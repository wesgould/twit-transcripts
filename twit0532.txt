[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I'm really excited.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   We've got Jason Callicannis back, because you can never get
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   enough Jason Callicannis.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   It's good to be home.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And I'm still working on the Brooklyn.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Oh!
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Hey!
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Oh!
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Despresso is delightful.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It was a short, short pull.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Short and tight.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Short and tight.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Short and tight.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Put a little amorato in there.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Also, he brought along old buddy of his.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I think you probably met when you're in Engagit, right?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Peter Rojas.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Yes!
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Peter Rojas and I, we created Engagit Together.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Co-founders, he did 99% of the works.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   What are you doing these days?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I am doing seat stage investing for beta works.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Oh, nice.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   On their West Coast ambassador.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Ah!
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Yeah, Jason was telling me that journalists actually make great
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   angels because they get access to all the deals.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And you know how to question people.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   You should stop being a journalist when you do that.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah, you have to be honest.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   It's kind of, you can't be a journalist and cover the companies
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   that you're investing in, but what's great about it is if you have
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   an inquisitive mind, you know what questions to ask, right?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And as a journalist, we all had to sort through the BS and the PR nonsense.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So you started as a journalist.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Peter was a part of Engagit.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Yeah, I know how to tear things apart, which I think, it's surprising
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   actually how many founders you meet with are raising money.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And they have gotten, I think, conditioned to think like, oh, you just
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   like, do some meetings and you go check.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I know, I used to people actually like trying to understand what they're
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   doing or pushing back on it.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   It's actually makes sense.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Somebody's reviewed a lot of product would be a much better
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   person at figuring out what the next big thing is.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Yeah, and I think that's, I mean, my entire career has been about
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   trying to figure out what's the next exciting new product or company
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   on the horizon.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So it, intellectually, like a good fit for me.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Fun.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   So I'm enjoying it.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And then we got a couple of angstyened wretches here.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Well, you're angstyened.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I'm kind of just stained by my...
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Well, you know, we don't even do paper anyway.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Just saying.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Just saying.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   My fingers are burnt from the keypad.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   So how hammer away.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   That's Ian Thompson from the Register.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Great to see you.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Oh, it was fun.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Love having you in here.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And we don't have anything to talk about.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So that's okay because really, if there were news, it wouldn't be
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   nearly as much fun with you guys.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   We just...
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I'm a little horse because we were just diffusing bombs for the last
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   45 minutes.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   This VR headset, I mean, I have to say VR is going to be a legitimate
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   platform.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And it's been 20 years of VR.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   VRML.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And just all kinds of different headsets.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Yeah, I remember being a SIGGRAPH in 1992 and they had an
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   attached big asset.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And we were flying on a pterodactyl or something.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Yes.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And you had that little gun that you pointed around.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And it was disorienting and weird and mainly you thought no one's
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   going to wear a giant five pound headset and do this.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And now because of these, all the sensors, it's made it possible.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   No, actually I picked up the gear VR at a day when I was meeting
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   with a bunch of VR companies and all of them were doing their demos
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   on a gear VR.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And I was like, I gotta get one of these.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And the gear VR doesn't have any electronics in it at all.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It's just the headset with the lenses, but all the screen and
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   electronics and everything, it's all off the phone.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Yeah, so Samsung makes it 199 bucks.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   They currently have two, one for the Note 4 or maybe the Note 4
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   and one for the S6.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   They announced it Oculus Conference.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   They're going to make a $99 one that will fit all their current
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   models.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Yeah, and it has the Oculus software.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Oculus was based on a Galaxy.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Yeah, the original Oculus.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Well, what happened was what I heard from the inside was Oculus
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   needed screens from the Samsung folks.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Right.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And they were like, hey, if you want our screens, you need to
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   give us your technology to get this consumer thing out and make our
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   phones.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And so the Oculus people didn't exactly want to do it.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   So they did that.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   But Samsung has their own technology, so they're not going to
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   need the Oculus for much longer.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Yeah, I think VR is a thing for the moment.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I think AR is going to be much bigger from it when they actually
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   get the going there.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Trying the HoloLens, I was very excited.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   That was, you know, with the right application, that could be
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   really, really good.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   My problem with VR is that you're just too isolated.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   You can't move around.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   You can't, you know, concentrate on anything other than what's on
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   the screen, but it's very useful in certain circumstances.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   They're gaming.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Yeah, it's gaming for a good one.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   So we were playing a game called Keep Talking and Nobody
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Explodes.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   You're diffusing a bomb.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   One person's wearing, it's actually clever because nobody has
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   four VR headsets.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Not yet.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And although we've seen demos where two people are in a VR
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   space, that's a non-trivial thing to do.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   So this, you're in the VR, you're looking at this bomb and the
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   rest of you guys have a printed manual and you're trying to
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   solve this puzzle without seeing the bomb.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Right.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   It was fun.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   If you were actually diffusing a bomb and you were like,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   "Magiver" in a room and you had a radio and Wucky talking and
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   we're talking to somebody at base, or you had to land, you
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   know, it's like if it's a land of plane and the control tower is
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   telling you like, "Oh yeah, pull the yoke.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   You're like, what's the yoke?"
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And you're like, "What?"
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   It's worse than that.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And as you can see, these bombs get very, very comfortable.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   It's hilarious.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   It was fun.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   We turned into 12-year-old boys.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   We did not want to stop to do Twitch.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   It was really fun.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   We really don't want to.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I mean, it's a high-stress like tension situation while you're
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   doing it.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   But what you see is so much fun.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And I was terrible at it.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Is that VR isn't necessarily what you imagine necessarily, what
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   you imagine VR to be, which is an immersive environment that you're
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   running through and shooting people.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   This is a very interesting use of VR.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And augmented reality would be similar because you're still
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   seeing the world around you, but stuff is superimposed upon it.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I could imagine some very interesting, not just games,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   but obviously AR is more about UI, right?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   I mean, AR is going to be certain things.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I'm amazed Disney hasn't got the bigger into AR.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Have you seen the Viewmaster yet?
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   This thing is amazing.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   29 bucks.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It's cardboard.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   So you get a disc.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   We can just print them out.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   You get a disc and you put the disc on the table and then you put your
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   phone in the Viewmaster because it's cardboard.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   It's Google's cardboard.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And then you're looking through it and it is AR because on the
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   disc, 3D animals appear and they're moving and they're acting.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   It is for kids, but it's very much of a game.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Well, we got one.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   There it is.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   And it's very much of a game.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   I guess I could put my-- I don't want to distract you.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I guess I could put my S6 in here and you guys could play with it.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   But it's kind of spectacular.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Oh, there's the disc.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   There you go.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   The disc doesn't actually do anything.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   The disc is not coded or anything, but I guess the Viewmaster
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   probably sees it.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   I'm just talking back to my kid to when I was a kid and you had this.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   It's the things that you press the thing and it cycles through.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   You still do it.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   It's so good that it's got the thing and everything.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   What is wrong with you guys?
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Ooh, it's an edge.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   They're bringing me all the stuff so I can do this.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   No, no, we'll do this at another time.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   So I watched the Democratic debate.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   I did too!
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And that was--
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   That was sickening.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   To Ian's point earlier, my complaint was I couldn't follow or tweet.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Follow Twitter or tweet while I had the headset on because you can't
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   multitask.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   You have to pick one--
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Wasn't it kind of weird though?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   At first I thought, what are we going to be in the back of the auditorium?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   And I'm looking down.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Obviously the VR camera is just a ball, right?
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Because nobody knows that they're on camera.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I'm looking down.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   There's a guy looking at his phone.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   I'm this close to him.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I'm going to read what he's doing.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Then I look to the left.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And there's a camera man.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   He's chewing his gum.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   He's waiting for the thing.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   They don't realize you got a few hundred people, me and Peter Roas anyway.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   We may have been the only two people in the lecture.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And then the debate begins and you're like backstage.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   You see the steady--
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   It's a lot about how it's being produced because you see the steady
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   game guy.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   I saw a show of crow tucking on her shirt.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   I was getting ready to sing the Star Spangled Banner.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   But what I do like about it, in theory, is you could watch a debate and look at the
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   candidates as you choose as opposed to this.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   That was actually what I liked about it.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   You didn't have to focus on the candidate who was talking or who was on camera.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   You could actually look at the body language and see what other people were doing.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   But did you-- were you able to wear it the whole time?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   No, I only watched it for maybe 10 or 15 minutes at a time.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Me too.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   You tire pretty quickly.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   You get tired.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Is it the way to the headset or the--
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   No.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.240]   It's not the way, but the resolution is still low enough that it just starts to create eye
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.240]   strain.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.240]   And I don't really get a seasick from it.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.240]   But yeah, you get a little bit of a headache.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.920]   And that's what they-- I mean, the reason this is all actually working now is because
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.240]   the resolution has gotten better and the processors and the GPUs have gotten better.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.240]   The Oculus is going to take two GPUs.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.000]   That's what I heard, like twin video cards to really--
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   You're going to do a $1,500 gift.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.360]   I heard like $1,500 is like minimum game rig.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.360]   You might be more like a $3,000 game rig.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.000]   Well, they said $1,500 for the Oculus--
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.880]   So it's for the Oculus plus the minimum gaming rig that you would be needing it.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.520]   So the Oculus is $1,000?
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.520]   No, no, no, no.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.520]   Under $500.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.520]   Oh, $500.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.320]   $350 to $500, I would guess.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.440]   So it's a $1,000 gaming PC, a $500 Oculus.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.280]   By the way, this isn't till maybe next quarter.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.280]   And I don't think--
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.720]   It's going to be-- it'll be-- they expect the ship, I think, Q1.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.080]   Yeah, they say they will.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:59.320]   What I heard from talking to people in the industry is when you can get to 8K displays,
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.960]   that's when it starts to--
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   You dual 4K is really--
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.960]   Dual 4K.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.120]   Actually, dual 8K would be the ideal because you'd need the two images.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.120]   Dual 8K.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.120]   And the thing is--
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.120]   That's a lot of grunt.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.640]   It's a lot, but we'll get there eventually.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.640]   But it's--
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.640]   We're not next yet.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.640]   Oh, new new.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.120]   Well, and Ian, you said when you put on the Gear VR, you could see the screen door effect.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.960]   You really see those pixels.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.960]   This is a fit right?
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.440]   And then when it first came out, they'd got this sort of thing where you're going over
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.440]   an African safari.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.120]   And it's like, ooh, pixelated elephant.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.640]   Yeah, I'm going to pay to see that.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.280]   Was the Holland lens a better resolution?
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.800]   It was a slight-- it was a better resolution, but a much smaller screen area because with
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.480]   the Holland lens, you're looking at like a little patch in front of you like that,
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.240]   which is great.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.240]   But the key thing was that you could actually knock certain things out.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:53.920]   You could leave a computer monitor on, for example, and have a Martian landscape in front
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.680]   of you with a Samsung computer monitor sitting down looking completely out of place.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.680]   That's a weird idea.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.240]   That's a weird idea if you want to check things.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.040]   If they can-- if you could get an AR-- a set of AR glasses which could switch to VR,
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.040]   that's going to be the killer.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.400]   So you can basically flip a switch and see the real world or--
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.400]   Oh, by the way.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.200]   You can do that with a Gear VR because it has lenses.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.560]   Yeah, it has a pass through.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.560]   Oh, actually you can use the camera in the phone.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.560]   So you can't do it all the way around.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.560]   It's a little disorienting.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.560]   Yeah, it's weird.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.560]   But taking it off is just like--
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.720]   You've said it pointed another problem that I'd never even thought of.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.440]   This transition from the VR world to the normal world.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.560]   You really do feel like a shock when you take it off.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.560]   That's how convincing it is.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.360]   Your brain is literally fooled.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.280]   And in the test, if you like try to walk off a cliff, like--
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.560]   It's very hard for people or when like a car goes off to a ravine--
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.560]   You feel physiologically like you're falling.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.560]   Well, I think the one that really freaks people out is the guillotine guillotine.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.560]   Oh, what?
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.560]   You are like you bend over.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.560]   No.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.560]   No.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.560]   What are you doing?
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.560]   It's simulator?
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.560]   Just-- I'm getting to send me a letter.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.560]   It's like a--
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.560]   It's like a--
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.560]   A good roller coaster, Ticcoo.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.560]   There's good news in bad news.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.560]   You're going to be Louis the 16.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.560]   The bad news is you're getting your head shot, though.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.560]   You might not like the ending.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.560]   You get to be kidding.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.560]   It's not true at all.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.560]   Just give it a try.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.560]   Game of Thrones is going to be very interesting.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.560]   They said that.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.560]   Well, of course we still mean.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.560]   Well, of course we still mean.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.560]   But yeah.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.720]   Microsoft said at its announcement a couple of weeks ago that it's going to be a first quarter
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.560]   of next year and it will be developed for you.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.560]   For the development.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.560]   And it will be $3,000 and it will not look like the video we're showing on the screen.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:32.560]   Because I think this was unfair and we've mentioned this before, Microsoft, to show this video at the demo.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.560]   When in fact you're not seeing that, are you in this?
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.560]   Not even close, right?
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.560]   No.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.560]   I mean, well, they displayed it on stage.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.560]   I was in the audience watching this trying to find a Wi-Fi signal that worked.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.560]   But I mean, it's one of those things where they've shown how it could look.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.560]   Yeah, it's going to get really.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:56.560]   I mean, I've got to say with that, actually that's not that far ahead because what you're looking at is a very basic game, very basic graphics.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.560]   And once you've done the work of mapping out the room that you're in, then it actually, it's fairly easy to set up.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.560]   But you're going to be seeing an awful lot of clunky stuff in the meantime.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.560]   Hey, you know what?
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.560]   The first PCs were pretty clunky.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.560]   First mobile phones were.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.560]   First HD TVs were $10,000 for a 50-inch display.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.560]   I mean, this is all early days yet.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.560]   And money comes down.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.560]   I mean, I would love to.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.560]   I mean, there's a couple of things they have kept quite about the whole lens.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.560]   Battery life is going to be the absolute key thing.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.560]   Well, it's a PC.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.560]   The whole thing's on your head, right?
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.560]   There's no wires.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.560]   Well, but there's a PC and this visor.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.560]   But every time you pick up the visor, you know, there's no real cooling slots.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.560]   It doesn't get hot.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.560]   I'm wondering how on earth they've managed to get anything more than 15 minutes battery life out of this.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.560]   Apparently it does do a lot better than that.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.560]   But it's going to be some work.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.560]   And that kind of thing only works if you're untethered because the whole point of AR is you can move around the room.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.560]   You can do various things and pick up various things.
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.560]   So early days yet.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.560]   But I think it's going to be a winner.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.560]   Here's the good news.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.560]   It's going to happen about the same time my car could drive itself.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.560]   So I will be able to sit in the car, play some games, and I won't have to worry because the car will be driving itself.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.560]   Ah, but you've got the legators at legators if problem.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.560]   Automatic cars are only going to work if you don't have to be sitting there ready to take control.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.560]   Did you watch the video of the Jalopnik reviewer?
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.560]   You're a Tesla owner.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.560]   Can you get the autonomous vehicle thing?
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.560]   Well, I have a very, very, in fact the first Tesla of the Model S.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.560]   And I didn't have the sensors in mind.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.560]   The sensors came I think in 2014.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.560]   So what sensors is it?
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.560]   Lidar?
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.560]   What are the sensors?
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.560]   I'm not sure exactly which one is it.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.560]   I think it is Lidar.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.560]   No, you're not in his anti-Lidar.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.560]   Oh, he's anti-Lidar.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.560]   So this is one of the challenges with the Google autonomous vehicles which use Lidar.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.560]   Lidar is way too expensive.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.160]   But not only that, it turns out that the Google autonomous vehicles have to have the road mapped
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.120]   before they get there.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.560]   So that's not good.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.360]   You want a car that can go anywhere, right?
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.560]   This is the guy with the autonomous.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.560]   Let's listen in because he's clearly terrified.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.560]   That was...
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.560]   He's also driving in Manhattan.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.560]   Ooh, that was interesting.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.560]   He's driving in Manhattan.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.560]   Traffic.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.120]   He's got a really bad taxi.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   Really well.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.120]   That's the West Side Highway.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.120]   Incredible.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.120]   And it's stop and go.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.280]   And you have New York City, Texas.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:10.280]   Now, I've got crew that I can use it stop and go traffic and stop the car if it's...
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.280]   It keeps its distance.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.280]   But this changes lanes, which I think is unbelievable.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.280]   And it knows what's next to it.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.280]   Of course, mode, which is incredibly fun, but the fact that it can do all this.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.280]   With like change lanes, then you have to manually check your blinds balls.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.280]   Apparently not.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.280]   Well, it's doing it, but I think that you're not supposed to take your hands off.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.280]   So technically speaking, it's to assist you, but you're not supposed to take your hands off the wheel.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.280]   See, there it goes.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.880]   You see, it's got to be fully autonomous for it to work.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.600]   You want something where you can stagger out of a bar at 11 o'clock, fall into the backseat
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.280]   and just mumble, take me home.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.280]   This is the...
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.280]   As to answer your question about legislative hurdles.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.280]   That's how...
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.280]   The initial step is, and this is what they described it as, it's like an autopilot.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.280]   So a pilot doesn't get to leave.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.280]   No.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.280]   You must stay in the driver's seat.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.280]   You've got to keep looking at the windshield.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.280]   It's assist.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.280]   Yet, this guy's driving, and it's driving for him.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.880]   In fact, he had a hard time.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.880]   He actually put his foot on the brake unnecessarily.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.880]   Right.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.880]   Because he couldn't stand the idea that the car was going to stop.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.880]   He wasn't afraid it wouldn't stop.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:16.880]   And supposedly in the test, they've gotten from Los Angeles to Seattle.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.880]   So they're figuring out the five and the one on one, and they're just going up the...
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.880]   Highways are the elasties.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.880]   Highways are super easy, which is where you want it anyway.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:23.880]   Like, when you're...
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.880]   No, no, I want it in stop and go traffic.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.480]   That's the worst thing in the world.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.680]   But I don't mind driving the highway.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.680]   How often are you off the highway?
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.880]   I think on the highway you have these long stretches.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.880]   You have 35 minutes.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.880]   Yeah, my YouTube...
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.880]   When you're in town, you might be like a 15-minute run.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.880]   It's not as necessary as the hour and a half.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.880]   You obviously...
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.880]   I'm talking about commuting.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.880]   Yeah, I'm talking about commuting too.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.880]   I used to commute to San Francisco.
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.880]   I'd have two hours of stopping to go traffic between San Francisco and here.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.880]   That is not the way.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.880]   How much was highway though?
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.880]   It's all on the highway, but it's still stopping to go traffic.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.880]   It's like that West Side.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.880]   Right.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.880]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.880]   So stop and go on the highway.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.880]   Oh, okay.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.880]   It's when you're in town.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.880]   I don't know if you need it as much.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.880]   Well, it's good.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.880]   But this is going to go faster than a lot of people think.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:08.880]   A lot of the cities are right now in competition to get these autonomous systems on the road.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.880]   Yeah, Nevada is making a big play for it.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.960]   Nevada, New York, California, a lot of cities are really engaging this because they see
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.040]   it as a huge economic opportunity.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:24.560]   As the commutes go up, depression goes up, all these things are about commutes are terrible
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.720]   for people.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.880]   It really is an impediment to the economy.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.400]   So traffic can go down to, you reduce 10, 20% of traffic.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.160]   You don't have to build a bigger highway.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.160]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.880]   Like how many, I mean up here in Petaluma, they've been working on this goddamn road
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.880]   for how long?
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.880]   We've got a two lane stretch that just kills everybody.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.880]   And they've been working on a wine.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.640]   It's going to take probably a decade to do the wine name.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.880]   And they did a decade in Los Angeles on the 405 in the Sepulveda Pass.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.880]   And then it takes a decade.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.880]   And then as soon as you wine it, of course, the traffic goes up and you're pretty soon.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.880]   You're just as bad as you do.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.880]   You're just as bad as you do.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.880]   You're just as bad as you do.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.880]   You're just as bad as you do.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.880]   You're just as bad as you do.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.880]   Well, one thing, go ahead.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.880]   I was going to say, this could be really interesting.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:06.680]   In a lot of places like cities, we have this issue of people who are firefighters, let's
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.880]   say teachers, can't live in the cities anymore because rent has gone up and more people want
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.880]   to live in the city.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.840]   So if we can really make commuting easier and faster through either ride sharing or the
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.000]   cars in the existing highway system, that is going to be really profound and keep the
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   economy moving.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Certainly, but what it needs is for you to be able to do other things while you're driving.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   That's going to be absolutely okay.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.640]   Otherwise we're just wasting time.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.400]   Which is YouTube's entire, I mean YouTube, um, movies and tires and tires.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.960]   The entire push on this is they look at the windshield as the next screen.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:38.960]   Right.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.000]   And that is why YouTube and then it sounds really futuristic.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.680]   But if they make the autonomous car work, YouTube's minutes watch per month and the advertising
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.760]   is going to go up fivefold.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.280]   I mean, it's going to be ridiculous.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.480]   So are you going to Mercedes is coming to town with that concept autonomous view?
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.760]   They invited you to go for a ride in that thing looks like a living room.
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.640]   They even sent the window so they don't, and Google took the steering wheels out.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.040]   This is, they're really emphasizing that.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.040]   They have a button.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.040]   A board.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.040]   I don't even think they have that.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.040]   And that's, and you know what?
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.440]   That's the problem with this jaloptic guy.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.440]   He could do it.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.800]   And it was making him, I think he was just anxious the whole time.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.520]   So well, there's not that I wouldn't be without a steering wheel.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.600]   There was actually a great article on, I can't remember if it was in the Atlantic or the
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.600]   New York or something like that.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.440]   But when they introduced the first elevators that didn't have conductors, people were incredibly
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.520]   uncomfortable and people didn't want to get in them.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.760]   They didn't trust an elevator without somebody actually manually controlling it.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.760]   It's insane.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.200]   And they had to actually change the design of elevators and get people used to the idea
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.960]   of that you would press a button and it would just go to where you don't go.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.960]   Exactly the same thing.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.960]   The 20s.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.960]   In the 20s.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.880]   When they introduced computer control trains, people refused to get on them because they
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.440]   couldn't see a driver in the front.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.520]   Well, I don't like riding the model reel in Vegas because there's nobody driving that
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.520]   thing.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.520]   I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.400]   It could go right off, could take a left when it should take a right.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   That's terrible.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.840]   But yet you trust the model reel with the guy who's getting paid like 18 bucks a day
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:01.840]   to pretend he's paying attention.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.120]   You know, in the 20s when you bought a phone and actually came with a dialer, a human,
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.760]   that would dial the phone for you because it, no, I'm joking.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.840]   I was going to say.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.360]   The building I lived in New York on the West Side Highway, you remember the building I
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:19.720]   lived in, I think it had manual operators up until like 2003, 2004.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.720]   That's a luxury.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:24.800]   No, it was a warehouse kind of building, but they just hadn't upgraded them.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.720]   And you know, we would cheaper to get some guy.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.280]   Then to upgrade them.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.280]   Exactly.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.280]   The world's most boring job though.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.280]   It's just like, what kind of detail is the button?
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.400]   It could only go up and down.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.560]   One of the biggest parts of the economy for a period of time was, you know, operators.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.440]   This was a huge industry.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.760]   The one of the biggest drivers of women's employment.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.760]   Exactly.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.200]   At one point they said, if the phone network continues to expand at the rate it is, we
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.840]   will actually, AT&T will be employing every woman in the United States to do the switching.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.600]   That's when they came up with electronic switching because they couldn't, humans couldn't do
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.600]   it.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.600]   Right.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.600]   And employment seemed to go on.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.600]   So you, yeah, somehow we survived.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:07.040]   So you may be able to drive an autonomous vehicle in Las Vegas, but you can't bet on
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.760]   draft Kings in Las Vegas.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.280]   Oh, the party's over now.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.280]   Is the party over?
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.440]   Boy, they're taking huge.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.040]   So there, it started, there's two of them, right?
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.760]   There's fan dual and draft Kings.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.520]   And fan dual started, raised some money.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:24.560]   Draft Kings came out of nowhere, raised hundreds of millions of dollars, including some hundreds
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.160]   of millions from Fox and NBC Universal.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.360]   Yeah, they gave them free equity, basically.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.000]   Basically Fox said, okay, we'll give you what 300 million, but you have to buy 260 million
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   in advertising.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   You know, we call that round tripping.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Yep.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.400]   And it's big in the first dot com wave.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.960]   Remember AOL got in a huge investigation because people were doing these huge portal deals.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.760]   Like you give me 200 million.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.880]   I invest 175 million in your company.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.240]   And we both put it on our books and then the public buys the stock.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.240]   Oh, that's terrible.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.240]   And it's like, oh, what just happened?
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.240]   It's a shell game.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.240]   Oh, that's terrible.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.560]   So this has big ramifications.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.560]   But here's the thing.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.840]   The good news is these guys are going to get punched for this investment because draft
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.600]   Kings is going to be maybe illegal.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.800]   Well, it's yeah, Nevada's they don't play around there, obviously, because they have
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.800]   protection.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   They're not actually in their business.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   They're not.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   The game.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.800]   The question is, there's two issues.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.800]   One is, is it a game of skill or not?
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.800]   Right.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.800]   So how much is right?
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.800]   And there is skill involved for sure.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   I'm skill involved.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.800]   Absolutely.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.640]   And then there is the climate of gambling in the United States.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.800]   And we live in a great time of change where, you know, look at cannabis legislation.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.240]   We have 30 states now where you have medical is better.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.240]   It's matter of time.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.240]   Matter of time.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.240]   Gambling will be the next one to fall.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.760]   And for sure, because if you look at the major sports leagues, it's going on.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:43.200]   Anyway, and it's an exact parallel to the drug trade, which is when it's underground,
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.040]   it's easy for people to get ripped off.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   It's easy for people to get murdered.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.840]   It's easy for them to be crime.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.960]   And if you look at numbers game with public with a lottery.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.960]   Yes.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.520]   And in the UK, it is completely legal.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.760]   You can gamble on anything.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.320]   And society has not crumbled.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.920]   No, it's always amusing when Americans come over.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.640]   Wait, I saw locks talking smoking burritos, poking barrels.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.640]   And that did not look like a safe environment.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.640]   Oh, come on.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.640]   That's just.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.840]   It was amusing when Americans come to a British pub and they say a fruit machine in the corner.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.360]   And they're just like a slide.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.360]   What's that doing?
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.880]   Yeah, like a sort of, you know, the song.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.000]   And they're just drawn to it.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.800]   Just like, this is so illegal.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   Wow.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.800]   You know, seriously?
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.800]   So, see, I would see, I think, you know, I think FBI is investigating.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.640]   I think you're going to see congressional investigations, partly because of the equivalent
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.640]   of insider training.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.600]   That's the part that I find the most concerning and most interesting is that, you know, it's
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:42.480]   basically these two big operations and people that work at one have so much information
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.040]   about what people are actually betting on and what they're doing.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.320]   And then they're leveraging their arbitrage and information to take advantage and down
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.320]   the other platform.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.000]   It's always about getting an edge.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.040]   And so it has been for all time.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.400]   When you play poker, I'm trying to get a read on you.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.200]   I'm trying to just have any edge I can.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.000]   And if in poker, the biggest edge that I know of and, you know, I play in a lot of these
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.320]   big games, it's how tired are you?
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.360]   Did you just get in a fight with your spouse?
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.360]   Are you exhausted?
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.360]   How are you doing?
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.360]   Are you rich?
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.360]   Are you poor?
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.360]   How expensive is that watch?
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.480]   Like, I'm looking at those issues to see if I can get an edge on you, right?
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.960]   So now you have people who are working inside of a company and these are people who are
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.440]   drawn to the gambling business.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.280]   And then they see an edge that they can get over another person, a huge edge, any information
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.280]   edge.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.040]   And that's why being legal is so important.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.520]   The whole reason Jimmy the Greek and all this, you know, all these people became to
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.520]   prominent sisters.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.720]   Well, they were basically setting the line.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.760]   The whole idea behind setting the line is to just even out the money in gambling so that
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.960]   one side doesn't take too much.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.960]   But this is perimutual.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.400]   So this is a little bit different, right?
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.960]   These guys were getting an information edge that nobody else had.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.760]   Explain this to me because at first I thought it's kind of like the sting, you know, where
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.760]   they delayed the telegram.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.760]   The telegram.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.760]   It's not exactly like that.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.040]   It's that if you work at say, FanDuel, you can see in aggregate what bets people are
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:00.120]   making and then you use that information to bet a draft Kings.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.200]   So does it give you an edge in picking the team?
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.200]   I guess it does.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.400]   Well, I'm not sure everyone else is picking.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.400]   So if you pick, if you go for lesser picks, you've got a better better show.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.920]   That's the, what the ads imply is if you could find that secret guy that's going to perform
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.720]   really well this week today that you can win.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.840]   If you have all the, if you know where the money is moving, you can know where the edge
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.840]   is.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.760]   And there's so much money that draft Kings says they're going to spend a payout $2 billion
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.760]   this year.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.760]   That was one of the shocking things.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.760]   $1 billion money is going into this.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:31.760]   Plus FanDuel.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.760]   Well, I mean, think about it.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.760]   You have over 300 million Americans.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.760]   That's more than their capitalization.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.440]   But if you just think about if you, the people I know who bet on sports, bet every weekend
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.160]   during the football season, every weekend.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.040]   So you're talking about a dozen weekends.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.480]   People are betting and they're betting probably on average 50 or $100 or $200, which isn't
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.480]   a lot of money.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.920]   It's, you know, based on minimum wage, it's a couple of hours a week.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.040]   It's people blow off steam in aggregate.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.440]   This becomes a lot of money.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.440]   If tens of millions of people are doing it and they're spending $1,000 a year, you quickly
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.280]   get to billions, which is why it needs to be regulated and it needs to be sanctioned
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.280]   and they need to audit it.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.280]   So now it's missing.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.800]   It's not a morality issue.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.800]   It shouldn't be just like marijuana and cannabis shouldn't have been a morality issue.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:18.920]   It should be objectively looking at science, alcohol and cannabis and MDMA, LSD.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:23.320]   If you put all these drugs together, heroin, methamphetamine, alcohol would be way far ahead
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.320]   of cannabis.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.320]   In terms of cannabis.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.320]   Yes.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.320]   Alcohol and tobacco.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.320]   Alcohol and tobacco.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:32.160]   Can you say that about gambling?
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:37.040]   Fantasy football that it is not addictive like other forms of gambling, which are illegal.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.680]   Is all gambling going to be legal?
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.000]   I think that's just his argument is that all gambling should be legal.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.560]   It's got to be legal because it's illegal then at least you know that there aren't illegal
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.160]   activities going on in the background.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.160]   Same thing as violence.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.040]   Why is heroin should be legal because the real risk of heroin is it's being cut or you're
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.640]   having to buy it in the street and if you're illegal, you'd be much safer.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.040]   Yeah, you also got to rub large numbers of people to speed that.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.040]   It would be highly addictive.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.040]   Sure.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:03.840]   Yeah, but I'm just trying to be debilitating just as gambling might still be for some people
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.800]   highly addictive, but you don't plan it because of that.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.960]   And then once in a while you'll have 30 people die in the same month, I'm a bad shipment
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.920]   of heroin who are being dealt by people who are not the most upstanding citizens who are
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.920]   trying to get an education.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:21.240]   So I was thinking, oh good, it's going to be comeuppance for Fox because even though
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.640]   they played this kind of this game, this round tripping game on us, they're going to
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.480]   lose their shirts because these guys are going to be put out of business.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.480]   You don't think so.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.880]   In fact, if you could invest in fan duel or draft, they could very conceivably go out
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   of business.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.600]   This could be a wash because look what happened to the poker industry.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   What the feds tend to do is they'll let you go for a little while in this gray zone and
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.120]   they build the case.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.200]   So poker thought they were in the clear and all that was happening was the government
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.200]   was building their case.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.200]   They were investigating everybody.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.520]   People running poker sites are being arrested in getting off a plane in Guatemala.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.360]   It was a serious situation.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.240]   And then the real thing with full tilt and a lot of these are the poker sites were they
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:04.160]   had mixed the accounts of the operations of the company with people's players bank accounts
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.160]   on the system.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.440]   In other words, like here's how we're operating and our profits should be in this bank account
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.480]   and the players holding should be in this bank account.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.320]   It was one bank account.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.040]   And then they were playing all these they were paying all these poker pros, you know,
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.240]   half million dollars a month, a hundred thousand dollars a month, a million dollars a month.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.800]   This sounds very much like what we're seeing with these fantasy.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:26.680]   Who knows if it's that deep, but you know, this is why you have to have light and regulation
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.680]   on it.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.680]   And then everybody would be protected.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.600]   I mean, you keep on expecting somebody with a middle name, the like Jimmy the squirrel
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:36.960]   or Johnny the axe to come in and just like bring some mafia sort of style to it.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.920]   But it's great to be right.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:44.760]   Adam Silver, when he took over the NBA said he wanted to make sports betting, have us
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.600]   look again at sports betting in the United States.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:51.320]   This is the head of the NBA, which has had multiple scandals with the referee.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.000]   But will Pete Rose ever get into the hall of fame?
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Probably not.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.480]   He's getting on his own games.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.480]   Yeah, that's probably.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.920]   I mean, that's probably like, they said Michael Jordan, the rumor is Michael Jordan better
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.360]   in his own games too.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.040]   But he always better not himself to win.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.720]   Pete always said he better not himself to win.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.360]   He said I'm not going to bet against myself.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.160]   Yeah, we've got the same problem in the UK with football because I'm proper football
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.160]   like American football.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.920]   You're talking about when you kick around the little ball?
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.440]   Yeah, I want to use a foot to kick a ball rather than pick it up and run against throwing
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.440]   a win.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.440]   No, he's got any win handy.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.720]   Yeah, throw your fizzy thing.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.760]   But yeah, I mean, senior players throwing games deliberately, you know, because you could
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.640]   make an awful lot of money that way.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.000]   So there are downsides to having this all be legal.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.440]   It doesn't bring the sunlight out and make it all OK.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.000]   Anybody can find a way to game any system.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.560]   But if you do make it legal, then the vast bulk of it can find sticks to standard business
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.560]   practices.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.560]   You want to make money?
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.560]   You get on YouTube.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.880]   We'll talk about the top paid YouTube stars for 2015 in just a moment.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.640]   But first, a word about your next mattress.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.640]   Oh, Casper.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.920]   This is a company I missed investing in.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:54.920]   I go vault.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.720]   Well, isn't this this is an explosion, actually, this this and I love the internet because
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.840]   what it's clear is happening and you guys can confirm or deny.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:08.680]   But is that smart entrepreneurs are looking for businesses ripe for disruption.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.720]   They're looking for something that's not quite working.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:15.240]   And I can tell you one thing that's not working going into a mattress store.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.720]   Well, because I know because it's not working for me.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.840]   Why not a mattress for five minutes?
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:25.360]   Well, the saleswoman's given you the kind of the squirrely look and you say, yeah, I'll
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.960]   take that one and I did that and I got a mattress that was way too hard.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.440]   It was horrible.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.200]   Fortunately, Casper came along and I'm getting not only a great deal because you're getting
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.360]   it direct from the factory, but the most comfortable mattress I've ever had.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.360]   The mixed mess.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.360]   Now, some people say, I don't want a memory foam mattress.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.440]   This is memory foam and they put latex on the top.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:49.320]   So you get the firmness and support of the memory foam, but the comfort of the latex.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.080]   And most importantly, it breathes.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.600]   It's a cool mattress.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.600]   It comes in.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.600]   Look at this.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.440]   This is a queen size mattress in a tiny box.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.840]   I opened it in my jammies because I figured, why not?
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.840]   I'm going to be sleeping on it next.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.840]   You committed to the bed.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:04.840]   I'm committed.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.680]   That comes with a Tyvek wrapper.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.080]   You have a little, it comes with a little opener.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.080]   Watch this.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.720]   You open it up and it was very easy to get in the door because it's so compact, but then
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.400]   the mattress, and you got a full mattress.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.400]   That memory foam is amazing.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   I like this so much.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.400]   I got one for my kid.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.000]   He's in college, third floor, walk up.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.800]   And it worked great for him.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.800]   Oh my God.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.800]   Brace yourself.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   Boom.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.800]   Wow.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.800]   Was there just an earthquake?
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.360]   Oh no, that was Leo jumping on his casper.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.360]   I got you.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.160]   You got him a mattress, not a bottle of JD.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.760]   This is the hilarious shot.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.760]   Very affordable.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.760]   Very graceful.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:42.080]   $500 for a twin, $950 for a king size.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.760]   That's a great mattress price for a premium made in the USA.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.040]   I might add mattress.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.200]   You got to go to casper.com.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.720]   By the way, you may say, "Well, okay, but what about lying on the mattress in the show?
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.280]   How about if I gave you 100 nights to try the mattress?"
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.920]   A hundred nights, if at any time in those first hundred nights, you say, "It's not for
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:32:59.920]   me.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.920]   They come.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.920]   They get it.
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:02.920]   They refund every penny you've paid.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.920]   Shipping is free.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.920]   Returns are free.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:05.920]   I mean, there's no risk at all."
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.520]   I like how you place the mattress at the door so you just get home.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.520]   It's been a late night.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.520]   You're just...
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.520]   Wow.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.520]   That was quite a bender.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.520]   You stagger in and just...
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.840]   You're the first person to notice that it's in the entryway.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.160]   Of course, right in the vestibule.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.600]   It's because it was the light.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.680]   The light was good and our bedroom is dark, but in the light was good in the vestibule.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.680]   You know what the thing is?
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.440]   They've taken out the whole retail channel here and all that money that used to pay.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.520]   This is what's happening with the direct factory movement.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.520]   There's no middlemen.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.520]   There's no middlemen.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.360]   They used to be, you had to sell your product for half price or a third of the price to
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.080]   somebody who then marked it up 2X or 3X.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.640]   Now what these companies are doing is they just go boom direct.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.480]   You also have to play all these games with the mattress stores.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.480]   Its chain had to have its own specific...
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.480]   Oh my God.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.320]   So each mattress manufacturer would create pseudo models for price.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.360]   There's no way to lose the transparency on the cost.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.360]   And don't get me started on the springs.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.360]   Forget about it.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.360]   Forget about it.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.360]   No.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.360]   Casper.com/twit.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.360]   If you go there by the way, $50 off.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.360]   What's that code again?
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.360]   No, it's not code.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.360]   It's a promo code to it.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.360]   I'm going to write it to get a $10.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.360]   I'm going to write it to get a $10.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.360]   That's T-W-I-T-I-T.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.360]   That'll pay for your VR.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.360]   There you go, boom.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.360]   Not quite, but it gets you closer.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.360]   I love the member phone.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.600]   Then we'll play some poker later.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.600]   Awesome.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.600]   That'll be...
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.600]   Collapse on the bed.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:19.700]   So YouTube's highest paid stars, according to Forbes, this is not an easy thing because
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.880]   the stars don't say.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.680]   YouTube definitely doesn't say.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:27.240]   They'd like to give you all the impression everybody's getting incredibly wealthy.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.320]   Yeah, I'm sure they would.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.320]   On YouTube.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.320]   But Forbes...
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.320]   Yeah, it's completely BS.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.880]   So, in fact, you probably...
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.400]   You wrote a great article a couple of years ago on why I'm leaving YouTube.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.200]   I was part of the partner program and they gave you money in advance against your accounts.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:41.520]   That was a good deal.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.520]   You were a lucky guy.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.520]   It was pretty good.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.520]   Yeah, we got like...
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.640]   I can't say exact details, but it was seven figures ahead of time.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.800]   But we then had to recoup it and it's like three years later and we're actually recouping
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.400]   it now and it's going to work out actually.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.400]   It was a pretty good deal.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.480]   The problem is they take 45% of your revenue, which if you are running a business and you
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:00.280]   have a sales team, you know your sales team is going to cost anywhere from 15% to 30%
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.920]   of your overall cost.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:07.240]   So if you are getting 55 and then your sales team has to take another 20% to 30% of that
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.720]   55 that you get, now you're down to like 30%.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.720]   So a great place to build a brand, a horrible place to build a business, completely unreasonable
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.640]   to take 45%.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:20.200]   And now what they're trying to do is do a little damage control because last week Twitter
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.480]   came out and said we're going to give the rumors, Twitter is giving 70%.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.840]   I actually can confirm that because I know people on their side.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.840]   Interesting.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.840]   3070 is split.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:28.840]   Just like I do.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.840]   Just like Apple.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.840]   So, and that's what it should have been from the beginning and that's what I told them.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.120]   I said I'll stick around if you do 70/30.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.040]   It's worse on YouTube because there's no transparency.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.680]   You don't really know what they're getting.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.720]   And then YouTube, it's their interest.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:47.040]   Every time they make a change to the YouTube system, it's to keep the length of views.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.520]   So when you put Twitter, right?
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.240]   To accept artificially inflate the length of this.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.680]   Yeah, but for them.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.680]   So here's the thing.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:57.400]   When you put up, you know, Twitter videos where I put up this week in startups, all
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:01.560]   of a sudden on the side are our competitors and then you get all these subscribers but
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.040]   then you can't reach them.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.960]   And they keep obscurifying your ability to reach your audience.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.960]   Right.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.960]   And so it's a little bit of a trap.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.920]   Once you get on, you get all these subscribers and then they change the rules.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.520]   You never actually own your audience.
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.880]   It sounds like they might have leaked these numbers to force.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.880]   Oh, they happen.
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:23.800]   In effect to promote the idea that you, like PewDiePie, will be making, believe it or not,
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.400]   $12 million a year.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.840]   Completely believe he makes that much money.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.480]   But consider how pathetic that is if they're making $6 or $7 billion at the number one source
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.640]   making that.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:37.560]   And then compare it to something where you look at something like, let's say, Ironman,
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.560]   right?
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.920]   He's getting paid, Robert Downey Jr., you know, $50 million, $100 million.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:42.920]   But he's got talent.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.920]   PewDiePie just swears it as he plays an example.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.560]   But even still, the audience is developing.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.080]   Well, that's the other question I have from the point of view of YouTube.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.160]   This is a crappy audience, right?
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.160]   It's 12 year olds.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.160]   And it's everybody.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.920]   Yeah, but it's an audience that is very difficult to deliver.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.920]   Nobody wants 12 year olds.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.920]   Not yet.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:05.440]   Especially because most of those views are repeated views from the same few 12 year olds.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.440]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.440]   I watched my 12 year olds.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.440]   I watched the same video a hundred times.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.440]   It's a billion.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.920]   It's now a billion people a month.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.880]   So it's everybody on YouTube.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.680]   So you can't get everybody there.
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:20.480]   The problem is, of course, they're just taking so much of the revenue.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.480]   And they just were able to do that early because remember when YouTube started, you
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.600]   used to have to pay for bandwidth and you used to have to pay for hosting.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.840]   So it seemed like a great deal then.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.600]   They've tried to hold the line on this revenue split.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.040]   And it's ridiculous because if he's making 12 million only, can you imagine what he's
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.040]   done for that platform though?
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.840]   He has brought so much value to that platform to only make 12 million a year is a joke.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.960]   Yeah, but it's a joke.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:47.120]   But on, you know, conversely, there's no PewDiePie without YouTube.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.880]   There was no other platform where he was going to go.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:49.880]   Which is.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.040]   It's a great way to build a brand.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:56.080]   But what you'll see is you had Ellen who was making, she Ellen DeGeneres and her show
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:00.080]   had a sweetheart deal with YouTube from what I was told by insiders.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.000]   90% of the revenue.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.720]   And YouTube started unraveling those deals and put her back down to 55%.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.800]   Then she created Ellen Tube, her own YouTube.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.720]   And now Twitter is going to her saying, we'll give you 70%.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.040]   Where does she interact all day long on YouTube or on Twitter?
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.040]   She's on Twitter.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.040]   Where does Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga have won?
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.040]   Oh, but wait a minute.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.040]   They're on Twitter.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.160]   Frankly, Ellen is really there for promotional value, not for revenue.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.480]   And so she's going to go where the audience is and where the best audience is.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:33.280]   She wants, I mean if Fallon and Ellen are on YouTube because it generates audience for
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.120]   the TV show, that's where the revenue is.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.040]   But if you think about how much they're getting in terms of views there, when you get a million,
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.280]   10 million views for some of those and you can get a $1,300.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.920]   A million views is like $1,500.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.920]   If it's a 30 or 40 or $50 CPM for that level of talent.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.680]   Ah, because it's a higher CPM, okay.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.600]   They're getting bundled into the $2, $3 like YouTube garbage.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:57.440]   When they go over, you know, CPMs, when they go over to Twitter and they can put an ad on
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.760]   every single view, which you can't do on YouTube and they get premium advertisers and
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.280]   they can sell into their own inventory.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.280]   Who do you get?
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.280]   You get the Twitter crowd.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.280]   Is that what you want?
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:09.040]   Well listen, any of these are going to be legitimate views and they're going to get 30,
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.040]   40, 50, 50, 50.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.040]   Views of you as a view.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.040]   It doesn't matter.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.840]   I think for the advertisers, it's going to be a great view and it's going to be a 30
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.840]   million on TV.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.480]   Because you know what TV they don't freakin' know what you see.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.480]   Who's seeing it?
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.480]   Precisely.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.480]   But they buy a pig in a poke.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.000]   I think Twitter, or people are talking about, "Oh my God, Twitter, are they going to be
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.640]   able to come back or whatever, keep growing.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.720]   They're at 300 million or whatever monthlies."
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.760]   They could go right to a billion because if they start getting people like Justin Bieber
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.000]   and Alan to start putting their videos over there and interacting with their audience,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.240]   nobody can interact.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.280]   Would you ever talk to the YouTube commenters?
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.280]   No.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.280]   It's horrible to stay away from them.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:45.600]   But on Twitter, you get all really great considered people and they're going to let
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.600]   you control your Twitter.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.600]   You use.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.760]   I've been getting some right numbers on YouTube.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.480]   I think it's a lot of the YouTube people.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.040]   Oh yeah, but I mean, everything compared to YouTube is just a smosh.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.760]   Who makes 8.5 million?
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:57.760]   Who's Smosh?
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.160]   They're way no smosh.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.160]   They're way no smosh.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.160]   They're way no smosh.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.160]   Okay.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.160]   That's PewDiePie.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.160]   Next is Smosh.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.160]   Here comes Smosh.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.160]   Are they a duo?
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.160]   Then the Fine Brothers.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.160]   I've seen them.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.160]   But this is, you know, kind of mostly, it's under 20s.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.160]   A teeny-bauper.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.160]   Teeny-bauper.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.160]   Rhett.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.160]   She's the dancing violinist.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.160]   Lindsay Sterling.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   Oh yeah.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.160]   Rhett and Link.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:25.720]   You know, when they talk about these numbers though, and I noticed in the Fortune article,
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:32.160]   they're also including money that Coca-Cola and others pay Rhett and Link to make kind
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.480]   of crap pseudo-native content ads.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.160]   Oh, they're including the native content.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.680]   They're including the native content.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.360]   So I don't even think they're making this kind of money off of YouTube.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.360]   Well, the name of the game.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.360]   That is not Michelle Phan.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.360]   That's not Michelle Phan.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.360]   No.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.360]   This is very confusing.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.360]   She's a great...
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.960]   Michelle Phan, she's making $3 million here.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:49.960]   She's making, you know...
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:50.960]   Much more selling.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:51.960]   Tens of millions of dollars.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.480]   So almost everybody who's made it work on YouTube has stuff off YouTube.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.480]   That's my point.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.680]   If, really, it's a promotional thing.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:02.600]   Well, you know, what it comes into is you have to balance, is the value that you get
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:08.440]   at having your videos on YouTube as a platform more or less than the value that you're able
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:12.240]   to extract by showing your content somewhere else, right?
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:16.720]   And I think that if you are reliant on YouTube for the audience, especially when you're early,
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.720]   it makes a lot of sense.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.320]   You build, like, chasing, you build your, not just your brand, but you build your audience
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:24.520]   there, there comes a point when your audience is big enough and maybe loyal enough where
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.600]   you can try to move them off of YouTube or that's when you really must.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.600]   You want to get their email address.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.600]   And so...
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.600]   You can't.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.600]   Can you get it from YouTube?
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.600]   No.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.120]   So the whole name of the game is people are running contests and landing pages and they'll let
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.840]   you click off of...
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:43.000]   And I actually was the person who actually got YouTube to concede this.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.480]   I convinced Salar, who was the previous head before Susan, to let you link out to your
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.480]   own site.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:53.760]   So they let you link out to one domain name and then the conversation I had with Salar,
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.920]   I was like, "Listen, Salar, I want to link to my website."
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.000]   He's like, "You can't link off of YouTube.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.760]   Annotation is going to link to other videos."
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.360]   I said, "Well, why can't I link to myself?"
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.360]   He's like, "Well, we'll have spamming."
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.960]   I'm like, "Yeah, but I'm a partner."
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.960]   Right, yeah.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.520]   So you've already positioned me for trust.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.320]   You have my social security number, you have my tax ID, we're already splitting revenue.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.040]   Why don't you let the partners at least link to themselves?
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.320]   And they relented and said, "You can put in one URL."
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:25.280]   So I put in the URL of our website and then I created redirects to go to our Twitter,
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.080]   to go to our email landing pages and try to move it over.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:35.120]   And we moved over, I would say, 1% of our audience per month to email subscriptions.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.680]   And so what you do is the name of the game is to just get, if you're just eating and
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:42.640]   you have two or three million, which is probably 10 million subscribers, if you can just get
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.800]   eventually 10% of those, a million of those emails, then you will not be dependent on
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.000]   YouTube.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.720]   And then what's going to happen is the marketplace is now emerging between Yahoo, Facebook and
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.960]   Twitter to get this talent.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.800]   And I think YouTube's not going to go from a billion viewers down to 100 million, but
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.200]   they're going to have serious competition.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.520]   And this talent is going to leave and go other places and publish other places first and
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.800]   publish other places more.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.760]   And I think that's why they're going to Forbes in the first place, because they know they've
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:13.280]   got a constant churn of people that they're going to have to go through and just flashing
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.120]   that in front of a late teen or an early 20 year old.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.600]   And they think, "I can do that."
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.200]   And of course, 99% of the work is about that 1%.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.520]   That's what breaks my heart is.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.240]   I see these kids and they really think they're going to make it.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:29.040]   It's like going to Schwab's drug store, expecting it to be discovered.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.920]   It's an essential life lesson that you've got to learn.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.920]   It doesn't work.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:33.920]   It works.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:34.920]   It works.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.920]   It works.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:36.920]   It works.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:37.920]   It works.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.920]   It works.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:39.920]   It works.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:40.920]   It works.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:41.920]   And you know what?
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:42.920]   You're not going to make it to the NBA either.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.920]   This is why it's a lousy parent.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:44.920]   You know.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:45.920]   You get used to it.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.920]   No, you're a good parent, I think.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.920]   I want to talk about Twitter.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   What we're going to do with Twitter, Mac, Apple's got some new Macs.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920]   I don't know if we care.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.920]   We got lots more.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.920]   We got a couple of gadget guys here.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:54.920]   In fact, I wish I could ask you about these new phones, but you're going to be reviewing
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.760]   them and your review appeal in the register.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.160]   I was reviewing until three o'clock this morning.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.160]   Yes.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.040]   1 AM Pacific time.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.040]   1 AM Pacific time.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.040]   The embargo lifts.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.840]   And we will have something live on.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.240]   There's been the hands on sessions, obviously.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.240]   Can I say what the phones are?
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.240]   I haven't said yet.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.240]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.240]   The new Nexus phone.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.240]   Yeah, the Nexus 5 and the 6P.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.040]   I mean, that's public knowledge, but the actual reviews themselves, we've got to keep
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.040]   quite a bit.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:24.360]   But it's interesting upgrades and the timing of it was interesting because I mean, the
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.160]   Nexus 5 is two years old and it's really showing it.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.000]   The Nexus 6 is less than a year old.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.160]   And the Nexus 5 is full of compared to the Nexus 6.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.840]   Yeah, well, even Google doesn't like the Nexus 6.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.640]   The Nexus 6 was not a good phone.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.640]   It wasn't.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:38.640]   It was too big.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.640]   The camera was not great.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:40.640]   I didn't think the screen was that good.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.640]   The screen was not so good.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.800]   It was, yeah, it was very awkward and unwieldy.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.600]   And now the motor has been sold to Lenovo.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.440]   They said, right, ditch that.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.640]   Let's go over and see what I like.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.160]   Well, in fact, no one in the Nova was kind of ditching the Motorola spirit.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.800]   They announced that when Marshmallow comes out, they're going to drop Assist, which
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.800]   was kind of one of the key features of the Moto X.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.440]   It's always listening and knows what's going on.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.600]   It's kind of situationally aware.
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.680]   Peter, do you miss getting these phones?
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.520]   I do miss it a little bit.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:11.280]   Now it's a little harder to pull the trigger on things when you've got to pay out of pocket.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.600]   But I do like to keep up.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.720]   And I think I'll pick up one of these Nexus phones.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:21.320]   I actually like to pay out of pocket because it reminds me of the pain that real people
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.120]   are going through making these decisions.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.840]   That could be a $1,000 error if you buy the wrong phone.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.680]   These phones are very, very expensive.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.120]   I mean, this is why you've got to read all the reviews, try them out yourself, get...
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.440]   And yet, it's so personal that I don't know.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.680]   You still have to make that decision like for me, what is the best?
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:42.200]   Because a review is only going to tell you so much about how you're going to like it.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.400]   For instance, for me, battery life is all I...
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.960]   I'll...
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:50.360]   And all I care about is on the 6P, which I have ordered.
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.160]   And I hope will come in a few weeks is battery life.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.760]   If battery life's fine, then everything else will be fine.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:00.640]   If it can't get 20 hours, 18 to 20 hours, the way...
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.600]   And again, this is a problem because it's the way I use it, not the way you use it.
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:07.080]   I was going to say battery life is such a difficult one because of the different ways
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.080]   people use things.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.640]   And actually, from a testing perspective as well, trying to run these things down, you've
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.640]   got to use all these different...
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.640]   All these different...
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.160]   Application, you know, turn the flashlight on, run YouTube video the whole time.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.160]   You've got...
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.920]   It's so synthetic, that's not a real world experience.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:25.160]   So that's why I just buy them and I try to use them as long as I can and then say as
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:30.800]   subjectively, I know that it is, but try to say, you know, for me, it's not enough.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:34.200]   Well, yeah, like everybody has their own personal use circumstances.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:38.680]   And also, I think frankly, where you live and where you work has a big impact on battery
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:42.120]   life too, because it has to do with distance to a cell tower and...
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.640]   Hunting, if you're hunting a lot, they're going to kill the battery life.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.040]   There's all sorts of issues.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.280]   So I'm going to use a couple of five phones, at least for me it'll be a Google five phone,
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.840]   although it's unlocked, so you can put anything on it.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.360]   And I actually like five because it uses either T-Mobile or Sprint.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.120]   So I'm less likely to be hunting.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.640]   In the city, I'll use Sprint.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.080]   Here I'll be using T-Mobile.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.320]   I'm hoping that will also open Marshmallow supposedly.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:08.080]   You see, my only problem with Fife, so I'm still testing this out, but it seems to default
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.600]   more to the Sprint network than it does to the T-Mobile.
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:11.600]   Here it's T-Mobile.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:16.480]   And you've got to carry around the equipment to handle both T-Mobile and Sprint's networks.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.480]   Well, you do.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.480]   That's the phone.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:22.360]   Yeah, I know, but T-Mobile is largely based around LTE, whereas Sprint has still got an
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.360]   awful lot of...
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.720]   Yeah, CDMA stuff out there.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.720]   So you've got an extra hardware load.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.240]   Oh, it's more in the phone.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.440]   You've got more stuff going on.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:33.800]   This is in the Nexus 6P and 5A.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:34.800]   6P and 5A.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.440]   Google Fyats, they're a wireless network, which is just for the network.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.040]   There are an empty, I know, with Sprint.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.600]   So they're using both of those networks.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:43.600]   And they're for...
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:44.600]   And therefore...
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:45.600]   They roll in which one.
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.960]   That's where you've got to have the hardware to deal with them both, which...
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:50.440]   Yeah, therefore your battery is going to get a little more drained.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.440]   Well, I don't think they're both here.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.440]   Or more expensive.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:53.440]   I bet they're not both lit up.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.440]   It's different chips.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:58.640]   No, but it does mean you've got less room to pack in there and there have been some...
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.640]   So you're...
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.640]   Actually, maybe the same chip.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.760]   I think Qualcomm has a CDMA LTE chip.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.000]   I think there are chips that say...
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.600]   So Google is now going to be your provider of your phone service, not Verizon.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:08.600]   Right.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.600]   20 bucks per phone for...
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.600]   Unlimited.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:12.600]   That's all you're calling and texting.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.000]   So you're calling it as a gigabyte, as used and they do fractional.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.800]   So Mike's been a save to a lot of money.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.800]   They only refund you.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:23.360]   After the first month, they only charge you for what you used each month.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:28.320]   So is Google taking out all the profitability that the carriers would have had?
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.320]   Well, this is what's a limited rollout.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.480]   I think the carriers are still trying to work out.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.480]   But it's...
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.320]   I mean, but they've gone with T-Mobile on Sprint.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:40.000]   AT&T and Verizon would have loved these people out of the building.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   Right.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   Because...
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   So the underdogs need them.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.040]   Well, Sprint, and yeah, Sprint historically has been very friendly to the NVNOS because
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:50.920]   what ends up happening is these guys do the cost of customer acquisition and the marketing
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.480]   for them and Sprint's ended up purchasing a lot of the NVNOS.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.480]   That's right.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.480]   Like the purchase...
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.480]   Perch and mobile they purchased, yeah.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:03.320]   So Google doesn't need to make a profit off of us as consumers from the service as the
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:08.080]   NVNO and they don't try to make money off the phone hardware either.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.120]   They're just trying to make money off of you doing searches.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.120]   I mean...
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:16.000]   It is this model to beat if you're Sprint or you're LG or you're...
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   Or even Apple.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Or you're...
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   Or you're taking two layers of cost out.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   How do you beat that model?
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   That's a great model.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.400]   The only reason they can do this is because you guys are getting hosed so badly on your
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.400]   mobile bills by the existing dual-color.
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.400]   No, make sure.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:31.720]   Seriously, if you had a decent level of competition in the US mobile industry, this wouldn't be
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.720]   possible.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:36.240]   I don't know why more people don't use NVNOS because they're almost always a lot cheaper,
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.440]   right, than the big carriers.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.440]   Yeah, typically.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.040]   I mean, you look at something like Straight Talk.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.040]   It's pretty ting, which is one of our own things.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:48.400]   But at the end of the day, NVNOS are leasing capacity from the existing...
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.400]   Right.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:53.960]   Do they get treated differently by Sprint?
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:58.080]   Sometimes sometimes the customer service can be a little more complicated.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.320]   But the quality is service.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.040]   The quality is going to be the same.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:07.280]   But the thing is, it's hard for them to pass a certain point to compete on price because
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.200]   even if they're paying a wholesale rate, it's not like they can just...
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.120]   I mean, I think as Google could sell it at a loss or something like that.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.440]   But at some point, they have to pay the carrier for the...
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:20.280]   You're sure Google fiber is cost rather than cost.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.280]   It's for Google, right?
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.120]   Google fiber is different because they're not renting capacity from somebody else.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.120]   They're building out their...
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.120]   Ultimately, they're buying somebody's...
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.120]   Well, they're buying...
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.120]   They're buying bandwidth.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.680]   You're going to level three or cogent.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:31.680]   They're buying that big.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.680]   Sure, for the...
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:35.680]   But in terms of like...
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.680]   The infrastructure...
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.480]   The infrastructure to the home, they're not leasing somebody else's line.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:39.480]   That's to their cost.
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.480]   They've got to pay...
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.760]   Well, also, they've been very picky in where they put Google fiber because they work out
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:47.560]   sweetheart deals with the local government in order to get it up onto the wires.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:48.560]   That's right.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.560]   That's right.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:50.560]   More gets some kind of...
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:51.560]   But who wouldn't do that deal off?
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:52.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:53.560]   I mean, definitely Google fiber.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:58.240]   It's frustrating writing about this because if you live in the Bay Area, you have to put
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.920]   up with such lousy wife...
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.760]   Lousy internet connections usually.
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:03.280]   It's not just the Bay Area.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:08.080]   And those are the two businesses that we in the United States have the worst deal.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.440]   One is mobile and the other is internet.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.920]   But this is what's so frustrating to think.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:12.920]   And what you think...
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:13.920]   You invented the internet for goodness sake.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.920]   You would think of the Bay Area.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.160]   Is it because we have old infrastructure?
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.760]   Well, it's because of the legacy.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.760]   If we wanted to...
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.760]   It's a big country, right?
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.520]   But I'll tell like the regulatory environment that we have and the way that we've done a
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.520]   lot of this stuff.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:32.040]   So if you look at, say, how we did cable TV, cable companies would go to local municipality
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.880]   and cut a deal where it was...
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.480]   We agreed to...
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:37.200]   We get a monopoly, right?
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.560]   An exclusive franchise in this area from the municipality.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:44.560]   But then in response, the cable company has to agree to wire up every single home.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.480]   So there's sort of that trade-off there.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:51.160]   And the way we've done this before in the past was this idea that it's because of the
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:57.280]   cost of laying the actual infrastructure, which was wired in most cases, that the trade-off
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.760]   is that you have to give the company some sort of...
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:59.760]   You give them a monopoly.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.760]   You give them an offer.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.240]   And then there's a level of regulation, right?
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.240]   And they can only... they have to appeal to some sort of board or commission to raise
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.240]   their rates and things like that.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.880]   This is where, by the way, it's fallen down.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:13.520]   It's fallen down because what's happened is that the Comcast and Time Warner's of the
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.960]   world have figured out that they can...
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.520]   They bully the hell out of these guys.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.200]   They lobby and they create this revolving door.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.200]   Yes.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.200]   And so they want the monopoly without the regulation.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.760]   I think the thing is you have to have both.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:29.120]   And if you look at, say, like in the UK, the level of regulation is actually very high
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:32.080]   and it's actually led to a better situation for consumers.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.080]   So it's the right kind of...
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.080]   Counterintuitive.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.200]   We have this idea that less regulation is always better.
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:41.000]   It's been proven that there are circumstances, and this is a good example of one where a
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.160]   more regulated market actually leads to better competition.
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.160]   And if we had it...
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.640]   Which is more capitalist at the end of the day.
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.080]   It's like you guys, we could actually have TV licenses.
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:54.520]   Yeah, well, I mean, the TV license is a tricky one because it pays for the BBC, which has
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.520]   a public education.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.240]   I don't think that's going to fly here.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.240]   No.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.680]   But on the other hand, if you look at how much people you pay for the BBC, as well as you
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:04.480]   pay for other subscription channels, it's a bargain.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.880]   I mean, it's about 126 years or something.
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:07.880]   Oh, that's a...
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:08.880]   I think in the UK, it's nothing.
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.040]   You know, people are spending 40 bucks a month on sports.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:14.000]   Is it based on color in black and white or is it based on TV screen size?
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.760]   It's based on color in black and white.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.400]   So you pay a little less for a black and white TV, but, quite frankly, who has a black
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.400]   and white TV in these days.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:21.400]   How much do you say?
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.400]   How much do you say?
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.160]   They knock on your door, door to door.
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.600]   Well you do get TV detective ads, which go up and down.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:28.600]   I heard about...
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.600]   ...claim to be able to...
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:30.600]   It cannot be.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.600]   It cannot be.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.600]   It cannot be.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:33.600]   It cannot be.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:34.600]   It cannot be.
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:35.600]   It cannot be.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:36.600]   It cannot be.
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:37.600]   It cannot be.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:38.600]   It cannot be.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.600]   It cannot be.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:40.600]   It cannot be.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:41.600]   It cannot be.
