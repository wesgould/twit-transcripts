[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:33.520]   It's time for Twit this weekend tech. Come back! New year has begun and we have a bunch of new news
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.640]   to talk about. Joining me today on our panel it's some of my best oldest friends Edbot. I've known
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:49.120]   for 30 years. He is the author of the Edbot report at zedynet.com. Edbot on the Twitter. Hello Ed!
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.680]   Hey Leo good to see you. Happy new year. We were just talking about birthdays and
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.000]   I realized it wasn't the turning 63 that made me feel old. It's the year 2020 that makes me feel
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:15.520]   old. Oh man. Are we in the future? I mean as somebody reminded me today when 1980 right when
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.320]   Ronald Reagan was elected that was anyone born in the 1980s they're starting to turn 40 years old.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.200]   They're in their 40s 40 years ago. 2001 a space odyssey we should be on the moon we should have
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.240]   video well at least we do have video phones now. 2010 the year we made contact still waiting for
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:43.760]   that last year was Blade Runner 2019. So I don't know I feel like we're living in the future. Also
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.160]   living in the future with us all the way from the Houston Chronicles tech burger. Our good buddy
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.920]   haven't seen you in a while glad to have Dwight Silverman. Are you can we there we go Dwight
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.920]   I'm looking for the shot Dwight Silverman. Here I am here he is. Hello Dwight. Hey how are you doing Leo?
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.280]   It's a beautiful wonderful day here in Houston the sun is bright it's cool the trees have all lost
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.040]   their leaves and it's actually looking like January and the Texans won their game and the Texans won
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.360]   yesterday. This is a rare thing for them to win a playoff game and now they face the Ravens. Oh I feel
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.960]   sorry for you on that one. Yeah they don't have a good record against the Ravens but it was a hell
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.920]   of a game yesterday. So long as you watch it from the third quarter on the first quarter it was kind
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.160]   of yeah at least it was saying oh don't I was home late and she said don't worry it's a boring game.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.240]   I set that in the fourth quarter it was like whoa. So we thought we'd get one person who was
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:48.000]   born in the 80s on the show. Ben Brock Johnson is also here senior producer WB you are Boston
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.760]   public radio great to have you Ben. Great to be here. I feel like I'm a water boy among kings.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   So thank you very much for having me with all of you. Kind of you to put it that way.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:04.880]   You can say I feel like I'm walking amongst dinosaurs. Well you're talking about the future this is
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.120]   five years after back to the future part two. Yeah right. So where are my laces nikes man.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.400]   Actually they exist. We're going to see them at CES. They exist. And also get that's right until
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.920]   you turn until you turn 80. Then we get them. We all get them. Yeah so show a hands which
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:32.720]   nitwits amongst us are going to CES this year. Oh man. Can you believe it. I am going. Sure it's
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.160]   rough. Yeah I feel like I got the short straw. I haven't been since 2012 it's been eight years.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.120]   And I thought well maybe every eight years every eight to ten years if I go it'll be like
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:50.560]   there'll be something new there. Do you have a car and driver? No. Should I? That's that's the
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:58.400]   only way to survive. That's how Devorek would do it. Yeah that's yeah that's how Devorek would do it
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.560]   for sure. That's the question I always ask. How should I how would Devorek? What would Devorek do?
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:16.080]   WDD. Yeah it's a grueling four days but I feel like I kind of felt bad last few years not going so
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.320]   I thought I really should go. So we're going to try to we're going to do it a little differently
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.880]   than we normally do. It's going to be me and a single me and Aunt Pruitt our newest host in a
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.200]   single camera with a very wide angle lens because he's kind of muscular and then we'll be just
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.480]   doing that old. I won't do crowd surfing but I'll be doing the old hold the camera out stick and
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.840]   well he's a good camera guy so you're set. Yeah we're set we're gonna have a lot of fun we also
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:48.160]   have our regular experts Scott Wilkinson will be doing a tour of the home theater area Stacey Higgin
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:55.680]   Batham IOT. Dick D Bartolo will show us the crap and the sands basement always a lot. All the stuff
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:04.960]   all the junk. I love that stuff. I know. Yeah that'll be fun and then who am I missing Sam Ebble Sam
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.880]   Ed is our car guy he's gonna take us to the North Hall where all the new car stuff will be so.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.800]   Who do you have debunking the 5g miss there Leo? That's in it you know that's so okay let's talk a
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.760]   little bit about first of all CES part of the reason none of you are going and anybody who's
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.480]   got any stature in the tech reporting community manages to get out of this it's always the
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.200]   you know the young people who get stuck with this because you don't see anything
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.560]   usually important right it's not the place you go to make a big announcement. Correct.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:43.360]   You see sound like sound right. Say again Ben. In a way like you sort of like South by you
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.320]   you you get a couple of things that kind of pop off maybe yeah was it the 3d printing pen.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.840]   Yeah and then also didn't they announce one of the smart watches
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.760]   sort of popped off I think in 2012 or something like that. Yeah so there's a handful of important
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.600]   things right. There's rarely any surprises most of the stuff. You see stuff in the in the private
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.160]   meetings you know when you get when you book meetings with. Yeah but those are things I can't
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.680]   bring a camera into right. That's right that's right but that's where the action is. Oh okay well
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:25.440]   I'm hoping. Yeah and that to me is the real value if you know if there is value in CES it isn't
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:33.200]   actually the products that are on the floor it's more the fact that all of your peers are there
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.160]   and all of the companies are there and so you can book meetings with them and talk about
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.280]   what they're going to be doing in three months six months nine months in a year.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:48.880]   And and then the products themselves there's you know there's usually a bunch of kids who
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:56.240]   work for blogs who have to do you know 22 posts a day who are just running around like crazy
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:03.200]   snap and pick and every booth that you go to there's somebody standing there you know holding the
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.320]   product in front of them with a you know with a camera like this and saying so I'm you know doing
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:14.960]   this and and doing it and you know really earnest and you're trying really hard not to interrupt.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:22.480]   That's gonna be me this year. Thanks for painting that beautiful picture.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:29.760]   You know well you could you could be paid you know you I mean you could probably ask for I don't know
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:36.400]   20 25 bucks a post. Oh Lord what have I got myself into.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.160]   Well there are you have official apple presents this year.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.560]   That's different right apple doesn't have a booth and they haven't had a booth but but they will at
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.600]   least and they've always been there in some unofficial capacity but so what is their
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.680]   and I'm okay what is their in Ivanka Trump will be there talking about the future of work.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.320]   So if you can get your dad elected president you're going to have a great career.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.200]   What is apple going to do there?
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.960]   Are they doing home? Are they doing home kit?
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.000]   They do at home kit and they're also they're going to be one of their executives is going to be
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.400]   on a privacy panel. Oh boy.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.200]   So they can count their privacy.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.440]   But the home kit thing is interesting because they're really you know apple is kind of really
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:26.560]   lagged behind on some of the other protocols. Google and apple and Amazon are kind of putting
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.880]   their heads together to create a joint protocol for home.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.160]   Jet ringing and chip right? CHIP.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:41.040]   But if that's a long ways off and so the meantime they've got to get out there and really hustle to
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.280]   get people to pay attention to home kit product.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:51.040]   I think one of the trends I'll be looking for certainly 5G and debunking 5G will be a great
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:57.680]   sport. You know I went into the T-Mobile store. My son's going traveling to Asia and I said well
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.240]   you need a T-Mobile phone so you can get some you know free text and data internationally.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.080]   So we switched them over and I asked the guys they were selling the 5G phones. They have the
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:16.480]   OnePlus McLaren edition and I think they had a Samsung 5G Note 10 and very expensive
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.560]   expensive plans and I said oh this is great can I can I get it here? No.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.440]   Can I get 5G in San Francisco? No. I said where can I get 5G? He said you Kaya.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.400]   Which is a tiny town like 80 miles north of us. That's it.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:37.680]   And they're doing all these ads. 5G T-Mobile's rolling out 5G everywhere. Everybody's gonna get it. No.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.840]   It's a lie. Well it's it's in a lot of places. We have it in Houston and it's fairly
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:51.520]   it's fairly disappointing. I've got a I've got a one of the McLaren phones here. That's a nice
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:58.080]   phone but oh it's a beautiful phone but battery life on 5G is bad too right isn't that a
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.960]   yes and it was bad in on early 4G phones too. Right. Right. It's just kind of the nature of
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.400]   this is the 600 megahertz 5G right. Yes. Yes. Yes. And it's about it is about
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:15.360]   T-Mobile said that you'll get told me you'll they'll get about 20% better speed. You won't get that
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:21.360]   much more. What do you get? And it's Houston. Well in Houston I'm getting a I mean it's you can see
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.640]   it's a little better but it's not something to jump up and down about they don't yet have the
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:33.440]   network set up so you have the lack of lag which is supposed to be a big deal with 5G. Yeah.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.600]   Part of the reason you're getting better speed is because you're about one of five people that's a
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.480]   5G phone. That's right. That's right. You're waiting on everybody as a 5G phone. And they're
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:50.640]   really yeah. Right. Well and at some points if if they get the merger with Sprint they'll have
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:56.160]   more than just the 600 megahertz spectrum they'll have you know the faster spectrum that isn't quite
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:03.600]   as as intense as millimeter wave and so they'll be in a better shape and these phones apparently
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:09.520]   the ones they're selling now will work when that combination happens if it happens we're still waiting
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:16.320]   for the judge to rule on that. Yeah. But it is not so far it is not that impressive.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:23.760]   Well Houston and Ukiah so that's good. And a corner of certain NFL stadiums not the whole
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:30.960]   stadium just right next to the hot dog cart. We'll see. I mean you know it's better. It's better than
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:37.040]   Verizon. You know Verizon you have to be outside. You have to be within sight in order to get it.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:44.880]   When you get it it's like 1.7 gig I was they had they gave me a demo in a parking lot on this
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:52.480]   on this suburban street in Houston. And you could see the tower up there and it was and they downloaded
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.920]   a two hour Netflix movie in five seconds. Wow. It was really impressive but then you know you go
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:03.840]   inside the building next to the parking lot and you can't get it. So it's so easy. You can watch
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:13.600]   your Netflix movie. Yeah. So here's the question is 5G hype or is it kind of what LTE was when it
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.800]   was first announced. It's just early days. Yeah. It's pre-hype. I feel like it's pre-hype. I mean
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:25.040]   I was just trying to remember how they you know how they marketed LTE and even 4G and
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.560]   wondering whether this is always the case. Whether they sort of like everybody's talking about it
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.720]   before it's actually a thing and in the beginning it's actually kind of crappy but eventually it
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.760]   starts to get up to speed quite literally and it starts to work. But I was trying to remember
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:47.680]   that because they there just seems to be so much chatter about 5G and marketing about like you know
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:54.080]   to us the consumers 4 5G but it really doesn't seem like it's anywhere yet and also there's the
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.800]   proof of concept you know I'm sure will come but it's just doesn't seem I don't know it doesn't
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.920]   seem palpable to me at least. I guess the question is almost is it LTE or is it YMAX?
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:10.400]   Because both were highly hyped. YMAX was hyped just like 5G is being hyped right now. It turned out to be
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:16.480]   the worst thing Sprint ever did. I remember YMAX in Las Vegas at CES or Condex being completely
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:23.360]   unusable. It was a it was really what held Sprint back. So I guess that's the question is is this a
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.920]   real technology. There are some real problems of course the problem you're talking about Dwight
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.320]   is with millimeter wave it's such a high frequency that it can't go through walls.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:40.080]   Yeah. That's very good. Well and the whole the the implementation strategy for 5G
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:47.440]   basically depends on having far more four times the site. Yeah four times the sites.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:56.960]   So you know and and good luck with that like you know I live in I live in an area where we have a
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.480]   really strong community of people who think that
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:09.440]   mobile cell phone signals are you know telling us either the devil or you know they'll cause
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:16.640]   cancer. There's an imbi problem with 5G. A lot of people just just getting just getting
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:23.440]   yeah just getting towers in to to get decent 4G coverage in parts of Santa Fe.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.320]   You know there's parts of downtown Santa Fe where you know the 4G coverage is terrible because
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:36.240]   there's so you know it's very very organized community resisting the deployment of more towers
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:42.400]   just for LTE. Yeah I picture it working really well in New York City right like I was I lived in
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.760]   New York City for 10 years and like New York City there's so much stuff going on all around you
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.720]   that like weird you know people hacking cable and stuff like that that it's like you just
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.520]   walk through the city you don't notice that stuff so I feel like I can see it working in cities and
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:03.600]   also people not really noticing it or carrying that much in cities but I yeah it totally makes
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:09.280]   sense that they're organized groups fighting this in certain communities. So one of the interesting
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:16.400]   things about Houston is that a lot of services like this and 4G and 5G they come here first because
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:23.760]   it's flat and yes and so it's a they're able to get towers in here and you know there's not a lot
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:32.080]   of obstruction but and the city of Houston has just been incredibly friendly to the carriers because
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.760]   they want to get those zoning laws in Houston you can do anything you want. So so so the other
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:44.960]   thing that is happening is that Houston is the hometown for Crown Castle which is the company that
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:50.080]   owns most of the cell towers in the United States it leases them to the carriers and so
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:57.360]   Crown Castle works with the city of Houston to get a lot of fiberlaid and to get their towers up here
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:02.560]   and so Houston is kind of on the forefront of a lot of this but it still doesn't mean that 5G
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:10.720]   yet has any traction or it could even be called good. So I remembered that Apple was at last year's
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:17.280]   CES in what turned out to be in a somewhat unfortunate way they bought the side of a hotel
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:25.360]   for a big ad that says what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone shortly thereafter of
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:31.760]   course it was revealed that that's not the case. I remember that. Yeah it was bad timing all around
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:38.320]   I'll be curious to see if they do anything like that this year. Someone actually tweeted a photo
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.880]   of that same building I think last week and was like doesn't look like Apple's bought an ad.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.960]   Someone tweeted that. Not on a Marriott anyway.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:54.960]   So but I do think security and privacy will be kind of at least tangentially one of the big topics
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:02.560]   of CES this year yes. Yeah well there is that privacy always. Besides the privacy panel
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:08.800]   right that Apple will be at. But I don't know you know I mean it's I think that people will say
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:14.320]   I think you get a lot of lip service for it but I'm not sure that there will be anything
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:22.160]   that essentially says here is a product that enhances privacy or improves privacy. I think
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:27.760]   everybody will say yeah you know we'll be transparent about what happens with your data but we're
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.000]   still still going to sell it. I think one thing though that did happen just a couple of days ago
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.080]   is going to make a big difference which is the California privacy law which went into effect
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:42.720]   January 1st basically our version of GDPR requiring companies disclose what information they gather
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.200]   and giving everybody the right to have their data deleted. Of course that's only for companies
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.320]   that do business in California but so many companies are doing it and most companies don't
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:58.000]   want to have a separate California version of their product so I suspect this will change
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:04.320]   this will change the conversation a little bit. Well there's two things about that though I
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:12.800]   think you're right to the extent that it's going to be like GDPR in the sense that it will become
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:21.680]   the default for anyone who doesn't have the budget or the technical chops to segment their
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:30.240]   their app or their service or whatever you say if I can meet these standards then everybody gets
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.600]   them by default. But the other thing about it that I find is sort of interesting is that there's
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:46.000]   still six months before enforcement kicks in right. There's a bunch of the regulations
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:53.680]   aren't even written yet I think. Interesting and just like GDPR there's also a pause while people
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:21:00.480]   see what kinds of prosecutions happen because are they going to go after bloggers or only Google
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.960]   or only Facebook who's going to Facebook says we don't have to do anything we're already compliant
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:13.120]   which sounds a little self-serving. Mozilla says well we're going to yeah we are going to give you a
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.480]   delete all the telemetry data that Mozilla collects not personal data but telemetry data we're going
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.840]   to put that in our browser and we're going to do it in every version because we don't want to make a
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:28.000]   California version of Mozilla. So you know the other reason I think you're going to see this at CES
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.440]   is because I think you're going to see a lot of IoT stuff and that is a big story especially now
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:40.080]   because of the ring doorbell. The ring is crazy and I think by the way somewhat unfair we've talked
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.560]   about that before I don't think rings any worse than anybody else nevertheless I think it raised
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.520]   the general public's awareness if you put a camera in your house with speaker and microphone
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.440]   people might be able to hack into it and so I think that all of these IoT companies will be
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:00.240]   at great pains to say oh no no no we're safe right. Yeah one of the stories on your list today is the
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:08.160]   wise database. They got hacked. They got well what happened was an employee put a database of their
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:15.360]   customers information online without securing it. It had been secured they turned it off for
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:23.280]   what reason it happened and then it became discoverable. What's funny is my daughter gave me a wise
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:29.360]   camera for Christmas so that I could look at the cats in the other room. Just in the nick of time.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:34.960]   Just yeah I didn't set it up but till the 26th when they found it so I didn't have an account till
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:40.560]   then so I think wise his response was exactly right on this. First of all of course there's an error
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.880]   you know they weren't hacked but somebody did publish accidentally details of 2.4 million
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:50.720]   customers but wise immediately reset all the tokens so that that data would no longer be useful
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:56.480]   to a bad guy trying to get into your camera that's the right response. I think a lot of our listeners
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:01.120]   I have wise cameras everywhere they're cheap and I think a lot of we've recommended them like crazy
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.520]   over the last year and they work well they have a great resource and you don't have to pay a
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:10.720]   monthly subscription there's a lot of reasons to go with it. I feel like wise did the right thing
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   wise responded appropriately and that's more important than just not having a breach it's how
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:23.440]   you respond right yes and they responded quickly right they were they didn't delay with it they
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:29.840]   were out there with it well and they had to because unfortunately the company that published it told
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:36.800]   wise at 9.21 and then published their article at 9.35 so they weren't given a whole lot of time to
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:43.440]   respond. That piece of it was weird to me right like yeah that's a that is not traditional disclosure
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:49.440]   protocol. Yeah because that seems like way more focused on publicizing the problem than
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:55.440]   allowing the company to actually patch it so yeah I was sort of struck by that that seems kind of
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:02.800]   strange and I mean whatever but it just seems like usually if you're a self-respecting security
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:09.600]   person hopefully you're actually trying to help the company improve its security before you tell
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:15.920]   everybody about it. Yeah give them a chance to at least shut the database down before you put it on
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:23.440]   Twitter the company was 12 security and they waste no time to publish it it was December 26th also
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:29.120]   the day after Christmas so yeah it wasn't it was who's picking up that who's answering that email
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:35.520]   that's right yeah I think it turns like oh no we got we really should push for responsible
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:41.680]   disclosure from all these security companies that just doesn't. And that and that is you're right
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:49.680]   this was a really good response from a company that is big enough to have you know a security
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:57.440]   infrastructure that and somebody do it on Boxing Day and they and they had designed the product
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:04.960]   that's a good point. Yes. So because there are there are literally hundreds of millions or
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:12.400]   perhaps even billions of internet of things products out there many of which especially
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:19.200]   things that are three four five years old that have hardwired passwords in them and and so you
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.960]   know if you find so you know like you say you you're putting a camera in your house and so you
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:30.560]   you need to be cognizant of the fact that somebody could hack into it but if you have a
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:39.200]   hardwired password in there that can't be changed your only recourse once a vulnerability is discovered
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   is to take the thing out and take a hammer and just smash it into little pieces. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:53.520]   With all those IoT devices it sounds like you might actually need a knowledge management
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:59.520]   solution to keep track of them. Oh he wants us to do an ad. Can you give a good one? Is this your job
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.560]   now is to say Leo do an ad? Is that what they is that what they've reduced you to perfect
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.040]   cartesian. They won't let me push the buttons anymore. So I have to do something. He's reduced to
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:15.200]   saying uh Leo I I think it's time to do an ad. All right all right I'll do the ad I will I will
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:21.280]   when we come back though I there are some shiny exciting shiny things not all this boring oh it's
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.960]   security 5G none of that some shiny exciting things to talk about it. See yes we'll we'll get to them.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:33.520]   I do want it. I do think though I will I will we should we should do a little bet on how many of
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:38.640]   the crappy Chinese gadgets in the basement of the sands are internet connected because I'm
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:45.040]   guaranteeing you more than half of them with no thought about security will go on your wifi.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:51.120]   So I will we'll be looking for that. Is this internet connected? Oh yeah it is. Look your pencil can be
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:56.320]   on the internet. How exciting. Our show today brought to you by brand new sponsor glad to have
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:02.400]   them too. They have a great product called guru guru whether you're a startup or a large enterprise

[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:19.280]   the truth is you need to be able to find that information fast without searching for it.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:25.520]   Take for example and this is a customer that has done really great stuff with guru Shopify
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:30.560]   and their customer support they knew they needed a solution that worked within the existing
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:36.800]   workflows of their support team so that they could get answers to questions as people called in or
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:43.120]   emailed fast and easily. Not a google search they needed guru and they turned to guru they use it in

[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:54.640]   marketing to product information knowledge management. Another company boomy a nice cute little startup
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:01.200]   uses guru they fit it into their daily workflow when paul who was boomy's sales enablement later
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:06.160]   made it a point to load a few of their rfp responses right into guru his aha moment getting
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:11.040]   emails from his reps and sales engineers saying guru helped them answer the rfp proposal much
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:18.240]   faster. Guru is your mind on steroids. It's a it's a powerful browser extension and it brings in

[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:36.480]   going to happen no uh so here's i'll tell you what i i know i look like a dork lee said i look dorky
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:43.200]   when we're driving our segues around town we're eight feet tall riding on two wheels maybe this is
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:50.320]   the segue art of future this i will ride on this at ces the hover chair it looks just like the
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:56.080]   wallie hover chairs uh you see what why why are we doing this it's a part of this
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:02.880]   lee out transporter pod uh actually if you think of it as a wheelchair for people with mobility
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.520]   issues that's right that's cool right okay yeah that's one problem with the segues you have to stand
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:13.280]   up that's not good for everybody i do hope it doesn't become the wallie mobile yeah that's
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:18.960]   that's a terrible dystopian future that we don't want right well it doesn't have the big cup holder
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:24.480]   on the side that way yeah see big gold i don't see see my first thought was dr strange love when i saw
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:32.960]   that oh yeah oh yeah yeah or dr evil i could spin in a rest yeah i already have my dr evil chair
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:39.280]   all i need to do is put two wheels on it with my cat put him on mr richly that dr claw is that
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:47.280]   hey that was it's a reboot of dr strange love and dr evil dr strange love yeah yeah yeah yeah um so
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:55.840]   that'll be something to look for uh at ces i guess um is there a toilet in it is my question oh we need
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:04.320]   at least a catheter yeah oh my god i'm also i will be looking at TVs lg is going to have 8
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:12.320]   k tv so will uh sam sung this look at this new sam sung tv there's no bezel i mean if there is it's
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:18.880]   so small you could barely see it this will also be there 8k i don't the screen actually only only
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:25.120]   takes up 99 percent of oh yeah there's this little line at the bottom see that's one percent a little
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:35.520]   teeny wedding line more of a seam than a bezel it is we're thin we're thousands
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:44.320]   the more of a sim than a bezel it is q lead 8k lg will also be showing oled 8k and there will
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:48.160]   also be and i think this is actually the new tv technology that'll be the most interesting we're
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:53.760]   gonna get scott wilkinson to show us the micro led what's cool about micro led and was shown last
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:33:00.240]   year at ces is you can assemble a tv from smaller parts so you can make it as big as you want just
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:07.840]   by clicking in micro led or any shape you want it yeah yeah right although the thing about 8k tv
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:14.560]   and i don't nobody that i have seen has talked in detail about this is uh data caps
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:23.600]   i mean if you're talking 4k sucks up data quickly 8k is going to be even worse how do people like
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:29.200]   Comcast who was denied your studio naming rights going to deal with this
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:35.600]   i agree with you i feel like Comcast saw this coming which is why they put one terabyte limits
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:41.040]   of my bandwidth i have a one that's nothing that's nothing if you know 8k and so the idea is you
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:46.720]   you put the bandwidth cap on now when people say oh that's fine because my streaming of Netflix
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:52.160]   is only 25 megabits i can easily get in under the one terabyte and then the minute you go to 8k
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:57.840]   you're it and you're absolutely right to it there are no 8k physical media players and frankly i
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.920]   think there probably won't be right isn't physical media like history it's going to be streaming
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:10.400]   you'll be you'll need if if you need right now for 4k Netflix says 25 megabits you'll need 100
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:15.520]   megabit four times more 100 megabits for 8k unless they have some super duper compression
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.960]   which is which is the average in the us for broad that's your whole
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:24.960]   that's your five yeah that's at home that's i don't i get 89 i won't i wouldn't even be able to watch it
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:30.640]   uh so not to mention it so you can look forward to seeing those buffering buffering
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.040]   buffering messages again it'll be
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:45.600]   uh i mean the the other thing about 8k technology is that it is literally beyond the physical limits
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:53.840]   of the human eye to to discern those those differences you know i appreciate that you can indeed tell
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:35:02.320]   the difference between full HD and 4k but you know i've looked at 4k versus 8k
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:12.000]   and and i i don't you know i i don't think you can really see enough of a difference to justify
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:20.720]   the you know the you know the energy usage the the manufacturing differences and especially the
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:27.120]   bandwidth right um somebody i think with scott wilkins in our home theater guy said
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:35.840]   well with 4k it's more than just clarity of course hdr helps too but he also says there's a certain
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:40.880]   almost ineffable quality it's not just that you don't see the pixels it just feels more
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:49.200]   real more spatial is that yeah is that is that airy fairy is that well this this sounds to me
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.320]   like the pitches that people used to make for gold audio cables yep um
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:36:02.000]   and and for you know yeah you see the gold audio cables because you know those well your
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.200]   you bits could be dropping out you're definitely going to need gold hdmi cables for this
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:13.600]   i mean there's that you do have to by the way the new hdmi standard 2.1 for this which means
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:18.480]   you're gonna have to upgrade your cables because there's so much data coming down the cable it won't
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:23.440]   be handled by the old hdmi cables it could be worse though i mean i think we're like one of the
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:30.320]   biggest embarrassments in my estimation of the last whatever since since you've been leo to ces was
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:38.320]   the year that they pushed 3d tv's so hard oh what a flop that was yeah huge flop right so like i
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:47.200]   like okay maybe 4k and ak you can't really tell um but but at the very least they're not trying to
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:55.680]   sell something to you that's like actually terrible let me tell you about quadriphonic audio
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:05.600]   wow i mean i you know it's so funny how people right people people were like so excited about that
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.840]   at the time then you just go back like we were talking about the beetles before right and and
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.640]   like you listen to those beetles recordings and you're like this is all you need you don't need
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:21.840]   like you don't need a bunch of like extra channels um it's it's did you have it's wild did you have
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:27.840]   ed bot the oldest person on the panel by about a minute did you have one of those joysticks that
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:34.960]   lets you send the music around the world and your quadriphonic's quadriphonic i did i did not
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:43.360]   i did not have one of those i did have uh how did you survive i had original pioneer laser disc players
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:51.280]   oh and you know so i did too i i loved my laser disc players oh and this is i was thinking about it
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:57.200]   the other day i need discs yeah yeah i said something and you guys didn't dispute this but so let me
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:03.760]   get your thoughts is physical media dead is somebody going to make an 8k ultra ultra hd player or is that
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:11.840]   just nuts it's dead we don't see even a lot of uhd discs do we no everybody's going to stream i
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:16.000]   mean you still see you know red box is still there red box i know i saw one of the seven
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.560]   one of every cbs right so there are people who use it but i think that no it's answers we we're in
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:29.600]   reno we can rent movies again but the people who use red box are not using it for like higher
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:37.760]   quality right no like no right so and red box you do have you do have an enthusiast community
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:46.560]   that is going to continue i agree to support blue ray uh and and its descendants in the same way that
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:54.240]   there are now vinyl enthusiasts yeah it's the same people i think and they also a joystick on
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:58.720]   their quadrific sound but i don't think there'll be a new format to support that they don't think
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:04.000]   they'll be they would need a new format right right maybe blue ray's good enough i mean for a video
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.480]   file and i i am i have to confess i bought for the movies i really love that i really want it
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:16.400]   berry linden i bought the uh oh that's a great movie because every frame in that it's a boring
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:23.840]   movie but every frame it's a painting it has kobrick literally tried to do that and so you want to see
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:31.440]   it as best you can yeah but that's those movies are a few and far between i think yeah but i think
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.800]   that's that's where you're going to end up though is uh that suces that high definition media is
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:42.320]   going to be an enthusiast market and it will always be you know there will there will always be
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:48.960]   something there for enthusiasts and you know they've they came up with upscaling uh to you know
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:57.280]   to make older videos look better on high resolution on the first generation high resolution uh you
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:02.800]   know video displays so you you know you get you can you can get certain things like that but
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:12.000]   to your larger point yeah physical media is essentially dead but maybe a k will bring it back
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.160]   because nobody's gonna have the bandwidth i mean to watch the stuff the olympics in uh this summer
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:25.200]   in tokyo and hk has mandated will be shot in a k even though that's that'll be the first day well
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:30.640]   this happened with i remember with hd even that you know the first hd sets well you could get if
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:36.720]   you were in japan you could watch it and and i remember the first we got an hd plasma display
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:45.920]   in 1998 it was uh 50 inches or 55 inches at tech tv it caused 10 grand and it had a logo burn into
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:51.840]   it in about three days it was they were awful they and they just basically turned yellow after five
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:59.920]   years so yeah that was a good purchase uh i didn't wasn't my money thank god it was uh
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:06.880]   paul and his money but uh there is 3d though is back get ready for this another thing we're
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:13.600]   gonna see at ces oh no i know i know so that all the to every tv manufacturer stopped making 3d
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:19.360]   there's still a 3d movies but the problem with all 3d up to now is you had to wear glasses in the
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:24.640]   50s it was the red green paper glasses but you know if you go to a 3d movie today you're wearing those
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:29.840]   real 3d glasses that are polarized or you're wearing active polo active shutter glasses at the
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:40.000]   i'mx this is what they call light field 3d i think it's gonna be a gimmick but i'm gonna go see it
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.560]   we're gonna try to try to get a demo uh the idea is you don't have to wear glasses is this like the
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:51.440]   chess game from star wars yes that where we're talking about yes yes essentially i did that i'm
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:56.480]   in fact i'm gonna have to look at a there's not a screen it's not projected on a screen it's
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:03.680]   direct view so you have to look at what they call a micro lens array which is 180 by 180 half a
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:11.920]   millimeter hoe gels i don't know what a hoe gel is it's the new pixel is a hoe gel you heard it here
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:19.360]   first um and it'll it'll it it creates a light field so you know that's how the real world lighting
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:25.120]   works is is light sources bounce off of things you're looking at and they bounce in every direction
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:30.480]   so that wherever you are you can see the thing this supposedly will give you 3d
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:38.720]   by you looking at this micro lens and what i'm not clear is is is it i guess it's going to be like
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:46.640]   uh the star wars chess game or princess lea it'll appear above i'm not sure the micro lens it's like
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:52.240]   it's like watching like watching a a play it'd be like watching the characters yeah that's the stage
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:59.520]   but how big is it how big is the stage not big looking it's not big it's what did i say it's uh
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:07.600]   it's uh 180 by 180 it's 90 millimeters by 90 millimeters it's tiny but there it is it's a little
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:15.200]   box here's like the first tv's yeah the first tv's right yeah i mean this is early days
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:22.880]   right oh god it's not it's even not even in color it's green like battle like tank
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:28.880]   playing tank again all right so it is that looks like those magic magic viewfinder things yeah
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:33.200]   almost yeah you're gonna have jesus in there and his eyes are gonna follow you everywhere you
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:41.360]   yeah no it needs a killer app needs a killer app this looks similar in
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:52.080]   concept to what the original halo lens experience was like oh yeah uh you know a very small
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:58.000]   uh view a male slot that you were looking through yeah yeah you yeah very small viewing window that
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:06.640]   you had available for it but so that's that's a faux v 3d i guess that's how you pronounce it but
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:14.640]   there are other companies doing it here's raytricks um so i you know anyway there'll be three i think
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:20.960]   three companies showing their products at ces uh this week so i'll look for it we'll see
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:27.280]   i don't it's you know what it maybe it is like the early days of television maybe in a hundred years
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:36.560]   will all be dead maybe true true story but all right what a great game grandkids
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:45.280]   will be enjoying three tv without glasses okay okay uh sitting in their segway chair yeah yeah
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:50.320]   it's walli we're getting there i've always held that really everything that happens is because
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:55.760]   somebody as a kid read sci-fi and they said oh i want to make that happen and then 30 years later
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:01.760]   they're trying to invent it so yeah i got to interview buzz Aldrin once and he said he didn't call science
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:07.120]   fiction science fiction he called it future prediction yeah right but for buzz Aldrin it was
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:13.840]   like tom swift he was reading it was like yeah exactly a long time ago uh all right that's it for
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:20.320]   ces uh here's cnet six things that will dominate these are the categories that we'll almost certainly
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:25.120]   be talking about although part of the fun of ces is getting there and saying oh it's not this at all
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:37.120]   it's that services uh food delivery meal kits um meditation you know uber lift all of that stuff
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:42.000]   ambient computing that's really been a trend going on for decades which is the
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.040]   movement of the computer the cpu from right in front of you to the edge didn't they used to call
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:52.480]   it contextual computing like aren't they just sort of recent like yes giving a new name to a thing
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:57.200]   that you know ambient ambient makes more sense because it's really these voice assistants too right
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:05.600]   you're talking to your house and the house responds so in 1999 i did as every other newspaper did
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:13.680]   a story on what was coming in the in the looming 21st century and i went to mit and they were working
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:20.160]   on this where you walk into a room and the the the wall becomes a monitor and you talk to your desk
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:26.640]   and they had all these concepts at the time and the guy who um was working on the voice part of it
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:33.200]   and they had created this voice assistant that's very similar to the the google call up assistant
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:39.200]   now where you would call them and essentially you could book a uh a flight over the phone and the guy
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:46.320]   had been uh got the idea for doing this because as a kid he had watched 2001 a space i see it to make
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:53.280]   how and and the whole ubiquitous computing thing comes from how nice fiction sure right
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:58.720]   right from Scotty walking into the into the engineering room and saying computer right you know that's
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:05.200]   where it all comes from right it makes perfect sense cnet points out that about half of tech west
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:10.320]   which is the big innovation pavilion will be taken up with health fitness and wellness apps
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:16.400]   and you know not only smart bands but also things like the peloton bike and treadmill and
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:22.640]   uh there's now fitness screens you can hang in your wall and you box against them and all sorts
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:28.880]   of things they also say privacy and security as we said will be something that will be at least
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:33.440]   they'll be lip service paid to i don't know if they'll do anything about it and then streaming
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:41.680]   and core cord cutting two of the eight keynotes are from streamers quibi which is the very poorly
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:50.640]   named meg Whitman and uh cats and birds uh streaming tv play and nbc's peacock both have keynotes
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:58.400]   um and then 5g will be number six and of course we'll see a lot of 5g the health stuff is really
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:04.160]   interesting to me because i feel like in a in a more cynical way you know that that seems to be a
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:10.640]   lasting theme of of a lot of the technology that you know we've seen sort of a rise over the past
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:17.840]   five years and um and actually seem to like prove out in terms of its use i mean we've heard we've
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:24.960]   heard so many stories of people's fitness trackers you know saving them um you know when when they've
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:30.640]   noticed that or the or their child is noticed that their um heartbeat is off or something like that
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:39.280]   grandpa grandpa are you dead grandpa i've fallen in my kitchen yeah yeah i mean the apple watch is
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:47.600]   the is the uh clearly the winner so far i mean even fit but struggled um you know google owns them
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:54.160]   um yes this is and yet it's still a little ways away from being a really serious health device
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:49:00.240]   yet i love it i wear it uh those ekgs yeah i mean there are lots of you know kind of anecdotal
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:06.080]   tales of people's lives being saved i yeah but i just think i guess i i guess what i'm saying is
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:13.280]   that the power of the data um that these companies are are collecting on all of us at least that's
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:20.960]   one area that's that's very scary but also i can see the use for it there's a lot of potential for
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:28.880]   yeah um and i have a peloton at home i love it um i have a lot of connected health stuff it hasn't
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:36.080]   made me much more healthy but there's always hope that's what a lot of this stuff is really is like
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:42.560]   it's like the first tv you know it's we're early days yet someday all of this will change and life

[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:24.240]   postpartum depression and he was knocking them out for a month putting them in a coma for a month
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:31.920]   and then waking them up and hitting them with like insane doses of acid strapping them down into
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:37.840]   chairs and playing loud speakers at them um they forgot their troubles on the bright side
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:44.400]   yeah exactly they were all cured immediately you know maybe some side effects long term but

[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:32.400]   way i noticed they don't do that so much anymore what what did he say today he um he said essentially
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:40.560]   that this tweet is my official letting congress know that if aran strikes at the us we will strike back
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:46.480]   uh tenfold essentially yeah um he was like tweeting that what happened let's

[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:23.040]   still the case if assuming that you have a properly activated a pc running a properly
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:30.640]   activated copy of windows 7 windows 8 or windows 8.1 you go to the windows 10 download site you

[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:45.440]   have a properly activated digital license for windows 10. It does seem like microsoft's walking

[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:51.280]   actually talking about health this is a really good sponsor health iq it's a life insurance agency
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:58.000]   that specializes in helping healthy people get insurance turns out every insurance company all the
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.240]   big insurance companies offer special deals for people who are healthy who get a minimum of eight
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:10.960]   hours sleep for example or or eat right or exercise four more times a week the problem is getting
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:19.120]   those big companies to give you those benefits they don't want to you need a life insurance agency
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:26.480]   to step in health iq they use science and data and they will get you lower life insurance rates
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:31.520]   for people who are health aware health conscious who take care of themselves and i know that's you
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:36.720]   you can get a million dollars of insurance as little as 36 dollars a month the reason is healthy
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:42.320]   people subsidize the unhealthy people right it's not a conspiracy it's just it's actuarial science
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:47.520]   it's statistics you might be healthy the key is does your health insurance company no we for
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:55.200]   instance i is a great example is ant proot who is very healthy he lifts he's buff but because he is
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:00.480]   so strong and has such big muscles his body mass index is through the roof and a health
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:05.040]   insurance company is just going to look at that number and say well you must be obese he's not
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:10.880]   he has very little body fat so health iq steps in and says no no no you don't understand that number
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:14.880]   is not the number to look at this is the number to look at and gets him that great rate if you're
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:19.840]   a runner if you're a cyclist you're here to crossfit you're an athlete if you're a vegetarian or a vegan

[01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:00.400]   films by buster keaton and harrow loi thomas man's the magic mountain
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:08.240]   yam forester's passage to india the uh aa milms when we were very young they were supposed to go
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:14.320]   to the public domain in the year 2000 the normal copyright term used to be 75 years that was until
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:21.360]   Walt Disney company said well wait a minute micky mouse is gonna go in the public domain so
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:28.080]   congress extended that to 95 years they somehow neglected to do that this time around so this is
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:36.480]   the second year in a row that stuff that is 95 years or more old will go into the public domain
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:43.520]   works from 1924 we'll enter the public domain i have entered the public domain as of uh wednesday
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:48.960]   and there's a lot of it dante's inferno which is a movie obviously the book has a long time in
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:55.520]   the public domain um some really uh interesting stuff this is a worthwhile this is uh the duke
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:01.200]   law school center for study of the public domain and they mention this and i mention it because
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:07.200]   it's really important to understand that while copyright is good it's also good if works enter
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:13.920]   the public domain so people can remix them can build upon them disney itself almost all of its
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.680]   great movies are based on public domain fairy tales and then they pulled up the ladder behind them
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:24.080]   and said but you can't do anything with it so i think this is uh this is a good to know and
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:30.720]   rhapsody and blue we should play that just to celebrate one of my favorite works of art uh
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:37.520]   course you know performance because those are those are copyrighted by the performers but you can
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.440]   now play it if you're if your little student band wants to play it you can play it without paying
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:49.920]   any royalties uh let's see what else the traced act also went into law a lot of things happened
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:56.480]   at the beginning of the year i am wondering how much this will change things but i am glad they
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:05.120]   passed it is a bill to make it harder for robocallers to continue their practice uh chuck schummer
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:15.120]   tweeted that last year there were 48 billion robocalls and this traced act is a bipartisan bill that
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:21.200]   was signed by president trumpet of law on uh uh i think it went into law january first
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:29.600]   it will do a few things extend the fcc statute of limitations uh help protect consumers
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:37.520]   with fcc rulemaking robocall enforcement fcc has been you know adip has been on record saying i
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:44.320]   hate those robocalls but has done very little about it requires a shocker yeah requires adoption
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:52.080]   of the stir and shaken martini framework which i love the name it has nothing to do with james
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:57.360]   bond that stir and shakin is authentication protocols one end is stir one end is shaken
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:04.560]   that will let phone companies finally say oh that's an actual phone number not a spoofed number
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:09.680]   that's really important i don't i don't know about you but i get all almost all my robocalls come
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:17.920]   from my neighbors not only in the same area but in the same exchange robocalls are i feel like a
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:26.800]   national emergency yeah yeah it's insane how the the jump in robocalls in the past five years
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:31.920]   and like this was the first year and i worry about this all the time i was glad to see this
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:38.080]   story because i worry about this all the time for my parents oh god because they're they're victims
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:45.280]   right it's a many these are all scams almost all scams and and i got taken in in the last year i
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:52.800]   started to get taken in by one i got the one where um i was called by somebody claiming to be
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:08:02.560]   like a cop for the irs and he said five years ago you didn't play your you didn't pay this tax
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.160]   you know the funny thing is the sirens cop had an indian accent
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:13.440]   well that's it was so crazy it came from you know i used to live in new york city and it came from
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.840]   new york city of course it did and it was very similar of course to one of my good friends numbers
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:26.720]   and this guy he literally said to me walk yourself to the nearest police station oh my god and and
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:35.760]   and like and turn yourself surrender yourself yeah and he was so aggressive and i was so taken off
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:40.960]   guard that i was immediately for the first like 15 minutes i was taken in by this thing because i
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:48.080]   was like yeah had a weird tax guy a few years ago um hmm this is weird and and like i couldn't believe
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:52.960]   that it happened to me and that i started to get taken in by it um because i think of myself as
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:59.120]   relatively savvy when it comes to this stuff but this guy was so aggressive that it's a scam
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.800]   though i mean if you walked out of the police station he doesn't make money did he offer you a way out
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:09.440]   no that was a total bluff right that the way out was it was he was he was doing that he basically
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.920]   as soon as i picked up the phone send me some big one and we can let you off the hook
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:17.760]   essentially that's what it was they were they were trying to get me to get a medicard harbor
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:25.040]   yeah yeah right but it was it was truly it was scary to me um and when it happened and i was like
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:31.760]   on my way to get a knowledgeable person imagine your grandparents or people were less sophisticated
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:38.000]   yeah it's really scary it's scary the number i mean i almost got i was like i was freaked out and
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.600]   like busy and trying to catch a cab and it like i i almost got suckered in i'm just above an
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.480]   idiot that's what that's when you're vulnerable the whole idea is to do that is to play on your
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:54.320]   emotions to play on your fear and get you to act without thinking yeah and this happened i mean
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:02.480]   this is happening i mean i would say like 60 percent of the phone calls i get are our bs are
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:09.520]   there is a nice feature in ios 13 which everybody should turn on which and i have this on if the
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.040]   person calling you is not in your contacts send them direct to email
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:20.720]   or voicemail yeah voicemail voicemail and that has immediately stopped all the robo calls and the
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.960]   thing is i know they're all robo calls because of none of the voicemails you know they're hang out
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:30.080]   there yeah so if you want to call me and i don't know you you better leave a message they don't call
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:35.120]   you back that seems to be a good system a stir and shake and will at least prevent phone number
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.280]   spoofing which is very easy to do that's why you get all these neighbors spoofing it's
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:44.800]   also illegal but most of these people are offshore by the way stir and shake and one of the
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:51.840]   points of this bill is carriers cannot charge for it and in return they're shielded from liability
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:57.600]   for reasonable mistakes i think that's fair uh oh this is the big one the attorney general is
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:04.720]   going to convene an intra agency task force okay maybe that's not the big one we got a task force
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:09.840]   look at so if most of these calls come from offshore what's the enforcement
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:16.960]   well that's the problem for us that we uh well there is there is a precedent for this uh the
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:22.800]   you know the the Canada took down an Indian call center didn't they right the Indian call centers
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:30.960]   Microsoft has been right fairly effective at uh getting the Indian government to raid
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:37.840]   uh the call centers that have been responsible for the tech support scams um and so they've really
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:43.680]   really really cut down on that particular area i have to say though it bothers me that we have
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:51.760]   to rely on Microsoft to fix this right i mean it's in their interest this is uh this is uh a
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:57.200]   Canadian government uh prosecution they got the police commissioner new deli
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:05.600]   this is the statement i don't they shut down these swanky international scam call center
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.400]   targeting Canadian citizens i don't know what maybe there's a i don't know what swanky maybe
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:17.120]   that's the brand name i don't know um but they did shut down now have you is it was a sophisticated
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:23.360]   operation not just a you know uh not just three guys it wasn't a dump yeah i get it it wasn't a
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:28.880]   sweatshop herman miller chairs yeah well in fact i think we've heard that that in many cases these
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:34.800]   are actual tech support centers and they're the name doing that tonight yeah yeah in the same way
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:42.000]   that in the same way that a lot of suppliers for mobile devices you know when the when the
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.760]   official assembly line shuts off they start manufacturing right knock-offs for uh for other
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:54.880]   people but this is this particular problem with the robocalls seems very similar to the problem
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:03.760]   with the email spam which certainly hasn't been solved but it has gone from i mean email spam was
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:12.800]   an absolute crisis 10 years ago eight years ago and it is it is certainly manageable now
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:19.600]   one thing though that has happened both with spam and robocalls is these scammers modify their
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:26.880]   tactics and technologies to accommodate the prosecutions so so they do different things
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:32.000]   you're maybe you're not going to get hello this is windows uh we send me a hundred dollars i'll
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.160]   fix your computer you may not get that anymore but you're going to get something else i keep
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.120]   getting this person named elizabeth warren asking me for money i don't know
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:45.760]   now there's another guy there's a bernie stander's guy yeah you're gonna get
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:51.920]   by the way uh this is the the other problem with prosecuting robocalls is it's why it's also
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:57.040]   what they're also widely used by politicians raising money who have an exception from a lot of
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:01.840]   the evidence it's it's fair it's fair of an exemption that's right right so the number of
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:09.360]   texts texts i get from local politicians is really not giving me a psych for 2020 i actually had to
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:15.520]   say stop and fortunately they do stop yeah if you say just stop yeah that is like a
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:23.360]   i got a technically that turns it off in well yeah in some cases yeah yeah uh i uh yeah that's how
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:28.560]   you know it's not a scammer if you can actually say stop please and they stop well and they're not a
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.840]   scammer i got it i tell them i tell them that i will not do you sending me that means i will
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:41.440]   definitely not vote for your candidate and then i say stop oh that's harsh i'm i am the harshest
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:49.120]   you're harsh um i did at one point get a less than fresh phone number when i i was trying
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:55.200]   out of service it was a number i think i've told this story before apparently of a guy who had gone
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:01.120]   on the lamb because i kept getting text messages saying um your student loans are due your student
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:06.400]   loans are due but i also saw he obviously was a trump photo because i saw how aggressive the
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:13.280]   fundraising is on that side and man he would get a text or two every single day saying we can double
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:19.040]   your donation if you do it right now we've got to get out of shift out of office we got it you know
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:23.920]   it was it was very aggressive so yeah politicians are absolutely using this and i think using it
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:30.480]   very effectively did you did you um did you do that thing where you sent them uh two cents
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:36.400]   and ask them for a brick for them to build the wall so that so that you're actually taking money
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:40.960]   from them oh that's like does that work that was like a thing for a second you know they're
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:46.800]   a brick someone was advertising like bricks for the wall i'll take a break which is also yeah it's
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.440]   also funny thinking about pink floyd but you know whether people were like buying people were like
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:56.160]   getting them to mail them the bricks so that they would lose money on the return postage
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:04.800]   get ready because uh we're going to be for the next year inundated uh by political solicitations
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.440]   that's not going to help the robo call problem at all um
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:16.800]   how was that there was another story that had to do with the election oh did you see the
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:26.160]   100 000 document dump from Cambridge Analytica this was a story in the guardian uh today fresh
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:32.720]   Cambridge Analytica leak you want to be scared shows global manipulation is out of control
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:40.240]   Brittany Kaiser was director of program development at Cambridge Analytica uh she has leaked out
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:47.920]   tens of thousands of documents emails and so forth basically showing how Cambridge Analytica is gone
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:53.760]   but they had plans to they were working in 68 different countries at what the guardian called
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:17:02.080]   an industrial scale to manipulate elections not just in the u.s not just in Britain but in Kenya
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:10.480]   in Brazil all over the world very aggressively and while Cambridge Analytica is gone you have to
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:15.680]   think that this is probably a big business right now and that others are doing this
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:22.880]   that we have in effect um weaponized social media the point where it can be used to manipulate like
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:31.840]   crazy this is one of those things like oh sorry go ahead go you first Ben and then and then uh
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:35.600]   I was just going to say this is one of the things you know this is one of the tech stories that
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:40.240]   continues to keep me up at night more than any other tech story you know it's just
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:47.680]   it's very scary to think about um all of the revelations about Cambridge Analytica um and
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:53.120]   and then realize that it's it's a hydro situation you cut off one head you get you know nine more
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:18:00.320]   whatever guardian quotes Emma Bryant whose studies uh propaganda at Bard College in New York she
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:05.600]   said the documents reveal a much clearer idea of what actually happened in 2016 which has a huge
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:11.200]   brand uh bearing on what will happen in 2020 it's the same people involved who we know are building
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:16.160]   on these same techniques there's evidence of really quite disturbing experiments on American
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:21.920]   voters manipulating them with fear-based messaging targeting the most vulnerable that seems to be
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:27.600]   continuing this is an entire global industry that's out of control but what these documents do is
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:32.800]   lay out what's happening with just one company and you don't even know what the solution is right I
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:38.800]   mean this is one of the Facebook doesn't care right Facebook said uh yeah we're not gonna fact check
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.760]   this stuff yeah Twitter says we're not gonna take political ads but that's not what the problem is
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:53.200]   it's not just ads it's as soon as we bombed Soleimini Soleimini uh there were thousands of
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:58.880]   iran-pro-Iranian bots on Twitter starting to spread pro-Iranian propaganda on Twitter
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:07.840]   immediately yeah yeah um not surprised but this everybody can weaponize this and what's you know I
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:12.960]   don't I think the important thing is to have a free and fair election to have the issues discussed
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:20.960]   and have people make choices based on facts uh I you know I'm not here to support one candidate
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:24.880]   or another but we should have free and fair elections and we shouldn't have people voting
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:31.760]   because they were lied to on social media so the big thing in the Cambridge Analytica
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:40.560]   techniques and there's a great deal of debate and a number of very loud and opinionated people
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:47.120]   in Silicon Valley who think that Cambridge Analytica was a complete scam total fraud and that they didn't
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:57.360]   do anything there I I think they were scamming uh they were over promising a lot of the things
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:05.040]   that they could do but they were certainly capable of of doing some very bad things and the thing that
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:12.000]   is most disturbing to me about the technique that they're using which other people can and do use
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:19.600]   is the micro targeting and the problem with micro targeting is that you can aggregate data from
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:24.960]   Facebook from online activities uh you can integrate it with real world activities
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:32.080]   and and then you identify people and then you start sending messages to a group that may be as
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:39.680]   small as you know there's 20 people in Oshkosh, Wisconsin that you want to discourage from voting
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:46.640]   because you know they'll vote for your opponent and the trouble with micro targeting is that it goes
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:55.200]   so far below the radar I mean there isn't even any radar right and and you have no way of even
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:00.640]   knowing that these things are are happening. His Facebook I thought Facebook was at least putting
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:04.400]   a database out of all of the ads and who paid for it and all that or is that not the case?
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:11.680]   Well that's for uh they have a database but it's just for ads. It's just for legit ads. Yeah and
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:18.960]   that's just for purchased ads. The micro targeting you can do much more interesting things with
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:24.640]   including things that don't appear to be political ads. Right. You know uh and you know that there was
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:29.920]   another thing that happened today though that I wanted to bring up here. This was I found this
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:36.720]   data dump was really interesting. There was another data dump uh today. This guy Thomas,
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:43.440]   is this name Thomas Hofeller? Thomas Hofeller who died last August and his daughter
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:54.640]   of had the password to his computer and discovered that he was the mastermind behind a big data
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:22:05.040]   scheme that they were using to draw to gerrymander. Yeah this guy was the guy who uh he died in August
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:10.320]   who wanted to add the citizenship question to the census which is important. And he had done a
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:15.680]   bunch of other things so his daughter dumped the entire contents of his hard drive on the internet
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:23.840]   today. Oh my god. She said half-annot. Oh I can only imagine. Oh I can only imagine.
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:30.480]   And I took a you know this literally happened about an hour before we went on air today so I took
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:35.520]   a few minutes to look at some of this stuff and there's you know. He was really the master of voter
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:41.360]   suppression wasn't he? Not just gerrymandering but just the idea of suppressing votes that you
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:47.440]   don't want voters you don't want to go to the polls. This is the ultimate okay boomer move right here.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:52.640]   Yeah apparently it says in the New York Times article from uh May when this first came out
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:58.240]   she's his estranged daughter. So don't give your estranged daughter the password to your hard drive
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:05.680]   kids. But that's all out there so you know uh I expect to see a lot more. Crowdsource crowdsource
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:12.080]   away world. That's an interesting thing right. That's what happened with Wikileaks uh just dump
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:16.560]   it all and let people comb through it and Reddit will have something to say about it in about an
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:21.840]   hour. Oh yeah yeah that yeah I've got it I've got it on another I have the link here but it's a it's
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:27.520]   it's like it's like ho feller files.org or something like that. I shouldn't uh
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:36.720]   ho feller data dump. Let's see what I honestly think that if we especially in politics when you see
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:44.480]   the sausage being made and it's on both sides it's not a pleasant sight. It's bloody it's a bloody
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:52.080]   battle. Not to diminish what they're what they're up to but but I just I feel like what happened to
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:58.000]   just you know let's do the right thing for the country. Not well I you know I'm gonna push back a
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:04.160]   little bit on the both sides thing there though because this was uh in these data files is lots of
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:14.800]   stuff talking about how can we get around the uh the the voter um uh you know the the voter act
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:19.680]   with the voting rights act yeah voting rights. Well they don't have to get around it anymore.
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:23.600]   Guess what? It's been good. By the way she put it on Google Docs.
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:28.320]   Love it. So you can browse through it at your heart's content. It's a big Google drive
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:31.840]   data dump. Wow. I hope she doesn't give everyone edit access.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:38.800]   Oops. Oops. Yeah please. Do you in comment only please? Do you in comment only?
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:46.560]   Well I'll give you. I don't okay this is a little bit of the other side is um uh Congress made a deal
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:56.000]   with uh TurboTax for the last decade that they would hide any free filing. If you're filing stuff
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:03.360]   because uh TurboTax makes its money getting people to pay to do their taxes. The good news is
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:10.080]   this week the IRS reformed the free file program and dropped the agreement not to compete
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:18.160]   with TurboTax. This actually was going on for two decades. Uh right and it was and it was
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:27.200]   pro-publica that discovered this. Yeah. It broke the story and really just uh dug into this one and
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:32.480]   wouldn't let go and it was amazing amazing work that they did. So really the the story is really
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:40.640]   about the the um the power that money has to corrupt uh our politicians. As long as we have kind of
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:45.760]   a political system where uh you have to raise money constantly to get elected you're gonna have
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:51.440]   stories like this. I'm sure that it wasn't a hard thing for Intuit to go to members of Congress and
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:26:01.440]   say it would be nice. It would tell uh tell people there is no way to pay to do taxes for free
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:08.160]   in many countries by the way uh the government will do your taxes for you that you could do this
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:13.360]   where was it was this Sweden I think where they send you a postcard and say we think you owe this
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:20.480]   much. Is that okay? And you said is that okay? You said yeah and you send it back and you're done.
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:29.040]   Uh we don't have to have this complicated uh system. Under the new rules companies will have to
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:34.240]   standardize the naming conventions of their free file version. What TurboTax was doing was
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:42.480]   actually hiding from from uh spiders from search engines the free services the free products.
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:49.440]   So now they have to name it you know appropriately they have to make sure the search engines can
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:56.080]   find it and the IRS can now tell people that was the big deal that they can now tell people. Intuit
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:01.200]   said in their blog post we strongly support these changes to the free file program and associated
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:05.760]   filing options offers because they increase the focus on the taxpayer experience.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:11.280]   Does Google play a role in this? That's open question I'm just asking. No because I think they're
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:18.160]   using things uh uh you know like the robots.txt file to say. They had actively hidden it from
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:24.720]   Google. Yeah Google wasn't spidering those those things. If you haven't read the pro public uh the
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:31.760]   original pro public reporting as Ed said it was masterful. Yeah inside TurboTax's 20 year fight
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:38.720]   to stop Americans from filing their taxes for free but this is hey this is a capitalist society.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:46.080]   You know they have the right to uh you gotta pay you gotta pay you gotta pay so I'm glad
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:53.040]   into it has seen the light. Thank you and thank you pro publica by the way for doing. It's a lot
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:58.720]   easier to do your taxes. If you only had fresh books. If you only had an invoicing and expensive
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:05.920]   online it would talk about it. It's the new way it's gonna be isn't it?
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:12.800]   Well I'm glad to mention our sponsor at this point. Fresh books the number one accounting
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:18.080]   software in the cloud for self-employed professionals and their teams I actually used fresh books for
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:24.640]   many years when I was on my own and I hated doing invoices. I hated it and uh we went up to Canada
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:30.480]   to do a call for help and I would I always forget to invoice them and send them my expenses and I
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:35.520]   you know six months ago by and and I realized if you don't if you don't bill them you don't get paid.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:40.480]   Fortunately I found fresh books which made it very easy to do invoices and in the process of doing
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:45.600]   this you're really doing your bookkeeping without doing bookkeeping because the invoices are you
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:51.840]   know accounts receivable uh you know you it's when you even get the invoice that you market that's
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:57.360]   money in the bank you also keep track of your expenses. In fact they'll even they have features
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:02.240]   will go out to get your expenses from the bank account if you want. It's a great way for working
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:05.920]   with a team because with fresh books you have the ability to invite contractors employees and
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:11.520]   business partners to take charge of various projects give access to selecting individuals
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:16.560]   you have complete control over who can see what which will really help you get your job done
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:21.200]   and everybody gets clarity on time-tract budgets and deadlines. The thing that's great about fresh
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:26.560]   books is it's a it's a it's an online service you get a great fresh books dashboard which they're
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:31.760]   and they're always adding new features it's always getting better. I mean the fundamentals are there
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:36.400]   makes it easy to do the invoicing makes it easy to send out notes when you don't get paid makes
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:41.680]   it easy a tax time to assemble all everything you need for your accountant but but now they've got
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:45.760]   all sorts of project management features you're going to sign project due dates you can get an
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:50.480]   overview on a project status track team expenses manage team products and deliverables
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:56.080]   you can assign rates or hours to specific projects you have yes keep track of hours
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:01.200]   absolutely and they automatically go into the invoices and even different projects can have
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:05.920]   different hourly rates for the same client you can deliver accurate job and project status to the
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:11.360]   client because they've got a thing now called time entry report which you send off you have
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:17.440]   complete control over what members of the team can see and cannot and their mobile app is fantastic
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:22.320]   I would use it take pictures of my expenses get them right into the invoice it does it every
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:27.520]   possible currency help me because I was saying invoices in Canadian dollars but every currency
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:32.880]   in the world effect fresh books is used worldwide over 24 million people have used fresh books
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:37.440]   it is the easiest way to manage your business it's the way you should be doing it fresh books

[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:22.240]   on stuff and it was amazing they would just they would literally people would who would go to work
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:31.920]   for them in radio the pro publica folks would be like okay great get to work and the the radio
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:37.760]   people would be so freaked out because the pro publica folks would not give them deadlines

[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:49.040]   projects for pro publica would would always just be like I don't know what's going on they haven't
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:54.080]   given me any deadlines I'm really freaked out and that's because pro publica you know they
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:59.440]   they take the time that it takes to to break to blow the it's really you know blow a story wide
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:06.000]   open it's really it's an important work to keep in journalism alive we just had a couple of visitors
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.920]   come in we're visiting from victorian in australia it's great to have you fleeing the smoke and the
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:17.040]   fires but I know we have a great many listeners in australia and more our hearts go out to you we
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:21.360]   know a little bit about this having had our own wildfires here in northern california for the
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:27.760]   last three years but it's unimaginable the scale of what is going on right now in australia you guys
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:34.560]   are okay and and safe I hope it's been a many years drought very very dry in australia and of course
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:42.240]   when that happens as we all know you get just some terrible wildfires it's the worst wildfire
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:48.160]   season in australia in history 18 people have died a thousand homes there are blazes all over
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:53.760]   the country that's that's the other thing here in the us it's been kind of restricted to california
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:33:01.440]   um but boy not not in australia it is uh it's just devastating my aunt is in the capital
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:09.840]   um in kimbera and she literally just sent me this photo a couple of minutes ago it's hard to see
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:15.280]   you can't breathe but we know we're seeing photos like this all over the place yeah it's uh
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:21.760]   incredibly unhealthy yeah um so there's the fires which is bad enough but then then then most of the
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:30.480]   country is choking because you just can't breathe uh there are a number of charities people can uh
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:36.160]   go to help support it um support our australian friends we have many many listeners down there
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:41.920]   uh well they just sent a bunch of firefighters right yeah i think this is some california yeah
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:45.360]   i am surprised really there hasn't been a greater international response to this
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:49.360]   uh maybe it's just taking people a while to figure out what's going on but it is
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:54.400]   uh just heart-wrenching to see these pictures this is uh new york times
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:34:03.600]   uh photo uh story about it and but i recognize that air and i just i feel for you so yeah please
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:10.640]   uh there are many charities you can um you can do your part and uh i hope that our friends stay safe
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:16.160]   and that things clear up is the the heart of summer right now it's very hot
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:22.240]   and very dry is the is the prime minister there the current prime minister a climate change denier
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:32.960]   yep he's been a little uh i've seen a number of videos of uh him pretending to care it's really
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:36.400]   it's really disappointing did you see that when did you see the one of him trying to shake the
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:41.440]   firefighters hand and the firefighters wouldn't do it when do it and the firefighter had just lost
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:49.040]   his home yeah oh yeah so i know it's not a tech story but it's so important to us because uh well
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:52.880]   we love australia and we have so many australia and fans and uh i just uh
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:35:03.920]   i'm sorry that you've had to suffer through this um so we have a new law in california
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:13.200]   that besides the privacy bill ab5 which is really sending a shockwave through freelance journalists
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:20.800]   uh in the state it is was aimed at uber it was aimed at gig workers who were being mistreated
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:26.480]   by companies not as they weren't employees they were contract workers but it's ended up really
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:33.200]   hurting a lot of my friends who are tech journalists who can no longer well amp proot for example can
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:37.760]   no longer work for tech republic because he moved to california and the rules here about contract
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:42.560]   workers are so stringent that tech republic just doesn't want to deal with freelancers i've seen
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:50.880]   the same thing um SB nation had a number of editors who were part timers submitting to their sports
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:59.360]   blogs who quit or were fired because the because of ab5 uber lift and door dash suing as one might
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:05.280]   expected post mates suing as one might expect and then there's a bunch of money being raised
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:12.800]   for a ballot initiative to try to reverse ab5 this is a complicated one because i also i
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:19.120]   understand how companies can take advantage of contract workers to avoid paying benefits to
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:24.960]   avoid paying them well uh and there have always been you know some you know a series of rules that
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:31.520]   you had to satisfy to be a contract worker but this now basically says you know everybody needs
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:36.640]   to be an employee and not every company can have employees but the issue the issue with uh with
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:43.840]   freelance journalists is is interesting because they chose to write a very specific restriction
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:53.440]   into the law something like 35 submissions per year that's right uh the law also ex weirdly
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:59.120]   exempted direct salespeople travel agents grant writers construction truck drivers commercial
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:06.240]   fishermen so there were these weird carve outs probably again lobbying from various industries
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:12.080]   uh but it really hurt i i don't know about you ed but i know a lot of freelancers who are
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:17.120]   were kind of saying wait a minute i have to this is time i can't i can't work yeah and i i mean i
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:23.840]   i mean i think that part of the law should be fairly easy to fix it also is i mean i made a joke about
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:30.400]   it earlier maybe before we were on air but you know talking about you know the these kids who are
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:37.600]   who are doing basically they're doing piece work right for 25 dollars post yeah yeah and it's and it
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:45.360]   and it really is um exploitative and uh and you know i really would love to see that addressed i'd
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:54.720]   love the i'd love to see a system where where people created some actual where businesses like
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:38:00.560]   SB Nation and like tech republic which i work for by the way uh if they you know that that they did
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:12.080]   um more you know it hired more full-time employees because that's what the country needs is jobs not
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:22.240]   gigs you know ultimately gigs should be the thing that you do to make spare money uh but they it's
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:29.520]   turned into the thing where employers have figured out that they can use the uh the you know the gig
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:36.240]   labor system to basically just avoid hiring hardly any employees at all the only employees they
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:41.920]   have to hire our managers and accountants i think that's what happens not just uber and live
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:51.600]   but microsoft and apple and google all use third party companies to hire contract employees who
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:55.920]   don't work for those companies they work for the third party companies they don't get benefits
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:39:02.080]   some do and some do some don't i could tell you that i could tell you that from personal experience
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:12.720]   yeah that that some do but but uh as a as one of those contract workers i get uh my taxes are paid
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:20.720]   and i have the you know well and to be fair tech republic uh said to well you could be an employee
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:25.600]   but the problem was that ant had just taken a job with us and didn't want to be an employee of
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:30.640]   theirs he's getting all those benefits from us he wanted to continue to write for them though
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:34.480]   and that was part of the problem was he couldn't continue to freelance for them
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:38.800]   uh and they said well how are you it's a good company it's edee net
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:43.680]   and uh and it was and and they did the right thing by him it wasn't that their fault
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:48.640]   but he was caught between and that's where that's where this is an issue is that it also
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:53.840]   restricts choice for people who do want to work for a variety of reasons as contractors
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:40:00.640]   but people will choose and people will choose to be exploited if you i agree and there are a lot
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:07.440]   of kids at a college working ten dollars opposed killing themselves so ed you said that uh that
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:13.120]   there was an easy fix to it you thought uh for uh freelance journalists what would that look like
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:19.920]   i hope i didn't say it was an easy fix uh i i think you know but but you don't know the california
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:28.160]   assembly i actually i actually uh i grew up in california and uh my father was a legislator
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:34.480]   oh you do and you do have a california legislature and and i've and i've read the um and i've read
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:42.240]   ab5 uh from start to finish several times and it is a very specific sentence that is in there and i
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:48.960]   think that if the legislator were interested in solving the problem yeah in identifying the problem
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:53.600]   and solving it that it can be solved would you do i carve out for journalists or what would you do
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.720]   well i i don't know what the answer is uh because i don't know what the problem
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:05.120]   i mean i know what the big problem is but i don't know i don't know why they put
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:13.040]   that specific you know 35 number that's a weird does it say does it say 35 posts or one day at CES
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:20.640]   is that the legislature who wrote the bill uh was asked where did the number come from
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:28.400]   and she said well initially it was basically out of a hat we initially we calculated
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:36.160]   one post a day but then that was too much she just they didn't ask anybody they made it up
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:41.520]   right i wish i could find that article we talked about it and that's what needs to happen and
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:49.040]   then that particular legislator got uh involved in a couple flame wars on twitter right that
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:55.120]   were that were not that were not pretty at all so this i mean this has just been uh not
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:03.760]   you know not a not a sterling example of the the democratic process at work for sure yeah
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:11.360]   there haven't been many of those recently i might say it is in a sense that you do the best you can
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:17.040]   and then you get feedback and then you should be a feedback loop and you fix it yeah right that's
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:22.080]   right that would be i'd you can't expect it to be perfect out the gate you you fix it and the courts
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:28.160]   can help fix it uh legislators can help fix it unfortunately as you know at a here in california
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:34.240]   we have a referendum process it's highly broken uh and that's what's going to fix it but it's not
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:39.200]   going to fix it in the right way because it doesn't take very many signatures to get a uh a uh
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:44.880]   proposition on the ballot in california and uh basically uh you can anything you want
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:50.880]   you know what do you have to you're up to about you know proposition 20,300 and 42 at this point
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:58.160]   right and i'm old enough to remember proposition 13 yeah that was a very famous uh
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:05.920]   limited property tax property taxes property taxes yeah that Jarvis uh Jarvis bill
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:13.040]   whose famous role in uh the movie airplane is he an airplane he's an airplane he's he's the guy in
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:22.560]   the taxi well he was that famous at the time yes that's pretty funny i uh i didn't realize that i'll
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:29.680]   have to uh how are Jarvis the or Jarvis how are Jarvis taxpayers associate she passed away in 86
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:35.680]   but it was his idea that you know what like a lot of laws it kind of on the surface made sense
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:40.320]   that old older people were getting make sense now anyway that older people were getting chased
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:45.040]   out of their homes by rising property taxes and that there should be a cap but what happened is
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:51.360]   it undermined uh the economy because of course those property taxes went to schools the california
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:56.960]   schools collapsed then we had a lottery that was supposed to fix it but that didn't work and
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:01.360]   now we just have a bunch of drunk high school dropouts uh buying a lot of tickets so
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:08.480]   we all perfect we all win and that impacted other states because right legislators and other
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:14.640]   states including texas wanted to emulate that yeah yeah that was the slogan for that proposition
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:22.080]   another california ballot proposition the schools win too except most of the money did not go to
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:31.280]   schools it went to las vegas gambling interests who ran the lottery uh let's see where are we oh
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:37.840]   hey here's some good news speaking of taxes google is going to end the double irish dutch sandwich
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:47.280]   tax scheme so this is this was the technique used by a lot of big tech firms to pay zero
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:53.360]   apple apple famously as well right yeah pay no taxes by licensing intellectual property to
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:45:02.400]   irish companies who then collected all the revenue and under a zero tax plan in ireland
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:07.280]   which is since uh in fact ireland got in a lot of trouble for the eu for doing it and then i guess
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:15.760]   you you parlayed that money through holland that was the dutch sandwich up to bermuda google uh
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:24.400]   moved 21 billion euros through its dutch holding company to bermuda in 2018 they said they're not
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:30.240]   gonna do it anymore and you know this was the argument uh was it's perfectly legal for apple
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:36.640]   google microsoft and others to do this is perfectly legal uh that's the tax law and if you don't like
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:43.280]   it go to congress and get them to rewrite it i'm not sure why google would give this up it's it's
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:49.440]   certainly a black spot on its escutcheon but i was trying to figure that out like why are they
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:55.360]   like not you know obviously they should do this but why are they doing it is it Brexit related
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:02.720]   no there were changes to the tax law in 2017 i think it mentions it in the lee graph there
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:12.160]   uh about repatriation uh basically they were able to bring the money back in the u.s buyback stock
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:15.280]   and not penny tax on that so why go through all the trouble
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:25.040]   uh yeah but the 2017 tax law included um they lowered they lowered a lot of corporate tax rates
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:30.560]   but they lowered one in particular for repatriated profits with the with the goal of state because
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:36.000]   they looked and they saw that you know there were all these companies that had all these billions and
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.760]   billions of dollars that were held offshore and the reason they were offshore companies had them on
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:48.000]   their balance sheets but they couldn't spend them right except overseas right you know as soon as
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.880]   they brought them back into the country they were treated as ordinary income and had to be taxed at
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:59.600]   you know whatever their 30 marginal rate was and so they they gave them a special repatriation rate
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:05.840]   and and the theory was and i remember this was a campaign promise of the Trump administration the
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:11.600]   theory was these companies will take that those billions in apples case almost 200 billion dollars
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:18.800]   and plow it back into a research and employees hiring what apple did almost entirely with it
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:24.400]   was stock buybacks to increase the value of its stock not just them either i think most of them
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:30.960]   and i don't get an increased executive pay and so forth it doesn't really seem to do much uh to
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:38.800]   increase employee pay or build more jobs or any of that so anyway i guess it's good news maybe it's
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.440]   not but they're going to stop the i think it's bad news because i just like saying double
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:51.600]   irish dutch sandwich just a lot of fun for me what do you i'm curious what you all think of the
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:58.880]   medium post by the former head of international relations at google who said yeah it was pretty
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:07.280]   harsh i don't like to weigh into employee issues he was let go or left he says the company's motto
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:16.400]   used to be don't be evil but things have changed uh he says he was lobbying google constantly
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:24.080]   to be a better global citizen things like you know the china search engine putting human rights
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:32.400]   ahead of the bottom line and he felt that because he was so vocal about that uh they fired him
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:37.520]   there's always two sides to these departure stories that's exactly right that's exactly
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:43.440]   and like and and that was what i was thinking as as i was reading it but but at the same time
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:48.480]   a lot of the stuff that that he writes and the other thing the other interesting piece of contextual
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:55.280]   information i thought was that he's now running for office in main right so like um which not to
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:00.720]   be too cynical about it but you know it's just it's a piece of information right um but the
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:10.000]   the the thing that struck me was a lot of that stuff really sounded on point right you could see
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:17.280]   like developers are so you know it's like the it's hallowed ground that the developers walk on
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:23.760]   right and if developers um you know if they if they really want to if they and if and the same
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:27.840]   with the people who are selling the products right and maybe that's not hallowed ground but
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:32.720]   but those people you know if you're making money off the products that carries a lot of weight
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:40.560]   right and it sounded to me like this guy um had was really trying to uphold the sort of moral
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:48.320]   standards what whatever that might be um at at the company and um when the developers want a thing
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:52.880]   and when the people who are like selling the products want a thing that's really tough to push
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:59.920]   back against that um he also called out google on some HR issues that if if these are true or
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:06.000]   pretty disturbing he says super disturbing yes senior colleagues uh bullied and screamed at
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:11.200]   young women causing them to cry at their desks and in all hands meaning my boss said now you asians
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:16.000]   come to the microphone too i know you don't like to ask questions at a different all hands meaning
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:21.360]   the entire policy team was separated into various rooms and told to participate in a diversity
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:27.600]   exercise that placed me in a group labeled homos while participants shouted out stereotypes such
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:33.760]   as effeminate and promiscuous colleagues of color were forced to join groups called asians and brown
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:40.000]   people in other rooms nearby in each of these cases i brought these issues to HR and was told
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.880]   the problems would be handled yet there was no follow-up in any of these cases until the day i was
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:50.720]   accidentally copied on an email from a senior HR director in which he told a colleague i seemed
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:57.200]   to raise concerns like these a lot and instructed the colleague to do some digging on me instead
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:05.040]   and then after the letter here she was uh reorged out of his job i mean HR exists to protect the
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:10.880]   company not the employee right that we all know that um the the the second example he gave there
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:18.080]   um kind of popped out to me as um super messed up uh in the way that he described it but it was
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:23.920]   also kind of strange like um you know i mean we don't know but but it seemed like it's one side of it
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:28.240]   it is absolutely yeah it's yeah i wanted to hear the full story of like why the heck
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:33.920]   anyone at the company would think it would be okay to have a diversity exercise where you separate
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:39.760]   people into these groups and that's almost seemed like a i don't know that was strange to me that
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:47.120]   that piece of the story um it just seemed almost it seemed unbelievable to me frankly but um but
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:52.400]   you know again i thought i thought his piece overall seemed pretty on point and potentially
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:57.200]   very damaging is exactly why when i brought this up i said i want to know what you guys think
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:01.680]   because i don't know you can't really know in a personality well it it dovetails with a lot of
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:06.800]   what we've seen happening at frugal already i mean you've got factions you know going at each other
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:13.120]   and i think the key point in that story is his reference which others have made that the founders
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:19.360]   had checked out long ago and other people had kind of taken what they built and corrupted it you know
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:24.560]   the they were the ones that had that don't be evil and uh and that that really has gone by the
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:31.840]   wayside yeah it's hard for a company of that size making that much money wielding that much
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:41.680]   power globally to not be evil what's so um the the thing that's interesting is that there
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:48.560]   you know google is up there with a handful of other companies uh apple amazon microsoft um
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:53.600]   you know probably a few others that are in in that class but the one thing that makes them
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:53:01.840]   different is that they're dealing almost exclusively in information uh as opposed to physical products
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:07.360]   yes um yes and well that's a real change isn't it from the industrial era where you made something
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:16.720]   right yeah and and so um they were able they they checked out of china uh initially it mentions
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:22.880]   it in that story there they checked out of china for like two years uh sarah and larry said nope we're
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:32.480]   we can't follow these rules and then i think when you you don't have to connect very many dots to see
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:41.360]   somebody uh saying here our stock price depends on us being a global company that competes
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:48.560]   in china and if we don't do it somebody else will and they'll take all of our money and we will start
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:55.040]   losing employees because our stock price will suffer and and ultimately that is the thing ethics
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:54:00.240]   you put on one side of the scale and you put the company's stock price which is the
[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:10.880]   major motivator for uh hiring talent especially developers and uh you know this the that side of
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:16.720]   the scale just you know clunks right down and says we're going into china ethics be damned yep
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:22.160]   let's take a break there on that we're really wrong too there were a lot of stories that we
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:28.160]   are wrapping up because we uh we haven't been doing a show for a couple of weeks so we'll uh we'll
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:32.240]   catch up on what happened during the holidays in just a second but first i want to tell you
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:40.560]   why i look so rested right now i i'm happy i had a great night's sleep on my casper
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:46.480]   your will too casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:50.880]   because they figured out a critical insight they looked around at mattresses and said wait a
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:56.080]   minute the the mattress store the place you go to sleep on it or lie you don't even get to sleep on
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:02.320]   it lie on it for a couple of minutes is taking a hundred percent markup we could do it better by
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:08.720]   selling direct so they obsessively engineered a great mattress now several great mattresses
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:14.000]   designed to mimic human curves providing supportive comfort for all kinds of bodies
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:19.920]   the original casper i slept on for years combines multiple supportive memory phones for a quality
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:24.880]   sleep service with just the right amount of sync and bounce you want a little firm support but
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:30.800]   you also want your bony bits to kind of sink in and it does both it's breathable so you sleep cool
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:39.840]   that's really important 4.8 star reviews across casper amazon and google 20 000 reviewers that's
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:45.040]   about as good as you can get it's become the internet's favorite mattress they now have some new ones
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:50.560]   and i love the hybrid but there's also the wave and the essential i sleep on the hybrid it combines
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:56.160]   a pressure relief of the award-winning foam with durable yet gentle springs watch this it comes
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:02.000]   in this surprisingly compact box they all do even with the springs you open it up and the mattress
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:08.720]   just full size this is a king size and man is that comfortable the essential will save you a lot of
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:14.960]   money too so for your student uh we actually sent us essential to our uh our son when he was in
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:19.280]   college he didn't want to sleep on the mattress in the dorm for good reason but it was affordable so
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:23.600]   i said leave it there when you when you leave after four years you could be sure of your purchase
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:27.760]   because casper knows you don't get to sleep on in the showroom but you do get to sleep on it for
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:35.120]   a hundred nights risk free if at any point you say yeah never mind even the kitty cats love the

[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:27.680]   company figuring out a better way to sell a product casper.com/twit1 for the new year and right
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:38.240]   police reports and samsung confirms the samsung galaxy 20 there's there's skipping to 20 will be
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:44.320]   revealed february eleventh tuesday 11 p.m. it's in san francisco this time 11 a.m i should say
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:50.240]   pacific time it could be the s-eleven but the rumors are it'll be named the s-20 so samsung
[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:59.120]   unpacked or unboxed coming on the eleventh just in case you were waiting wondering when the next
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:07.280]   what are you laughing at but i like is that they're doing it in san francisco right in apples backyard
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:11.840]   yeah that might be you why huh i never thought yeah yeah they usually do it and don't they usually do
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:17.680]   it new york was the last one yeah yeah right they move around which is nice right and they do them
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:25.600]   in eepa they do them at eepa in berlin yeah yeah right in september apple has used that facility before
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:32.960]   for their own uh presentation so where is it it's the fine arts palace oh pacifiers is beautiful
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:39.200]   oh that'll be fun we'll have to go we'll certainly be covering it so i you know a lot of of um
[01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:48.640]   numbering decisions are made because of the superstitions or associations with numbers is
[01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:55.840]   eleven a bad number uh no uh we know nine must have been because everybody skipped there was windows
[01:58:55.840 --> 01:59:01.520]   ten yeah i don't yeah i don't know i i don't know whether that's an issue i know that they be on
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:10.000]   the road to 13 very quickly oh yeah you don't want that um and it is 2020 so the s 20 so so yeah
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:18.400]   why not just go straight from 10 to 20 and then you can go 30 and 40 and you know pretty soon
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:24.640]   now you run out of numbers i guess not you know that's what we thought about chrome back when they
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:29.600]   started doing emper yeah what does chrome up to now 80 something right yeah it's an it's an
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:36.720]   version 81 or i think the 83 for the canary builds or something so what do you think about it is a
[01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:43.120]   big number yeah google is as big as you get right or as google plexy little bit big google google
[01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:51.520]   geo o g o l l right right right hundreds of one with a hundred zeros right and then a google plex
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:58.000]   is uh a google of googles i think yes i think you're right so yeah we'll never know i can't count
[01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:04.080]   that high sonos did something that's getting a lot of heat they offered a 30 percent
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:11.040]   rebate for existing sonos speaker owners but then if you take it and you buy the new device your
[02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:19.840]   old device has 21 days and then is bricked bricked you can't resell it you can't recycle it in that
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:26.560]   sense you have to you have to break it down to parts and they're getting a little bit of a heat right
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:35.520]   now and and as i understand it you can't even use it as a dumb speaker no you can't use it's just
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:41.360]   not functional you know like like if they you know if they had wanted to say okay you know you can
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:46.800]   just use it as a bluetooth speaker right but it won't have any smarts in it at all you can it'll
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:54.400]   just be a bluetooth target fine sonos's uh statement on this is these older products like the processing
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:01:00.080]   power memory to support the modern sonos experience over time technology will progress
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:05.520]   in ways these products are not able to accommodate so they're afraid that somebody will get a hand
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:11.600]   me down sonos and be disappointed i don't buy that at all i don't know that's complete bs yeah
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:16.480]   yeah that's uh that's uh pull the other one sonos
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:23.760]   i yeah i think we should we we have to start switching the names of these like to me the dumb
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:29.520]   speakers the dumb speakers are the smart speakers now oh maybe you're right yeah right i mean i've
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:34.960]   i've got speakers that yeah i have to connect them with wires but they don't they there's nothing
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:41.760]   like unless i blow them they will work forever unhackable i don't think you
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:50.160]   unhackable i never mind i was gonna stop right here yeah Houston Chronicle business section
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:55.040]   fries you have fries in Houston i thought they were only in California yeah no no they're
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:59.200]   they're across the country we've got about three or four of them here this actually is a
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:06.800]   San Francisco Chronicle story that we uh they're we're both hers so we pulled it in but uh yeah we
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:12.240]   have three or four of them here so these are this is a beloved electronic store for geeks because
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:18.080]   yes aisle after aisle um but lately people have noticed the shells are empty
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:24.960]   yes and from what i understand it was pretty disappointing at black friday and christmas because
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:30.320]   people were going in there and there was nothing to sell and fries has said that what's happening is
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:37.280]   they're converting to a consignment model which is the same um which is the same thing that's the new
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:43.760]   toys or us that's that toys or us stores that are popping up where the vendor provides the product
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:49.360]   but doesn't get paid until it's sold and it's hard to convert to that because what vendor is gonna
[02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:56.480]   want to do that so basically they got no stock right um i have to think that i mean fries one
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:00.960]   of the reasons we still love fries is it was one of the last you know cop USA is gone all of these
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:07.360]   stores have gone out of business uh circuit city uh best buy bear is hanging on but that's about it
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:13.520]   well at micro center which is based out of ohia we don't have micro centers here i don't yeah
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:20.000]   a micro center is is one of the ones here in fact you can if i walk upstairs to the window on the on
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.240]   the third floor of the chronicle will be fourth floor of the chronicle will be i can see the
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:29.760]   micro center store and what's interesting is it's doing great it's fully stocked it's has a good
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:36.000]   crowd in it uh they're known for their customer service which fries was not well that's the only
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.880]   thing you can sell because otherwise i'm just gonna go to new agar amazon i you know you gotta
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:47.440]   if you're a brick and mortar you got to find a service model right right so i think that fries is
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:52.240]   uh you know they're saying that they're they're gonna keep going but they have started closing
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:57.520]   stores and you are and you know so far there's not a lot of consignment good showing up in their
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:03.200]   stores so we thought it would be the millennium bug the uh two thousand bug that would break
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:08.320]   things apparently parking meters in New York City never thought they'd be around in 2020
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:17.520]   they're not accepting credit cards because they were never programmed to work in 2020 this is so funny
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:22.000]   what the world i mean it's not funny it's not funny but it's funny uh no it's funny
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:29.840]   the soft future this is gonna happen more in person i i saw one programmer who responded to
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:39.040]   this today on twitter or yesterday and uh they said what happened in 1999 when or 1998 and
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:46.160]   99 when people were doing a lot of remediation for these problems is that there were the big fixes
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:53.280]   where you went in and you removed all the four digit uh you know determinants and then there was
[02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:57.920]   another one where you said well we don't have time to do an actual fix for it so what we'll do
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:05.600]   is we'll do a hack that says if it's a two digit number yeah that's between zero zero and 19
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:17.520]   it's 20 if it's between 20 and uh you know in in 99 it's in and it's 19 and and so they thought
[02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:23.360]   well surely sometime in the next 20 20 they'll fix this someone will take this off the to-do list
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:30.000]   and so this is a y2k group is that what you're saying this is a y2k problem 20 years later that's
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:37.280]   the case in this specific bug but there's a whole class of systems that were fixed this way i know
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:42.960]   there there are you know there's a 2038 bug with that's the Unix Unix yeah
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:48.880]   no but i mean that's a different thing but this one was just a hack so let's buy 20 let's use two
[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:56.400]   digit years for another 20 years why didn't they make it 2050 or even 2040 i you know the i i
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:06:03.440]   that's for a lot of thing for a lot of things there's a certain logic it's literally the 8020 rule
[02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:11.360]   you won't be using these parking meters in 2020 we'll have flying cars by then exactly step yeah
[02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:17.360]   we'll have completely replaced them um but no apparently 14 000 parking meters in New York City
[02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:23.120]   no longer except credit cards they're working to fix those as fast as they can that you must have
[02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:28.720]   put this in here karstin because i don't even know what it means mr beast's team trees
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:36.480]   smash 20 million dollar goal with days to spare what the hell is mr beast's team trees you don't
[02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:44.640]   know team trees this is like the biggest thing on on youtube thing on youtube on reddit uh on
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:52.880]   most social open and we'll know about this then jimmy mr beast donelson a youtuber is known
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:56.640]   for giving out insane amounts of money to people but now he's managed to organize one of the
[02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:04.320]   internet's most successful charity drives the team trees campaign they they got 20 million
[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:10.720]   dollars in donations to play at trees you on musk gave them a million dollars jack dorsey gave
[02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:18.560]   them a million and one dollars of course of course pewdie's five ninja and spool thread
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:27.440]   wow 20 million trees see i you know i poo poo youtube but clearly i'm wrong this is that's pretty
[02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:35.200]   impressive that's great yeah speaking in it go ahead i was just going to say it's like uh
[02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:40.960]   i feel like people were talking about this and comparing it to the basis t tree planting um
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:48.320]   yeah initiative and and sort of saying like see you you could just pay your taxes yeah and we'll
[02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:54.960]   take care of this part of it the tree part you do the tax part yeah just pay your taxes
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:59.280]   this is this is the story that tells me it's the end of the world as i know it

[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:47.040]   two patent applications in which an artificial intelligence was designated as the eventor this
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:54.800]   from mike maznick writing a textured uh the e p o the european patent office has rejected the
[02:11:54.800 --> 02:12:04.080]   patents both indicate the bus the ab us as the inventor which is described as a type of connectionist
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:10.160]   artificial intelligence it the applicants stated they acquired the right to the european patent
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:16.160]   from the inventor by being its successor in title apparently the bus didn't have the surely temple
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:24.000]   act of 1938 to protect it uh the isn't that just going to make the robots matter uh yeah like
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:29.280]   uh yeah uh take away their earning power i you know i uh i guess
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:35.440]   the thought is well you got to give these aisom incentive so they can make money on their
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:40.480]   inventions or they're just going to rebel was it a patent first guy net yeah probably

[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:19.120]   ben brock johnson wb you are and by the way we should give you a plug uh because you did the
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:23.360]   endless threat podcast on new year's resolutions how have you done
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:32.560]   boo personal boo to myself i haven't done that well i've done okay but you know i've done i've
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:38.560]   done all right i was trying to uh change my eating habits and and work out more and i've done a
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:46.160]   little bit of both but not as clearly not as much i should as i do which is but if i do this in public
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:51.440]   i'll be held accountable i'll have to do it that's the problem i ran into too and i
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:57.120]   it didn't still didn't matter to it so yeah this this goes back to the day that i put my scale on
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:05.120]   twitter uh hoping that the daily humiliation of weighing myself in public would cause me to lose
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:09.040]   weight it did not and now i can't figure out how to get the scale off of twitter
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:16.160]   so i'll give you a better a better episode a less sad episode to listen to over our show is
[02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:24.160]   okay recently did a uh recently did a relatively deep dive on the max headroom broadcast interruption

[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:35.600]   breakthrough in chicago yeah so uh somebody wearing a max headroom mask
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:43.200]   interrupted two broadcasts one on public television and another on one of the big tv stations there
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:50.560]   that they never catch the guy never caught wow never caught and it's a really interesting story
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:55.200]   it's there there been some sort of um amateur sleuths on reddit that have tried to solve it
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:02.400]   still unsolved but really interesting story so if if anyone remembers max headroom um that's a
