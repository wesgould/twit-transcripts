[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   This is Twit this week in tech episode 9 recorded Sunday June 12th delivered Sunday June 19th
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.400]   2005 sorry about the delay folks. I'll get another one out to you any day now like today
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.960]   Enjoy the BBC would like to announce that the next scene is not considered suitable for family viewing
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.880]   And now for something completely different we are all twitch now
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.880]   What a great trip
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.700]   And after you ladies gentlemen welcome to another fine edition of twits Leo are you breathing heavy in the background this week?
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.440]   That mean am I the my the breather this week? There's always somebody breathing heavily here the breather this week
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:16.560]   Oh, I'm sorry. This is your favorite tech podcast Leo report breathing heavily Kevin Rose hiding in the darkness with his lock pick kit
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.320]   Robert hair and looking around trying to figure out why he's cold
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.480]   Would not go away. That's because you smoke and Robert. It's menthol, baby. It's a curse
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.760]   I I I can't do not Thursday Thursday afternoon
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.400]   I look somebody square in the face and say I never get sick ten minutes later. It just hit me God
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.200]   Oh, I think it was me you looked at and said you wouldn't get sick by the end of the day. I was miserable. Oh
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.720]   Gotta knock on wood, baby. Well, if you never do get sick, then you wouldn't be sick now now
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.920]   No, no logic. They're doozies when I do get sick. They're doozy, so
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.440]   So Robert you got the lead story today Microsoft warns on security
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.960]   What are they like 42 updates are coming out on Tuesday for Microsoft?
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.240]   Well, let's get to the point where pretty much any time you turn on your windows machine
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.360]   It's gonna check for an update and find one so right. What is it? What are they saying come Tuesday?
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.120]   They have ten more updates. This is the regular they do it every second Tuesday of the month and they've you know
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.720]   I don't know. What do you guys think you think this is a good idea or not?
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.120]   I mean for a while it was it was the patch of the moment and then they said well way
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.360]   Maybe we just better do it once a month, but then that leaves you kind of open for a month doesn't it?
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.640]   Well, you know what bugs me is the fact that you know anybody who's updating their system if they have if they don't have a broadband
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.880]   Connection they either have to wait for 42 hours for the download or order the CD to get service back water service pack to a
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.800]   Good a good way to get around that though is to just leave your system on overnight a huge percentage of America does not have broadband
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.280]   Well, it's time to change it's time to get some broadband 52% of America has broadband now. That means 48% does it?
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.520]   That's true
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.520]   I mean it's it's still pretty close to 50 50
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.920]   But in the case of Windows updates since service pack to it the system encourages you by default to have your automatic updates turned on and the default
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.960]   Time I believe is it like three in the morning
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.920]   So if you just left your system running overnight, you're that usually solves the problem of slow connection if you if you can so
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.200]   What's the why are they waiting till just you know one one day a month to do this?
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.920]   Why not just stage them throughout the month?
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.680]   I don't see it is such a bad thing really you consider that most of the the hacks that they're fixing or security holes that they're fixing are
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.520]   cutting edge threats that perhaps you know
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.360]   Maybe it would take another month of being out in the wild before a serious threat could be mounted
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.640]   But they're gonna have a patch out that hopefully we'll cut that off ahead of time unless it's like, you know
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.360]   A seven-year bug or something. It's been there forever and it's been in any version of Windows
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.080]   But you know are they sticking hard and fast to this though
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.480]   I mean if something comes out say on a the Wednesday after they do their major patch for that month
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.600]   Are they gonna release it later? Are they gonna have to wait a month to get that patch?
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.040]   They're gonna wait a month. That's true. That's what they've been doing if it's ultra critical though
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.180]   If they throw something out there immediately, I think they will but apparently nothing's been ultra critical yet tell me
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.360]   I mean it really it isn't widely known until Microsoft releases the patch anyway, right?
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.040]   I mean how widely known is these are these exploits?
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.300]   I once the patch comes out everybody knows about it
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.040]   I think for the professionals out there who who infect machines for money
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.840]   They're aware of this stuff because it's it's in their interest
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.860]   But I think for the the general amount of script kitties out there are people who simply take an easy to use tool to cross-causing
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.480]   Mayhem
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.340]   I don't think they're gonna be seeing or be able to use any of these exploits hopefully in time because of things like automatic update
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.000]   Well, I'll give you a I mean
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.580]   Here's part of the problem look I just my hard drive just died and I'm reinstalling windows and I had a windows image
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.760]   Thank goodness. I used ghost to make a windows image of the install
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.080]   So I didn't have to go through the full install
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.960]   But it's a service pack one image so the very first thing I do before I even go online
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.880]   I tell everybody to do this I install service back to halfway through blue screen at death the thing's dead and I have to
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.600]   Reinstall over again. No wonder people don't want to install patches
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.620]   Well, you can download service pack to as a as a standalone
[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.100]   I did I have a seat standalone oh
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.680]   72 megabyte file on a CD didn't stop a blue screen of death
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.320]   Infuriate that sucks. Yeah, no kidding. Is it in was it an older piece of hardware?
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.420]   Well, it's the same piece of hardware that was running the same image and service pack two before I don't know
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.460]   What happened all of a sudden?
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.660]   It's just you know, it were it used to work and doesn't work anymore
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.100]   I I went through literally two weeks of pulling my hair out trying to figure out a problem
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.700]   I was having it turned out it was a power supply related issue
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.660]   Ah and I went through two seemingly brand new power supplies that people had given me and I finally went
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.900]   I'm bought one of my own and guess what it worked as soon as I know dropped one that I had pulled out of a package
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.060]   You never I mean this it's such a complex system. You never know what's wrong. Do you know?
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.780]   That's why I love the shuttleboxes everything's pre-wired and I just drop parts in it goes
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.900]   Yeah, well, that's the advantage Apple has they make their own power supply
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.120]   I mean where they spec their own power supplies. I don't make them but at least you know what you're getting yeah proper
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.780]   I mean any reputable PC vendors also testing their equipment before they ship it out as well
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.940]   Hopefully catching we can only hold most of it the more it's directly rated to how much you pay though
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.240]   The more you pay I'm sure the better they are tested
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.060]   Yeah, you know the high-end PC gaming companies are gaming PC makers out there
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.040]   Is there any evidence that an alien where or Falcon Northwest is more reliable?
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.440]   I mean you sure pay a lot more for it
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.840]   I I I know exactly what they do to test those systems and it's about as rigorous as you can think of each and everyone
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.140]   Yes, that's good. Especially well one company in particular
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.680]   I mean I don't want to name names, but they were talking about how
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.020]   They put every system through a five-day test and it's 24 hours a day trying to break it
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.160]   And they're fearful of things like driver updates because you know they're worried that the new drivers might introduce problems
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.560]   I take the opposite approach
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.700]   I say there the driver updates in particular for graphics guards are really necessary just because
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:49.080]   There are so many little things that could happen when you code a big game nowadays that could cause a problem or a bug or a crash or
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.120]   Performance so frequent patches and driver updates in particular for the gaming scene. It's just critical
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.260]   They're really two different schools of thought out there
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.820]   I mean if you never change your computer and never install anything it's always gonna operate the same way or
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.860]   You update everything all the time and hope and pray that's gonna continue to work
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.060]   I don't know I don't know which is the right way. It's funny
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.940]   I've been going back and forth because I think you know
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.900]   It's always nice to build your own computers spec everything out
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.020]   You know what you're getting and then it is nice to buy something that's already pre-built for you
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.540]   But my problem the biggest thing that I know that just drives me nuts is that all these pre-built computers come
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:29.100]   Alode was so much crap software. Oh, it's all I just got an IBM thinkpad and there's like 30 applications
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.500]   I will never use you try and uninstall them and then just the system gets all nasty. That's terrible
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.460]   Well, yeah, the first thing I did on this tablet PC was uninstall half the stuff that came with yeah, absolutely
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.900]   Can you reinstall the app the OS easily is it just using Windows XP on your tablet?
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:48.540]   Now see here's the well with mine. I was gonna say with with the thing pad it comes with another image on there
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.540]   It has all that crap already installed on the image so when you try and restore the image you restore all the crap
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.620]   They don't give you original Windows XP CD
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.740]   So none of them do that actually some of them do yeah
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:07:59.220]   I'm okay
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:04.540]   So I have a HP tablet and it has tablet edition the problem with this one is it has no spindle so you you
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:11.940]   Can't install anything unless you do it over the network or you make a disk image or you know some serve some sort of massive hack
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.620]   And then it has this thing called Altirus which is a backup
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:20.820]   But it backs it up to another hidden partition on the hard drive so as long as the hard drive doesn't die
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:26.540]   I'm okay, and it's a constant backup. So what's nice about that is I can
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:34.100]   Make any modification the system like uninstalling these things and it will modify my it's like a system restores like a global system restore
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.140]   So that's pretty good. Mm-hmm. So now I've uninstalled all that crap
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:42.140]   And now I have an image of that in a sense. I can go back to that point in time the uninstalled
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.620]   But I don't have any you know they gave me a Windows disk
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:50.780]   But well how much supposed to install can't that's funny. Yeah, it seems like to the less you pay for a computer the more extra crap
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.380]   You get installed on it
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:57.380]   Either through deals made to the manufacturer or something bad effect. We're in a crap
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:04.220]   This is a crap society where it's a crap generation. There's crap everywhere. There's ads everywhere. There's no, you know, there's never I'm
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.180]   Cranky old man. That's all crap. You okay there Leo?
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:13.180]   Everywhere you go there's an ad on every surface. I hate it
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.180]   Yeah, but a lot of what's crap to us like Kevin certainly doesn't want you know
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.940]   The software running in the background that allows Delta fixes machine
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:27.380]   But you know there's a lot of insert name of non-computer experts here who think that's you know the bomb true
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.460]   But I don't know I hate that stuff. I know I mean it's amazing
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:36.420]   What's like buried really deep down in the system that you don't realize until you wipe the system rebuild it
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.780]   Yeah, what are you guys doing for backups nowadays?
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:44.020]   I'm gonna get one of those external networkable hard drives that do the retrospect incremental backups
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.940]   Those are you doing the are you doing another one of the one touch the max source?
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.820]   Yeah, they have the max door one touch now that it's actually a networkable
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:56.660]   It has the large a 45 10 100 1000 I think in the back throw it in the closet hide it
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.300]   So if anybody breaks in they don't steal your data and then
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.380]   Dude, I'm I have to be careful here
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.500]   You know I got so many computers and and all this stuff
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:09.060]   I try to you know at least throw harder somewhere where you know if someone breaks in they can't find it and then
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:15.860]   Do your incremental backups to that? I'm actually building I've got three penny in two boxes and one of them
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:20.500]   I'm turning into a new smooth wall firewall and the other ones becoming I'm gonna use probably
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.820]   Open filers really cool looking but I think I'm just gonna use NAS light
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.500]   Which is a really cool someone is breathing really heavily and it's kind of hot
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:35.540]   Gotta be Leo. I know it's just really distracting. It's like having someone breathe in my ear. I'll move the microphone
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.540]   It's naughty man
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.180]   I like start farting
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.700]   Let's just disgusting
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:49.060]   Yeah, but actually it's pretty cool server elements.com as a website and there's you can get downloads
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.540]   On fresh meat that and it essentially just turns a box into a network
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.100]   Network attached storage box. I'm gonna try that and see if it works
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.220]   But it's really cool. So they've got a version of it
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:04.900]   They've got a they've actually have a version of it that'll do large disk support on older systems. That's cool
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:11.380]   I am I have I foolishly went out and bought the Iogear boss, which is you know network attached storage slash
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.260]   router
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:19.700]   Oh, what a piece of I can't believe you bought one of those. I am such a moron by anything that says boss on it
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:20.780]   Yeah, well boy
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:27.100]   I tell you we should we should actually have a round of applause for being honest and and open enough to admit that you actually
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.100]   bought one of those
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:35.100]   Mean you knew it was a bad idea. I should have asked you first. I didn't know I yes
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:40.960]   You should have asked me it seemed like a good idea because I mean I am using it as storage
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.920]   There's a I'll tell you the flaws though. I'll tell you what's wrong with it first of all see here's what I thought look
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:50.820]   It's got built-in VPN built in FTP built-in web server. It's a 200 gigabyte hard drive 300 bucks
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:56.580]   And I have in its firewall. It's a firewall. It's a router. So here's what's wrong with it
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:01.860]   Mmm crappy router. It has very few port forwarding capabilities really limited kind of stuff
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.260]   It doesn't stealth it only stealths two ports
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:10.140]   It's delts the bios net that that bios ports, but it leaves all the other ports are closed, but they're visible
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.060]   So it's like it's saying shoot me come on get me come on and then
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.940]   It's got a couple of just like really gross flaws for instance if the power goes off
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.980]   It stays off the thing doesn't come back on so your whole your whole network storage
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:29.340]   Is down right it doesn't and your routers down right and you don't know what's what happened to my network because the power was
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.340]   All were you accidentally turned it off or whatever?
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:36.460]   It it's I mean it's just it goes on and on and on it's it's just goofy
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.660]   But I am using it as network attached storage and I've backed up all my
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:44.100]   Photos to it and all my music to it and I mean it works for that. It's fine for that
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.340]   And so that's you know, it's it's a centralized backup
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:51.580]   I plug every piece of a sensitive equipment I have into an interrupted power supply including my network here
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.260]   Yeah, even if the power goes off for like 15 to 20 minutes
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.380]   I can still sit there and you know finish up what I was doing without worry
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:02.380]   Yeah, but it's it should but true if it totally drains at least my router comes back on and everything just resets
[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:07.300]   Right the worst thing I have to worry about is maybe getting a different IP address and extend around a router
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:12.500]   Shouldn't you know go away and not come back when the power comes back. This doesn't make sense anyway
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.180]   It's it's disappointing. It's overpriced. It's just as far as file backup ghost
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:21.020]   You guys ever use like the offline files app that's built into windows itself
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:26.620]   I believe my IT department at work has a way set up on our local network that anything I drop into my documents
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.020]   We'll get backed up to a mirror my documents folder sitting on my drive
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.300]   So I use that frequently and I do that on the Mac
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:38.740]   They have they have an iDISC backup on the Mac that I do it automatically syncs your iDISC that has the advantage of sinking it to
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:44.500]   All of the Macs that are that you're using so I have access to the all the same files on all my computers
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.180]   Which is kind of nice and it makes local that is exactly yeah
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:53.780]   It's a nice, you know, I mean you only get 250 megs of if you mess with Google's like using a Google program to use a Google Drive as a
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.980]   Remote storage Google file system Google that's well
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.700]   I mean like say you I mean not their file system like their OS that they use internally
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:07.420]   But using like the two gigs you have is as an emails for online storage. Yeah, it's slow
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.940]   That's actually I mean people have been talking about that, but I just haven't tried doing it
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:17.580]   I haven't seen anybody's actually running it that you mean the download that you can use to back stuff up kind of automatically email stuff
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:23.540]   No, where it simply just takes a Google account you have and uses it as two gigs of remote storage like a drive
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.700]   You can actually give it a drive letter and right
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:31.380]   But how does it what I want to know is how it spans the files because you've got a limit to the amount you can attach to an individual
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:36.300]   Email at it. Yeah, I've used it before it breaks it up in a small little five megabyte chunks
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.260]   And then gives it a little ID and like the subject and then uploads them one at a time
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.500]   It's just all transparent to the user. I mean behind the scenes. Yeah, it's a hack
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:49.260]   It's just a simple changes something it breaks everything and then there goes a silly hack leo
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:55.220]   Or is it a cheap bomb proof 2 gigabytes of storage for nothing? That's what I'm thinking. It's a silly hack
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.460]   How are you gonna get it back? What how do you restore it? The only thing that's what it is now with the client software
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.660]   Is for yeah, that's how the client software works, right?
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:07.860]   You are putting the data out there and if something ever went wrong with that account you lost them with any other storage system
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:13.780]   See the only thing I'm concerned with is I would want them to use the Google's API in order to actually make this work
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:17.540]   But they were using the official like Google API then I would say okay
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:22.220]   Maybe this white might work, but they're actually kind of scraping the system and it's a little bit of a hack
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.340]   Yeah, that's what makes me nervous. I agree
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:29.820]   I mean if Google said here's your SDK for saving files on Google, but they're never gonna do that. Oh, that'd be awesome
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:36.020]   Yeah, that's true. It would be abusive probably in Google's eyes. So not the coolest thing well there to their credit
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.220]   They haven't done anything about it. I mean they're letting people do it
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:45.020]   I probably because most people aren't not doing it yet yet. Hey, did you see that the OS 10?
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:51.300]   point four point one the Intel OS 10 is apparently on the where sites already. Yes, that's awesome
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.940]   I can't wait to get a copy less than a week. I have to get a copy
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.780]   If anybody hasn't their email me
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:04.940]   What is this about Apple being a hardware company when now all the focus is on their potential takeover not anymore in the OS world
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.260]   So who predicted this last week this you did
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:15.860]   I didn't think it'd be cracked so fast this forces this forces them to sell it right it hasn't been cracked
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.540]   This has just been leaked off the developer systems, but you couldn't put on the system
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:26.300]   No, I would I'm saying is they have they have a they have a small number of systems are selling to developers as of the worldwide developers conference
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:31.620]   I don't think any of the scary security stuff. They're talking about doing for the release version
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:39.140]   Which is summer of 2006 has been implemented yet. Can you run this 10 point four point one on a white box PC now from what I hear
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.540]   That's the rumor
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:44.220]   I was speaking with a friend of mine who's a Mac developer and he was at the conference
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.620]   And he said he would actually got a chance to play around with the machine
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.620]   He was looking inside of it
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:53.500]   And it's just a standard Intel motherboard standard on board Intel graphics. There was nothing crazy nothing special
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.580]   No special Apple chipset on the board. It was you know off the shelf kind of stuff
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.220]   So I don't see any reason why not at this point anyway until they had that protection
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.460]   See the minute it's cracked if you think it forward
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.620]   It let's say it is cracked and they somebody does figure out a way to put it on a white box
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:10.500]   Then Apple's gonna have to do a shrink wrap release of it because otherwise
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.620]   They're losing all this revenue and then all of a sudden they are a software company
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:17.060]   I don't know it'll be interesting to see what happens. They screwed the pooch
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:24.420]   You're just not a happy man today Leo. They screwed me. I'm telling you I hate windows. I hate Apple. What's left Linux?
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.100]   Piece of crap
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.540]   Those boot CDs are cool long live nopics and the other boot CDs out there
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:38.100]   I'm just I'm not gonna install anything ever again. I'm just gonna run live CDs of everything
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:43.100]   Hey, at least with nopics you'd have about two gigs of apps on one CD
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:49.820]   So pretty amazing if you're open office and you're it is it is really amazing. That's the heck I want OS
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.060]   10.4.1 live CD baby
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:27.180]   How long before that happened tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.580]   Digital signals by March 1st
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:37.980]   2006 instead of I guess it was gonna be see March April May June July 1st October or
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.140]   2006 and then all of the sets
[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:47.940]   All the smaller sets they're gonna actually convert over seven months earlier than the original FCC deadline
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.420]   So they basically means they're gonna support
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:56.300]   Digital signals on these these are regular standards and not AT TVs. These are regular standard TVs
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.020]   The the CEA was pushing for this. Yeah, that sounds right
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:05.820]   the because a lot apparently a lot of retailers were were are convinced that consumers aren't gonna buy
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:11.900]   any of the digital televisions. So the the manufacturers didn't want to get stuck with a bunch of
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:17.420]   TVs that nobody would buy and the retailers want to get stuck with a bunch of digital TVs
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:22.460]   They didn't think they could sell so they lobbied the FCC to force the deadline earlier
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:28.980]   for the digital compatibility of televisions, you know, it's really just a raise awareness with consumers about the
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.580]   Say that you know what everything will transition to digital eventually
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.500]   Here's why and to get them simply thinking about it because I believe this week
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:44.380]   It was reported that Comcast is actually really almost forcing some of their original customers who are sticking with analog only
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:51.940]   reception in the home to move over to digital because then once all the analog consumers are done and the system is
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.660]   completely digital they can then start implementing okay digital on every channel and
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:02.540]   Increasing the quality of those digital channels as well through hopefully more bandwidth and the copy protection of course
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:09.580]   But the whole thing about digital TVs though is kind of like a so what odds are if we're moving to this digital
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:15.540]   Environment anyway who doesn't have a set-top box and that set-top box will do the digital conversion for you
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.540]   But I don't want a set-top box
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:22.460]   Don't confuse but don't confuse cable and broadcast this is this is you know
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:29.660]   This is to convert to digital broadcast technology so they can resell as much as the of the television bandwidth as possible
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.780]   Who still watches rabbit ears see I'm all for that too because I'm my favorite
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:40.060]   That's my favorite form of TV is digital over there apparently apparently something in the neighborhood of 30 million Americans
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:44.180]   But the Lord but that's what's there watching for channels. What are they watching?
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.860]   They're I mean they're watching ABC NBC CBS
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.860]   Fox and then a couple of uhf indies. That's nothing. There's also
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:57.740]   I mean the other thing is yeah, but you remember something later. You're also talking about you know all of the
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:04.220]   Spanish you know a huge percentage of the Spanish language channels Chinese language channels Korean language channels that are locally broadcast
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:09.820]   The communities are still going out on uhf or some of well and they need to go HD. Absolutely. Let's move
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:15.020]   Hey, if you're poor, let's go HD as of today. There are 1500 digital stations
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:20.100]   There are 1500 digital stations in 211 markets. It's the not HD. It's it's digital TV
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:25.020]   Well, which way is it gonna be Leo? You've just argued one way which is not one watches broadcast TV
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:29.980]   We should kill it all off and you just want the other direction which is so you're saying this is for people who are watching
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:38.100]   Broadcast television well, who is that it's somebody who is not the somebody who should be buying a digital TV
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:43.980]   It's somebody who's who's watching probably watching a 13 inch black and white television watching Chinese language
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:49.580]   Programming they need a digital TV like a hole in the head or those of us who watch PBS and HD
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:57.100]   Yeah, I think what the real market what's what's really going on here is they want this frequency you talked about this before with a yes
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:01.420]   They want to resell the broad they want this that's right. They want the 700 megahertz frequencies
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.100]   It's worth billions and screw consumers screw the public
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:12.340]   Do you think it has also anything to do with if it gets back to terrestrial broadcasting as a competitive media or medium or getting you your TV
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:19.940]   The way you want it you think that would then and reempower the local broadcast stations who are probably being decimated by just the
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:24.620]   Variety and breadth of cable offerings and satellite offerings and yeah, you think that would it
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:30.180]   Well, it's kind of a plan therein to say you know what we're the local the local stations broadcast
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:35.540]   Just fought this tooth and nail for years. They really didn't want this to happen and I mean I think broadcast is
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:41.260]   I mean it is really now just the realm of local small-time television, you know
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:47.740]   Look what happened to channel 4 in San Francisco true. Well, that was that was there was all sorts of weirdness around channel 4
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:55.900]   You know, but I mean check this out cuz the CEO obviously has a vested interest in selling as many new televisions as possible
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:01.020]   But their numbers are claiming that 33.6 million which is 12% of the
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:06.780]   285 million television sets in the US are used to view over the air television programming today
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.340]   Wow, so only 12% of TV sets well
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:18.300]   I think this is basically an unholy alliance between the federal government that wants those frequencies back because it's a windfall of billions of dollars and
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:23.700]   The Consumer Electronics Association that wants to sell TVs to people who don't really want to buy them
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:28.180]   And and neither one of them is looking out for the interests of the individual
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:32.340]   They're I mean they're both looking out for the interests of big business or big government
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:36.900]   I think part of what everybody's always wondering is what a set top converter box is gonna cost, right?
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:41.780]   I mean, what's amazing is right? This is this is the end of 2006. This is supposed to hit right? Yes, that's soon
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.980]   Yes, and that's part of why I was thinking about this. That's really soon. Yeah, that's not far away at all
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:53.020]   Yeah, that's that's 18 months away. The chips aren't cheap digital TV chips, please. Okay a couple years ago
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:58.500]   Yes, they were pretty expensive, but when you have the card selling you can put in a PC for well under 200 bucks
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.500]   Yeah, the chips themselves probably cost no more than say 20 bucks a pop
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.580]   Yeah, but you're also talking orders of magnitude and difference in the purchasing amount
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:11.340]   I mean, there's never gonna be a huge number of people, you know purchasing the boards for PCs
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:17.220]   But I mean, you know if so many in terms of what it would cost them to integrate that into a television that cost is significantly
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:24.520]   It really shouldn't at this point it should be a non-issue short of making it look better or upscaling the
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:29.780]   Pitched digital feed they're gonna be using trying to cram as many channels as possible into this new bandwidth
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:35.820]   They have and I just I have had digital cable or digital even even satellite
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:42.420]   That's completely digital and I still see you know visual flaws here and there it's all changing direct TV has their new direct
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.140]   Directway satellites going up this year already started with one and they're moving to MPEG-4
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:52.660]   Lots of people I talked to are really digging Comcast HD over some of the other options out there
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:59.460]   Especially with the demise of zoom and it's amazing how bad some of the digital cable is that's floating around right now
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.060]   Well the other thing too is that they have digital cable
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.300]   Yes
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:07.740]   But even if you have the digital cable set-top box less than I believe less than half the channels that you'll receive are in
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.940]   Sent digitally it's still mostly analog on the digital system
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:17.820]   And that's part of that problem of still having to support the people like me who haven't switched up yet or switched back
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:22.180]   Just because of that I like certain things about analog cable as in you know
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:29.740]   I don't have this lower third and ugly ass menu system being forced on me or the incredibly slow channel changing that suddenly
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.820]   Jumps in when you're moving to a digital channel system listen
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:39.140]   I mean we're talking here's the guy who's the HD TV expert that our our HD TV guy and he
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:45.900]   Still watch an analog cable that tells you something about consumer demand. It's the transition point. We're in right now
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:50.260]   There's not enough content. Yeah, what is it of of everyone who owns an HD TV?
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:55.340]   It's I think less than 13% have actually watched HD TV on their HD TV
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:01.640]   But I mean it was like there's a difference between digital TV and HD TV. Yeah, it's this it's this weird transition
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:08.140]   Yes, we need digital we need digital transmission and we need more sources like you know rentable content, right?
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:14.780]   I think there's common confusion and certainly my consumers and obviously even among experts about the difference between HD and
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:19.940]   Digital TV what about now? Let's talk about this broadcast flag which the courts have thrown out
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.520]   Isn't this kind of a backdoor way to broadcast flag if we go all digital?
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.700]   This is the third part of this unholy alliance. You've got government
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:31.500]   You've got the consumer electronics association and you've got all the content creators who are desperate to copy protect everything
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.740]   They don't need a broadcast flag if everything's digital. They just prevent copying through the digital well
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.840]   Thank goodness the courts refused well in theory, right?
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.240]   But if you're running this I mean it's it's gonna be interesting
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.660]   There's always been a lot more controls on the HD content that there have been on the standard
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:51.420]   You know digital version of the NTSC content, you know anything. It's widescreen versus anything. It's four by three
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:57.600]   We think of DVD content right now as well. That was digital protected. It happened to have one little aspect of it
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.600]   That was very weak in terms of its protection
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.840]   and
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.680]   Yet there there's a there is a very successful
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.820]   Digital format that we've all lived with for quite a while now
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.160]   Well, if you think about it
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:15.880]   I think that's that by far is the number one digital format and the number one high quality television format
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:21.520]   It's not HD. It's ED, but it's it's it's really what most people think I bet you if you ask people
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.880]   Most people think DVD is HD. That's true
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:31.000]   They most people associate it with just the set they're looking at or the display they're looking at and not the content itself
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.040]   It's funny. I have an HD TV and I don't watch anything in HD. Well women's tennis is actually pretty good, but aside from that
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.320]   I'm just really waiting for kind of like the HD DVDs or the Blu-ray to push it
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.160]   That's what I what I want really want is movies in HD, you know, I could care less about TV
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.000]   I was very excited, you know
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.760]   I had a dish HD unit for review and I saw ESPN HD
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:28:00.600]   Wimbledon I thought oh great Wimbledon. It's gonna be HD TV. I tune in it's NTSC with bars
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:05.880]   This is ESPN HD. There's still there even they can't even do 24 hours worth of HD
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.640]   And and some of them and this is the premier tennis event in the world. It's not it's an NTSC
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:16.880]   So I mean that was last year, but that's where that's where they the signal you're receiving is 720p or 1080i
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.360]   But then they add it's basically with the original signal
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.840]   You can see it's letter or a pillar box in the center with their logos down each side our
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:29.720]   ESPN HD guy told me. Oh, yeah, most of our stuff. We up we up scale. We don't you know
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:37.320]   We're not you know, we're turning it into HD. It's not HD. That's the other issue is you're looking at a 1080p a 16 by 4 ratio
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:42.440]   But it's not high-def content. There's some good programming out there though. The Discovery HD is awesome
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:47.800]   Monday Night Football is amazing. Yeah, if you like to watch crickets mate. Hey Nascar
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.680]   Over half of this season. It's been broadcasting HD, you know, I loved it
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:29:00.760]   High-speed sports. That's where you really appreciate a good HD feed sports the Oscars big events like that and then movies totally
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.240]   I don't know. I'm just happy for you and I Leo that
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:11.000]   Neither one of us has ever had to make HD broadcasting. I know I know they got high-def radio coming
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.880]   I'm terrified high-def radios. I mean it's it's out. Hey, I hope it just simply improves the cameraman attributes
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.440]   I'm sick of shaky cam and the bigger the screen you have the more you notice camera movement
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.800]   So for everyone out there shooting home videos, it's like don't shake the camera so much use a tripod
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.200]   Please home videos. It's MTV baby
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.560]   Oh when you start looking at stuff on 60 plush and screens and somebody's moving the camera on a lot
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.880]   Get everyone, you know reaching for the drama mean. Oh, yeah
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:42.000]   We have to change everything. It's scary everything. You know is wrong
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.080]   Leo you sound so I
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:51.800]   Am I'm sitting here trying to get my goddamn windows to work and life sucks
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:57.880]   85 86 degrees in this Garrett office. I'm starting to feel like the Vorac
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:05.680]   No, the works a little punchier you start to sound depressed. I'm just cranking
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.400]   Just cranky
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:15.720]   All right. Well, let's change the subject AMD details early quad core plans story up from extreme tech comm so
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:23.240]   Friday they didn't analyst briefing AMD said they are making and this is one of the best quotes of all time quote irreversible
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.400]   Progress on the new architectures specifically
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:35.840]   Multicore microprocessors and 64 bit processing this guy's going to the George Bush School of Elacution. I don't know I
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:42.720]   Mark Hockman is a guy I do a bunch of work for a red extreme tech it made to put made sure to put irreversible
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.320]   Progress and quotes
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.320]   I just made me laugh
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.960]   but but
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.960]   Yeah, it's an interesting the whole idea of like four processors on a chip is a little disturbing
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:59.600]   Well isn't is that they're just going to leapfrog right over the penny MD? I mean obviously this is a you know marketing
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:04.280]   Move they're not going to do to they'll do for why why do dual core when you could do for core?
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:10.720]   Interesting thought yeah 2006 AMD ships at specific of virtualization and Presidio security technology
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:15.640]   Is this aimed at workstations or is it it aimed at the servers is this desktop?
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:22.500]   This is more of the server end during the first quarter 2005 AMD captured 28% of the total market for four-way servers
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.360]   You'll see this dribble down to everything though consumer stuff soon enough
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:33.200]   Yeah, it's simply that it's cheaper to it's cheaper to build more cores than it is to keep shrinking the process at this current time
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:38.440]   It just strikes me as kind of capitulation from the chip manufacturers. They're saying yeah
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.800]   Well, we just really can't get our chips much faster or much more efficient
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.880]   So we'll just put more of them on a on a die. It's it's like it's a clue
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:49.760]   It's it's and I mean am I wrong or the benchmarks?
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:54.040]   They're not showing four times the they're good for servers because you're doing transactions
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:58.640]   Where you have lots of things happen simultaneously, but they're not great for desktop
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.000]   You know the Intel guys were saying over and over you know
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.440]   It's interesting is they were saying like the dual core the Intel guys were saying the dual core penny
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:10.500]   M's you know, you're gonna feel a difference as an end-user. It's like it's not very benchmarkable at this point
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.800]   Nobody's using everybody
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:17.000]   There's 42 different variations on benchmarks of people homemade benchmarks that people are using but he said that you know
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.200]   You'll notice a difference and I remember this guy
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:24.960]   I used to co-host a television program was a early dual processor system fanatic true
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:33.040]   I still was that it was lee it was me. I still have my dual penny in threes and that's why I know how crappy it is
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.480]   Where did you see you see you to sing the praises of dual processors systems? I think dual process
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.440]   I think do processors fine. It makes a lot of sense
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:47.440]   For a certain class of applications server applications
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.640]   We have it works where there's a lot of things happening simultaneously
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:56.640]   If what you want to do is burn 3d rendering if you've got a well-threaded program in a well-threaded OS
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:03.800]   Yes, but but is it doesn't really been it's not I would I I do think it's it's it's in a way saying yeah
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.880]   We just really couldn't make these processors any more efficient
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:12.360]   It really couldn't push the clock speed any farther than we have we have no other way to go and
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.280]   I just seems to me that
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.520]   It's it's a it's a way of the
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.000]   It's a marketing thing right I mean it's more of a marketing thing than I really it's all marketing stuff
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.800]   Would you rather they would you rather they accelerated to a you know a six gigahertz processor that was four percent faster than the four gigahertz
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:34.040]   No, you're right. You're right when you haven't seen much improvement. I'm still using a penny in four two point four gigahertz
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:39.880]   And it's fine thing. There's a reason there's a reason why Intel finally backed away from using you know the clock speed numbers
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:44.240]   Right, you know if Intel's backing away from using clock speed numbers there's two things going on there
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:49.040]   They're either so frustrated that AMD's you know got what close is it Robert?
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.680]   Is it 18% of the market that AMD has now Wow something like that sounds bright
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:58.760]   You know they're either so frustrated that that you know that they're either so frustrated that AMD has been able
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:05.280]   to to do their thing where they're more efficient processors which were getting dinged because they sounded slower because they had a
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.920]   slower clock speed even though they were doing the same amount of work right there either you know
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:14.760]   It's a two-fold thing they're getting away from that into you know if Intel is saying for years people buy based on the clock speed number
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.800]   People buy based on the clock speed number and if they're moving away from that
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:22.000]   It means you know they've gotten to the point where their clock speed number doesn't seem to be very useful
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.360]   I mean don't you feel as though that this is a good step though in the right direction
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.640]   I mean we have so many this is something that Apple did a long time ago with the g4's remember
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:34.760]   They couldn't really get the speed of performance that they wanted Apple did that because they were flatlined on their processors
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:41.000]   That's what's happened to in what's happening with Intel right now. Yes exactly exactly Intel's now in the same boat Apple was a year ago
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.280]   And and that's what I'm saying is it's kind of a way of saying yeah, you're right
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.280]   I mean we're not gonna get to four gigahertz
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.520]   More to the point
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:54.160]   I mean you've got Prescott which is really kind of a flop chip because their pipelines were too deep the branch prediction wasn't good enough
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:59.440]   And it generates a thousand watts the things like a little you know you could use as a hairdryer
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:04.080]   So I can attest to that. I just I just finished building a Prescott based system
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.400]   Did you did the weekend and it is an amazingly hot box and is it fast?
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.040]   I you know what I had the spare parts and I built it for a friend and it is it is fast
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.440]   But it is one of the you really have to be careful with the heatsink and yeah
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:21.560]   And use a good heatsink because there is a lot of heat coming off that it underload
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:26.400]   It's getting around 75 degrees Celsius. It's like what is that 160 degrees or something?
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:32.240]   I'm tempted to liquid cool it at this point. So that's under extreme load under your average condition
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:36.240]   It's down, you know 50 sub 50. All right, the dual core chips gonna be really hot
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:41.200]   Are they gonna be hotter too, but they wouldn't have theoretically you wouldn't have to run them as fast
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:45.360]   More than the same equivalent speed if you just have more of them and we're still dealing with you know
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:51.280]   We've had what two decades of OS's and hardware optimized for single thread single CPU use right?
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:57.240]   Yeah, I was just gonna say that with Intel and now AMD doing it. It seems like you know the application developers
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:01.400]   Are just gonna start writing for dual core in two or four way and it'll things will you know?
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.800]   You'll see certainly hope so remember. It's not the same as twice as fast
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:12.040]   I mean a processor that's twice as fast as faster than two processors because it depends on you being able to split things up
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:17.560]   Yeah, I mean if you have the choice between the two and the threading on the app if they have the choice
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:22.360]   I mean you'd want to have a faster processor as well. I mean are we are we not gonna have faster processors?
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:27.200]   Is that the end of the line? I think processors are gonna I think processors are definitely gonna get faster
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:27.560]   Oh, no
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:34.680]   What's the record now for switching transistors 600 gigahertz or six terahertz? Wow some crazy number like that
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.880]   And then the scientists are just coming up with the new single atom switching using quantum mechanics or the you know
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.880]   One spin so hopefully we'll have it, you know, that's another way they could reduce heat
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:48.640]   It's just you know, we're in that we're in that crazy transition time with new technologies coming up for multi-court
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:54.000]   We're being teased with you know the upcoming even game consoles now are becoming super computers in their own, right?
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:01.080]   Yeah, and Sony just announced they're gonna have the hard drive out on for the ps3 that will include a pre-install of Linux
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:06.360]   So who knows what you could do with that as well and like, you know, most wise people do at this point
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:11.400]   Isn't that interesting that they're actually putting Linux out for the ps3 is that a developer box?
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.960]   Well, they did a Linux for the ps2 when they when they unveiled the network adapter for the first time a couple years back
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:24.000]   That was part of their dev kit that included the hard drive as well because the hard drive actually attaches to the network adapter
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.080]   And that was preloaded with Linux as well
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.720]   So it was like the ps2 itself
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:31.400]   You go so they've done this before yeah, and this was a development environment was that the idea?
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.640]   But now when you have the power of the cell processor
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:38.160]   It wasn't so much a I never saw anybody develop using the Linux environment
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.720]   I was always curious to see what anybody did with it. It was more I think just to say it could be done
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.920]   Like oh, you know what we can compile that kernel to run on this hardware here you go
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:52.360]   It was to say to hackers hands off have you guys read the some of the articles in the PlayStation 3 Linux stuff?
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.640]   No, this is getting ps3 is a supercomputer
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.160]   He says but people won't recognize it as a computer unless we call it a computer
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:03.280]   So we're gonna run an OS on it in fact the cell could run multiple OS's in order to run the OS's we need a hard disk
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.240]   With order to declare that the ps3 is a computer. I think we'll have the hard disk pre-installed with Linux as a bonus
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.680]   Wow
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.840]   Mr. Kutigari I feel like we're in 19 we're kutaragi
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:17.600]   See me kutaragi who knows with enough storage that could be the do-it-all box
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:22.280]   You know with the right right inputs outputs any of those little new media boxes coming up can do that
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.400]   We just need the content we need high definition content damn it
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:30.040]   I just hope Apple doesn't look back at this and say gosh we should have really gone with a cell processor
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.960]   jeez
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.820]   Maybe maybe the PlayStation 3 is my next computer hey, it's a computer, you know
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:43.960]   I hear it's a computer with the cost of graphics cards. I can't believe how much you shelf our graphics card now
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   Do are they gonna have two ATI?
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:51.800]   Processors in that ps3 crossfire is it SLI? What are they doing? Oh, oh no?
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.080]   Well on the PC side
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.040]   They have their crossfire motherboards that they're showing off already in the chips
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:01.040]   That's the support two cards in the same system and it's SL I advantage that they have over Nvidia's
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.640]   SLI is that the cards don't have to be exactly matched and
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:09.240]   What else is there there is and I'm not gonna touch those for a long time
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.040]   Have you guys run in the same problems?
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:16.800]   I know we tried to do a couple demos on the show of the SL line. It was just buggy and certain games didn't work right?
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:21.960]   Well at its launch there were some issues. They're doing the same thing CPU guys
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.640]   You're doing they're throwing multiple processors of the problem must be the wave of the future
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:31.240]   Well graphics cards by their nature are highly parallel right right? It's a very different kind of environment
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:36.360]   Does the game have to be SLI compatible not necessarily so that so the BIOS handles the
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:43.600]   Threading there seems it seems to be two different ways that are better optimized for OpenGL and direct 3d gaming in terms of say
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.480]   Here are several ways you could think about splitting the screen
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.720]   You could either say the top half in the bottom half you could have interlaced lines
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:55.200]   You could throw a tile system over it and say you know what you do these this row of tiles you do the next row tiles
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:00.040]   There's all these different methods and some work better for different APIs than other and that's that again
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.800]   You're on the cutting edge if you're messing with any of this right now, and you're dealing with the growing pains
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.120]   So it is being worked out. I think
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:14.400]   ATI announced with their new system their crossfire technology. I believe it's called they have I think 12 SLI modes quote-unquote
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.960]   So you know until they get it figured out what works best work
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:25.160]   What doesn't if you're just riding that that bleeding edge and plus you you're probably using close to a thousand dollars for the
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.160]   graphics cards
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:32.440]   It's funny. I had a friend of mine asked me whether or not he should get an SLI system, and I couldn't recommend it
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:36.280]   I was just like now hold off you know wait another year wait until they get all this worked out
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:44.520]   Are you guys recommending any of these SLIs or no, you know what I say we're past that very first bleeding edge generation of motherboards that supported it
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.840]   So now there's I'd say a half a dozen good options out there
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.200]   So at least you at least didn't buy it right when it first took but right now
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:57.080]   You can only buy Nvidia's solution. That's mature enough that to recommend ATI's was just announced
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:02.200]   I don't believe you can actually buy anything right now regarding that and so you know if you want to live and die on the edge
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:06.200]   And you got the money to do it sure we're not really talking about frame rate improvements here
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:11.320]   We're talking about quality of the visuals right and that's where you see the biggest improvement both
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.200]   So so you can't have higher resolutions higher frame rate
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:22.080]   Yeah, you can either you know have 16x anti-aliasing 32x, you know an isotropic filtering or you could say take that up to 16
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:29.680]   By 12 or higher and you know where it's gonna become really important is when we have displays that are you know your your 40 50 inch home theater
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:37.280]   Display that'll do you know 19 20 by 1080 progressive. Yeah, you want to drive like a 3 megapixel display at 60 Hertz
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:40.480]   That's where you're gonna want you know right a beefy system
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:46.320]   But when we're talking resolutions, you know 12 by 9 and under you know matter or even up to say 16 by 12
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:53.520]   I like 16 by 12 for gaming with no AA on a 19 inch display. I think that's that's that's where I shoot for on my own gaming experience
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:58.040]   But I think we're getting a taste of this looking at h.264 and 1080p
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:02.960]   It really takes a lot of juice to play those things back without dropping frames
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.240]   I mean you have to have a pretty hefty system
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:11.360]   And so it's it's obvious that what we're going for these new these new video standards are gonna be very demanding
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:15.500]   Definitely and there is no 1080p format that well there is a 1080p format of course
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:20.760]   But nobody is actually recording much in that that you can buy sort of like the Windows Media 9 HD
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.160]   But you can do rendering in through 1080p and that's where you'll see it first
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:30.640]   Oh, that's the real-time gaming in 1080p is here and now and it it for that kind of resolution a
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:34.560]   There aren't that many displays well PC displays can do that resolution of course
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:40.280]   But actually getting a 1080p resolution into a home theater display right now is a bit of a challenge like for that
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:46.880]   Remember I was mentioning last week the sharp aqua so I have in the 45 inch aqua. It's a 1080p native LCD flat panel
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:51.840]   Beautiful beautiful display. I love it. The only thing is the only way to send it native
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:59.440]   The only way to send a native 1080p signal into that display is through the RF digital over the air RF connection
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:05.480]   You can't hook a dvi you can't do it through HDMI bandwidth too high for no actually dvi is specked up to
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:12.480]   Forget the person's name off top of head, but bless them for some of you good lengths last week for some good information
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:19.280]   But turns out the speckford dvi is rated up to 1080p the thing is is that transmitter and receiver hardware wasn't even manufactured
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:26.000]   until March of this year so and new and and yeah with those record with those receivers and transmitters now
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:33.160]   Being manufactured in more quantity. We're gonna start to see all the new displays coming forward. Hopefully support that through digital inputs
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:40.880]   Soon but for right now, it's it's really difficult to find a 1080p display that you can input 1080p into outside of the PC
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.700]   Style display so here's a hypothetical. I'd like to throw at you
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:48.800]   I think I've got a new sponsor on the radio show. They don't want to pay me cash
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:53.520]   They want to pay me 20 grand in trade for a home theater system. Who I don't want to have a huge
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:58.840]   Yeah, well, I don't know how far 20 grand will go. I don't want to have a huge honking display. Would you get the aqua bar?
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:06.880]   So far I like it a lot. You know what? It's the first display I've had in where boom it the industry standards for color in
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:11.720]   Television broadcast and things like that this TV just you can hit a couple of presets boom
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.960]   You are very close to industry standards just right out of the box
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.440]   And that's very very rare to find in displays nowadays
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:25.640]   So I know that when I'm playing my DVD or watching an HD TV broadcast the color is as intended by the people who created it
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:31.400]   I get a really and for that accuracy. Yeah, it's not bad, but I'm getting in two more displays this week
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:37.840]   I'm getting in pioneers new 50 inch plasma. I don't want to take a look at and that's uh that I find plasma is better for video
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:41.920]   Yeah, but if you plan on watching video last minute is hard to beat
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:48.880]   Yeah, I mean LCD's coming on but where LCD matches plasma at the the pricing level and the size level
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.720]   You're it's almost twice as much money. Right. Well, I don't mind
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:56.840]   I don't need a big I don't want a big honking screen. I just like you looking for 50 inches or no
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:01.820]   No, no, it could be smaller than that. I just want a nice screen. I want a 1080 42. Yeah, 42 is fine
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:05.480]   I just want 1080p is what I really want and a screen that you can see in the living room
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.280]   I mean so people can you know, I don't have to sit right next to it
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:14.920]   That's one nice advantage of LCD at least for that sharp in normal viewing light bright brightly lit rooms
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.080]   Oh my goodness. I think is awesome
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:21.400]   It actually I think it looks a little bit better because sometimes with most LCD technology
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:25.640]   You don't get the really really dark blacks and when if you're sitting in a dimly lit room
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:30.360]   But is the bride the bread or the ambient lighting becomes right the the by contrast
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.160]   Something looks gray on the screen. It'll get darker and darker looking
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:37.320]   So your eyes tend to see things darker the brighter it is within with the ambient lighting itself
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:43.160]   So for brightness. Yes for you know all the bells and whistles of a of a seven eight thousand dollar display
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:48.440]   It is I'm pretty impressed. I gotta say I'm writing up a good review of it. Yeah, Robert when I move back up there
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.440]   Can we do a movie night in your lab?
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:56.280]   That sounds great. I was currently the size of a closet. We're building out a new facility
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.400]   So as soon as that's done definitely movie night at my house
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:04.760]   It was either that or or get one of those super stable turntables, you know, that's got this special
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:11.480]   Liquid hydraulic balancing in there that was about 20 grand so I could either do that or a full home theater system
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:15.080]   I don't know. What do you think I'm buying a fifteen thousand dollar turntable
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:18.840]   You can
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:26.680]   You really can oh no. Yeah, I listened to I listened to an original like 1947 lui Armstrong lp on and like a
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:33.080]   $15,000 crazy looking turntable with probably like $40,000 for the speakers and at the home theater expo last year
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.160]   And that was just uh it sounds better
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.360]   But you know what I just in vinyl just sounds neat and
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:44.600]   It sounded it sounded as good as you could make that vinyl. It's pretty warm. It sounded perfect. Yeah. Oh, it was beautiful
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.680]   Meji cry
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.680]   But please
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:54.360]   I don't I don't need an $8,000 tweeter sitting in my my you know front param monitors
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:59.560]   A diamond we know this tweeter from a block of diamond. It's like great
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.760]   Yes, it sounds amazing
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.960]   I don't know. I'm having a hard time really thinking about getting a tv
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.400]   I just I mean it's been fine without a tv for this time and I you know
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:14.200]   I'm not sure I want to buy another tv it'd be nice to have a really good stereo
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:18.120]   Well, you know what it least hold off in the tv decision until the end of the year
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:21.320]   You think starting from this month till throughout the end of the year
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:26.040]   Right now is when the smallest of the new displays come out progressively or as it follows throughout the rest of the year
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:31.480]   You'll see larger and larger displays and by uh say october november the biggest of the new displays will be out
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:35.960]   And then prices fall accordingly. So that's good to know. Okay. So the end of the year
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:40.600]   This is the stuff we saw at seet yes at the beginning of the year and it is some of the best techniques
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.920]   The best display technology ever and it's now just starting to finally make it out into the market
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:51.960]   So i'm never in a hurry to buy anything when it comes to new displays, which is you know, i'm sure the manufacturers love hearing that commentary
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:57.240]   What's that cut off date for buying a new but we're really in the transition phase of the television right now
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:01.400]   And so it it would be good to put it off as long as you can definitely but for the
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:07.000]   A lot of people i know they're looking or they're looking for displays that are sub two grand and or they want something in that price range too
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.640]   And that's that's that's that's just challenging to find a good product in that category as it is
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:17.480]   Any category it's just the value stuff finding for people i find is probably the most challenging part of what i do
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:23.640]   Because but like i said this those uh 37 inch lcd's are coming up from then q and
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:29.000]   Westinghouse and they'll offer 1080p resolutions and they're going to be priced at around, you know
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:33.400]   99 and i'm really curious to see those those are starting to trickle out right now
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:39.080]   So patrick sent me a link is this a tech tv on this date photo blog? What is the deal on this patrick?
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:44.440]   Oh somebody it's a collection of stills from the site. Wow. This is awesome. Who put this together?
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.720]   I have no idea
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:52.200]   It's a lot of it's off of fatty maddies jib cab and then the and then the jib camp shots and the spy cam too. I see it
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:56.680]   With the url it's a text america photo blog text tv tech tv dash
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:04.200]   otd.textamerica.com it's tech tv on this date.textamerica.com and uh, it's kind of cool
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:07.800]   It's like you know what's going on what happened on this day in tech tv history
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:11.240]   It's kind of sad really i have a quick question
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:16.440]   What's so how how how long should i wait before buying a new uh a new television?
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:22.200]   Should i just wait till christmas season for the first of the year january of 2006 because then you'll see all the new displays
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:26.920]   They come out by christmas and you'll want those so bad that it'll put you off another six months
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:31.560]   See i need a i'm gonna have i need a tv in like july dude
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:37.000]   Okay, i hear you in time for the in time for the start of sport season so what what do we get?
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.520]   Uh, what size are you looking for? You know what kind of space do you have like in terms of do you need a flat panel or do you need a rear projection?
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:47.720]   Uh, i i still okay i'm still think crt's are the best deal for the money right now
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:54.440]   Especially for the right room i'm tempted to buy a projector because the place i'm moving to a lab space on a wall for a
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:50:00.200]   To use a projector i don't like the angle issues with with most of the projection rear projections i've seen
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.960]   Uh, i don't want to pay i want to keep it like under two thousand dollars
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:10.360]   You know i i reviewed a 32 inch lcd panel this week or last week that was uh pretty damn good
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:16.600]   Overall i had some definite issues but image quality and detail even in a brightly lit room was amazing and it was
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.560]   1099 $1,100 so
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:24.760]   I mean it was from a win book actually it had some significant it had some
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:29.960]   Very specific issues that i kind of railed it on but as as a display for hd content
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:33.560]   I was I was very impressed and you consider that price point though
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:37.720]   Oh, is that the one that had the shutter and the when it was doing the ntsc stuff?
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:38.920]   Uh
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:44.440]   This actually had a stretching problem or scaling issue when it came to standard definition content
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:50.200]   But it you know if that really really bothers you that would that i think would be a major turn off for getting that particular display
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:55.160]   But for hd content it was spot on for most component and dvi based content
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:59.080]   It was spot on and the detail i found it was just phenomenal
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:04.200]   But again that price at 1100 bucks say you're really good crt based tv's you know
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:10.840]   We're gonna weigh about 100 pounds more a couple hundred pounds more and they're right about that same size for not much
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.720]   You're not gonna save a whole lot less by going crt at that point
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:20.040]   So if it's we're really getting to that interesting time where flat panels are gonna really i think of of one technology or another take over
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:25.160]   The crt finally in rear projection technologies. It's just uh, they're too big and not sexy enough
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.720]   You are not sexy enough you must leave now
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:35.000]   You know what though the when i left ces at the beginning of the year i was still convinced that crt's in the in the 30 inch range
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.240]   30 to say 36 at the max i guess
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:41.000]   Were your best value in hd tv because you get them for around 800 bucks or so
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:48.040]   But now that we're seeing lcd's of increasingly better quality and improved quality coming in at prices under a thousand now or right around a thousand
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:53.960]   Dollars, yeah, I just don't see it being very much longer before a flat panel technology of some kind will satisfy you
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:58.840]   At a price you can afford and you know within a few years that'll just mean bigger and better for everyone but
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:06.600]   Years down the road, right? But if like I pointed out what was it that toshiba that toshiba crt was awesome. I don't know what the hell i'm saying anymore
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.480]   I'm drawing out i'm parched
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:13.320]   It's a head cold. Hey, what is this what is this about my cold medicine?
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:19.400]   What is this about dvd decrypted what did it go out of business? What happened the website's down right they got a cesan desist
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:25.640]   You're kidding. Yeah, they did. I want to know who it was they gave him the cesan desist because it just sounded like a okay?
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:29.240]   We're done. We're really done this time. It's like three two one studios. They're gone
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:33.480]   I think they gave it to the wrong guys though. Did you guys i never used decrypted i was always a shrink guy
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:38.760]   What about dvd shrink now that's and they were based out of the uk that's still there i downloaded it today
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.560]   And that's free right oh yeah, so was that the problem was that dvd decrypted was a company?
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:49.080]   They were what was it a lightning uk? I mean he was you try to do the shrink and let's see
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:54.040]   Basically, they were given the cesan desist and anyone hosting the file was told to take it down
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:59.400]   And the person who was the author of the application said that you know what they don't have the time or the resources
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:03.640]   Resources are the big one to put up any kind of defense against this so yeah the cd free
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:12.280]   He the cd freaks posted a letter he wrote he's like if if uh, you know three two one studios can do can't do with millions
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:14.360]   What am i gonna you know what chance i have to fight?
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:23.000]   Although the the rumor is that uh the rumor is that sony served him the notice
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:29.640]   Cause and the slash tide is the best quote as it is rumored that he broke their new copyright protection within 72 hours
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:34.280]   That was my favorite thing about that app didn't matter what dvd had old if you could just
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:37.160]   Strip it get it on your hard drive and you don't have to worry about
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:43.960]   Region codes or you know do I need the disc or am i gonna scratch the disc sure can be a pirate tool everything can be a pirate tool
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:46.600]   Is this the part where we remind our listeners that this is a
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.680]   Violating
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:53.240]   Copy protection is a violation of the dmca very use though for personal backup
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:57.400]   You know what's sad is that canada which is up to now and not had that
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:01.720]   Copy right rule that you can't reverse engineer encryption is about to pass
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:07.320]   A law next week that will make it the same and you know where this all comes from is is uh,
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:13.960]   WIPO the world intellectual property organization, which is a united nations a united nations group
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:21.000]   And wipo essentially is setting the patent and trademark law for the world and encouraging all
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.920]   Nations to go along with I was talking to cori doctor. Oh this week
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.600]   He's a you know, we always used to have money from the electronic frontier foundation
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:33.160]   He actually is is an observer at wipo at the united nations
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:39.320]   He says the problem with wipo is even though it was a un chartered organization and their charter was
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.240]   to promote
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.000]   uh, you know the sharing of
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:50.520]   Of information it was pretty much controlled by intellectual property companies like the motion picture association of america
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:54.200]   They're supposed to be non-governmental organizations ngos nonprofits
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:58.520]   But it's the mpaa and the ria a that's on wipo and they got their agenda pushed forward
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:03.080]   Which was you can't backward, you know, you can't reverse engineer copy protection
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:07.480]   So now canada is going along for the right? It's really sad. I think it's uh because there is a fair you
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:12.360]   There's a legitimate fair use purpose to making backup copies of your dvd's totally
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:17.960]   I don't think roberts pirating dvd's to sell them on the streets. He wants to make backup copies
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:22.520]   See i don't think it's it's not selling it on the streets that they care about so much is you know
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:26.920]   Bit torrent and peer-to-peer but you're not doing that robert are you no no never
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:32.360]   Robert isn't and if he was he never admitted i wouldn't do that period. It's just it
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:36.680]   I'm a quality whore. It's like i have to have things in pristine quality
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:41.800]   And i'm not gonna put up with any shaky camcrap nor am i gonna give away something i paid good money for
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:47.640]   You know i i buy seasons of of shows i like because i like having it in that good quality
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.640]   That's commercial free it happens to be as well
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:55.480]   It's another reason i like watching dvd's and there are good legitimate reasons to make backups that yes one
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:59.880]   Sometimes i run into region code problems where i get a disc from overseas and i want to watch it and
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.120]   I either have to give up on my pc
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:07.320]   I have to change the drive where you only get five times you can do this before the drive becomes
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:10.760]   Unchangeable again or i have to use some piece of software to get around a region code
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:15.320]   Or i want to watch it say on my psp or i want to watch it on a portable format
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:21.880]   Or i simply don't want to have the disc with me hollywood and the in the in the people who own the content give me a no other
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:25.160]   Option and i'm i'm tech savvy enough to be able to get around that and
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:28.520]   You know i don't think twice about it personally and you're not alone
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:32.280]   There's a lot of other people like you yeah, but there's also a lot of people that are
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:37.480]   It's like if they gave it to me at a fair price i can't even buy the original star wars anymore
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:42.120]   Yeah, so how is it stealing if they're not even selling it i yeah, but leo you're saying you know
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:46.200]   We're the well-behaved people that are disciplined and only back up copies for our own use
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:52.760]   You're not the people that try me you get regulated by default, but you know i mean how many how many millions of people i mean
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:57:00.760]   Look there's no way to there's no way to establish the relationship between you know file trading and piracy and lost sales
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:05.640]   Right however, you know i you know how many people you know and you can get into the whole well
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:10.440]   I'm just sampling i buy a cd if i like it, but if you think about it, there's an entire generation
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.640]   You know of teenagers that look at you like you're on crack
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:19.560]   If you talk about buying music, you know because they download it all i mean it's it's going to be interesting to see
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.960]   You know is there are there legitimate issues yet?
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:29.720]   You know do i think broadcast you know television going after people for for doing file trading on broadcast episodes is kind of ridiculous
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:33.400]   Yeah, you know do i understand why cable companies are wigging out
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:40.280]   You know hbo or somebody would they be upset if deadwoods being traded online i can see why they'd be upset because they want to sell the dvd
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:45.560]   Box set well the music industry got smacked with it first and that drove them to immediately start well
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:51.720]   At least nowadays you can for a fairly low price buy music online and it's an increasingly competitive
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.920]   Space as well, which i think is going to be good for everyone and i
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:58:02.280]   I hope that hope that is over the video the online music sales most of it stinks most of the online music sales horrible
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:06.680]   But i mean is the selection bad rights the access the qualities atrocious compared to a cv
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:12.200]   You know we get around that though too pat and i mean i've been using uh him to decrypt all of the music that i buy
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:17.320]   Just so that i can you know do what i want with it yep i do too i just hit j him but if the quality is not there
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:22.680]   Yeah, i'm using the higher quality i bought i've bought eight or nine hundred songs on the itunes music store
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:26.280]   It's not like i'm not giving them my money believe me they're getting my money
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:31.720]   But i don't want any copy protection on it so i j him at all right, you know say isn't j him amazing
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:36.520]   It's a great little app now by the way there is no guarantee that once we've j him this stuff
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:43.240]   Apple won't make some change to their drm that makes it all unusable and and frankly i know it's ripped it all out though
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:47.880]   Right, it's just it's just a uh, what is it a mp or mp right now?
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:51.000]   It's a completely i mean you can never tell that it was ever there to be em
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.840]   That's not true because we don't know exactly what stuff apple's putting in there
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.800]   So there could be other things that aren't being stripped out
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:04.040]   The only really safe thing to do at this point would be to convert it to an mp3 and then you wouldn't and which by the way j him will do
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:08.440]   Automatically and then you're safe because it's no longer an aac of any stripe, you know
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.440]   Yeah, i'm not too worried about it
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:14.520]   I'm just gonna keep it you can always bet you know the j him does a backup before you have you seen that where it can
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:19.080]   Write it to a different directory you can take it off side if you want the safe thing to do is make a backup copy of the original
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:24.920]   Unmodified aac so that you if apple does flip a switch you can get back to where you were
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.440]   I love how you can deauthorize without actually deauthorizing have you seen that?
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:34.360]   Well, this is you know i started using j him and one of the things that scare me a little bit is uh, you know
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:39.320]   In order for it to decrypt you have to get the keys in order to get the keys you have to authorize a computer
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:45.320]   Right so instead of actually authorizing your real and computer it makes up a fake guid that's random
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:51.400]   You authorize that guid and then it's an additional computer and you can you know get the keys
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.880]   The problem is you know
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:58.760]   You can either do it temporarily or a long term all of a sudden you've authorized five systems
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:05.400]   You know instantly and and they even warn you don't do this a lot because it might track attention from apple
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.640]   That you're authorizing deauthorizing authorizing
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:11.480]   So i think it's one of those things you want to you want to do
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:18.840]   Once and then you know decrypt everything at once and get it done with because and then and then by the way unauthorize because you've got a
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:25.480]   Bogus computer that's authorized. It's fun. It really works great. I think it's a great solution the man trying to keep us down
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:27.880]   Mr. LaPorte
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.880]   Mr. LaPorte
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:33.640]   Again, i'm not selling this i'm not trading it. I'm not paying
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:37.000]   Steve jobs. It's just because I want to put it you know why i'm doing it
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.560]   I want to put it on that file server that piece of crap boss
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.560]   And I don't want any copy protection on it because and and that's all
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.640]   That's the only reason
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.720]   Leo went to prison for our sins
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:56.760]   I'd like to be a martyr. I want to see some free leo t-shirts. I'll print the free leo bumper stickers
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.880]   Oh
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.960]   Gentlemen, i'm gonna be late for dinner time to wrap up this piece of clip
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.080]   Back in the web
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:12.760]   Hey, i'm gonna go play the new battlefield to demo. Oh, yeah, what are you gonna? Hey just remember something my wife
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:16.600]   You
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.280]   What are you going off to do?
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:23.480]   Uh, i'm tracking though. I just launched a new version of system by the way. Oh, yeah, let's let's give it a little plug
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:29.800]   What are you doing on this one? Yeah, s y s tm. Dot org. Yeah, it's uh, this one is uh, how to create myth tv box
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:35.160]   So we start from scratch show you the about the different cards that you can purchase and then walk you all the way through
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:41.000]   Uh, how to set up your own, uh open source pvr. This is the system even john c de vorac liked yay
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   Yeah, I saw that that was crazy does myth work with a dtv card as well
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:51.240]   So you can pull in digital broadcast like even hd stuff. Yeah, i've actually there's a card from a pc hd tv called the hd
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:56.040]   3000, uh, it's a lemmest base card it works great with, uh, uh, high def content nice
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.640]   Yeah, it's pretty cool. It's a nice box
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:02.520]   I mean it does so many so much more than just capture video that how actually has a bunch of different add-ins
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:07.080]   You can do rss readers your uh, you can play main games from within myth
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:13.080]   It's it's a very cool open source and you don't have to pay the the monthly subscription fee like you would at tvo or replay tv
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:18.280]   Which is also really nice that is cool and you were able to get it running pretty reliably because I know that
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.440]   Was always a problem in the past. We never really was able to get any of this stuff to work reliably
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:28.360]   Yeah, you know, it was actually really hard to set up initially, but there's a great distribution of uh, nopics called konop myth
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:34.600]   That does it all for you. That's me and uh, you run that you install it formats the hard drive it installs everything you need
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:39.480]   It has all the you know, you don't have to go and download additional packages or anything and uh, you just configure it
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.760]   It's good to go perfect use for nopics. You know, my favorite nopics
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:47.080]   Distro is is the nopics maim that will turn any machine into an arcade machine
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.840]   You can add all the way it doesn't come with any ROMs
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:53.560]   But you can easily rebuild the iso to have all the ROMs and then all you do is you go around any pc
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.760]   You put it in your boot and you've got you've got this massive arcade machine
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:01.960]   That's awesome didn't roger Chang build that set top two player look like a set top arcade machine
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:06.360]   Yeah, it wasn't that cool our tabletop arcade machine. Excuse me. Yeah, well the our table
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:10.360]   Minds me like those old tron or miss pacman tabletop versions
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.960]   So great. Oh you take like a box case cabinet like that with the maim system
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:16.040]   That'd be just oh that'd be heaven. That was a kit
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:20.200]   I'd like to set something like that up if you make it look really good. I wonder what happened to that
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.960]   I mean probably still has it. Do you think he has it?
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:27.240]   Sure, I hope he I hope he can't i thought I went home with them. It was really cool. It certainly hopes so too
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.520]   Uh, so there's the plug any other plugs anybody else wants to do
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.960]   Hey, go to extreme ipod.com and uh send this your ipod picture get a chance to win

[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:44.120]   Which has like the entire huge and not the entire huge chunk of the epitaph catalog
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:47.720]   If you're into the whole punk rock thing they've got an access on there a bunch of other good stuff
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.320]   But send us your
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.960]   Strange and you have to do a new up. It's another poll soon
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:52.520]   I know well
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:57.240]   I haven't had access to the poll because that every time i've gone on the system has been throttled down
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:03.000]   Too many people visiting our damn site. Uh, i haven't been able to all right. I'm gonna be in there. It's all for you
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.080]   Yeah, comments have been shut off for a while
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.520]   Yeah, that's the throttling because as soon as we get more than i increased the number
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.160]   Uh, you know it has to be like 2 000 people or something on the site
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:16.600]   This is simultaneously and you know if anything more than that it really does bog so
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:21.240]   I don't know what i'm gonna do. I'm moving it. I've moved it to a new server. Maybe that'll help
