[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   [Music]
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   It's time for TWiT, the show that covers tech news, and I'm back. I want to thank very heartily, very heartily, both Tom Merritt and John C. Dvorak, who filled in while I was gone in China.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And just say that I am exhausted. You're going to hear a very jet-lagged Leo Laporte, but it won't just be me that's jet-lagged, because also joining us today on the show, Mr. Kevin Rhodes.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Mr. Kevin Rhodes, who is also, when did you get back, Kevin?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Two days ago, but I am also jet-lagged and waking up at three in the morning ready to sprint for some reason.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Yeah, me too.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   It's the weirdest thing.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Me too. Two o'clock in the morning. I'm going, okay, well, because it's daytime.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Yeah. And you're like, you feel like you want to go outside and run. And then like an hour later, boom, you're back in bed again. It's the strangest thing.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Also with us from the Houston Chronicle and always welcome regular on the show, Dwight Silverman. Good to have you, Dwight.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Thanks. Nice for you to have me, Mr. President.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I am the president. During my absence, without any intervention on my part, I apparently was elected the president of the internet by, was it Tech Republic that did that?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Yes. Yes. I was surprised it wasn't moot in the end, because you know, the four-channers swarmed those things.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Yeah, no, they didn't know about it. Otherwise it would have been moot.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   So Mollywood came on strong towards the end, but I, you know, it's because ironic because I'm in China and I can't even get online.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   The site was blocked.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   You know, it's interesting that you didn't bring a laptop, did you, Kevin?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   No, I did not. Just the iPhone with data plan.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   You did a very different thing. I did the tourist thing. I went to Beijing and Xi'an and I went to Guilin. You went on a tea tour.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Yeah, I was in Beijing for a couple days, but then I flew into Kunming and then was out for a week and a half traveling around the Yunnan province.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   First of all, Beijing. Could you believe that city?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Insane. You looked, you were like driving around and it was so modern and beautiful and Lamborghini dealerships and just, I can't believe how it just, it seems like you're in Los Angeles or something.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I fully expected a bunch of people in Mao coats and Mao hats on bicycles jamming the street.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And no, this is exactly like LA or maybe even more vital.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   You know, we stayed on Chang'an, which is the main drag, just a couple of blocks from Tiananmen Square and went around the corner and it's hopping.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I feel like we're in Times Square on a Friday night.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Big and big screens, a little Blade Runner-ish because they're big screen ads everywhere, gigantic screens. McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   But right across the street from McDonald's, there's a booth with a guy selling deep fat fried scorpions.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Right.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   It's a wild country.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   It is.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And a country on the move. I really, really enjoyed it.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I imagine you did. You were with farmers though. You were really in the countryside.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Yeah, I mean we were in kind of the rainforest area, just out in the middle of nowhere, about two days away from any major airport and just going around and kind of decompressing and meeting with different people that are creating different types of tea and going to tea factories and tasting tea and just relaxing.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Did you have a translator with you? How'd you?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Yeah, yeah, we had a translator with us.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   So I was also with Tim Ferriss, who also speaks Chinese, so that made it, or Mandarin, so that made it easy.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Oh, that really, that helps a lot. Yeah.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Wow, that's neat. What fun.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   It was fun. We both had a good time. It's great.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   So had I known you were going to be out there, we would have met up.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   No, you were very far away. I mean, it's like being in California and New York.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I mean, it's a big...
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I'm wondering if we were in Beijing at the same time.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   We might have been.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I was in Beijing July 4th, 5th, and 6th and 7th.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Ah, I would think I was there the 5th.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Oh man, that would have been so funny. I kept looking for you.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I kept thinking, I wonder if Kevin's going to come around a corner and I'll jump out of my seat.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   That would have been so strange.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   It was an amazing experience.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   But yeah, talking about censorship, when we got there, you couldn't get to YouTube.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Right.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   By the time we left, because I think of the Uyghur uprising, they had blocked Twitter, FriendFeed, Facebook as well.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And I don't know if you probably didn't see any TV, but CNN, if a story that they didn't like came on, they just black it out.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   You know what the craziest thing was? My friend Tim had his laptop with him.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   So he would turn it on every once in a while.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And I had my iPhone with the data plan.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   So I would jump on the iPhone and I could pull up my Twitter feed and access it just fine.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   But if I went to his laptop, because it was using HTTP and it wasn't using the API, I couldn't get to Twitter.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   So I could still access Twitter and Facebook through the API calls on my phone.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   It was just the normal web service that they were blocking.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   They figured it out eventually because they stopped working on the phone as well.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Oh, did it?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Yeah, that was strange. It was the weirdest thing because I was sitting there pulling it up and he was unable to get to it.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Well, in a way, it's a real pat on the back for FriendFeed that they even heard of FriendFeed.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I was still able to post a video to Twitter using a brand new service.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   It takes them a while to figure out.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   There was a service called Twittreal that lets you post videos.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   I was able to post that way.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And then I was using Posterous to post to YouTube.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   So I would email a video to Posterous and it would cross post.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   They couldn't block that.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   And that just shows you how impossible it was.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   We saw this in Iran. You can't block this stuff.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Well, you know what's funny is I sent out a…
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   On our last day there, we did a little tweet meetup.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And so I sent out a message saying, "Hey, if anyone's in Beijing, come out and meet with us."
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And 15 people showed up, yet Twitter was being blocked.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And we asked them, "How did you find out about this?"
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   And they're like, "Oh, you just have to know what you're doing."
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   The geeks know.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   The geeks totally know how to do it.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   These guys are like, "Oh, we just use proxies and yeah, it's not a big deal."
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   My sense, I'm curious if this is your sense.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And we'll talk about the news in just a bit, Dwight.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Don't worry.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Dwight's been the keeper of the news all this week because we haven't paid any attention.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   I've been holding down the fort.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   There's quite a bit of news we're going to talk about.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   But this is newsworthy too.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   My sense of it was that the vast majority of the Chinese populace doesn't really care.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   As long as they're on an economic upturn, which they seem to be despite the world global meltdown,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   as long as everything's going fine, they don't care that they're not seeing that CNN story or missing Twitter or Facebook.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   I don't think they even know though because we asked our translator whether he was aware of blocking.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   He's like, "Well, I know they block pornography."
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Then there was a few other people on the tour that we asked about it.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   They're like, "Yeah, well, there's just bad sites that they block."
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   I'm like, "Well, actually there's normal sites that they block too."
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   They didn't seem to know or really care, which was weird to me.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Well, I think also the guides.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   I talked to one of our guides about drug use and she said, "What do you mean?"
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I said, "Marijuana." She said, "I never heard of marijuana."
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   There's a certain amount of, especially from the guides, intentional misrepresentation.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   However, I think that it's very, and I have to draw it parallel to the American public too.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   That's not just Chinese public.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   As long as everything's going fine, they don't know who can get out.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   So what? Big deal.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I got a car. I got a microwave.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I'm fat and happy. I don't care if I can't get to Twitter.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   The truth is it doesn't really make that much difference in terms of-
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   It doesn't matter. The geeks know how to get to it anyway.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   We would have no problem there, Leo. I think it's all our favorite sites.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Exactly.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   But you'd be state criminals.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Well, that's the other thing.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I have to say I love China.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It's amazing what a economic tiger they are.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Some say a paper tiger, but that's a conversation for another time.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   It is a little scary when you think of the control that these hidden-
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   I mean, these guys are basically hidden.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   It's not like the Mao cult where there's pictures of them everywhere.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   I mean, Jiang Jemin, people know who he is, but you don't get the sense of them being important in day-to-day life, the fact that they're doing all this.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I wonder if 4chan is blocked in China.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   I bet it is.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Dvorak is, by the way, dvorak.org/blog blocked.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Did you all see the pollution that's supposed to be so bad there?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Was it really as bad as-
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Horrible. It's horrendous.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   In Beijing, you can't see five feet.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Yeah. In Beijing, the day that I was there, it was 100 to 150 yards max, and then everything just disappears.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   I've been told 400,000 people a year die of pollution-related illnesses, chiefly lung disease. 400,000 a year.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Yeah, we were trying to fly from Kunming into Beijing, and they actually delayed our flight by six hours because they said there's certain pollution restrictions, and they only allow so many planes in per day, and they'd already reached that level of pollution, and so they had to hold off and delay our flight. It was crazy.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   So, I have a little story to tell about AT&T. Did you see MG Sigler's article in TechCrunch? How did he put it? AT&T, a steaming-
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Big steaming pile of fail.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   AT&T, I bought the 100 megabyte international roaming data plan for $110, something like that, knowing that I was going to be doing a lot of blogging and posting and so forth. I watched carefully my usage meter on the iPhone because it's five bucks a megabyte if you go over.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   And I got to 100.1 megabytes, and I turned off 3G and turned off roaming. In fact, I'm looking at my usage right now, and even since I've come home, it's only gone to like 103 megabytes. Call AT&T when I get back, they said, "Yeah, it went to 251."
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   The phone was off by 250%, and I have a $750 bill, and I don't understand how come the phone, they even tell you to use the phone to watch your usage.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   So, I have to, I'm with MG Sigler on this one.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Not so happy.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   That's strange.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Not so happy. You didn't use it much. You weren't posting or anything.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   I did. I did post some stuff. I was mostly-
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Did you buy an international data plan?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   I don't know. I didn't set that up. Somebody else set that up for me.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I'm sure they did. Because that's a very expensive other one.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   We have, the cell phone's all covered through work, so they set up all the plans. I'm sure they did, yeah. It's probably smart for them to do.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   All right. Let's get to our tech stories. We've got a lot of them. Some big stories while you and I were gone.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   I'm sure we covered this last week, Google's new operating system, which got a lot of press for reasons I'm not fully clear about.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   That was one big story. Microsoft tried to counter with Office 2010, another big story.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Then business, the quarterly results are starting to come out for the tech industry and a grim outlook there.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Before we do all of that, I do want to mention our friends at Squarespace. I know you use Squarespace, Kevin, for your blog.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   I do indeed.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   I'm just blown away by these guys. They're very smart. They know what they're doing. We have a special deal. I think you do also on Dignation.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   If you go to squarespace.com/twit, you can get, well, you can sign up and use it for free without a credit card anyway.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   But then if you decide to stick around 10% off when you use the coupon code TWIT.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   How long have you been using Squarespace?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Probably about two years now.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   What?
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Something like that.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   You've known about them that long?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   They approached us a long time ago and the funny thing about it is like you do on your show, we get a lot of sponsors that come in for an episode or two and then leave.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   The Squarespace guys came in and they said, "We want to show you the product we're working on."
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   They didn't want us just to be reading copy. They actually wanted to show us their service.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I was impressed.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   They sat us down and they showed us what they had built and it was cool stuff.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   I had a few of my stories get on dig and some of the other sites and it didn't fall over.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   I was pretty happy with that.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   You're a good test for that.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   They were happy to have me test it out.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   I think they were a little worried the first time but they didn't have any problems.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   They do this interesting kind of virtual server stuff that lets them turn on bandwidth kind of at will.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   It's all done with Java and very slick because you're not on a single server.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   You're shared across the Squarespace kind of cloud and if they need more bandwidth they just respond instantly with it.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   So it's really good for that kind of thing.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   If you are an existing blogger, it includes complete import and export for WordPress, Blogger, Movable Type and Type Pad.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Now when I say import and export, that's important.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   I don't want you to feel like you're in a Roach Motel. You can't get out.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   So you can get your stuff in there. Play with it. Amazing.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Did you do your design or did they do one for you?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   I did my own design.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Isn't it cool how you can drag and drop stuff?
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   You should see what they have coming. Have you seen their new stuff?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   No.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Well, they have something coming really soon that's going to be pretty awesome. It sounds like I'm saying an ad, but I'm not.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   I was actually in New York a couple weeks ago and they showed me some of the stuff that they were working on.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Dane and Anthony are really cool. Really neat guys. Just impressive as heck.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Well, I mean that's the ad. We don't have to say much more.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   You can try it out by going to squarespace.com/twit.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Give it a try. Not just for blogs. They've got forums. They've got photo galleries.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Amber's significant other, Chris Dick, uses it for... he's a photographer, brilliant photographer, uses it for photo gallery. It is gorgeous.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Google Maps built in. Amazing stats package and website tracking.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   You're just going to love it. Squarespace.com/twit for a 10% off your new account.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   As well use the Twit coupon code. And we thank them so much for supporting this week in tech.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Well, I am the president of the internet. So I don't know. Do I get any? I don't think I get anything.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   I should point out that had you been nominated, Kevin Rose, it wouldn't even have been close.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Should we be in your cabinet? Can I be vice president?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Yeah. What do you want?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   I don't know. Something fun.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   You don't want to be in the state department. You don't want to be secretary of state Hillary Clinton right now.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   The US Department of State is not allowed to use Firefox. They have to use Internet Explorer 6.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   We had a town hall meeting on Friday and Jim Finkel, one of the state department, just some guy, a worker bee, says,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   "Can you please let the staff use an alternative browser called Firefox?"
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   I love that they asked her about open source software.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   What did she say?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Well, she didn't answer it. She deferred it to somebody else who initially said, "Oh, there's a cost issue with using Firefox."
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   At which point somebody pointed out, "Well, you know, it's free."
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Well, there is a cost issue anytime a corporation or business has to put in a new software.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   It's a change like that. There's this training and that type of thing.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   It's cost millions. But the truth is, IE is such a piece of crap.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   There's a very simple solution to this.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   What's that?
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   You just basically say, if you're smart enough to know how to install Firefox and use it, then you do so. Everyone else uses IE.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   You know they're not going to do that.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   In fact, with all of the break-ins and so forth and the security issues in the government, you know those machines.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   I hope those machines in the State Department are locked down.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Man, on the cruise ship, they basically had no internet.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   There were six Windows machines that had...
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   I don't even know what version of Windows because it had an application running.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   I thought, "Oh, good. There's a memory card slot on it."
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   But all you could do is put your card in there and for whatever, 30 bucks, send a postcard to somebody with a picture you pulled off the card.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   You couldn't read or write. I wish you'd been there, Kevin. Maybe you could have hacked into the darn thing.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   I couldn't get any internet access at all.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Do they not have wireless there?
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   No, this is the crappiest shit.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Who did you go with? Don't say Carnival.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   No, it was worse than Carnival. There's actually a step down from Carnival.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   What? Like, Festival?
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   It's like Festival.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   I was on the Costa Krapaka, I think was the name of it.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   It was the worst cruise ship ever.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Did you say CostCo?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   CostCo. Might as well have been.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Anyway, if you want... But it kept me off the internet, which was a little bit of a problem because I had four lectures to give about social media and iPhone apps and stuff.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   No internet access kind of hampered those, but that's all right.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Anyway, what was I saying? Oh, locked down. I'm sure the State Department is pretty locked down.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Well, the guy that asked the question actually had come from a security agency where they were letting them use Firefox.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   So he had the argument that if we can use it over at the NSA or wherever it was, we should be able to use it here.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Wow. Well, I hope they get their Firefox.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Actually, wasn't there a big hole in Firefox 3.5?
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Yeah, they released 3.5.1 this week and patched it.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Originally, it was going to come out about a week later, but they rushed it out because of this flaw.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   It also fixed a problem where if you're on a slower Windows machine, when it started up, it would sometimes take minutes for Firefox 3.5 to come up because it was scanning...
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   In order to do some kind of randomization, it was scanning temporary folders.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Using it as random data or something.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   So on Windows, it was taking a while and they fixed that as well.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   But I also saw another story just today that said that in 3.5.1, there's another vulnerability and the exploit code has been released for it.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Already? Yes.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   All zero-day stuff. Microsoft has a zero-day exploit too.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   It was patched Tuesday, last Tuesday. Microsoft pushed out nine patches, but just to keep the hackers busy, left one open.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Why not?
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   I always leave one on the table.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Six of the nine were ranked critical. Three were tagged as important.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   The kill bit turned on for the ActiveX control, the DirectX show fix.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   But one is still open to exploit. So you figure out which one hackers. All you hacker kitties.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Are you a Safari user, Kevin, or do you use Firefox?
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   You know, I'm balancing back in between Chrome and Firefox.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Chrome on the Windows side.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   On Mac.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   It's the Chromium beta.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Is that stable? Google hasn't released Chrome yet for the Mac, but the source code is open.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   He's done a compilation of it, I guess.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   No, this is directly from Google.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   It's from Google? Chromium?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   It's Google Chrome. It's just their beta version of it.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   They're doing nightly builds and you can go in and dive in. I did a blog post on this. You can go and dive in and grab the nightly builds.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Some of them are going to be more stable than others, but I think, Kevin, if you download the beta, doesn't it refresh from the nightly builds every few days?
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   It didn't. You know, I was always doing the check for update and I was having to go in and manually download it to get the latest build.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   But if you type in Google Chrome Mac, it's the first link. No, actually it's not the first link because the first link is saying put in your email address.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   It's the second link under Google Chrome Mac, which takes you directly to what they're calling the developer release.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   And you like it better than Safari or better than Firefox?
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   It's just really fast and snappy. I don't know. I'm just playing around with it because I want to stay up with all the kids are playing with nowadays.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Well, it doesn't have bookmarks.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   How does it feel not to be one of the kids anymore?
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   I know. It's weird. I'm not in the loop anymore. It's killing me.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Oh, those kids don't know anything.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   It doesn't have bookmark management, so you can't pull up like a screen and manage your bookmarks. You can bookmark things. It can't print.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   There's a lot of things that it can't do yet, but it's really fast.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Yeah, Flash doesn't work.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   I've been pretty happy with Safari. Safari 402 now. They've done a couple of updates to some pretty nasty bugs on Safari.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   But I just use Firefox because of all the add-ons, the extensions that I'm dependent on. I just can't leave them behind.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   And 3.5 at first was very fast, but it does feel a little bit sluggish now. And that's on Mac. I don't know why. Chrome is so snappy.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   It is.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   I think they did a hack on the Mac too. It's weird. I've never seen the Chrome dock icon bounce one time. It's strange. I'm serious.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   It's the appearance of speed.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Yeah, launch it and tell me if it bounces. I've never seen this happen.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   It didn't bounce. No bounce.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Isn't that weird? I haven't tried to trick it. I launched like five other things and then clicked Chrome last. I'm like, "Okay, give me one bounce." And it didn't bounce. I think it's a little hack.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   This is good. This is like an ad for Chrome. So I'm sure they covered it last week, but what do you think about this Google OS? It was getting a lot of press.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   It's not even a screenshot, right?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   It's Linux. In fact, this is what Bill Gates says. He says, "Well, what's the big deal?" It's a Linux distro, basically.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   I saw somebody joking on Twitter that they created a prototype for it. They ran Ubuntu, deleted everything off the desktop, but Firefox and now they have Chrome OS.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   That's it.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   It'll be a quick start, although there are other quick start versions of Linux out there.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Gates says, "In some ways, I'm surprised people are acting like there's something new. I mean, you've got Android running on netbooks. It's got a browser in it."
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   He says, "The more vague Google is, the more interesting it is."
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   That's Google's secret for their PR.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   They got Apple quality PR on this.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Yes. It was weird because this was, as Kevin said, there's no screenshots. There's no detailed description of how it would work other than that it's a Linux kernel with a browser.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   The description sounds a lot like what Michael Arrington was describing for whatever operating system he wants to use for the Crunchpad.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   It's all vapor. It's total vaporware. The tech press went crazy with it.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   People don't know what it means and how important it is. You don't know how important it is. You don't know what it means because you ain't seen it yet.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   It's not going to be out until next year, right?
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Yes, late 2010.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Late 2010?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Hey, you just said it. We could do a distro tomorrow. Just strip down a little Ubuntu. There's a lot of choices out there.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   In one respect, though, this is sort of a coming of age for Linux because Linux now is running in a lot more platforms. It's the Google. I mean, the Palm Pre is Linux.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Android is Linux.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   We're seeing more and more Linux in a lot of different forms in a way, too, that users don't really even know they're using Linux.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Right. Linux has almost become the de facto embedded operating system. It's hidden. That's not necessarily a bad thing, I think. I don't think you should see the operating system, really.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   Well, this is what Bill Gates is actually saying. He says, really, the browser is the OS. And what does the browser mean? He says, "It just shows that the word browser has become a truly meaningless word."
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   What's a browser? What's not a browser? If you're playing a movie, is that a browser or not a browser? If you're doing annotations, is that a browser? If you're editing text, is that a browser or not a browser?
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Everything is browser-centric nowadays. I guess that's his point.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   That's right. And I think ultimately we're moving towards where the computer is invisible anyway, where you just get your data and you get the information you need and the computer itself, the device and kind of the trappings around it should be as out of the way as possible. I think that's kind of the long term.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   What do you need as a browser, really? Nowadays. I mean, that's WebOS is just exactly what it sounds like. It's a WebOS. Are you Mac, still Kevin, or Windows mostly?
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   I'm Mac. I'm almost, yeah, I don't have anything Windows at all. But I'm hoping that Apple eventually decides to just open the OS up and say it can run on any piece of hardware.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   I mean, everybody's doing it. It would be awesome. Everybody's doing it anyway. Right, exactly.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Pretty much, I think Colleen now has easily installed from the Leopard disks on a variety of Hackintosh platforms. And if you can install from the Leopard disks and you can update, it's just as if it's a real Mac.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   I just can't imagine the Google OS being like a cool operating system. Like design wise, you know, they have their head designer, Doug Bowman. He's phenomenal. He actually left Google, I don't know, maybe two or three months ago.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   And I just don't know who they have at the helm of design. And I can't imagine it being like a cool, slick OS.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Google saying they know nothing about design. I can't stand working for these guys. They're bozos when it comes to design.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   They're all engineers. It's engineer driven. And design is considered something peripheral.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Well, they certainly, I mean, the Google page is nice and clean and simple. But you're right. I don't think they, I mean, Android doesn't feel, for all of its, you know, promise doesn't feel like a cool operating system in any way.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   No, it feels kind of like, it's kind of like the OS 2 of operating systems.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   It is. OS 2 is a good, that's a good analogy. The whippersnappers won't get that, but that's a good analogy.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Hey, I remember OS 2. I loved OS 2 warp. I installed that.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   It was called it warp. I remember when they called it warp and everybody kind of went, uh.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   That's not a good name.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   I remember seeing that at Comdex.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Yeah, it ran Windows 95, right? Wasn't it 95 or was it 95? No, it was 95.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   3.1. Wasn't that 3.1?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Yeah, it would allow you to emulate like 3.1 or something like that.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Oh, lord.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Very slowly.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Uh, let's see here. We're going to talk about, there's so many stories. Amazon speculation that, well, there's two huge Amazon stories.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   One that they may buy Netflix. You think that's credible, Kevin?
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   I think they should buy Netflix. I think that Amazon, it makes sense for them. They're in the data delivery business.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Netflix is going all data for their, their shows and everything they're doing with the streaming over Xbox Live now.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   They're really in the same business now that streaming is it.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Absolutely.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   I mean, on my Roku player, it's Amazon and Netbox. I mean Amazon and Netflix.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Unbox and Netbox. I mean, Flix and, Unflix and anyway, it's the same. It's all the same, except you have to buy, you have to buy the Amazon stuff and the Netflix stuff is free.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Of course, I'm already paying a monthly fee to them. So it'd be interesting if they acquire them.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Does Amazon become as big and as strong and as powerful as the only other competition, which is iTunes?
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   I don't think it, I don't think it puts them immediately up there because they, you know, you still have to have the brand awareness of, all right, I'm going to do this instead of iTunes.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Apple has a, because of the iPod and the iTunes platform being on so many computers and so many people using it by default, I think they have a leg up.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   It sure would be great to have that level of competition.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   And what was funny was when this story broke, every tech journalist was just, you know, slobbering over themselves to say, "Ooh, yeah, let's do this."
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Harry McCracken basically said, did a blog post and said, "Okay, how can we make this happen?"
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   You know, even if it's not real, let's make it happen. And I think everybody loves the idea of Netflix and Amazon together.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   I love Amazon's music service, Amazon MP3.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   I do too.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, one of the free apps I was showing on the Geek Cruise was something called Advantageous, which is a iTunes plugin that when you go, when you start to buy a song on iTunes, it pops up, it's available on Amazon.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Now that was more important when they still had DRM on iTunes, but it's just, it's just, don't forget, you get this on Amazon.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   I still think it's important though, because I wish that iTunes did, does MP3s and they don't.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   That's right. It's that AAC stuff.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Yeah. AAC.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Yeah, it's AAC, but it's, it's, you can't, you can't play it on all your devices.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   A lot of players won't do it. Yep.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   We're going to talk about this Kindle thing, cause this is a huge story and I'd be very curious what your take is on, on this.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Kevin Rose is here from dig.com and dig nation and from the Houston Chronicle, Dwight Silverman and I want to talk about George Orwell in just a second, but I also, we have some wonderful sponsors.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   As long as we're talking about books, I want to mention audible.com and the platinum deal from audible.com, audible.com/twittwo.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Now, Kevin, tell me you brought some audio books with you to China.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   I did. I loaded up and it was great.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   I brought Kindle stuff.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   You brought, you brought a Kindle. Of course, now the Kindle you can't download in China.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Yeah, I loaded up.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   I loaded up. I put a bunch of Chinese history books on my, on my iPod from audible.com and I had some, I have some relaxing sci-fi on, on my Kindle, which I left on the airplane, by the way.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   So whoever got my Kindle, I hope you enjoy it. Son of a.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Oh, no, you lost your Kindle.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   It's the second ebook reader I've left on a plane.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   But the one, the thing that galls me is I get, I get off the plane in San Francisco, go through customs, immigration and go, oh, my Kindle.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   I left it in the seat back, or actually I looked at my briefcase. It wasn't there. I left in the seat back.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   So I immediately go to the desk at Northwest and said, it's on the plane.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And I was called to say, no, I left. I haven't heard back from him. So it's either another passenger getting off the plane, saw it and snagged it or the somebody in the crew or the cleaning crew or somebody snagged it.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   So yeah, I'm going to buy a new Kindle. At least they dropped the price to 299.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   It plays audible. I could put some audible stuff on my Kindle, getting back to audible in the sleaziest way possible.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   I could have played some audible stuff on my Kindle.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Audible is a great place for your audio entertainment, your audio, not just your audio books, but they've got comedy performances, radio shows, even podcasts.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   audible.com/twit2 will give you a chance to sign up for the platinum account. That's my account. Two books a month.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   And you get the first two free. So there are a lot of choices if you go to audible.com. A lot of books, 50,000 books now.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   One of the things audible does that I love, they do a lot of pro bono stuff. They've been putting the Sotomayor confirmation hearings up for free day by day.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   They've got all the first four days up there now. You can download them and listen to them.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   They've done this always in the past with convention speeches, inauguration speeches, all sorts of stuff.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   So it's really a great place to get kind of pro bono stuff. But I am going to recommend a book today.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   You know, they're making a movie about Facebook.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   In fact, you know who's making the movie is our friend from Trigger Street, Dana Brunetti, is producing this.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Oh, really?
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Yeah. And it's based on this book by Ben Mesrich, The Accidental Billionaires, the Founding of Facebook.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   I imagine you know Mark Zuckerberg. I imagine you know him pretty well, Kevin, because you're both young guys and riding that wave of Web 2.0.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Has he mentioned this book at all? Does he hate it?
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   He has not mentioned that book to me now.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   So we don't know how he feels about the...
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   I can see if he's online now.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Yeah, ask him. Eduardo Saverin and Mark Zuckerberg, Harvard undergraduates, best friends.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Eduardo. This is the copy on Audible.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   "Edwardo figured their ticket to social acceptance and sexual success was getting invited to join one of Harvard's final clubs, a constellation of elite societies.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Mark didn't care so much. He was a computer genius, so he decided the best way to start him.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Hacked the university's computer system, creating a rateable database of all the female students on campus.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   He nearly got kicked out when he crashed the university's servers.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   And that's where the framework for Facebook was born." What a story. This is going to be a great movie.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   Read the book right now, The Accidental Billionaires, the Founding of Facebook.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   They've tried to add sex to this. In fact, the subtitle is a tale of...
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   A tale of sex, money, genius and betrayal. All right.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   I can tell you right now, Mark doesn't like it. You can get it for free.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Go to audible.com/twittwo. Many, many wonderful books to listen to.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Like I said, on the way to China, I was listening and I'm still listening now to a biography of Mao.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   I've got some great stuff. It is for history, for nonfiction, for fiction, for thrillers, whatever it is you'd like to read.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   You can listen to it and it's a great thing. Anytime you've got to travel, drive the car, work in the garden, do the dishes.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Audible.com/twittwo. We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech and all of the Twitter programming.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Did Mark respond back?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   I was going to wait until you were done talking about them. I'm going to send them the links so you can watch it.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Let's not get in trouble right here.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Aaron Sorkin of the West Wing is doing that movie.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   He's writing it, which makes it, to me, a must see because I think he's just brilliant.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   It'll be a lot better than if anyone else did it, that's for sure.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   He's just a brilliant writer. I think this is going to be his meet.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   When Dana sent me an email, I think that he can get us the author Ben Mesrich.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   We're going to try to get him on a show and interview him because Ben did a lot of research for this.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   It should be very interesting. We'll get that interview.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   There aren't a lot of good movies about geeks and this would be interesting if they could actually make this decent.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Best geek movie. Is it Triumph of the Nerds?
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   No, Pirates of Silicon Valley.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   That was pretty good, wasn't it? That was Noah Wiley as Steve Jobs, right?
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Gates?
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   I don't know.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   I didn't think so.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   You think there's never been a good one?
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   I still like, again, this is old school. This may be my age, but I have always liked...
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Don't say Sneakers with Robert Redford or I'm going to hang up on you.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   That was good.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   I'm going to say screw you.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   War Games.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   War Games. There's a great movie.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   We had John Badham, the director on Screensavers. Remember that, Kevin? That was fun.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   He had his scrapbook from the production of the movie and everything.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Although there's a really interesting television show that has started airing that is very geek oriented called Warehouse 13.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Have you all seen that?
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   I haven't seen that, no.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   It's the X-Files fringe ripoff in which there are two government agents who are assigned to the warehouse where mystical artifacts have been collected by the government.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   They have to go out each week to get a different...
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   It's the X-Files.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   But the person who stays behind, who's kind of their mentor, is a... I forget the actor's name, but he plays basically a computer geek.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   In the last episode, he was using IP traces to find out who was hacking into his computer.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   The technology that they were discussing, it wasn't just like buzzwords like on 24, I cringe when they start talking about computers.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   This was like they were talking about the real tech and I was pretty impressed. So as a geek, I'm going to keep watching it.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   What's your favorite geek movie, Kevin? You got one?
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Probably The Matrix. That counts, right?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   That's a great movie.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   You know, I was watching The Original Terminator, which by the way looks incredibly dated the other day.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   I was looking closely at the stuff that was scrolling by, you know, when he'd look at stuff and go brrrrrrr.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   It was Basch Shell Script. I don't know where they got it.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   But it was kind of cool. It was like little Unix commands going across the screen.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   There was some geek behind the scenes there.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   Yeah, clearly. Right. But usually it's just pathetic.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Normally it's so fake. All the geeks are like, "Oh, why did you even do that?" They try and make it look real and like high tech and futuristic.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   It's always when they're showing the operating system, right?
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   Exactly. They zoom in on the computer and it's like, it's horrible.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   Big giant letters, "Press this button to hack."
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   I like it when they show a picture of the person and you can't quite make it out and they press that button that says like, I don't know what it is, but it's like it makes it so much clearer so you can finally see the picture.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   It's like if a camera caught someone and it's all pixelated, they just hit a special button that makes it like all of a sudden crystal clear.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   Correction. They're telling me in the chat, I'm calling and saying, of course, it wasn't Basch Shell. It was assembly language.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   It was loads and moves. That's right. I'm remembering it now. Load, move, all that stuff.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   Somebody says King of Kong. I haven't seen that. That's the one about the guy who's a Donkey Kong player, right?
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   That was great. Definitely, definitely Netflix, that one. So good.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   Documentary?
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Yeah. Documentary about this crazy guy that just got so passionate about Donkey Kong that he had to get the high score and there's this other guy that tried to cheat. I mean, it was just phenomenal.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   That's really good.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   A couple of votes for an oldie but goodie, Colossus the Forbidden Project.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   That was a pretty bad movie, but it's still funny and in its time.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Did War Games? War Games must have come out, Kevin, when you were a kid.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Yeah, I was really into that.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   I was going to say it must have influenced you a little bit.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Yeah, absolutely. I love War Games.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Yeah. I think that influenced a whole generation of hackers, actually.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   I have a blog post that I did actually a couple of years ago called 15 Geek Movies to See Before You Die.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   And it went to the front of Digg when it came out and somebody resubmitted it last week and it went again to the front of Digg this week.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   There you go. You've been double-dubbed.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   I have been double-dubbed. That's my first double-dig.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   That's my first dig-dug.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   And thanks for the traffic, Kevin.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Excellent.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   But what's funny is that I did not include Blade Runner on that list.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Oh, God.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   We closed comments after so many days on our blogs just because of spammers.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   And so there was no comments on the second time around.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   But what was funny was all the abuse. If you go in that post, there's a link off the front of my blog.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   If you go in there, there's all this abuse I took for that.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   And if I ever redo it, I think I'll add it just to keep myself from being shocked.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Fifth Element is one of those things that divides people. I liked it.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   How can you not love Mila Jovovich? She's the most amazing, beautiful woman in the entire universe.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Just turn off the sound and watch her, Leo.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   Oh, come on. Who doesn't love multi-pass? Multi-pass. I just love that.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   And Total Recall, there's a good one. With Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   All right. Enough.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Amazon in a bit of trouble because they reached into people's Kindle.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   If you had a copy of 1984 or some other George Orwell books on your Kindle, they reached into it and deleted them.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   Now, initially, this was a PR nightmare because all Amazon said is these books are no longer available on the Kindle, so we're deleting them.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   And then it comes out. And in fact, the publisher of these books did not have the rights to distribute the books.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   However, it certainly raised a furor, probably rightly so, because if you bought a pirated book or pirated movie, did you go, Kevin, to the, what was it, the Fang Jing bookstore?
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   You go in the basement there and there's every program ever made for like 75 cents?
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   I did not.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Unbelievable. Wide open. There's no IP protection in China.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   But let's say you bought a pirated book. What if the bookstore came into your house, took the book, left a buck fifty on the nightstand and said, you can't have it anymore?
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   Were you upset by this, Dwight? Did you think this was going too far on Amazon's part?
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Well, yes. One of the problems I have with the Kindle in general is its digital rights management and the fact that if you buy a book, you can't do kind of the most human thing you can do with a book via Kindle. You can't like loan somebody else a book.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   That always bugged me because my wife particularly, she'll read a book and then lend it out.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   Publishers love this because they sell a copy for each person.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Right. And I suggested in a blog post a while back that what they ought to do is allow you to lend your copy to another Kindle user, but it's unavailable, say, for two weeks to you. You can't read it or look at it.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   And after two weeks, it vanishes from their collection and then they can't read it if they've not finished it. And I think that that would be a way kind of to keep that paradigm going.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   A zoom where you can squirt it?
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   Right. Right. Essentially squirt the book.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   I just had to say squirt.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   So I think that, you know, it was certainly it's outrageous if you have that on your book. By the same token, what happened that they allowed a publisher to sell a book that it didn't have the rights to?
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   Well, they have that.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   I'm sure they'll change this, but they have that kind of automated self-publishing system.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   And they had said that they said that this won't happen again.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   They said they'll never delete books from your they will never delete books from your system again, according to cash more.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   So what happens?
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Go ahead. Sorry.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   I said, what happens if you have a book that you don't have the rights to and and there's a there's a dispute about it? You know, that means that Amazon doesn't if they say that that means that they will not do that. And that is not a that's not a resolution for them.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   I don't think they can say they'll never do it, but it certainly brings a it really highlights kind of one of the limitations of ebooks and particularly those that are that are handled wirelessly like that.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   It makes sense. I don't know.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   I'm not sure I'd buy one now.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   It just seems to me that what they should do is consider that once you've purchased a book and it's transferred to your device, that is now in your home.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   You can take it back into your home and take something back once you've bought it. It's kind of like what happens with your iPhone.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   If you buy an application and they remove the app from the iPhone, the store, they can't go in your phone and take it off.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   It's still on your phone, even though the application has been pulled down.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   I think that was a they have that capability.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   They do have the capability.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   They have there's a kill bit.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   Well, they've never done. They've never used a few different apps.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Yeah, no, no, no. That tethering app, which they pulled very quickly is still out there.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Yeah. But so they haven't used it, but they do have the capability.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   Yeah. The other thing that bothered me with the Kindle is I was I was on it the other day and it all of a sudden just flashed a screen saying performing updates.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   And then it did a software update and rebooted on me.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   And it didn't give me the option to say I don't want the update.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Just all of a sudden started to do it and then just reboot it.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   I don't know what additional software was installing.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   Like what if I didn't want that latest version?
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   Like that was kind of weird to me as well.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   So should I replace my Kindle?
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   I mean, what else am I going to put?
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   I mean, the Sony reader, the Sony.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   I have a Sony. I have the I have the 505.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   It's exactly the same screen.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   I think the thing about the Kindle is that wireless ability to download.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   But that's the same ability that gives them the chance to do those things.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Right. How Sony whispernet all the time.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   That's how I buy books. You hook up your Kindle to your computer.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   No, I just I go on Amazon dot com and say send the Kindle and then it just automatically goes.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Well, you're using it. You're just using it for the other end. But almost I've never done that.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   Maybe with subscriptions, but always with books, I buy it on the Kindle, which is I mean, I think that's a really nice feature.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   But there you see the sample. Yeah, you get the first chapter.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   You read it. You like it. Who was it told me that that's what he does.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   He'll load up the Kindle. Maybe Alex Lindsay will load up the Kindle with first chapters.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   I do that too. Before he gets on the plane. Maybe it was you said that.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   I read 10 or 15 books at a time. I'll just load it up and things I think I might be interested in.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   Read the first chapter and if you like it, boom, done. It's on there.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Credit to you. I guess it was you who said that.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   No, I don't think it was.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   Obviously you're not alone. Yeah.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   And then if you like the book, you buy it.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   Exactly.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   I don't I wouldn't do that because I don't like to read a lot of first chapters.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   I have this weird Puritan ethic. I think that some somebody drilled into me that it's like cleaning your plate.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   You have to finish a book once you start it.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   It's not right. That's.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   I read a lot during the first first the first chapter though, whether or not you're going to like it or get into it.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   You know, I feel that way. Anyway, you'd start reading something like that.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   But then I feel compelled to finish it like I'm a bad boy if I don't finish the book.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   Andy Anato who does that, by the way, a dangerous told me.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   If you are the king of the Internet, you can do whatever you want.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   I'm not the king. I'm the president. I'm duly elected.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   This is a republic.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   Go ahead.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   If you connect the Sony reader to its software, even though you're not connecting wirelessly, let's say you do an update or download a book.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Is it possible that Sony could delete something from the reader in that way?
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   And what's in their terms of service with regard to that?
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   Of course, I'm sure they can.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   And you know, the frankly, I don't like this.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   That's the main reason I like the ebook reader is I have to use Windows, I think, to get stuff on there.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   Oh, there's no Mac version.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   Maybe there is. I think I seem to remember I had to boot Windows.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   So, okay.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   So, our consensus is they didn't, they shouldn't have done that, but they're not going to do it again.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   So, but now what do I buy? Do I buy another Kindle?
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   I don't think there's anything like it.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   How many books did you have on there?
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   On my Kindle now, maybe 10 that I purchased or so.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   What? How many books were on your Kindle, Leo?
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   And you know what I had to do, and I realized this when I got home since they didn't call me back saying we have your Kindle, I had to deactivate it because somebody could, you know, it's activated. You can buy stuff.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   Could you tell if anybody had possibly bought something?
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   Yes, because I would have gotten an email from Amazon saying.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   And you did not?
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   I don't think so. I'll have to check and make sure, but yeah, I don't think so.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   So, but I deactivated it last night thinking, oh, shoot.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   Now I have to, you know, now I can't, you know.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   Was it the first, first, first Kindle or the second Kindle? Is it the thin one or the fat one?
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   Kindle two, of course.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   That's the one that has the cracks from the.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   You know, what's the story there? Because I didn't, I didn't get any cracks. Do you have cracks on yours, Kevin?
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   No cracks.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   Do you have cracks on, Dwight, do you have one?
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   No, I don't have one, but the cracks apparently are coming from the protective case that Amazon sells as a $30 option.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   I'm using that leather Kindle. I like that leather case.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   It kind of connects in.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   And apparently at that joint, it has started cracking. That plastic is real thin.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   And at some point it cracks enough that it damages the screen.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   Initially they just said they didn't indicate they would replace them, but now they're saying they'll replace them free.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   Can I say I threw it away? Can you still replace it?
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   Oh, it was all cracked. I threw it out. Oh, I can get a new one. Oh, could you send me a new one?
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   That's right. You threw it out on the plane.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   So you just left it on the plane.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   I said I don't want it anymore. Oh, you'll fix it? How's yours, Kevin? Is it cracked?
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   No cracks. So far so good. I have that case as well though.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   Me too. I bought that because it's a nice case.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   It's the cheapest one too. Like you see the other cases are like $200 almost for a case. Like these designer cases, I just don't get that.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   No, and this is, it's nice. It's leather and it makes it like a book. You feel like you should have something over that screen.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   Exactly.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   It's the same. I have a, still have the review unit for the Kindle DX. I have the big one and it uses the same design.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   It's got those L-shaped brackets that fit in and that hasn't cracked, but I'm curious if that's also happening with the DX.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   So I'm looking at the Kindle 2, $299. Here's my opportunity for $489 to buy a DX. Should I buy the DX, Dwight?
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   I don't think so. It's, I like to read in bed and that's where I do most of my reading and I like lay on my side.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   Yeah, me too. Is it too big for that?
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   Yeah, it's uncomfortable. It's comfortable if you're like sitting in a chair, like in a recliner or, because it feels like a hardback book.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   Right.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   It's not that size and so it's actually comfortable in that way, but it's just a little too big I think for casual use, for comfortable use. I prefer the little one. If I were going to get one, I'd get the little one.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   My sister and I actually split the cost on one and got it for my dad for Father's Day, the DX.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   And he likes it because when you're reading a newspaper, it feels a lot more like newspaper format. It's not so, you know, scrunched down and tiny. So he really enjoys his.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   That's, you know, that's one thing I subscribed to the New Yorker, Atlantic, monthly salon, a bunch of periodicals and I don't like reading them on the Kindle because it's just, so I kind of gave up on periodicals and just buy books. Books are fine. If you're doing something linear, it's fine.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   I hate to support, you know, and this is something that comes up for me a lot. I hate to support DRM, but there's times you just don't have a choice. Audible is an example. Kindle, same thing.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   I mean, I'd love to take to be politic, you know, be, be principled and take a stand and say, well, I'm not going to buy it. But then you don't get the benefit of it either.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   Can I work within the system as president? Try to change things.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   You can do whatever you want. That's right. You can do what you want.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   Except have a BlackBerry. I think I had to give up my BlackBerry.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   Wasn't there a Linux distro for the Kindle a while ago that they figured out how to hack it and get in there and open everything up? That did happen a while ago.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   Oh, that would be cool.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   Sounds like something that'll break your Kindle.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   It wasn't so expensive, but the Kindle was like, you know, one of those $75, $99 devices.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   Hack away.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   You'd be hacking them all up and down the street, but the fact that they're like $400, no one wants to take the risk.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   Hack away.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   You don't want to brick Kindle.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   So I don't know if you saw this story in the New York Times, Kevin.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   I thought I put this in our list of stories to cover.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   It came out yesterday, so you probably haven't.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   The crowd is wise when it's focused.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   Of course, at DIG, one of the kind of the seminal inspirations that you had for DIG was let the audience decide what stories are big stories.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Crowd source. The wisdom of the crowds.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   And they call it in this article, open innovation.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   I don't know if you've heard that term before.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   I have not.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   So this is a couple of scientists.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   Of course, Netflix, the Netflix prize was where this all kind of got started.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   Netflix said a couple of years ago, in fact, that they would pay a million dollars to anybody who could improve their movie recommendations,
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   which are notoriously sucky.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   I heard someone just did that.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   Yeah, we could go.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   So on June 26th, statisticians, a seven person team of statisticians from the US, Austria, Canada and Israel and AT&T research.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   I mean, these are the these are these guys finally did all they had to do was improve them by 10 percent.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   The way it works is they did that 10 percent.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   I don't know what the metric is.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   Somehow they measure it.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   June 26th.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   But then the rivals have 30 days to beat it.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   And I guess we're coming in a week.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   They'll get to claim a million dollar prize.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   This is actually a very smart thing for Netflix to do because it gives you a goal.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   It gives you a metric.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   Encourage them with enough money behind it encourages people to really work at this.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   And a million bucks is cheap.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   You know, that's that's six that's six five or six engineers for a year's work.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   You know, yeah, I hope in glory they get glory.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   Open innovation models are adopted to overcome the constraints of corporate hierarchies.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   But successful projects are typically hybrids of ideas flowing from a decentralized crowd a lot dig.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   Plus a hierarchy winnowing and making decisions.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   In other words, using the crowd plus editorial.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   You've always resisted doing that.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   TechMeme just recently hired editorial people.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   Have you ever considered that, Kevin?
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   You know, I don't know that.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   It's it's you'll have to see what we're working on next.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   We have a big, big new redesign and launch.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   I love this.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   Every time Kevin's on time.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   I know it's great.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   It just shows how much you're working on it right now.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   I just think that there's there's like that's a last resort.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   Right.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   Like if you get where you have like just it's a slippery slope to full editorial control.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   I just hate to have to have someone in control of what makes it on the front page.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   Having like one individual that sits there and says yes or no to something.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   Totally with you.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   I'm totally that was the whole thing you wanted to avoid.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   Exactly.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   So I don't know. I think that when we I don't want to get in trouble if I start talking about what's the timing.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   Can you say timing?
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   Few months.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   You're so good.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   One book I highly recommend though.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   The wisdom of the wisdom of crowds.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   The book James Sirawicki.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   Isn't it? I just started reading that.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   You never read that.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   I never read that.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   I read it in China.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   That's the book that validates everything you're doing.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   I feel embarrassed to say that I've never read that because I've had reporters ask me in the past.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   They're like what do you think of the book?
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   And I'm just like oh I've never had a chance to check it out.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   And I read it and I was just like I'm sitting there like I consumed it in like six hours.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   Isn't it great?
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   So sucked into it.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   So good.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   He's a writer for the New Yorker and really really talented.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   So to me tech meme has changed since they've added a human editor.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   I mean you can I think you can tell that there's a person kind of pushing.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   Change for the better or worse?
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   I don't know.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   I haven't decided yet.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   But I'm curious.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   That's the question isn't it?
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   You can tell I think.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   And I think that one of the things that's better is there are things that show up there that aren't from the usual suspects.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   Tech meme had kind of become the usual suspects.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   It was almost too easy to game I guess.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   Right.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   And but I'm curious what Kevin thinks of it because you know he's operating something that is pure crowd sourcing or as close as you can get I think to being pure.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   What do you think of what's happened with tech meme?
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   Can you tell?
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   Well I think that I don't spend enough time.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   I visit tech meme a couple of times a week so I don't know that I would notice a difference.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   I think that one of the things I've noticed with with with dig is that some days you'll look at the front page and you'll scan the top stories and the stories that have been promoted and you're like oh those there's two here out of the list I like and I don't like the others.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   I don't understand why they're on the page and I think this is stupid.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   But then sometimes you'll come back to the site and you'll say there's no way any sane editor would have picked that story and it's awesome.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   Right.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   And so you get it.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   Right.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   You know what I mean.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   So sometimes it works with you sometimes it works against you.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   It's just like it really depends on what your flavor of news is and I think that we've always had the random aspect going for dig where you never know what you're going to get.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   And that's what I think actually pulled in a lot of people to view the site in the first place is it wasn't just your standard same old editorial driven news site.
[00:59:47.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   I'm sure one of the things that surprises me about my own industry is I would think that more newspapers would be and just general publications that are doing the web would try something like a dig version of their front page.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   I've seen people talking about it but not a lot of people have actually done it.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   And there are a lot of dig clones out there like you know Kurtzi.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   But Yahoo Buzz.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   Or Yahoo Buzz right which actually is you know the newspaper consortium is heavily involved with that a lot of those.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   Oh is that true?
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   Oh interesting.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   But what's interesting is that I haven't seen kind of other people trying to do that and I'd love to do it you know if we just don't have the resources to point at that yet but I think it's a great idea.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   And I'm also real interested in the idea of a hybrid of a human and crowd source you know an editor and crowd source collaboration.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   And I think you could get an editor in sync with the crowd.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   I think that you actually might be able to do it.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   I don't know if they've done that at TechMeme yet.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   Kind of lightweight mediation almost.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   Right.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   I'm curious what Kevin's going to do.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   Yeah I think you see a lot of even major news sites now that are starting to experiment with different ways of doing this.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   I mean even if you look at like CNN you see you know they're now placing a lot more prominence on big sections such as you know most viewed, most emailed, most tweeted, most dug, whatever it may be.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   And you know that's the one I always go to right away by the way.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   Yeah absolutely.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   Because you know that's going to be the good stuff.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   It's always the good stuff.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   I think that's one way that we have, in fact one of the few ways that works that we have of mediating the huge amount of information that's on the internet.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   And you know that's why I use and how I use Twitter and FriendFeed is I let people surface the stories, the important stories.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   I don't use my news readers as much as I used to.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   Yeah it's weird.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   I haven't used RSS in a while now actually.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   Twitter takes place of it.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   Google reader is trying more and more to incorporate those you know social aspects but it just doesn't seem to do it as well as just follow Twitter.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   Or I use FriendFeed just because it, FriendFeed's everything you know like I was following you in China, Kevin, because it aggregated all of the stuff.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   Yeah it's weird and when you look at like where we spend, we each have our own daily stops right.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   You may go to like FriendFeed and Twitter and Dig and a handful of others.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   And I figure if it doesn't show up on one of those sites I probably don't need to know about it right.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   It's going to be on one of those sites that I really care about.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   I don't, you can not answer this Kevin and we can move on and go to something else but I do want to ask you about the dig bar.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   Sure.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   Now originally there was some criticism.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   In fact this was one of the things that the last time you were on you said we're going to launch it.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   And I thought actually a brilliant idea to do a URL shortening service.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   Got some criticism because it was framing but you changed that.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   And now according to Jason Kincaid in today's TechCrunch, which I always take with a grain of salt,
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   it says that you've changed it.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   He says the change is a subtle one will have major implications.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   Typically when you use a link shortening service anyone who clicks on your shortened link will be sent directly to the original article without a landing page.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   Now the dig bar apparently sends you to dig.com.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   Is that true?
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   That's a good question.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   I've been gone for two weeks.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   So I don't know what got pushed, what code got pushed and how it functions.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   But my last understanding is that what we wanted to do is have it so that if you click on a dig URL it takes you to the dig story so that you can dig it.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   And just rather than providing a short URL service that just forwards this redirection, we would just do a URL service just for dig articles.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   Just like the same way that TechCrunch does like TechCrunch/85374.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   If you go to that you're not going to go to some other site. You're going to go to TechCrunch. That's the story.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   So you're backing off on the original idea, which is a general URL shortening service to say really this is really the dig.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   This is just if you see one of these links it's going to take you to a dig story.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   But I'm not sure if that's what's been pushed yet.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   I haven't been to the office in two weeks.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   I think that makes sense to me and I understand the reasoning to do that.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   That's where your revenue comes from.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   If you link just to the story you don't get the page view.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   Well, it's weird. We've had this hybrid system for a long time where some of the URLs have gone out just directly to the source.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   Another URL will go out and draw the bar if you're logged in user.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   And then we also had it where it would take you directly to the permalink page if it was from Twitter.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   And the reason for that is because we were sending out all of these links through our...
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   We have this feed on Twitter. It's @dig_2000 or maybe it's all dig 2000.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   Where it's any story that's received 2000 digs goes out and that has several hundred thousand followers on it.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   That's good. I'm going to follow that. That's great.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   Yeah, it's just like the best of the best stuff, right?
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   And so we had that feed and it's been getting really popular.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   But the problem that we had is that we were sending all the people directly to the source and they didn't know how to dig the article.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   And they're like, well, what if I want to go back and dig it?
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   So we made those URLs just go to the permalink page.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   But then people were confused because those ones were going to the permalink.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   Other ones were not and getting the toolbar.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   And so we were like, OK, we need to make this simple and just make it do one thing all the time. Right?
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   So it's a unified experience for everyone.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   Now I'm looking, you have 12 dig pages on Twitter.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   Those are for the different categories.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   Dig images, world news, environment, technology, software.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   So you could follow if I were interested as I am dig technology news.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   I just follow that. And is that what is that duplicate?
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   So any time a story gets promoted in technology on dig, it will come into your Twitter feed if you're following it.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   The Dig 2000 is by far the most popular, though.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   That's just stories that have received 2000 or more digs, which is huge.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   Yeah, that means those are the biggest stories.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   That's only that's only going to be, you know, maybe five stories a day or something like that.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   So it's just the best of the best.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   And when I click that link, it brings it to the dig page, which makes sense because I'm logged in to dig in that way.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   If I read it, I can dig it. Right. Exactly.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   Otherwise you wouldn't know how to get to the article to dig it.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   And to be fair, that's the ad page. That's where the revenue is. That's how we make money.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   I mean, I got to pay the bills. Yeah.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   No, I think that that seems logical. I don't think that there's a reason to complain about that.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   It's just a change, I guess.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   So, you know, any time this is always the case, you make a change, some people are going to get upset.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   Yeah, it's you just get the funny thing is I used to get really upset about that.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   But at the end of the day, it's like, I don't know, you just got it.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   You have to evolve and make changes and not worry about every single person every time.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   Like you can't worry about what the masses are always going to say.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   You just have to do what's right for your long term vision, if that makes sense, and what's going to be right for like the consumer.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   So it makes sense to everyone down the road, because right now, the way we had it, it was completely broken where some people were getting confused.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   I know it was broken. I didn't get what was going to happen.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   I couldn't predict what was going to happen.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   Yeah. And that's that's a bad thing. You don't ever want to have a situation like that.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   But I'm a little jet lagged. As am I.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   Oh, I never liked the social media bars. I didn't really like the dig bar. I kind of.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   I don't want framing. I don't want framing at all.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   Right. John Gruber of Daring Fireball was most scathing about the dig bar and its initial incarnation.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   I'm getting I'm getting kind of fed up with shortened URLs in general, which is why I kind of prefer if it's a dig URL goes to dig, then I know that or a tech.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   Right. You know what you're dealing with. Right.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   Because now I mean, I use bit.ly.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   But the problem is you don't know what you're going to get. And especially nowadays that the Web is so dangerous, clicking on links without knowing where you're going is just it's a bad idea.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   Well, there's a lot of Twitter clients now that will show you what the full URL is of a shortened URL.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   I think Tweety will do that. You have to turn it on.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   But I have those turned on wherever I can. And obviously that that saves me some grief, I think, when you're using it.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   I like shortened URLs. And obviously in Twitter, you have to you got to have a right.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   But I know ones where I see them where I know it will generate like Ali will generate a social bar.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   And I just won't click on them. I just don't go there.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   Yeah, that's one of the things you have to be aware of, too.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   It's like we've seen some of that happening when we used to when we did the short URL service.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   And I've also seen other services happening as you get spam emails now with these short URLs. And if you see a name, you see a name that you recognize.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   You're like, oh, I trust bitly, right? Because I've clicked on bitly things in the past that have come through my Twitter feed.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   And they've been OK. You know, this is what the average consumer is most likely thinking.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   They see that they click it and then all of a sudden, you know, malware site or whatever it may be.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   That's one of the reasons I use FriendFeed because they do that and the Power Twitter, which is a really nice Firefox app.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   Yeah, Power Twitter is good. I would like to see that feature where short URLs are expanded built into Office 2010 and Outlook 2010.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   I think that would be very handy.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   What do you think of this Microsoft 2010 Outlook announcement? It's all going to be on the Web. Is that the idea?
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   Well, there's a version of it that will be on the Web. It'll be like...
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   You pay a monthly fee?
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   Actually, for casual use, it's free. It's going to be at Windows Live as part of the Windows Live package and it'll be free.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   But for companies to use it, apparently, there'll be a fee for it.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   Just like Google Docs, basically.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   Right. And that's the competition. And the idea, you know, that you go and have that familiar Office interface,
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   or, well, as familiar as the ribbon is to people, that'll be the big draw.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   You know, I want to add, I just saw in our chat room that Frank McCourt passed away.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   Oh!
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   Yeah, Angela's Ashes. He was 78. And that means, since I get another Audible book pick, I really want to encourage you to get Angela's Ashes.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   He reads it and it is fantastic. One of my favorite audiobooks of all time.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   So there's your second Audible pick in honor of Frank McCourt.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   We should also mention Walter Cronkite passed away a couple of days ago.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   The Dean of Journalism. Were you influenced, you're of an age, like me, you're of an age where Walter Cronkite was it, right?
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   Yes. And, you know, I kind of grew up with the news with him. I remember the Kennedy assassination through his news reports.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   He pulled off his glasses and you could see his eyes tearing up and he was visibly shaken.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   And he said the President has died. I mean, I'll never forget that.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   And the moon, you know, it was funny that he or interesting that he died during the 40th anniversary of the moon landing period where we're doing a lot of the Chronicle.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   Obviously, we're doing a lot of things with Apollo 11.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   Sure, Houston is where the Space Center was.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   And I remember as a kid, my parents had given me a little reel to reel tape recorder and several years before this.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   And because there was no VCR and there was no way to record television, I sat in front of our Ford Philco television set with my holding up the microphone to the speaker so I could have the moon landing recorded.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   And, you know, I went back and listened to it a few times as a kid. It was great.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   And there's Walter Cronkite again getting emotional as as Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   From Mercury through Gemini through Apollo, I watched Walter, all those launches.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   And of course, you never forget the ones where there were holds and Walter Cronkite, who was known in his early career as an AP reporter as old iron pants because he could sit there for days on end.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   You know, and he had to during these launches with little more than an expert, you know, Frank McGee or somebody sitting next to him.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   I guess McGee was on NBC, but an expert sitting next to him and a model of the Saturn rocket and just go on.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   This is stage one of the Saturn. I mean, just going on and on.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   And it was gripping. He was brilliant.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   Did you watch his last? Do you remember his last newscast? Did you?
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   I do. Tell us about it.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   Well, I was sitting. I saw it in Austin. I was in college and I went with a bunch of friends to a to Mr.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   Gaddy's just off the drag off Guadalupe Street.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   And we ordered a bunch of pictures of beer and a lot of pizza and we watched it.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   And I remember at the end of it, I expected something kind of more dramatic.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   And it was just kind of like, oh, OK.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   It was like the only time he ever really disappointed me.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   Well, like the way it is. What did he say?
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   The last words were that's. I think he did say that's the way it is, just that's the way it is.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   I interviewed him for an hour after his retirement.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   I think this is 90 or 91.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   And one of the most engaging interviews I've ever had, it was a great it was actually one of my last interviews before I started doing only tech.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   And I'll never forget it. He was just an amazing journalist and an inspiration to us all.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   And the guy who really ended the Vietnam War, because when Walter Cronkite in 1968 said,
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   We're losing this war, it's all over. They're lying to us.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   That's when Lyndon Johnson said, We've lost. It's over. If we've lost Walter Cronkite, we've lost the nation.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   So very, very powerful.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   Hey, I want to mention, since we are in the 40th anniversary tomorrow, today, maybe as you're listening to this,
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000]   is the 40th anniversary of Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   There's a really great site that somebody sent me in the chat room called WeChooseTheMoon.org.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   I don't know if you've seen this site.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   It's put together by the Kennedy Presidential Library and AOL is doing the server.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   It's got live audio transmissions from a shoutcast of the NASA's been doing this to the audio.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   It has incredible animations, video.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   Did you read that NASA overwrote, they erased the original moon landing tapes?
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   Yeah, they have. They were not really into recording.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   Shocking.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   Back then, it was just a direct broadcast.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   And what you saw on your television in 1969 was a camera pointed at the big screen at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   And so you're seeing a picture of a picture.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   Hmm, sounds like a conspiracy to me.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   Did they really walk on the moon?
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   I hate the moon hoaxers. I don't think the moon hoaxers even deserve a dialogue.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   You remember a couple of years ago, somebody came up to Buzz Aldrin and said it was all a lie.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   And Buzz Aldrin popped him one.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   Boom! And it was boom! It was like, good for you, Buzz.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   Oh, well I think that Collins, Aldrin, and Armstrong are going to be on stage tomorrow at an event.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   You know why I think it's important to memorialize this, to remember it, is because I want us to go to Mars.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   I want us to continue on.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   I think that's so very important.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   I know we're in tough economic times, but this is what keeps a human race looking forward, is this kind of thing.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   I think it's so important.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   Yeah, I think we need to, I think that's kind of, of course I'm a child of science fiction.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   Yes!
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   But I think that's our destiny. It's our destiny to leave the planet and go elsewhere.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   I'm reading a book I highly recommend. It's also an audible.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   Kim Stanley Robinson's book. He's got a trilogy about Mars that is a very heavy duty scientific, you know, this guy does hard sci-fi.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   And obviously like became a Mars expert because he describes in great detail what would be involved in colonizing Mars.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   And it's wonderful. Highly recommend it. There's a detective story in there. If you like sci-fi.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   What's that called?
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   It's called, well the first one's Red Mars and then there's Blue Mars and Green Mars. Red, Blue, Green.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   And it's Kim Stanley Robinson. It is fantastic. I've read it. Ben Bova also wrote a book about Mars exploration.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   It's very good. But this is, this is the one that if you really want to kind of visualize what it would need to be like, what we would need to do.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   They say the biggest problem is that is the length of the flight. We, you know, people, you lose so much bone and muscle mass in zero gravity that that's the, that's the problem that has to be solved.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   And there's also no way to really adequately shield ourselves from that length of time from radiation that's out there.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   Well, one of the things that sounds like Walter Cronkite.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   Walter Cronkite.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   There's no way to shield yourself.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   One of the things that can happen. This is, this is actually in the book. One of the first incidents is there's a solar flare and they have to shield.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   It's really great. It's a wonderful, wonderful novel.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   But let's remember 40 years ago, you, you're, you don't remember it, Kevin. You're too young.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   That's sad to say. But I remember getting up in the middle of the night. I was 12 to watch the eagle land, you know, tranquility base here.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   The eagle has landed and then a few hours later, watch Neil Armstrong step off that ladder onto a surface.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   They didn't even know if, you know, if it was safe, they thought it was possible it could sink right in.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   So a momentous occasion for that to be so scary.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   I mean, can you imagine getting off and being like, I don't know if I'm going to step down that could be moon quicksand right there.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   And I don't know.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   You don't know.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   Amazing. Just amazing.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   Yeah. But these guys, you know, I mean, these are the bravest men in the world.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   I mean, these guys, they're sitting on a rocket.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   You know, I mean, it's basically controlled explosion that's going to launch them to the moon.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   There's a book, I forget the name of it. I know the name of the author because of his name. Craig Nelson wrote it.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   It's about Apollo 11. And we interviewed him on Wednesday on Technology Bites, the Pacifica computer call in show that I do.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   And he told this great story about Neil Armstrong. You know, they were test pilots, so they were used to the idea of danger and possibly dying.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   And apparently at one point, Armstrong was working with a rocket based simulator of the lunar module and it crashed.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   It kind of crashed and burned up and he walked away from it, you know, without being injured.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   And his remark was, well, we lost another piece of equipment.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   These guys. Well, if you read the right stuff, of course, Tom Wolf's kind of semi-fictional.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   It's supposed to be true. And I guess it is a story of the first Mercury astronauts. I mean, these guys were crazy. Chuck Yeager and the like.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.000]   Somebody is mentioning that a gratuitous plug here, Mark Pelletier is in our chat room, that we did an interview.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   Mark did an interview with Buzz Aldrin and you can listen to it still. It's one of our Futures in Biotech episodes.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   Fib 23, if you want to listen to Buzz's account of landing on the moon.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:40.000]   Of course, we'll hear a lot from Aldrin and Armstrong and Collins through the next few days. It's a big deal.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:47.000]   I'll take a quick break. Come back. Talk more about some. We've got some quick news about the PC industry completely collapsing.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   And we're doing we're doing a special tweet with a couple of jet lag guys just back from China.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   Kevin Rose and myself and, of course, Stripe Silverman of the Houston Chronicle.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000]   I'm just sleepy. That's all. I just want a nap.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   What time is it now? It's 730 in the morning. So we're just getting up in China.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   That's right. Yeah. We're just waking up. I do want to mention our friends at Citrix and the great GoToMyPC.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   I could have used this and I planned ahead. I should have really planned ahead.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   I didn't really realize how blocked the Internet would have been.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000]   I could have used GoToMyPC to log into my systems here.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   Basically, I use it as a VPN. 128-bit encryption means you secure end to end. It is the best.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   I love GoToMyPC, a fantastic product from Citrix.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   And I want you to give it a try by going to gotomipc.com/twit.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C.com/twit. You could try it free for 30 days.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:58.000]   Citrix knows how to make a product that is straightforward, simple to use, and yet, you know, sophisticated.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   This is going to give you the state of the art and remote access better than anything else out there.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   But all you need is a web browser. Just go to gotomipc.com/twit.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   Click the download link. In two minutes, you'll be set up.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   Now, any other computer you go to, whether you're in China, whether you're in Timbuktu, doesn't matter.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:23.000]   You open a web browser, get online, go to gotomipc.com, enter your secure username and password, click connect.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   And there it is, your office PC. You can use it remotely, run any program, send and receive email, access any network resource.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.000]   They couldn't make it easier. They couldn't make it more secure. There's nothing better.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:43.000]   If you need to access your PC from anywhere you are, go to gotomipc.com/twit and give it a try.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   I had it set up. I just wasn't thinking.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.000]   You know what they never do? They never mention the biggest use for GoToMyPC, and that's fixing my parents' computer.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.000]   It's true. Seriously. Because they have a PC and it's the easiest way to do it.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   It's the easiest way to do it. It works with Macs and PCs now. Absolutely. It's just very straightforward.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   And it's fast because they've got the algorithms to make this as speedy as can be over almost any network connection.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:13.000]   Go to gotomipc.com/twit. Thank them so much for their support of the Twitch network.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   So we're going to start to see a lot of second quarter reports, but so far what we've seen is not so hot.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   Dell down 19% year to year. They have 26% of the market share. Still number one over HP because everybody else slipped.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   Apple slipped down 12.25%, 12.5% from last year.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   Those are animal analyst estimates and do it animal estimates. Apple will do its analyst call earnings call this week.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   I stand corrected. I'm sorry. Yeah. In fact, we don't know. You know, Apple traditionally undersells overperforms.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   So the analyst could be completely wrong on this one.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:13.000]   Gartner says that PC units sales fell 5%, but that's better than some expected as much as 9 to 10%.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:24.000]   Is the PC industry in a doldrums? Is it shambles? Is everything falling apart or is this just kind of delayed bad economy stuff?
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000]   I don't see the reason to buy another PC. That's the real problem, isn't it?
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:35.000]   It's like we browse the web, we check our email, we send tweets, we watch movies and we use iTunes.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   And the computer has been able to do that at fast speeds for several years.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:46.000]   You're starting to sound like an old fart. No, I'm just saying. I said this to Craig Barrett at Intel.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   I said, who needs a two gigahertz processor? He said, only old fart journalists like you ask me that question.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:59.000]   Take that and couple it with a bad economy and there's no reason to ever upgrade for the foreseeable future.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000]   I've had the same PC for a couple years now. Do you think Windows 7 will change that?
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   Because that's how people upgrade Windows.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:12.000]   I think the people that upgraded to Vista are going to upgrade to Windows 7 just because they're so pissed off at how bad Vista is.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:18.000]   They want to get out of that. But yeah, I think Windows 7 is a big step in the right direction.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000]   Windows 7 will sell computers, right Dwight? Oh yes, definitely.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   But not as much as a new copy of Windows used to in the past.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   It used to be that's what everybody waited for.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   Right. And Kevin makes the point that people are going to want to buy Windows 7 to get out of Vista.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:46.000]   But there are a lot of people who don't trust Microsoft now as a result of Vista and won't upgrade probably until they get themselves a new computer.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   But I think this is probably the main reason that we don't buy a lot of computers anymore.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:00.000]   I think smartphones are kind of a bright spot in terms of sales in the industry.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:10.000]   I think that this may be, particularly if the iPhone moves to more than just one carrier, I think that the PC industry has a lot to worry about.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000]   Do you think that's going to happen?
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000]   That's a good point.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   I think, well, you know, I don't know. If I were Apple, certainly they're in the catbird seat right now because they're in the negotiation supposedly with AT&T over extending the exclusivity.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.000]   Please, Apple, don't. Please, we beg of you. Verizon, right? We want Verizon.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:39.000]   Yes. Well, I can see Apple, you know, if they can get a better deal from AT&T than they can from anybody else.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:44.000]   And there's something in there that, you know, right. Right.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:54.000]   And that they can extend their market share. You know, they may look at the numbers and say, OK, it's time to, you know, the best way, the best deal that we can get is to is to end the exclusivity.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000]   What I'd be curious about is what if Apple does another exclusive deal?
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   What if they instead of saying AT&T and Verizon, they just drop AT&T and only say Verizon? What would that be?
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   That would be just as bad.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000]   We don't want that because I've got, you know, I have to buy a new phone.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:20.000]   Right. Well, let me ask you a question. Is it possible for Verizon is not GSM, correct?
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000]   Yeah, they're CDMA.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.000]   Right. So Apple has designed a new different type of phone.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000]   New chipset. Is that a big deal?
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:37.000]   Well, you know, it's funny. Some say it is because the chipset that Apple's using right now is GSM only.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000]   Right. I think it's an Infineon chipset.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000]   Which means that the only two carriers they could go with are AT&T and T-Mobile. Right.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:48.000]   So they have to put a new chipset in. I mean, they could do that. That's not, you know, impossible.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000]   Yeah. I didn't know if that would be a different engineering feat. Like are the chips bigger for that particular type of.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000]   Well, I wonder. I mean, that would be one way to do this is to keep it do a non-exclusive.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000]   If they're not going to do an exclusive with Verizon because that would just screw.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000]   I mean, as much as Apple likes to screw its existing customers, that's.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000]   You have to have an international phone too, right?
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.000]   You have to have a phone that's going to work in the world market. The entire world is GSM based.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:17.000]   Absolutely. I mean, if I had, you know, if I had a Sprinter Verizon phone, if I were using the Palm Pre, I couldn't have used it in China.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000]   Right.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000]   Now, Verizon makes world phones that are both CDMA and GSM. And I think that's what you'd have to do.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000]   You'd have to make a hybrid phone that does both. But that's that's you're right. More chips redesigns, complete redesigns.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:35.000]   I don't know. I don't know. It's a it's a tough one. I'd sure like to see them get rid of AT&T.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:41.000]   Is T-Mobile a better provider? No, no, no. They're nicer. They're nicer on the phone. They're nicer on the phone.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000]   They're very nice. Yeah. They're they're known for their customer service.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:50.000]   Although, actually, if you deal with AT&T's customer service on the phone, they're actually pretty good.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000]   No, especially since the iPhone. They've they've retrained, I think. Right. Right.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:01.000]   On the other hand, they're very nice to you. And when you hang up, you still have, you know, AT&T. Right. Right.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000]   AT&T service. No, I called them up and I said, what's the $750?
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:13.000]   And they said, well, you know, we could do we could we could we could split it up between two different months because my you know,
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:24.000]   my contract is like the middle of the month. And then you would only owe us $100 for the second hundred and then $300, $250.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:31.000]   So it would only be $350 instead of $750. I said, OK, well, if that's what you can do, do it. So that was nice of them.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   They were very friendly while they were screwing me. Well, you know, it's better better to have a friendly screw.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.000]   Yeah. It's like, you know, they bought me dinner. Right. They took you out first. Yeah. Took me out first.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   Did you take a screenshot of the phone? Yeah, I told you that it was.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000]   Yeah, it's still showing that I could do it.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000]   It you know, it says July. When did you reset it? July 2nd. How much usage since July 2nd?
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.000]   It's still well under 250 megabytes. It's like 103 now. Tell them you pay them for that.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   Yeah, here's what here's my phone says. I already pay them for that, Dwight.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000]   That's why I stopped at 100 megabytes. I paid him for 100 megabytes.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:16.000]   I was paying attention to the phone usage and that's what I thought I could trust, you know, my phone that I bought from AT&T to tell me the usage accurately.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000]   And what did they say when you pointed that out to them that the phone says X?
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   I had nothing to say. I had nothing to say. I said, well, we show 250 megabytes.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:33.000]   Maybe I would go back to them and say my phone shows this. I'm sure I'll hear from somebody tomorrow.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:39.000]   I've I've I've reamed them now on a national radio show and twit.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:44.000]   I'm sure I'll hear from somebody. But, you know, I almost I hate to pull that card. It's like almost I want to be.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.000]   How would you treat somebody normal? Right. Not so well, apparently.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:54.000]   Well, the question is, your phone shows X. That's what they tell you is the meter.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:00.000]   Then they come at you with a different meter. And there's a bigger issue there, I think.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000]   Hey, we were going to talk about and I yes, I agree.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000]   And I, you know, I'm going to pursue it and I'm getting an itemized bill from them and I'm going to see what I can do.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.000]   But I, you know, I don't have time for all this stuff. I got jury duty tomorrow.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:18.000]   Can you believe that? I got back and I have jury duty. That's rough.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.000]   They're all guilty. Repeat repeating. They're all guilty. I hate them all.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:28.000]   Hey, if you got arrested, it's for a reason. Go to jail.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   And besides, you're the president of the Internet. I'm the president of the Internet.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:37.000]   You can't make me do jury duty. So let's talk about the Twitter hack, because I wasn't going to cover this.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000]   And you raised some interesting issues, both Kevin and Dwight before we began the show.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:48.000]   This will be our last story. We're going long. I know. I apologize. But there's so much to talk about.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000]   Twitter got hacked. In a very, you know, Twitter keeps getting hacked.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:31:01.000]   And this one was, again, somebody at Twitter having a crappy password, which was guessed by the bad guys using a brute force attack.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:12.000]   This is not the first time this has happened at Twitter. The difference is this time, supposedly, the bad guys got access to the employees' email account or something.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:19.000]   They got all these documents. Now, as far as I know, only TechCrunch published these documents.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:24.000]   I looked at this and I thought, I don't want to do this story. I felt kind of dirty just reading them.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:30.000]   What is our obligation here, Dwight? Do we do it? Do we tell this story or what?
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000]   Well, I think you're the official journalist of the group.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:40.000]   Well, I think there's a I think there are a lot of interesting issues here.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:46.000]   You know, Michael Arrington kind of went on at length about why he thought he should publish them.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:53.000]   A lot of people disagreed with him. Legally, I think he can publish them.
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:04.000]   The law has been this has been litigated quite a bit where if you receive documents that are stolen and you print them, so long as you didn't collude in the original crime.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000]   Well, let's go all the way back to the Pentagon Papers.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000]   Right. The Pentagon Papers. That's the biggest thing.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:17.000]   Classic case where the inside papers from the Pentagon were leaked by Daniel Ellsberg. New York Times got them.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000]   Sy Hirsch wrote about it, published it, I think won a Pulitzer Prize for it.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:28.000]   And the Times never got, you know, was of course immediately tried the government tried to shut them down and lost.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000]   But now that was about the Vietnam War. I mean, there was something, something going on there.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:44.000]   There's an issue of whether this goes to the public good and, you know, do we essentially need to know about, you know, Twitter's business model, which is kind of what everybody in the tech industry.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000]   I felt I was started reading and I felt sleazy reading it.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000]   I think the difference is that the Twitter business model, I think, would have been OK.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:33:00.000]   What bothered me about what I saw published was the fact that it was a lot of Twitter's dirty laundry that was published out there.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:06.000]   And we didn't really need to read all that. I just don't understand why, why this was put up on the Internet.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.000]   Like, why, why did that have to be on TechCrunch?
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:16.000]   Well, I know why it had to be on TechCrunch because let's face it, that's how TechCrunch makes its living.
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:22.000]   They're basically the valley wag. I mean, they've really become a scandal sheet.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:31.000]   Well, they have, you know, they it comes down to this is that ultimately they received what amounted to stolen property. And yeah, they may have.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000]   They have the technical rights to publish it. Absolutely.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000]   They have the technical right. But the question is the where, whether ethically they should have.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:47.000]   I didn't see anything, Kevin, that was necessarily sleazy other than in fact, he apparently has sleazy stuff and he's not really sleazy stuff.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000]   And he's not doing anything with that.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000]   But but first of all, you can't you can't you can't judge the provenance of it, right?
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000]   You don't know that it's real. You don't know that it's really don't know has been altered.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000]   You know, you all you know is that you got these documents from somebody.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000]   In fact, the story is a little far fetched just because somebody hacked the Twitter account.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:11.000]   How would they or do they hack their Gmail account? I mean, well, I guess they have the same password, right? Oh, same password.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:20.000]   OK. And they also used once they got in, they used password recovery where it gets a password gets emailed back to the original account.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000]   And so then they were able to get into things like their like their Google Docs.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:32.000]   And it also raises the issue of putting company documents up in the cloud, you know, where they're where they can be accessed.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:39.000]   There's no question that there's if I'm on the Twitter board, I have some pretty serious questions to ask.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000]   Right. Because I mean, you know, that's but that's an internal issue.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:51.000]   And and and and frankly, I think TechCrunch has the right to publish this stuff. I'm not I wouldn't even complain about that.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:58.000]   I just decided not to cover the story. I'm not going to repeat any of the information from it because it just I didn't you can't validate the provenance of it.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:04.000]   Nothing I read there, you know, had the importance of the Pentagon papers for sure.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:11.000]   The thing that bothered me more than anything else is that, you know, we living in the Bay Area, I'm sure Leo, you know, some of these guys, too.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.000]   These are like friends of ours, right. They run these companies and they work at Twitter.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000]   And, you know, Arrington is also friends with these guys.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:28.000]   And I just think that, you know, if something like that, let's just say I'm TechCrunch, it's something like that lands on my desk and you have all these documents and you say, wow, this is going to be a really big story.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:39.000]   Right. I understand him going out there and saying like, OK, here's what their business model is or here's what they're thinking, because that's something that everyone is really curious about is just a general interest tech story.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:51.000]   But when you get down to start talking about like the specifics of what they were thinking about certain individuals that worked at Google, who they liked, who they didn't like, what they were thinking about dealings with like puff daddy and the fact that they didn't think.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000]   Oh, yeah. Really big asset.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000]   That's when I stopped reading right there.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000]   Yeah, that was the kind of stuff where I was like, why did you even have to put that up there?
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000]   Like that just makes those guys look bad and it hurts people.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000]   You know what I mean? It's not just like reporting on the news.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000]   It's actually hurting someone.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000]   I don't know. That's what drives traffic.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000]   Let's face it. That's where. Yeah, I know.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000]   But it's just a shame.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:27.000]   There's also an issue of Internet journalism here, and that is one of the things that that sites like TechCrunch and other pure Internet sites do is they not only give you the story that they've written, but they put the documents themselves up.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000]   They put their raw material, which I think is fine.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000]   But the raw material had the information about P Diddy in it.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:42.000]   And so what happens is I can argue the other side, which is the public's right to know if you're a real journalist, you don't say, oh, they're my friends.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000]   I'm going to protect them. You publish the story.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000]   Right. Right. You don't want to do that.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000]   But what's the story, though?
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:37:00.000]   Well, that's true. What is the story that P Diddy was the story is primarily in this case that that you get an insight into what they are considering as a business model, which is what everybody wants to know about Twitter.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000]   Absolutely.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000]   It's not. And it's going to be peripheral things if you're showing.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.000]   They're going to be peripheral things if you're showing the documents that include the reference to P Diddy.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000]   You have to explain that.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:17.000]   And so as stupid as it is, you know, that's kind of you have to put that out there.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:24.000]   You have to do something that said, you know, they could have done it in a non Internet journalism style.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.000]   They could have done it in a more traditional style and not put the raw documents out there.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000]   That would have been an antithesis of TechCrunch.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:35.000]   I kind of like the idea of the raw documents, but I felt sleazy reading them.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000]   So I just stopped and I actually wasn't going to cover the story at all.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.000]   I think the meta story is interesting, though, of what do you do?
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:51.000]   I think the most damaging information that was released, though, has to be what they thought of, like Marissa Meyer from Google, who's like the number third person in charge over there.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:56.000]   And also what they thought of Microsoft and how they got hurt with the ad deal.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000]   I mean, these are huge partnerships. Yeah.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000]   These are the relationships that are being damaged.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000]   And I don't know if they're recoverable at this point.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000]   You know, yeah, that hurts a little bit.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:16.000]   I mean, we all say stuff in private meetings that we wouldn't really necessarily want the world to hear.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:24.000]   Take notes in different ways and are actually said and just like, you know, like never do business with that guy and just like you're just jotting something down and it's taken out of context.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000]   And then, I don't know, it's rough.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:35.000]   The one thing that the thing that most intrigued me was Twitter's ambition of being the pulse of the planet.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000]   And I like that they want a billion users.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:47.000]   But, you know, it was Jason Calacanis who said this on this show months ago, whether he had inside information or not, I don't know.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:54.000]   Of course, he, like everybody else, knows all these players. But he said the goal is to become the Internet phone book.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:04.000]   If everybody in, he said, imagine if everybody in the world and a billion people is for this, for our purposes, the same number, had a Twitter account.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000]   That becomes how you identify the value of that to Twitter.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000]   And that's clearly what they're going for.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000]   And that's, by the way, exactly what Facebook's going for.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000]   Right.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000]   And everybody else.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:24.000]   Yeah, Facebook, I think, is more apt to become the phone book of the Internet at the moment before Twitter does.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000]   Yeah. I want to thank you, Dwight, for being here.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000]   Well, thank you. This has been a great show.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000]   This has been fun.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.000]   Well, Dwight, you're always great to have on.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:38.000]   You can catch Dwight in the Houston Chronicle and, of course, his tech blog is a must read.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000]   It's a great way to find out what's going on in the world of tech.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.000]   In fact, it's how I got all the stories for today.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000]   I wasn't here this week.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.000]   No problem. I went to blogs.cron.com/techblog and your link roles are just great.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]   I read them all the time, religiously.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000]   Always a great source of information.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000]   That is an honor coming from the president of the Internet.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000]   You're now the director of information.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000]   I want to be the secretary of the inferior.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]   Okay, deal.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000]   Kevin Rose, who can have any job he wants.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000]   It's great to have you.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:15.000]   Give us one memorable moment from your tea tour of China.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000]   Here, let me show you something.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:23.000]   This is a Pu-erh tea cake.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000]   Look at how huge that thing is.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000]   It's about the size of a pizza pie.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.000]   Yeah, and I actually hand pressed these from tea that we picked ourselves.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000]   You picked the tea? What kind of tea is that?
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000]   It's called Pu-erh tea.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000]   Pu-erh tea.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000]   P-u-dash-e-r-h.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000]   Yeah, it's the only tea that can be aged like wine.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.000]   So this cake can be aged up to 50, 60, 70 years.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000]   How long are you going to keep it or are you going to drink it?
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]   I'll chip away at it over time.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000]   Let me show you one other one. This one here.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000]   They allowed you to bring these back.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000]   Did you have to do a deal with customs?
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000]   Did Tim Ferriss have to grease some palms?
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000]   What happened there?
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:03.000]   This little guy is about 15 years old and it's about $1,200, something like that.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000]   What?
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000]   Yeah.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000]   Whoa.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000]   What?
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000]   It's pretty crazy.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000]   $1,200.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]   Tea is outrageously expensive.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.000]   The good stuff is just insanely expensive and it's like wine. It gets better with time.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000]   Well, what does it taste like? I mean, have you had some of that $1,200 tea?
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:27.000]   Yeah. I mean, it's very, Pu-erh tea is typically very chocolatey, very forest-like, like woodsy.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000]   Tastes like dirt is what you're saying.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000]   It's an acquired taste.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000]   It tastes like dirt. $1,200 an ounce dirt.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]   That's right.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]   Party at Kevin's house.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:44.000]   I admire anybody who follows a passion to that degree. It doesn't matter what the passion is.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000]   Tea is not a bad passion to have. I can understand that.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000]   I like beer, so you got to have that balance, right? The yin and yang.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.000]   I love tea. I completely understand that. My greatest disappointment was when I was in China. Mostly it was Lipton.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000]   Oh, that's too bad.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000]   I know. Isn't that awful?
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:06.000]   But we did go, when we went up to Guilin, they do grow tea as well as, on the real steep hillside, you can't grow kumquat, so they grow tea.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:12.000]   And I was going to bring some back. Our guide bought a brick and I thought I wouldn't be able to get it through customs.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:18.000]   Oh yeah. I brought a whole, actually I threw away clothes as I was traveling so I could fill up my suitcase with tea.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:24.000]   Well, you got to come up here and bring a little tiny bit.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000]   You don't have to bring much. One cup is all I want to taste.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000]   Alright, fair enough. Done.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:35.000]   Great to have you, Kevin. Kevin at dig.com and of course watch Dignation every week at revision3.com/dignation.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:41.000]   Are you going on the road anytime? On the road? You just got back from China. But are you bringing Dignation on the road again soon?
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:47.000]   We're doing a Patron train where we get on the train and write it from San Diego and that's next weekend for...
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000]   Patron like Patron Tequila?
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000]   Yeah, they're sponsoring an episode so it should be a crazy one.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000]   You're going to get on a train and go to Tequila land?
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.000]   Pretty much, yeah. Like Candyland but with alcohol.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.000]   Come do one in Houston. Come do a dig town haul in Houston.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.000]   I would love to do one in Houston. That would be awesome.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000]   Remember when we did the screen savers in Austin? It was the best thing. It was so much fun.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000]   Yeah, Austin's so much fun.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000]   Houston would be great.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000]   Don't come in August.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.000]   It's like 90... No, they had a little rain today so it's a little cool.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000]   Well guys, great to have you on. I really appreciate it.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000]   Kevin Rose, Dwight Silverman, I'm Leo Laporte. We thank you all for being here.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000]   I'm glad to be back. We'll see you next week. Another twit...
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000]   This is amazing.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000]   ...is in the can.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:55.000]   [music]
