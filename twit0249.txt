[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.120]   It's time for Twit, this weekend tech.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.640]   This week's tech news, digested, and spewed forth
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.560]   by our resident pundits today.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.440]   We're welcoming back, and we're so glad to have them.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.880]   Haven't been on in a couple of years.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.480]   Corey, Dr. O.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.080]   Yeah, those two years coincide with when my daughter was born.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.560]   Yeah, how's she doing?
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.080]   She's awesome, two and a half years old.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.960]   Turning into a little Disney nut.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.480]   We put her to bed at night, and we go up 15 minutes later,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.040]   and she's standing on the edge of her crib,
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.120]   holding the rails and shouting, "Yo, ho, yo, ho,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.120]   I was like for me!"
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.480]   Now, she hasn't read down and out in the Magic Kingdom yet,
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.160]   I would guess.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.720]   No, two and a half, she's more into the Apple, Dougie.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.600]   But she does know we go-- her first word was Chewbacca.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.920]   Oh, yeah, that were talking.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.480]   Yeah, and when you say posy, what sound does Vader make?
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.320]   She goes, "Hey, hey, hey, hey."
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.480]   Very good.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.320]   You're raising an appropriate child
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.720]   for the 21st century.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.520]   Corey, as of course, everybody knows.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.240]   Great science fiction author, and his newest book just
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.280]   came out, FTW 4, The Wind.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.040]   It's a juvenile, and we'll talk about it in just a little bit.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.840]   He's on tour, and right now in North Carolina,
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.080]   on tour doing readings.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.400]   So it's great to have you back in former EFF Europe guy,
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.320]   and still very active in internet freedom.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.280]   And boy, you haven't been here in so long.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.360]   There's so much to talk about.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.880]   I want to cover some stuff that might be old news, things
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.760]   like net neutrality with you as well.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.280]   But today, our big story will be Facebook,
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.280]   and there's a guy here who can help us with that.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.360]   And that's Robert Scobull, the Scobullizer.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.200]   Hey, Robert.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.240]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.240]   Great to have you, Robert.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.760]   It's been in the center of a little mail stream
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.640]   that's been going on today over Facebook.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.520]   And we'll talk about that.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.280]   But you were also at Google I/O, the big Google conference
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.600]   this week.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.440]   And I got a new phone for free.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.200]   You see the closure?
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.800]   I got it for free.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.320]   You like your Evo.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.880]   Yeah, it's dramatically better than the iPhone
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.160]   in a lot of places, and we can talk about that later.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.400]   You wrote a good post on Buzz, pros and cons of Android.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.440]   I'm starting to become a big Android fan.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.960]   And everybody here is an Android user.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.120]   I know, of course, Corey, you use the Nexus 1.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.720]   I tell you, it's been game changing on the tour
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.120]   between the really awesome turn-by-turn directions, which
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.000]   is saved.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.800]   My media escorts bacon more than once,
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.960]   going out to some school for a visit,
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.440]   and really good functional email.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.960]   And tethering.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.400]   Tethering has been amazing.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.320]   Because normally what happens on tours,
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.640]   you're out from like seven in the morning until 10 at night.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.520]   You know, it's four schools, four media events,
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.880]   and a book signing.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.440]   And you go back to the room and you do email till three
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.640]   in the morning, and then you get up at five the next day.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.920]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.080]   And with tethering, basically every time
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.120]   I'm done with assigning, I just jump on my laptop
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.000]   and get some work done.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.480]   And I've been getting almost five, six hours sleep
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.800]   a night.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.440]   It's been wicked.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.800]   And that's even without the 4G.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.600]   I imagine if you're in one of the 27 cities that have 4G,
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.600]   you'll have even better results.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.720]   So Robert, you get 4G in the half-phone bay.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.880]   I know it's some of San Jose has it now.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.640]   3G here.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.720]   And I didn't get it.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.600]   I didn't sense that I was getting it in San Jose.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.920]   But I think last night I figured out how to turn it on.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.920]   So you actually have to go and actually opt into 4G
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.080]   before you can use it.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.280]   But we were driving down freeway 280 by Apple's campus.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.640]   And we were on 3G.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.240]   And my son and I were iPad-ing in the car
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.200]   and watching videos and listening to music.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.760]   And it was working just fine.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.400]   They've turned on in Frojo 2.2 on the Nexus 1 now.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.800]   They've got free tethering built in.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.280]   T-Mobile doesn't charge extra for it.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.000]   You have to pay 30 bucks a month extra for it on the EVO.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.560]   So this is definitely where Android's going.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.560]   And it's in stark contrast to the iPhone,
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.080]   where tethering's been promised by AT&T for more than a year.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.960]   Been some day, maybe.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.200]   I expect that it'll come this summer when the 4G iPhone comes out.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.920]   I mean, Steve Jobs has been writing his own slew of emails
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.960]   to bloggers today saying just wait and see that we haven't
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.200]   been leapfrogged by Google.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.160]   We'll see.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.000]   Yeah, we'll see.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.160]   Well, I mean, even if they roll out tethering now,
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.840]   I mean, clearly they've been leapfrogged by Google
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.080]   because there has been tethering for a while on the Nexus 1.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.480]   But I love the idea that AT&T and these other carriers
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.560]   offer unlimited internet.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.920]   But don't let you plug it into a device of your choosing.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.080]   It's kind of like unlimited internet.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.200]   All you can eat provided you're not very hungry.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.280]   Right.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.440]   Well, that's the iPad, isn't it?
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.640]   I mean, you get--
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.280]   and AT&T has said this again and again,
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.360]   no, we're not going to limit the internet on the iPad.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.080]   Well, of course not.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.240]   Because you can only use it on the iPad.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.800]   How bad could it be?
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.080]   Although there are hacks that allow you to tether the iPad.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.240]   So maybe it could be bad.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.400]   Maybe it could get worse.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.720]   Let's talk about the Facebook thing.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.720]   Now, Corey, you-- the economists have an article about Facebook--
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   what do we call them?
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.920]   They're Facebook Refuse Nix.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.120]   Those of us who have deleted our Facebook pages,
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.440]   they mentioned you and me.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.320]   Mine will be effectively deleted on Wednesday.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.480]   It takes two weeks because they only deactivate it
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.400]   in case you want to come back.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.080]   You deleted yours as well.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.040]   And it was actually a little easier for me, I think,
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.480]   because I created a Facebook account just
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.320]   like I created a six degrees account,
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.680]   a friendster account, and so on.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.480]   I created it, used it for a week or two,
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.960]   and then abandoned it and didn't have anything to do with it.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.960]   And just wrote a kill file in my mailer
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.600]   so that I didn't have to see it anymore when it sent me
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.920]   messages.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.880]   So I just basically forgotten I had a Facebook account.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.000]   And then I started using my Nexus 1 and K9 mail,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.480]   which is a great little mailer for it.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.000]   And because I don't have any of my kill files on K9,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.480]   I was starting to see all those messages
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.840]   from people who were friending me on Facebook.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.840]   And I realized, hey, there's some people who,
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.240]   for at least part of the reason for being on Facebook,
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.200]   is that they're able to hook up with me.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.360]   Let's see if I can remove that incentive.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.000]   Let's see if I can stop being part of the problem
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.320]   and start being part of the solution.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.080]   So I resigned on my Facebook account.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.280]   And that was kind of funny.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.400]   I did it because I had 10 minutes extra in an airport.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.080]   I don't even remember which airport.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.000]   And within 10 minutes, as I was getting in the plane,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.360]   I got nine press calls.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.840]   I just tweeted randomly along with all the other stuff
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.200]   that I was tweeting for the lounge.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.600]   I resigned on my Facebook account and ABC News and CNN.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.440]   And everybody was like,
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.840]   "You resigned on your Facebook account.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.680]   Call us up because it's a thing of moment."
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.520]   Which was really funny.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.080]   I should resign on my Facebook account more often.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.920]   - I know.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.320]   I got more publicity, I'm sure, quitting Facebook
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.360]   than I ever got on Facebook.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.280]   And I'm with you, Corey, it's hard for me to tell people,
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.240]   you should do the same thing because let's face it.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.160]   Facebook is hideously useful for a lot of people,
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.160]   including businesses.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.960]   And there isn't really much of an alternative.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.040]   I don't miss it at all.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.200]   But I've got a website, I've got Twitter, I've got Buzz,
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.840]   I've got plenty of ways to connect with people.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.320]   I use Google profiles as kind of a Facebook clone
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.360]   in the sense that if you Google me, you'll find that
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.480]   and that'll tell you where else to go.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.880]   - Mm, I got the vanity site.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.640]   - What's the vanity site?
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.760]   - Yeah, I've had crap hound for, you know, ever.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.600]   - Yeah.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.080]   - So people, Google, Corey, and Doctor,
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.480]   they're gonna find you.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.560]   - If you Google Corey, I'm like the first three results
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.400]   for Corey.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.240]   - Yeah.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.000]   - So I'm pretty easy to find, I don't really have
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.840]   to worry about it.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.680]   So you're right, I have a different circumstance
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.160]   for everyone else.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.400]   - What about people who use it to meet old friends,
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.040]   or maybe they're small businesses that can't afford
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.400]   or don't wanna take the trouble to do a website?
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.120]   They're gonna stick around, aren't they?
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.120]   - Yeah, I guess, until the number of people
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.640]   kind of reach, the number of people
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.760]   leaving reaches critical mass, I was talking with someone else
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.120]   about this a little while ago about what it would mean
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.760]   to actually have some viable alternative.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.160]   And, you know, I think if you actually did have
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.880]   a viable alternative, some that was more privacy
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.760]   respecting and so on, you might could do something
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.000]   where since Facebook is so aggressive about slurping
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.520]   information in from elsewhere, but doesn't allow
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.040]   any information out, maybe those of you who are kind
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.440]   of off Facebook could export your information
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.360]   to the people who are on Facebook somehow.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.400]   I'm not really sure how that would work, but it seems
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.840]   to me that there's probably some meat on that bone
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.480]   if you wanted to start a service to kind of help people
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.640]   solve the collective action problem of,
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.560]   I can't leave Facebook until like these 20 other people do.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.360]   - But Leo, isn't this the real problem?
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.120]   You know, 13,000 people are on the Facebook group
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.160]   of quitting their Facebook on May 31st.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.160]   - That's probably fewer people that will join
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.520]   in five minutes on May 31st.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.360]   - Maybe 20.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.280]   It's not a huge number of people.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.040]   And, you know, when I talk to normal people outside
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.640]   the bubble outside, you know, the media sphere
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.640]   and outside the geek sphere, I just don't hear the outrage.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.440]   People have already resigned themselves to the fact
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.760]   that privacy is changing.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.040]   In fact, I just interviewed the guys who do the calendar
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.320]   tungal me and they just turned on a feature where they give
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.880]   people a choice of being public or being private
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.200]   and something like 89% of the people turn on the public part
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.480]   and they were shocked by that.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.080]   They thought, "My, you know, a calendar is the most private
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.200]   "thing that they could think of."
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.280]   And they were shocked that people were sharing it.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.720]   Now their service is like Blippi,
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.880]   where you share your credit card and--
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.920]   - Yeah, I sure am Blippi.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.160]   - Yeah, you know, I think that the problem with privacy
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.840]   is it's a little like the problem with, say, smoking,
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.400]   where the consequence of the decision is really far removed
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.560]   from the decision itself.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.400]   So you do something that comes back to bite you in the ass,
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.920]   but the actual biting takes place
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.560]   really far in the future.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.400]   - Right.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.640]   - So it's very hard to learn from that stuff, right?
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.560]   Like think about shooting with film cameras, right?
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.280]   Back in the film camera days,
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.160]   excuse me, I'm gonna try and get my camera lined up here.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.320]   Back in the film camera days, you know, the average family
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.280]   would shoot like three rolls a year and you'd shoot
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.240]   one of Christmas, one on holidays and one on,
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.960]   one on, or one on Christmas, one on birthdays, one on vacation.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.920]   And, you know, if you got your roll of film back
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.120]   and you looked at the pictures, you go,
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.520]   "Well, I don't know what I did to this one
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.440]   "to make it look so good and I don't know what I did to this one
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.640]   "to make it look so crap."
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.560]   And you never got to be a better photographer.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.400]   - Right.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.240]   - And just shortening that feedback loop.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.680]   Without anyone actually sitting down and going,
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.920]   "Well, now I've got a digital camera,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.800]   "I'd better be a better picture-taker."
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   Shortening the feedback loop between taking and seeing
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.840]   made a huge difference.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.160]   And privacy, it's really hard to ever learn
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.480]   to be a better privacy person,
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.960]   because by the time the consequence
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.600]   of your action rolls around, it's been so long,
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.120]   you don't even remember what you were thinking
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.520]   when you made that calculus.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.840]   I've got a story about this.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.160]   When I was in elementary school, I had a teacher
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.920]   who had a child who was born and then died shortly afterwards
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.560]   and it was heartbreaking for him and his wife.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.720]   When the kid was born, they couldn't see any reason
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.360]   not to give the marketing companies
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.480]   that were giving out free diapers and so on
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.080]   their child's information and birthday and their address.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.800]   But 18 years later, when they were still getting
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.680]   annual birthday cards from 100 marketing companies
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.560]   along with baskets of stuff for their kid,
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.240]   they were really regretting having made that calculus.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.760]   It's a very hard thing to judge in advance.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.520]   I mean, I think we go, people don't care about privacy
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.440]   and what we can't disentangle from that
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.200]   is whether people just can't make good decisions
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.040]   about privacy in the moment.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.520]   - Yeah, I told my kids that.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.480]   I said, and this is actually what prompted me
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.960]   to delete the Facebook account was,
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.880]   I was talking to my kids and saying,
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.360]   you know, you can keep your Facebook account,
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.040]   you should understand that everything you put there
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.520]   ultimately could be public, so you shouldn't put anything
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.000]   there or anywhere, frankly, on the internet
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.320]   that you wouldn't want parents, teachers,
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.320]   future employers to see and they didn't get it.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.960]   I said, well, no, no, Facebook's private
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.200]   and so I'm gonna continue to do this kind of thing
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.920]   because it's so useful and I can't deny that it's very useful.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.840]   And so that's when I started really getting worried
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.920]   that what we are, and I had the same exact reaction
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.080]   as you did, Corey, which is we're coercing people
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.800]   into using Facebook merely by having a presence there.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   So I just decided, you know, I don't need to play there
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.360]   and I'm not gonna play there.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.360]   But now there's been a bit of a big thing--
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.360]   - See, I went the other way.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.600]   - What did you do, Robert?
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.640]   - I said all my privacy settings, as public as they can be,
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.480]   in other words, I took all the sliders
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.280]   and made them as public as I could be.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.840]   - Well, I did that too.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.440]   But that's not the point.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.360]   I know the difference.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.480]   - I know, but therefore I behave in a way
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.320]   that I know it's gonna be as public as can be any.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.440]   Anyways, I mean, look at how we treat Steve Jobs, right?
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.840]   He emails people privately in a private email
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.160]   and we take his emails and post it on our blog.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.040]   - Yeah, I thought that was interesting
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.160]   'cause I hadn't really thought about that.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.800]   You posted this morning on your blog.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.840]   Why is it, 'cause Zuckerberg sent you an email,
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.320]   which we'll talk about in a bit,
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.280]   responding to this whole Facebook thing.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.040]   And you asked him for permission
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.440]   and noting in the blog post that
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.600]   why is it that others are so widely willing to publish
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.480]   their email exchanges with Steve Jobs as an example,
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.840]   isn't, shouldn't those be private as well?
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.080]   Now, I think it's pretty clear now that Steve understands
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:12.920]   that this is gonna get published.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.240]   He's been using it, frankly, as a megaphone.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.240]   - You know, we're public figures, right?
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.880]   That's different.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.040]   You know, the information about kind of
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.320]   what you're doing and who your friends are and so on,
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.640]   you've kind of all made that decision to do that.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.720]   Same with Steve Jobs.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.520]   And there's actually even something different at work
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.280]   when Steve Jobs emails you or me or Mark Zuckerberg does
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.880]   in that if you email someone as a reporter
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.440]   working for a journalistic organ and say,
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.720]   "Do you have a quote about this?"
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.320]   And then they send you an email back.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.720]   You shouldn't have to email them and say,
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.440]   "Do I have your permission to publish the quote
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.280]   "that you just gave me?"
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.120]   - I mean, that's interesting.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.520]   - Yeah, for sure, Mark had the expectation
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.760]   that you would publish it, Robert.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.840]   I think it's not wrong to ask for permission.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.680]   - Yeah.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.520]   - I'm glad you did.
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.360]   I think it's appropriate.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.560]   - Right after the F8 conference,
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.280]   in fact, he went through this quick negotiation.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.120]   Do you wanna have a chat with me,
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.000]   which will be a little bit more open
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   or do you wanna turn on your camera?
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.440]   And I find a lot of people really don't understand Mark
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.120]   and don't understand where he's coming from.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.800]   And so it'll be really interesting to see
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.400]   what he does this week.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.840]   'Cause I think he has a very intimate sense of privacy
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.840]   and where the world is going with this
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.840]   and where the Facebook is going and where the world is going.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.560]   And I haven't heard him speak about that openly
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.760]   and I wish he would.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.120]   I wish he would come out and just say,
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.560]   "Hey, here's my views on privacy
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.640]   "and here's where I messed up
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.880]   "because Facebook has been some ways
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.560]   "that are really interesting by ruining our trust."
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.560]   - Facebook's done some bad things.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.760]   They changed the policy multiple times.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.680]   Then they didn't communicate very effectively about it.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.280]   And I think that's really where they got in trouble.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.200]   They didn't say, "Didn't step forward as Google."
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.360]   I mean, look, Google had problems with Buzz.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.640]   Step forward, Google had problems
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.920]   with collecting this wifi data.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.240]   Step forward and spoke about it.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.440]   And I think diffused it.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.160]   Facebook has this ironic for a company
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.160]   that's promoting public has this very private point of view.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.520]   They're hunkered down.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.600]   Now here's what happened today.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.480]   And we can talk a little bit about this.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.840]   I got an email from the general manager
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.920]   of one of our radio stations.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.240]   I do a radio show that's heard in about 111 stations.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.760]   And one of them in Texas, KNOI,
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.200]   has two Facebook pages for the talk station
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.960]   and for the rock station,
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.480]   both of which were disabled.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.720]   And the general manager believes it was
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.720]   because he posted links to me deleting the Facebook page,
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.960]   links to Facebook privacy issues,
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.320]   and links to Diaspora.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.320]   One of the Kickstarter projects
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.560]   that purports to be an open replacement for Facebook
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.560]   for NYU students are starting it.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.160]   - On the other hand, I've linked to the same things
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.120]   and I'm probably-- - Well, it's inconsistent.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.920]   I mean, there's no question,
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.080]   look, there's no question that Facebook
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.440]   is deleting and censoring some people.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.160]   So I went on a rampage.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.680]   I said, "Look, there's one thing to change
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.520]   "at privacy policy."
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.640]   Another thing to actually actively disable
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.240]   or delete comments that are not favorable towards Facebook,
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.360]   they have the right to do it,
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.640]   but boy, you really wanna think now,
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.800]   do I wanna play in this space?
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.880]   This is actively, seems actively evil to me.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.720]   And then I asked our people,
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.360]   and the listeners in the audience,
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.240]   I said, "Let's see if this works."
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.680]   Post, I'm thinking of deleting my Facebook page.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.320]   I've found a link on how to do it
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.120]   in the WikiHow page on how to delete your Facebook page.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.760]   About half of our listeners reported
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.440]   that that post had disappeared within minutes
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.800]   of posting it.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.880]   About half said, "No, it's still there."
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.720]   - Yeah.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.560]   - I'm wondering if they have some weird spam bots,
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.440]   'cause every time I forget the political implications
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.920]   of deleting this content,
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.440]   I've heard this complaint over and over and over
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.960]   for the last three years,
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.280]   'cause remember, when I broke the terms of service,
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.200]   I got kicked off for 24 hours,
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   and so I've become a place to complain about,
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.880]   you know, getting your site--
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.200]   - They're not gonna mess with your site, Robert.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   That's a little too obvious.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.080]   - They deleted me for 24 hours,
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.360]   and later I found out it was an automatic bot
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.320]   that deleted me based on the behavior I was exhibiting.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.080]   And I wonder if that's what's going on here,
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.760]   is somebody's copying and pasting the URL
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.160]   or a same kind of text, and they're thinking it's spam,
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.640]   'cause every time I ask a Facebook staff for about this,
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.920]   they always come back and go,
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.760]   "Yeah, it sort of sucks that we don't have
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.320]   "a good way to get back on the system for normal people,
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.800]   "but we have no spam, right?
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.200]   "Our system has no spam like other systems."
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.000]   And it's like-- - Well--
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.840]   - Go ahead.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.280]   - It's like saying we built the system
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.680]   that works incredibly well, but fails very badly, right?
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.720]   Like our car goes zero to 60 in three seconds,
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.160]   but has no brakes, I mean--
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.760]   - But it does go fast.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.400]   - Yeah, it's not like God handed them two stone tablets
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.000]   that said thou shalt make a spam filter
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.880]   without a circuit breaker.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.480]   You know, someone sat down and said,
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.040]   "Yeah, spam filter with a circuit breaker
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.280]   "or cost more, be more difficult to administer.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.520]   "Let's leave that out."
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.160]   - I understand there's a problem though,
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.200]   when you have nearly half a billion users,
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.360]   I don't know how you do anything effectively,
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.960]   including sensors. - Well, maybe they don't do it
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.400]   effectively. - Right.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.280]   - Yeah, yeah, and so--
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.480]   - Well, the problem is all what you're saying earlier
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.200]   about Facebook and how they lost their trust,
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.680]   'cause there's something else that Facebook did,
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.840]   which is that they had a plebiscite of their users, right?
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.440]   They said to their users, what, you know,
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.160]   you provide all the value here,
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.920]   what do you think Facebook's privacy policy should be?
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.520]   What are you opting into when you opt into Facebook?
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.240]   And they let their users vote,
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.200]   and the users voted overwhelmingly
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.920]   for a much more private system
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.080]   than the one that they've just created.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.360]   So, you know, I think that if you wanna talk about
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.400]   losing trust, to me, that's the real trust loser.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.560]   - Yeah, and all these issues,
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.000]   I don't think have much to do with privacy,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.360]   because I'm seeing us give up our privacy
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.400]   in a whole range of context outside.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.800]   So, I think it's a trust issue,
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.400]   and that's why I wrote Zuckerberg.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.000]   I said, you know what, you're deleting sites,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   that's a trust issue.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.400]   I don't feel good about leaving my content on Facebook.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.160]   I don't believe you're gonna treat it properly
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.000]   in the future.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.160]   You might delete my identity or my business
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.360]   or my content, my pictures, and you've done that before.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.360]   So, you've already told me that you're not trustworthy.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.240]   And, you know, that's what I wanna hear.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.600]   The privacy stuff is points to trust.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.880]   Can we trust this company with our data?
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.000]   - So, that's the question,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.120]   and I guess what I'm saying to people is,
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.840]   just, this is these are all data points
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.760]   that are gonna help inform you decision
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.200]   about whether you wanna be on Facebook or not,
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.840]   but one thing's very clear,
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.040]   if I think this comes down to the conversation
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.480]   about an open web,
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.000]   and it's much better to have your presence
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.320]   on the web be something you control.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.160]   - Yeah.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.280]   - Look, let's face it, people don't go to Facebook
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.960]   to search for people, they search on Google
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.760]   and then get their Facebook page, yes or no?
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.760]   - I disagree, I actually--
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.960]   - Do you think people go to Facebook and search?
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.280]   - Brian Chen just tweeted that any journalist
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.400]   who quits Facebook is sacrificing access
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.080]   to a valuable resource for finally--
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.760]   - That's BS, that's BS, that's wrong.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.040]   - I disagree, I have a lot of people in my Facebook
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.800]   who are CEOs or CTOs or executives
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.200]   who put their phone number in Facebook
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   and email addresses in Facebook,
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.600]   and even if they don't,
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.920]   they answer their direct messages,
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.080]   it's hard to get a hold of some of these people,
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.800]   and so I understand where Brian's coming from there,
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.800]   I do use it on my iPhone to find phone numbers
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.640]   on my friends.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.720]   - Well, I would say then to people,
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.360]   if you're, if you're the weight,
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.720]   and by the way, this happens with Twitter too,
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.520]   there's Kevin Marks, the only way I can reach Kevin Marks
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.520]   is by DMing him on Twitter.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.040]   - That's wrong, I mean, that's just wrong, you know?
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.760]   If you have to use Facebook to reach somebody,
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.440]   then better not reach them.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.960]   If you have to use Twitter to reach somebody,
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.160]   then just, you know--
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.200]   - I just wanna say, you need an open web.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.040]   - You need an open web.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.960]   - Well, I just don't believe the CEO of a company
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.280]   can't be reached without Facebook.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.680]   I don't use Facebook, I've never really used Facebook.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.760]   I've never had any trouble reaching people
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.600]   that I wanted to give you.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.960]   - It just makes the friction of finding their phone number
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.680]   a lot lower, that's all.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.000]   - Yeah, but are you saying that--
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.160]   - I'm in a PR office of any major corporation and say,
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.800]   "Hi, you know, I'm writing a story for The Guardian,
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.920]   and I wanna comment from your CTO about this,
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.400]   that they won't get back to you very quickly?"
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.040]   - Absolutely, they probably will,
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.840]   but there's a little friction when I--
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.560]   - When I'm on my iPhone and calling people,
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.080]   you know, when Facebook bought Friend Feed, in fact,
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.560]   I had the two guys who owned Friend Feed on my--
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.440]   - I know, we couldn't get them on.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.360]   - And I just clicked on their phone number,
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.280]   and I had the first interview because I just clicked
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.080]   on their phone number and got their phone,
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.840]   and said, "Hey, can we talk in a public forum about this?"
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.640]   And I was walking around the Alamo,
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.320]   and that all happened, by the way.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.080]   - But so they talk on the public forum with you right then,
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.560]   or did you then set up an appointment?
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.480]   - No, I recorded the call, I said, can you--
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.680]   - Yeah, you wrote the call, that's cool.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.600]   - That was back when Paul and Brett were much more open.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.000]   I mean, you can't get them now,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.560]   you couldn't get that kind of access now, probably.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.120]   - No, because they have to check with you.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:21.960]   - They have to go through Facebook.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.440]   - They just say, "I can't talk on the record,"
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.400]   until you get the PR people to prove me to talk to you.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.320]   - They had just joined the company,
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.640]   they were still a little open.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.640]   And we never did get them because we didn't use those methods.
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.160]   But I would submit that if you wanna,
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.800]   I mean, I don't know if that's a reason to stay on Facebook,
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   maybe it is.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.120]   I mean, I'm not saying that it's not hideously useful,
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.480]   that's why I am saying that.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.120]   - On their hand, you know what I would know?
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:48.600]   - I interviewed a lot of people who are not in the tech world,
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.360]   and they just love it for being able to contact their friends
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.200]   and family. - I know.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.160]   - My wife, when I interviewed her about this,
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.840]   she said, "I really don't care about the privacy,
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.480]   "as long as something doesn't leak out, it has yet."
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.800]   But she said, "I love being able to talk
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.120]   "to my elementary school friends from Tehran
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.160]   "that she grew up with."
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.920]   She said they're all on Facebook, she said they're several,
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.600]   and that's the only place she could find them.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.360]   She went to Google and Yahoo and tried to search for them,
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.960]   and couldn't find them, but she found them instantly on Facebook.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.920]   - Abby's a freshman in college this fall
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.800]   and the all-incoming freshman have created a Facebook group
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.440]   where they're meeting each other before they go.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.040]   I'm not saying it's not useful.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.000]   In fact, very often, the most horrendous things are useful.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.480]   - And it's interesting. - What's the price?
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.600]   - It's interesting the degree to which this reverses
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.960]   the traditional dynamic for people like us
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.200]   who are using Facebook, presumably,
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.440]   for like to have a public profile,
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.760]   as opposed to people who are just using it
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.920]   to find their friends.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.040]   So traditionally, like if you had a service
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.120]   or a magazine or a media outlet
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.760]   that you use to kind of communicate
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.200]   with the rest of the world,
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.480]   the more important you were,
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.400]   the more they would rely on you.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.760]   So in other words, if you just talk to People Magazine
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.920]   and People Magazine, people buy People Magazine
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.120]   to see what you have to say every month,
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.840]   you have more leverage over People Magazine,
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.440]   the more people you have who care about you.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.720]   It's the opposite with Facebook.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.640]   With Facebook, the more people there are who care about you,
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.440]   the less you can afford to leave Facebook
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.880]   because of that walled garden nature,
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.840]   because it's much harder for them to follow you somewhere else.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.960]   It's a little like what happens with DRM and publishing,
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.920]   where the more as a publisher,
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.960]   if all of your music is sold through one DRM platform,
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.560]   or all your video, or all of your audiobooks,
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.680]   or all your books are sold through one DRM platform,
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.280]   leaving that DRM platform becomes much more expensive
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.680]   for you because you have to count on your listeners,
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.960]   or your readers, or your viewers,
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.320]   following you to a new platform,
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.400]   and that means that they have to abandon the old platform.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.720]   They can't take the media of yours
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.960]   that they bought with them.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:55.280]   - Mark did send you an email saying that this week,
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.360]   Facebook, they've been listening, they've been planning,
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.640]   they've been thinking and they're gonna make a shift,
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.760]   right, Robert, this week?
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:05.080]   - Yeah, he said basically that he wanted to wait
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.440]   until they had actually software fixes
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.240]   for some of the problems that they've been seeing
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.960]   people talk about, and that they just didn't want to talk
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.160]   and not have anything to show,
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.280]   which is a legitimate way to come at it.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.880]   I think he did himself a bunch of brand damage
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:25.880]   by not coming out earlier, but they'll survive.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.600]   If they make some good choices from here,
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.800]   and win our trust back and stop doing some of the stuff
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.520]   that they've been doing to shift stuff
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.680]   that we thought was private into the public sphere
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   without our permission, then I think they'll regain trust.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.760]   - I don't think that's why they'll survive.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.480]   'Cause there's no good alternative.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.760]   I think my space fell apart for far less
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.600]   because Facebook existed.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.240]   And if they resisted a good alternative to Facebook now
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.120]   that we're private and trustworthy,
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.640]   people would go there and that would be it.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.200]   Facebook would be over.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.760]   - It's other systems like PIPEO, Wall Street Journal,
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   I think we're not. - PIPEO is not
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.880]   an alternative to Facebook.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.280]   I like PIPEO. - Because nobody's on it.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.280]   - Well, yeah, it's kind of circular though, isn't it?
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.600]   I know there's a network effect, but Facebook started--
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.920]   - Remember you chase people to check you.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.520]   - If Facebook started at zero, things can start at zero,
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.600]   something does.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.080]   Are you saying Facebook's here forever, no matter what?
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.680]   - I don't, never is a long time.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.640]   - Five years?
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.400]   - I can't see a scenario where it falls apart
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.040]   in the next five years.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.920]   - I just don't. - So it's kind of like
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.080]   you're saying that the reason that they're giving out
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.240]   your personal information, like they change their privacy
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.920]   policy to give out personal information
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.720]   that they previously said they wouldn't
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.120]   is 'cause they had a technical error
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.960]   and they don't want to say anything about it
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.800]   until they fix the technical error.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.560]   - No, I think there's a couple different problems
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.000]   that they're working on.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.640]   And let's separate them out into the pieces.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.160]   One is they keep changing their privacy policies
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.920]   so often that you can't even keep track
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.240]   of what the policies were or what changed.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.840]   Even my wife said that, I get a message,
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.680]   she got a message two months ago
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.000]   that the policies had changed and then at F8 it,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.880]   they changed again and that causes a lot of people
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.760]   just to be confused, like why are they changing this so much?
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.800]   There's too much change about something
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.080]   that's so emotional for people.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.560]   So that's one slice.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.040]   The other slice is actually what they did,
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.680]   which at the FA Conference, which is they took stuff
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.920]   that used to be, that you used to be able to keep private.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.280]   For instance, your social graph and some of your
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.960]   profile information, like what music you listen to
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.720]   and what movies you like listening to or going to
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.680]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.440]   And they took that and made that public as well.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:54.280]   And then they also added a new feature
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.000]   or a new set of features, a new API
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.680]   and a new privacy construct where applications now
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.000]   could share that information with each other.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.240]   For instance, I got the new Pandora that night
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.720]   and wow, all my friends were there on Pandora
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.600]   with all of the music.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.000]   And so I could see, oh, Leo LaPorte listens to Black Eyed Peas
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.600]   or you know, or Dana Boyd listens to this thing
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.160]   and my boss was listening to Kenny G
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.080]   and I made fun of him in a blog post.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.000]   And that was unexpected.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.120]   So those three separate buckets of things
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.640]   are all going at one time.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:39.640]   And so that caused the firestorm and the media frenzy
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.280]   around this.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.280]   - So I guess the thing that I'm skeptical of is that
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.320]   they couldn't have said something about the privacy
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.160]   policy change 'cause it caught them off guard.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.440]   I mean, I don't understand how something that you do
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.720]   can catch you off guard, right?
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.400]   No one's surprised them by changing their privacy policy.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.080]   - No, the reaction is what surprised them.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.240]   - Well, yeah, but presumably like they knew what they
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.000]   were doing when they did it 'cause they obviously
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.400]   said last year in which the user said, don't do this
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.360]   and then they did it and then their users were upset
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.360]   to say, oh, we had no idea and we can't say anything
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.600]   for a while until we figure this all out.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.200]   Just seems to me to be like a kind of lame excuse.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.640]   And in terms of the privacy.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.720]   - Sorry, I'm about to answer.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.560]   - Sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.400]   - Go ahead.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.720]   - I still put Dan Bora.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.040]   - Being so complicated, you know, I reviewed this book
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.840]   on Boimong back in 2007 called How To Cheat It Everything
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.280]   by Summit Level, which it's actually a book about
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.520]   how not to be cheated.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.680]   But one of the things he talks about is how proposition
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.280]   that's worked like, you know, double or nothing
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.680]   if this happens, triple if that happens and so on.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.920]   And he basically is can boil it down.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.560]   It's like anytime someone makes a proposition to you
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.760]   that's really complicated, the reason that they made it
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.120]   that complicated is to make it hard for you to figure out
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.160]   what the odds are.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.560]   And anytime someone presents you with a bunch of privacy
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.480]   options that are incredibly complicated, I think the reason
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.520]   that they do that is to make it hard for you to figure out
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.480]   what you're agreeing to.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.960]   - Some of the, yeah, some of this argument comes down to
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.240]   trying to understand they're intent.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.080]   And of course, some of us impute their intent to be not so nice.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.400]   And some of us say, like you Robert say, well, you know,
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.680]   they're trying and I don't know, do we need to know their
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.440]   intent to know whether we wanna be part of Facebook?
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.920]   Seems to me that what's happened is sufficient,
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.800]   whether their intent is good or ill, what's happened is
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.120]   sufficient for me to say, I don't really wanna be there
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.640]   'cause I can't trust them to do the right thing,
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.480]   whether intentionally or not.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.240]   And I'm also really seriously concerned about this open
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.800]   graph, this open, the social graph thing they're doing.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.080]   'Cause it really strikes me, they're trying to co-opt the web.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.520]   They would love. - Oh, they absolutely are.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.440]   I wrote the post I wrote that night after a fate,
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.800]   wasn't even focused so much on privacy 'cause I don't think
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.200]   we had time to even think about it then.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.480]   But I said, man, these are ambitious moves.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.080]   And everybody at the press conference was using words
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.480]   like scary and ambitious and off camera, they would make fun
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.240]   of, they would say, man, Zuckerberg has balls,
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.240]   he's going for it all.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.880]   And they would joke around like that.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.200]   - Yeah, it seemed to me a grab.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.240]   And again, I don't know what the intent was,
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.600]   but I don't think I need to know what the intent was.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.840]   I don't think it's good for the internet.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:11.840]   - The intent is, clearly Facebook is headed toward an IPO
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:17.160]   and to get to an IPO and maximize the profit there,
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.560]   they have to turn on a new kind of advertising
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.320]   that's beyond banner advertising.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.080]   'Cause I'm not paying attention to any banner ads.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.600]   I couldn't tell you the last time I've even paid attention
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.040]   to any ads on the side of Facebook or anywhere, really.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:35.040]   So where is the future money in advertising?
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.440]   And I think Google showed us where it is, it's in search,
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.480]   it's in telling people or asking the system,
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.480]   show me all the restaurants in Half Moon Bay,
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.080]   and then having an offer in there.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.080]   A phase four square is showing us offers now,
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.640]   it's really interesting.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.320]   And I think that's where the money is,
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.440]   and Zuckerberg knows that's where the money is
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.360]   and needs to push his company in that direction,
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.760]   which means get out of a private system
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.960]   because he's not gonna be able to make any money there.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.480]   - That's where the fundamental problem is.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.360]   People joined Facebook with one promise
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.960]   that I was gonna, I can post stuff here
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.560]   and it's gonna stay private and I control who gets to see it.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.000]   And all Facebook really would need to do
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.920]   is to make it that way, to make it an opt out,
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.280]   or opt in situation where it's private
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.760]   unless you say otherwise.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.640]   That would solve a lot of people's issues
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.800]   but it would not solve their ultimate corporate,
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.640]   and I agree with you, Robert,
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.080]   they're ultimate corporate goal,
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.680]   and they've taken this chance,
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.200]   and it's a big chance, they know what they're doing,
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.560]   they've taken a very large,
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.520]   - Sorry, when I plug my phone,
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.480]   my phone battery is dying,
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.480]   when I plug it in, it makes that horrible noise.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.680]   - I love it, they're taking a very large chance,
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.120]   and they know they're gonna get flack, this is the flack.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:47.320]   And what they're hoping is that they're almost 500 million
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.640]   users will insulate and the network effect,
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.280]   will insulate them against that flack,
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.240]   they'll be able to make this very big sea change
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.480]   in privacy and survive it on the other end,
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.200]   maybe depleted but not bowed and continue on.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.000]   - I've had, it's funny because I've gone the other way,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.120]   I've actually used Facebook more in the past couple of weeks
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.120]   because of things like the Pandora.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.760]   - I can't look at Facebook now, it just makes me queasy,
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.720]   I'm sorry, I don't miss it, I don't miss it, I have to say.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:15.920]   Go ahead, Corey.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.320]   - I'd be interested in knowing how many users Facebook
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.720]   actually has 'cause we all know what the user game looks like,
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.560]   right?
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.840]   500 million people at some point had a Facebook account
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.880]   is not the same thing as that a 500 million people
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.160]   who are active Facebook users.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.640]   - Are they claim actors? - Are they very specific
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.200]   when they play active?
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   - They're very specific about when they do the last month,
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.520]   I think is what they're saying, right, whatever.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.400]   - Yeah, there's people who have signed in in the past month,
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.680]   they actually have many times more than 500 million
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.760]   who have signed into the system and left it,
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.120]   or just left their account life out.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:52.120]   - Just signed in just mean that they've got a cookie
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.440]   or designed and that that hits and advertising,
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.280]   you know, cookies, open, and all the web.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.120]   - I don't know because that's an interesting question
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.680]   because of the likes and things that are spraying now
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:05.360]   out over the web, but these numbers were before likes came out,
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.680]   so.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.520]   - Maybe they've got phone or million.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.880]   It's just, those numbers, whatever I hear,
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.040]   giant numbers, I've always reminded,
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.000]   I think as Kevin Marks said, a giant number,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.200]   an imaginary number multiplied by a giant number
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.760]   is always a very big number.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.000]   - I know I was in Tel Aviv after F8
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.920]   and people there are very excited about Facebook.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.720]   They were wearing the Facebook like buttons
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.440]   that conferences and handing them out as stickers and stuff.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.160]   There's a lot of people on Facebook,
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.000]   whether it's 400 million or 200 million,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.040]   or, you know, there's a lot of people who are on Facebook
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.120]   that aren't on other things.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.200]   - It's pretty obvious that there's a lot of people,
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.960]   I don't know how many a lot is,
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.920]   it's pretty obvious and that in itself scares me
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.600]   because I think more and more people,
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.880]   it's just like AOL are seeing Facebook as the web,
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.040]   just as they used to see AOL as the internet,
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.680]   now they're seeing Facebook as the internet
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:57.160]   and that's, to me, this is retrograde,
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.000]   this is a regression to an older walled garden model
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.320]   of the internet that I don't wanna see.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.120]   - It's a weird walled garden now,
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.040]   you know, answers.com, for instance,
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.200]   which is the 18th largest website,
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:13.120]   put the like buttons all on every answer
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:18.120]   and that's not the old AOL like walled garden
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.160]   where you had to pay to get into the walled garden,
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.200]   but it's a new kind of walled garden
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.080]   that I think we're still wrapping our heads around.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:29.600]   It's not like AOL, it's something new, which is fascinating.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.480]   - Yeah, I wanna move on a little bit,
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.520]   any final thoughts before we go to the next topic,
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:38.440]   which is Google I/O, Corey, bottom line of course.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.280]   You're good?
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.120]   (laughs)
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:40.960]   - I'm good, you said it's good.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.160]   - You know, it's funny 'cause I'm not a Facebook user,
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.960]   so I wasn't a Facebook user before,
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.080]   I'm especially not a Facebook user now,
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.800]   but it's not, you know, I kind of looked at this
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.080]   and I went, hey look, someone invented a Skinner box
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.560]   to teach you how to undervalue your privacy, wow.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.560]   (laughs)
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:01.080]   And ran away, so I'm not, you know,
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.240]   I don't have a very nuanced view of it, I'm afraid,
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.560]   'cause I didn't spend a lot of time there,
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.200]   but I am very skeptical of the idea
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.840]   that you can't do work as a journalist without Facebook.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.680]   - I hope not.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.640]   I guess if you're like freaked out about getting scoops,
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.720]   which I've never actually seen the point of,
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:18.440]   then maybe, but, you know, I've been a print journalist
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.160]   and a web journalist now for more than half my life,
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:25.880]   and, you know, I've never used Facebook for it, so.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.400]   - Yeah, luckily for our industry,
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.920]   Twitter has gotten become predominant.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.720]   - I don't trust them either, by the way, I just want to make.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.120]   - Well, yeah, you know.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.120]   (laughs)
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.360]   They're very willing to stab you in the back
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.640]   when you're not looking at--
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.760]   - You know, it's funny, I do trust to have more
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.800]   than I trust Mark, and mostly it's because, I mean,
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.040]   it's, Twitter was never private in any respect.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:48.880]   You know, I mean, I guess you could have
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.080]   a private Twitter account, but nobody who uses Twitter really--
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.440]   - But GMs are private, right?
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.200]   If you took all of our DMs and put them in public spare.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.240]   - I always treated Twitter as an absolutely public place,
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.600]   and so what's the risk?
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.440]   What's the harm?
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.280]   You know what you're doing when you're on Twitter,
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.080]   and that's the issue for me,
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.120]   is that Facebook made it the opposite promise initially.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.080]   We'll talk more in just a bit.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.960]   I am very excited about some of the announcements
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.960]   from Google, Robert, you were there at Google I/O this week,
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.800]   and we'll talk about that,
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.640]   and you got your new Evo phone.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.840]   Well, you got a good deal, because for $400
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.680]   to go to that conference,
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.200]   you get a Motorola Droid,
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.040]   and then they surprise you at the keynote
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.000]   and give everybody an Evo as well.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.280]   - Yeah, I didn't, actually it was a Nexus one
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.720]   that they handed out, so they handed the attendees
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:29.320]   two phones, and the press people only got one, so.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.320]   (laughs)
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.280]   That's how I react.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.840]   I can't use a T-Mobile phone, so I didn't want to miss it.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.840]   - Oh, you're in Half Moon Bay, there's no T-Mobile?
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.080]   - No T-Mobile in my house.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.320]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.560]   - I love my Nexus one, I have to say it's a wonderful--
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.120]   - Me too. - Yeah.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:42.960]   - Me too.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.440]   Have you put Froyo on it yet, the 2.2, Corey?
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.160]   - No, I'm not doing any OS upgrades,
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.200]   while I'm on a book tour.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.040]   - I guess you're right.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.560]   - That is just asking the fates to come along
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.200]   and just kick your ass.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.920]   So I'm one version of Ubuntu back,
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.280]   I'm one version of Android back.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.400]   - Oh, you're gonna love Lucid Links,
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.080]   I think they really hit the ball at the point.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.600]   10.04 is just really slick.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.360]   - I can never remember what the acronym is,
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.920]   I always know that it goes up by one letter,
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.800]   so it starts with an L, L, L, L,
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.880]   but it starts with an L.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.400]   I've been calling it like leap and lizard.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.920]   - I know me too, I can't remember either.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.880]   I know it's some animal and it's some adjective,
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:20.720]   that's all in.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.520]   - Crazy kangaroo and yeah.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.680]   - Hey, let me briefly talk about our friends
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:26.800]   at Citrix and the Great Product,
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.720]   go to meeting and then we're gonna get on with the show.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:32.280]   You know, we figured out a way to survive on advertising,
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.080]   it's just forcing you to listen to it.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.960]   As we go through the show, just listen,
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.760]   it's okay, let it wash over you.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.480]   And this might be a good time if you wanna get a snack
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.680]   or whatever, 'cause I have a feeling
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.520]   we got a lot to talk about.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.360]   - I gotta go to the bathroom.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.400]   - Go to the bathroom, there you go, exactly,
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.640]   that's what this is all about.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.840]   Go to the bathroom right now
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.440]   and while I talk about go to meeting,
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.760]   I go to meeting, see, go to meeting
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.440]   is so great because you can do things like,
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.520]   not wear any pants the next time you're at a business meeting.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:05.240]   You can, because go to meeting makes it possible to meet
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.080]   over the phone, you're having a conference call
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.080]   but something to make it visual.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.080]   Robert, you could use this for,
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.120]   I think for some of your interviews,
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.760]   we use it now more and more on the shows
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.960]   as people can show stuff.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.160]   I just love it, whenever somebody wants to have a meeting,
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.920]   I say, let's have a go to meeting instead.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.840]   And I want you to try it free for 30 days right now,
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.200]   go to gotomeeting.com/twit.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.920]   You can meet with the people you wanna work with
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.760]   whether they're across town or across the country,
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.040]   even around the world, bring them closer together,
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:36.880]   collaborate, demonstrate, train, present.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.640]   It includes VoIP, the new iPad,
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.080]   I'm not gonna say this while Corey's not around,
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.880]   the new iPad app is so slick,
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:45.240]   I know he's not an iPad fan, it is so slick.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.160]   I took it out in the backyard with Wi-Fi,
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.400]   it's kind of microphone in the audio,
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.920]   oh here he comes, I won't mention that.
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.040]   Don't say the onward.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.960]   Go to meeting.com, brought to you by Citrix,
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.160]   try it today for 30 days, absolutely free,
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.640]   go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.800]   Thank you, sir, for their support of this weekend tech.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.640]   I was just saying--
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.480]   I'm good for the next half hour.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.760]   Good. (laughs)
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.680]   No more tea.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.120]   I was just saying, you wrote an article,
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.080]   "Why I Won't Buy an iPad?"
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:12.120]   This was in January, and why you shouldn't either.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.840]   Have you changed your tune, Corey Doctorum?
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.280]   No, it was in April actually.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:21.280]   And so, a lot of people they said, well,
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.280]   you've got all these points about the ecosystem of the iPad,
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.840]   but wait, you hold the gadget, it's an amazing gadget.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.040]   And so I've held a couple, I've played with a couple.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.720]   People keep bringing them, there you go.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:35.040]   People keep bringing them to my signings and stuff,
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.520]   and I pick it up and I go, yes,
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.440]   this is a moderately well assembled piece
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.320]   of South Chinese electronics,
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:44.560]   waiting for you in 18 months,
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.680]   we'll look back on this and we'll go,
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.200]   wow, that looks really anachronistic,
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.560]   like those old toilet seat iMacs.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.400]   You think so?
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.240]   Really?
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.080]   I'm shut up.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:52.920]   Of course it will.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.960]   This is Apple's special genius, really,
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.480]   is that they design a device that will be obsolete
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.320]   in 18 months and will be aesthetically obsolete in 18 months,
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.160]   so that you're--
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.600]   Just like Detroit.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:03.520]   It's like phoenix.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.360]   Exactly.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.560]   You take your iPod out of the box and you look at it and you go,
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.760]   oh my god, this is the most futuristic device I've ever owned.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.440]   You remember the first ones that were kind of the size
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.400]   of a, of like a dove bar?
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.120]   And then after like a year, you know,
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.520]   they come with one that's half the size,
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.360]   the double capacity and half the price.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.880]   And you look at this thing, and first of all,
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:24.560]   the industrial finish is designed to be kind of wear off
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.960]   pretty quickly, so you know, the--
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.960]   You know, it doesn't look dull.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.760]   Yeah, it looks dull.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:29.400]   It gets all scratchy.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.600]   You know, I just got this new like a tiny little leatherman
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:31.960]   tool.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.800]   You can carry one of these in your pocket for like two years,
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.960]   and they don't scratch at all, but somehow they can't figure
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.880]   out how to make the back of your iPod out of that.
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.080]   You know, you look at it cross-eyed, and it looks like--
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.680]   You're saying this is intentional.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.640]   This is industrial design.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.560]   I think so.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.920]   Design obsolescence.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.320]   You can see when you dump it in the garbage can a year later,
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.280]   two years later.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.480]   Same reason, then, probably that they don't let you change
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.920]   batteries that just encourages you after two years of charges.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.400]   Own it for longer, yeah.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:02.560]   Yeah, I mean, so I never had that aesthetic for sawing,
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.840]   right, where I picked it up, and I was like, oh, wow,
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.360]   this is the best design device ever.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.240]   I picked it up, and I was like, it's a skinny big phone.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.240]   I have an Nexus One.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.200]   It's like if you took an Nexus One and made it a lot bigger,
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.880]   you'd have one of these.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.840]   And there is no such thing as an iPad without its ecosystem.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.120]   The iPad basically only exists to the extent
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.760]   that it's embedded in all these software services
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.840]   and subscriptions and so on.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.840]   And so you can think of it as just
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.960]   like a physical extrusion of this big set of policies
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.920]   and commercial arrangements and so on.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.760]   And those policies and commercial arrangements
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.120]   are actually a lot uglier than the device.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.200]   And so given that we're going to throw the device away
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.000]   in a year and buy another device, and the only thing
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.120]   that's going to endure the policies and the underpinnings,
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:50.000]   that's the thing that I think we should be paying attention to.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.320]   And I just don't understand how anyone can defend it.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.520]   I mean, is there anyone who really thinks that like,
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.560]   there's a boiler room full of prudes big enough
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.400]   to evaluate everything that someone might want
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.280]   to deliver to your device and make good decisions about it?
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.560]   - Apparently, yeah, Apple thinks so.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.440]   - I mean, we've got even bigger boiler rooms full of prudes
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.200]   that try to figure out what, you know, web pages
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.040]   you should be able to look at in schools and libraries.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.360]   And we all know how screwed up they are.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.080]   And if you don't, just ask your kids.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:18.480]   So, you know, human evaluation of stuff
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.600]   doesn't scale very well.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.760]   And, you know, to the extent that it's like,
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.480]   that Apple wants to make sure
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.160]   that they've contained the experience,
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.480]   I don't understand how that's at odds with a checkbox
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.800]   that says, I'm a grown up, let me choose something different.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.960]   I mean, that's what my Android phone is.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.600]   - Steve Jobs' response to that is,
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.680]   well, you have a choice.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.280]   You don't have to buy Apple products.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.840]   We think that there's a group of consumers
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.800]   who will prefer that kind of control environment.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.720]   - Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:46.400]   You shouldn't, it shouldn't be illegal to sell iPads.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.040]   I think that you should just not buy an iPad
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.280]   because I think it's a bad idea.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.120]   And one of the ways that people make decisions
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:54.600]   about whether or not to buy devices,
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.920]   people talk about it in public.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.640]   You know, I've never said, we should have a law
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.800]   that prohibits making iPads.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:04.040]   I've said, you should think about how the iPad works
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.680]   and all the stuff that's not obvious
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:06.880]   when you take it out of the box,
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:10.360]   like all that ecosystem stuff that's kind of hard to see
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.720]   and make your decision accordingly.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.400]   I am in accord with Steve on this.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.160]   I do have one small quibble with him,
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:20.120]   which is that by adding just like a one Adam thick layer
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.280]   of DRM to the iPad, you know,
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.600]   it wasn't good enough to stop someone
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.320]   from breaking the DRM, it was Brooklyn within 24 hours.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.360]   They've basically gotten for themselves the legal right
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.320]   to stop you from breaking your iPad
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.000]   and installing other stuff on it.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.760]   So, you know, my friend Joel Johnson
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.720]   wrote a response to that editorial
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.120]   where he said, you know, I can't hack my dishwasher either.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.040]   I can't make stuff with my dishwasher.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.080]   And someone tweeted later, you know,
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.600]   I can't hack my toaster,
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.760]   but no one ever designed a dishwasher
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.400]   where it was illegal to make dishes
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.600]   that fit in the dishwasher
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.600]   unless you had the manufacturer's permission.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.160]   And no one ever designed a dishwasher
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.800]   where it was illegal to put those dishes in the dishwasher.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.080]   No one ever designed a toaster
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:02.200]   where only one company got to make the bread for it.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.040]   Apple has done that.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.480]   And we're not talking about something as trivial
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.760]   as toasters or bread.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.720]   We're talking about, you know, culture and information
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.040]   and communications tools,
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.480]   which I think we should deal with, you know,
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:14.640]   treat with a lot more gravitas than bread or dishes.
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.120]   - Yeah, I think it's a very good point.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.480]   I happen to love my iPad, but, you know,
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.520]   I also love other things that are bad for me, like, you know.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.960]   - Krispy Kreme. - Krispy Kreme, don't.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.000]   - That's exactly.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.920]   - Yeah, you're making bad decisions about something
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.560]   in the present where the consequences happen.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.880]   - Long-term consequences. - Long-term consequences.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.840]   Much harder to see.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.640]   And I've never been good at long-term consequences.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.320]   However, I have to say, after watching the speeches
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:38.280]   at Google I/O and playing with the EVO
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.360]   and taking a look, by the way,
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.880]   the EVO is just a little bit bigger than the Nexus One.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.600]   And just even a little bit more size there
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:46.640]   makes it really good.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.360]   You can read on it.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.600]   I mean, I just, it's really...
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.680]   So I'm actually, in a way, I think that it's kind of interesting
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:58.280]   to see we have these two groups now,
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.840]   kind of fighting it out, Apple and Google.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:02.960]   And you have it, and you do have a choice.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.480]   And I think there will be Android tablets
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.840]   that might have all the functionality of the iPad.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.200]   - In fact, I talked to Sergey Brann at Google I/O
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.920]   and he's very passionate about tablets
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:16.040]   and obviously has an iPad and is studying it very closely.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:21.560]   - But just before I go down that road, Corey...
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.400]   - Okay, do you have any problems with Google?
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.480]   - Yeah, it's funny.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.760]   So I started off, like I think a lot of us,
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.200]   I was very enthusiastic about Google
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.000]   when it was like two guys at Stanford
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.400]   and some computers built out a Lego under a desk, right?
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.960]   And we were all like, "Wow, they're running Linux
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.320]   "and they're doing something that's so much better
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.720]   "than Alta Vista and it's great."
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.680]   And then I got very enthusiastic for them
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:40.880]   when they started to do really well.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.960]   And then I started to feel kind of ambivalent about them
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.200]   when they started to go down DRM
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.360]   and privacy violating roads
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.880]   and then I started to feel really kind of hostile
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.480]   to them when they started emitting
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.440]   this really self-serving BS about,
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.560]   "Oh, we've gone into China, we're censoring results."
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.880]   But that's only because getting results
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.280]   that the pull-up you didn't want you to see
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.760]   would be a bad user experience,
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.400]   which is like the most crazy thing I ever heard anyone say.
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.960]   And then I went back to kind of ambivalent about them
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.640]   and now I'm feeling pretty enthusiastic
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.200]   about them between 100 gigabit ethernet
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:15.200]   or gigabit ethernet through in towns,
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.800]   gigabit municipal broadband,
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.560]   totally like messing up the little cartelism
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:25.560]   of the phone companies and with Android and with the G1
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.480]   and just kind of generally pursuing an open
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.000]   and neutral net more or less
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.680]   and standing up to bullies like Viacom with YouTube.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.640]   I feel like they're being a force for good these days.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.000]   I'm pretty happy about it.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.440]   The China thing was really interesting
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.240]   because I talked to a lot of really senior Googlers I knew
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:44.640]   about China and they said,
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.200]   "Yeah, that story you've heard about
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.920]   "Sercate brand rolling in a bed one morning
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:51.080]   "and going, oh my God, my company is being used
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:54.360]   "to like help arrest dissidents and harvest their organs
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.760]   "for party members.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.360]   "I can't do that anymore."
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.200]   Or just not gonna do that anymore.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.040]   - Wow, that's great.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:48:59.880]   - Yeah.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.720]   - You think that's true?
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:01.560]   - And they all say it's true.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:05.280]   They all say, and either he's really good at duping his employees
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.680]   or it's true, which would be pretty cool.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:12.280]   I have to say I'm a big fan of the Android operating system.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.280]   I think they made some big announcements there.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.920]   It's interesting, isn't it, that Vic Condorta,
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:21.880]   Condorta, Condorta, Condorta, who made the,
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.080]   both did very well, I think on both Kino's
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.600]   despite some real technical issues,
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.960]   especially in the second Kino.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.400]   Really took some potshots at Apple in the second,
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.760]   on the Thursday keynote.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:36.560]   It was very clear that a lot of what the Android 2.2 release
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.240]   was about was fighting back.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.440]   And made a big deal about flash availability.
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:45.160]   I'm not sure that's exactly something I go crazy over.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:48.000]   Yes, you can run flash now on your Nexus One.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.360]   Although thanks to Apple, you don't see a lot of sites,
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.840]   mobile sites with flash on it anymore.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.720]   - Yeah, well, with Vic, he uses every sword
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.040]   that some may hands him.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:01.320]   I thought he was channeling Corey actually on stage.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.160]   - Really?
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:05.240]   He did a good job and it was exciting.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:10.240]   I think the roadmap for Android looks very exciting.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.920]   - Yeah, you know, Free Software often goes down
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:18.280]   like a slow-code path, something Daniel Bryan coined.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:24.080]   It's what happened with Mozilla where there was a lot of hype
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.920]   and then nothing happened for a long time.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.280]   Then all of a sudden, bam, there was this amazing world
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.840]   class browser that just kind of seemed to appear for no reason.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:33.240]   - I remember even saying, what happened to the Mozilla project?
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.240]   Did Netscape open source?
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.080]   - Exactly.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:38.400]   - Yeah, J.D. Zwinski went and opened a nightclub.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.240]   It's all over.
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.440]   So I have a theory kind of about all of this stuff,
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:44.160]   about mobile content and about tablets and so on,
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:48.520]   is that anything where there's an enormous amount of hope
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:52.280]   and hype about what a device or technology means
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.840]   for the future of an industry,
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:59.840]   it's very hard to do iterative, fast, smart development.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:03.400]   So here's what I mean by iterative, fast, smart development.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.720]   When I was dating the woman who's now my wife, Alice,
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:10.720]   I was on the board of a company called Ludicorp,
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.680]   the advisory board and they made a little flash game.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.680]   That was really fun.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.600]   Alice lived in London, I lived in San Francisco,
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.120]   we had this long distance relationship.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.200]   And one day the founder of Ludicorp came over
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.600]   to my place in San Francisco and said,
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:21.520]   how's it going with Alice?
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.160]   And I said, you know, it's going great
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.240]   and we share these photos of our days as we go through the day
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.640]   but it's a pain to do it.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.720]   And he said, oh, we've got photo sharing coming in the game.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.560]   We'll accelerate that feature and people really liked it.
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:33.800]   So they were revving the game a lot, like every 30 minutes.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.680]   And eventually that feature grew to eclipse the game
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.240]   and they retitled the service flicker.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.080]   - Yeah.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:38.920]   - Right.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:39.760]   That's what iteration looks like.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.560]   You know, a user has an idea, you do a lot of stuff,
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.600]   something happens and no one's looking over your shoulder
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.320]   going, are you sure that's a good idea?
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.680]   You know, maybe we should have a meeting,
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.040]   let's have some business development before that happens.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.480]   Meanwhile, if you try to do anything with say e-books
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.960]   in a publishing house, as soon as you like whisper the word
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:59.240]   epoch anywhere in the building, everybody runs up
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:01.280]   and tries to make sure that whatever it is that you do
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.560]   since it's definitely going to be the future of the company
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.440]   because it's e-books, whatever it is you do
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.120]   isn't going to undermine their little corner
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.720]   of the publishing empire.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.720]   And that means that you spend six months in meetings
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.360]   making sure you don't offend anyone
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.120]   and you produce something that's ultimately really
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.840]   inoffensive and when nobody likes it,
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.760]   you can't produce something different the next day
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.560]   because you've got to get everyone to buy in again.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.040]   And as a result, all the mobile content offerings
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.800]   I've seen, you know, with like for some values of all
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.000]   have just been crap.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.240]   And all the tablet stuff has been really slow moving
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.280]   and not very interesting.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.840]   You know, nobody wants to take big risks
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:35.880]   in case the risk that they take costs in the business.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:40.440]   Well, if something like Android is open and freely available,
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.680]   doesn't that encourage some interesting hardware stuff?
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.400]   Yeah, totally.
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.480]   And that's what I think we've got, you know,
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:51.000]   without, if you don't have to worry about what happens
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.680]   when you ship apart from whether people like it or not,
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:56.800]   not whether, you know, some company will approve of it,
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.640]   then you've got a lot fewer steps to making a revision
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.320]   and another revision and another revision.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.480]   And let's you go really quickly.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:07.480]   And so that's what I hope will happen with Android
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.160]   is that people will be able to be more nimble
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.560]   with their technology offerings.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:14.040]   Corey, Corey, the place that I really was excited
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:16.240]   was the video codec, the M8.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.840]   Let's talk about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:22.840]   I want to talk about M web M, which VBA and Digital TV2
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:26.480]   in just a second because there was a lot from Google
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.960]   that this week, a lot to digest.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.840]   In fact, so much that some of it was leaking out from Google
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.840]   in the blogs and so forth before they even made it
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.160]   to the keynote, some of it never even made it to the keynote.
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.800]   So this was a big week for Google.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.480]   We'll also, we've got our lightning round coming up
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:44.480]   and including a 23,000 member reply all email.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.480]   (laughing)
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.440]   Just one more reason you don't want to do a reply all
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.360]   before we do that though.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:54.920]   You may Corey, if you wish, find a place to go to the bathroom,
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:56.640]   anything you'd like to do right now is Robert,
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.680]   go right ahead.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.720]   As they used to say, the smoking lamp is on,
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:00.720]   smoke them if you've got them.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.760]   I got, you're going to go look at the room service menu.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:04.080]   - Yeah, do that.
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.520]   Your check code just asks, what is this monitor?
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.200]   It's an Apple 24 inch monitor on the side.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:12.440]   Ergatron arm and you can turn it left or right
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:17.440]   and the Mac OS X software lets you go vertical or horizontal.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:21.800]   - So you have on one computer, you have a horizontal landscape
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.360]   and a portrait display.
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:25.360]   So you put the web pages on the portrait display
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.160]   and the spreadsheets on the video.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:28.560]   - Yeah, this is just a 27 inch eye
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:31.800]   and I have a 24 inch monitor on its side.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:32.640]   - Nice. - It's really nice.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.920]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.080]   - How you backing that up?
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:38.280]   - All over the internet.
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:39.720]   (laughing)
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.320]   - The reason I ask Carbonite has a great solution for Macs.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.680]   Now this is not for Macs, this is the business solution
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:48.600]   and Windows only right now but it is backed
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.520]   by the same great Carbonite service.
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:53.160]   It's Carbonite Pro for small business.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.040]   You've heard me talk about Carbonite over the years.
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.040]   The service it backs up your PC or Mac files
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.280]   remotely, automatically, encrypted
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.200]   so that if you were in a disaster mode,
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.040]   forest, fire, flood, earthquake tornado
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.680]   and you've lost your backups locally,
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:10.560]   you are not down for the count.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.400]   I'm gonna put Carbonite on my daughter's laptop
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.840]   before she goes to a college this fall of course.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:16.920]   But what about business?
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:18.520]   Carbonite found a lot of business users
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:21.000]   were using the consumer grade Carbonite
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.440]   because there wasn't anything similar for a small business.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:26.200]   Well now there is Carbonite Pro.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.520]   Why don't you try Carbonite Pro for free for 30 days?
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:31.040]   Just go to CarbonitePro.com.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:31.920]   You'll be very impressed.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.000]   The central dashboard that lets you
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.840]   back up your entire enterprise,
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.080]   your users can restore themselves.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:42.400]   You don't have to come begging you for their old files.
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:45.160]   You do get a status report on all the backups
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.920]   you're able to restore as you choose yourself.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.800]   Prices start as low as $10 a month
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:51.280]   and I'll give you an example.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.520]   If you have eight computers, five gigabytes of backup,
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.920]   25 bucks a month, that's all.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.200]   10 computers with five gigs, $50 a month.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.880]   That's $10 to $50 a month for peace of mind for you
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:04.200]   and your employees, your files are safe,
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.680]   encrypted, off-site at the sophisticated data centers.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:08.680]   Carbonite's just great.
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.720]   I have used them for a long time now
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.240]   and I encourage you to do the same.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.040]   Whether it's Carbonite for your home
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:15.240]   or Carbonite Pro for your business,
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.920]   try if CarbonitePro for you right now.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:19.560]   CarbonitePro.com.
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.480]   I thank them so much for their support
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:24.120]   of the entire TWIT network.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:27.000]   And I do make it my motto, backup.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.440]   You gotta backup to get it back.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.840]   Somebody in our audience has a Evo here.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:33.680]   I can't wait.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:34.960]   I'm really excited about this.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.760]   The only negative though, I'm a little disappointed.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.320]   You can't put 2.2 on it because it's got that sprints,
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:43.320]   I mean, sorry, the HTC Sense UI on top of it.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.000]   So they have to upgrade that.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.680]   Robert, do you like the Sense UI?
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:49.040]   - Yeah.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:50.840]   - I suppose to just like the Nexus one.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.880]   Vanilla Droid.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.440]   - Yeah, it doesn't bother me too much.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.040]   It was pretty similar in most places.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.600]   - And there's some elegant stuff that looks nice.
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:01.640]   And Corey, what is that?
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:04.280]   It's K9 that you recommend is an email tool
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:07.880]   on the Android operating system.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.800]   - Oh, wait, I've turned it down.
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:09.640]   Go ahead.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:10.720]   K9. - Can you hear me?
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:11.560]   - Yeah, I turned you down.
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.400]   I'm sorry. - Yeah.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.240]   Sorry.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.960]   K9's like an industrial strength fork
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.600]   of the mailer that comes with Android.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:19.840]   - It's a pretty good pop client.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.120]   I always use pop.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:23.280]   I just wanted to say I'm with you on this backup stuff.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.760]   I'm not a, I don't use carbonite
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:26.760]   'cause I'm not a Windows user,
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:31.200]   but I've been a backup guy for all my life.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.080]   I've always been telling other people to backup.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:36.160]   - And Corey, I've seen what you do to your laptops.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.280]   - I'm not surprised.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.120]   - Sure.
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.320]   - Never forget a guy who kills a laptop for two a year.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:43.000]   Although I tell you what, these think pads are so rugged,
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.520]   relative to the hardware I used to use,
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.400]   used to use a lot of Mac laptops.
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:47.920]   And the think pads are super rugged
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.600]   and come with one year or one to three years
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.320]   of on-site next day worldwide hardware replacement,
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.600]   which is great.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:57.640]   I'm not, no one's paying me from ThinkPad to do this,
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.120]   but for like a hundred bucks a year,
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:01.360]   someone will come to your hotel room anywhere in the world
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.360]   the next day with hardware to fix it.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:05.600]   But even so, I'm a total backup guy.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:07.560]   I have an on-site, I have an off-site,
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:10.640]   I have a travel backup, I have a cloud backup.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:11.720]   - Well, you're a novelist.
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:12.560]   - I'm all nominated.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:13.920]   - Somebody who writes fiction, you know,
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:18.720]   I remember the Oakland fires of about,
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.280]   was it 15 years ago, something like that.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:25.880]   And a novelist, who was it?
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:28.640]   Was it Amy Tan, some well-known novelist
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.840]   lost not only her house in the fire,
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.520]   but lost her manuscripts in the fire.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:33.360]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:34.480]   - And I mean, there's nothing worse.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.920]   Ralph Ellison, after he lost his manuscript,
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:38.640]   he never wrote another novel.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.480]   - Wow.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:42.960]   - And so, you know, you don't wanna,
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.800]   if you're writing something,
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:46.000]   you don't wanna, in fact, if I were you,
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.400]   I'd print it and mail it to somebody, every J.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.560]   - You know, I SCP it to my server in Toronto,
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:54.680]   all my working files, but, you know,
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:58.760]   I also use Git to backup my writing as I go.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:58:59.600]   - For revisions.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.440]   - Wow.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.280]   - For revisions.
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.360]   And my, you know, there's a friend of mine,
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.880]   Thomas Gideon, who's got a great podcast
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.160]   called The Command Line, does,
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:09.240]   wrote me some Python scripts called Flashbake
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:12.280]   that every 15 minutes take all of my working files,
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:13.800]   checks to see if there's been any updates,
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.720]   checks them into a local Git repository,
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.920]   which is like a version control thing,
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.960]   software guys use, software programmers use,
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:22.200]   and then adds for context, the last three songs I've played,
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.160]   the last three headlines I've posted to boring,
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.680]   boring time zone, weather, you know,
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.000]   how long it's been since I rebooted,
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.960]   all kinds of cool stuff.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.440]   And you have a record of your life kind of almost
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:33.440]   in that Git repository.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:34.640]   - Yeah, yeah, it's really cool.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.920]   And this is for me, like, to get back to Facebook,
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:37.840]   which we shouldn't go back to,
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:40.080]   but it's the difference between spyware and malware.
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:42.040]   It's the difference between like a pedometer
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:44.520]   and like, you know, your boss counting how many steps
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:45.800]   you take in a day to figure it
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:47.680]   if you're going to the bathroom too often.
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:49.680]   I love having this stuff for myself.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.960]   And my plan is since Git is so good at replicating itself,
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:56.960]   my plan is to put a Git install on my server,
[00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.440]   which is in a big cage in Toronto at 151 Front Street,
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.960]   and then just have the two stay in sync.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.000]   - What a good idea, yeah,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.840]   'cause every Git repository is a duplicate,
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:09.040]   unlike SVN where there's one repository,
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.840]   you have everything everywhere, right, on Git.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.840]   - I think so, I think that's the idea behind it.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.040]   Wow, that's cool.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.160]   Is that code available?
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.640]   'Cause I think that's a great idea.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.680]   - Yeah, it's GPL.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.880]   It's on GitHub, it's called Flash Bake,
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.160]   which is a term from my first novel
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.840]   from down in the Magic Kingdom.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.840]   Flash Bake.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.080]   And it's great.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.280]   Works like a charm.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.440]   - That is really cool.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.280]   - That's sensible and open.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:38.360]   - So it's basically, I could have it save everything I do,
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.280]   you know, any changes, all the text.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.120]   - What a cool, what?
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.520]   - It's a great thing about working in a text file.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.240]   - Yep, text is nice that way.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.320]   Wow, that's really cool.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.720]   Oh, I was showing you the wrong thing,
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.560]   I have it set up, bro.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:50.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.880]   - I was wondering, ask Corey something something.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:53.880]   - No, I was gonna ask Corey,
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.880]   it says, "Ask Corey," you wanna know what it says?
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:00.160]   Ask Corey about his recent unusual Skype interview.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:03.640]   - Oh God, you did a naked Skype interview?
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:06.480]   - Accidentally, my friend Alex Kritoski
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:09.440]   writing me out for the Guardian had a phoneer with me
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.480]   at 6 a.m. when I was in San Francisco.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.880]   I was rushing to get dressed
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.880]   'cause I had a like a 640 call
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.800]   to get to the first school for first period
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:21.960]   down the peninsula and I forgot Skype cam was on.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.360]   So I answered the phone naked from the way stop
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.520]   and she said, "Oh my God, you're naked."
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.440]   And she's a good friend of ours.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.520]   It wasn't like, it wasn't terrible, right?
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:29.800]   I was just naked from the way stop.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.640]   It was okay.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.520]   So I dived under the table, I turned the camera off
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.120]   and I walked around with a laptop
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.040]   for like 10 minutes getting dressed.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.400]   And then I sat back down again
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.360]   and the camera was so on.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.400]   And I said, "Alex, is the camera on the whole time?"
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.080]   She said, "Oh, I didn't want to embarrass you."
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.920]   So it was definitely a low point.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:49.520]   I've had two kind of major malapropisms on this tour
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.920]   that were very funny and hindsight.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.760]   So that was the first one.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.120]   The second one is a guy came up to my signing,
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.720]   oh God, I didn't even remember what city I was in.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.000]   Maybe it was Austin.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.520]   And he said, "Can you, I said, like,
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.560]   what would you like in your book?"
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.240]   And he said, "Dr. Mihabut."
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.400]   And I said, "Dr. Mihabut."
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.000]   And he said, "Yeah, Dr. Mihabut, Dr. Mihabut."
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.280]   So I drew the most dramatic hobbit I could
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.160]   and he said, "No, Dr. Mihabut."
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.960]   (laughing)
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.040]   This is Mihabut, the hobbit.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:15.880]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.680]   So I drew a very dramatic hobbit
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.280]   and possibly gave offense to like a quarter
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.920]   of the world's population at the same time.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.640]   All the hobbits, all the little people now
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.040]   are upset with you, Corey.
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:25.880]   There's a fat one.
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:28.600]   All the hobbits, all the little hobbits.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.920]   Isn't that's a meme going on right now though?
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.760]   Isn't it?
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.320]   "Dr. Mihabut" meme kind of going around?
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.720]   Yeah, it's unfortunately kind of intertangles issues
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.240]   of free speech with xenophobia.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.080]   It's kind of hard.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.560]   I know what you mean.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.400]   It's like, and I also don't wanna...
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.760]   I don't wanna go there.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.120]   It's not for fear, but I don't...
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.600]   It's somebody's beliefs.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.200]   I don't wanna kind of mingle that in with...
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.640]   I'm okay with ridiculing dumb beliefs,
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.480]   but I just,
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:02.360]   I think that there's a difference between saying,
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.160]   I think your beliefs are dumb and saying,
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.800]   I think you're a bad person and saying,
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.560]   I'm gonna intentionally give offense
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.600]   to a whole bunch of people over something else.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.400]   And I just, I think that it's,
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.600]   unfortunately it's one of those things,
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.040]   like if you wanna do an experiment,
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.520]   you always wanna isolate out the thing
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.280]   you're trying to prove or test.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.240]   And when you're doing a social experiment,
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.480]   it's really nice to make it fairly unambiguous
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.800]   so that it doesn't look like a racist attack
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.640]   on a group of people, racist of their ethnicity,
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.840]   and instead looks like a defensive free speech.
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.000]   And unfortunately, it's smack in the middle of those things.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.840]   Right, it's on Facebook just to confuse the whole thing.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:40.200]   Here's the GitHub command line flash bake.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.560]   Yeah, yep, very cool.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.400]   I'm gonna try this.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.520]   It's called the command line.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.040]   The command line, I've gotta try that.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.080]   That's really, really neat.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.040]   So Google TV, now, Corey, you're probably not interested
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.720]   in Google TV 'cause this really does look
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.960]   like a commercial enterprise from Google.
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.120]   They're doing a deal.
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.760]   Sony, Logitech, and the dish networks all will add
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.040]   this capability to hardware.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.240]   Sony will put it in their TVs.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.760]   Logitech's gonna make a little box.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.560]   Dish is gonna put it in their satellite dish.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.720]   I was underwhelmed by this.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.880]   Robert, you were there.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.760]   Did it seem more exciting to you than it did to me?
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.760]   It seemed like it was kind of pathetic.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.560]   Well, if you come from the geek world
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.520]   and you have a media center hooked up to your TV and you have--
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.440]   We've been able to do this for a long time.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.440]   Yeah, if you have, but I did like how they took
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.560]   a search centric approach to it.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:32.560]   I wanna play with it, I wanna have one.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.280]   Yeah, it struck me that it's nothing particularly new
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:39.000]   and ironically, the geeks already have this
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.640]   and the non geeks is way too complicated.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:42.480]   So--
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.320]   Do you think so?
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.000]   I'm not sure that it's all that complicated.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.080]   Do you think your mom wants to enter in a search term?
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.520]   Like, so she wants to watch houses, they did in the example.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.080]   I think the world is changing when it comes to TV
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:58.080]   and the how we use TV is changing quite radically
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.520]   inside the home.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.760]   Even for normal people, they're sitting on the couch
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:05.840]   with laptops or iPads or whatever, you know, iPhones
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.960]   or Android phones on the couch.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:13.200]   And we're talking on Twitter while we're watching, you know,
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.640]   different shows.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.000]   I mean, tomorrow night is the big final for Lost
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.160]   and you should see my Twitter.
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.560]   It's been lit up all day.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.080]   I know.
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.640]   You know, with guesses about what's coming or even there's
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.200]   people writing code to remove any mention of lost
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.720]   from their Twitter stream, you know,
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.680]   so that they won't see a spoiler and it's crazy.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.400]   I never got the lost thing.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.520]   I never got that disease.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.720]   Yeah, I got a little hooked into it.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.000]   My wife is more hooked into it than I am.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.680]   But how we're watching TV is changing quite a bit.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:51.320]   I mean, and we're going to see a bunch of different approaches
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.320]   to how TV is changing.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.480]   You know, there's one coming out tomorrow
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.880]   at the TechCrunch Disrupt Conference that I've seen.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.400]   I can't talk about it, but they're coming at it
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.280]   from the social aspect.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.920]   There's Boxy, which is coming from--
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:08.080]   I think the Boxy Box is very neat.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.480]   Yeah, I'm most interested in that.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.400]   But this does-- you know, Google has a brand name
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.560]   and has the ability to make deals with Sony.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.680]   And, you know, if it comes on--
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.520]   Here's the one--
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.880]   I'll tell you, that was a nadir of this, of the event,
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.000]   was when Eric Schmidt comes out on the stage with seven
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.280]   other CEOs, Charlie Ergun from the Dish Network, Howard
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.200]   Stringer from Sony, Logitech.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.720]   I mean, all the CEOs are sitting there.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:34.640]   Oh my god.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.760]   And I can just imagine the developers going cross-eyed
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:37.760]   at that.
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.000]   Yeah, some of them did.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.200]   But did you see Stringer kissing up to Best Buy?
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.400]   Yes, that was funny.
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.360]   But here's the thing.
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.680]   For a normal person that are going to walk in to Best Buy,
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.600]   they want to buy a 50-inch TV.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.440]   And there's so many choices that all look the same.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.320]   I mean, it's really hard to tell the difference between any
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.960]   of the 50-inch HD TVs.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.600]   I mean, you have to look really closely
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.560]   to see any resolution differences anymore,
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.160]   because most of the time, they're made in the same factory
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.080]   with different brand names on it.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:10.160]   And one of them has this Google brand name on it.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.040]   And the salesperson shows, oh, you
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:15.000]   can search for YouTube videos on it too.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.560]   Boom, that's all as long as it's not--
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.200]   Yeah, you might want it.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:17.600]   Yeah.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.120]   As long as it's not $100 more or more,
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.040]   if it's the same price or $20, you're
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.360]   going to buy that and go, yeah, I want the Google thing.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.000]   And they're throwing it in.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.520]   You know what I'm waiting for?
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.960]   It seems to me, especially when this HD thing all
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.920]   started in the early '90s when we started talking about--
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.960]   or in the early 2000s when we were talking about the broadcast
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:40.160]   flag and whether we get a digital television transition,
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:44.280]   seems to me that the majority of high-def screens aren't TVs.
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.200]   They're computer screens.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.600]   And it's pretty rare that you get a giant screen and just
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.160]   put one big window on it.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:54.920]   And so I'm waiting for computer-- for rather than them
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:58.840]   to have computer like UIs, to have computer like use patterns.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:02.120]   I have this kind of utopian vision of a living room in which,
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.280]   instead of a TV being a thing that's kind of isolating,
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.560]   it seems like one of the big pitches for a giant TV is,
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:11.120]   hey, dad, buy a giant TV and send the rest of the family away
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.680]   while you watch sports, maybe with your friends, which
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.480]   sounds-- it seems kind of divisive.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:20.360]   I'd love a giant TV that had a video window showing something
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.880]   that required some audio, so like a television show somewhere
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.480]   in it.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:27.240]   And then some games that didn't require audio that had wireless
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.840]   headsets that kids were playing in the same room
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.880]   on the same big screen, and then maybe some other stuff
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:33.440]   that someone else was watching.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.160]   And where we could all pause each other's screens
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:37.000]   and make something big or make something small.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.240]   I kind of do this with my daughter now, where--
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:44.080]   Here's where your hatred of iPads is leading you astray.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.600]   We're already doing that with our iPads.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.960]   We're playing Scrabble and playing Geometry Wars.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.640]   But you're not all looking at one screen.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.000]   You're looking at a bunch of different ones, right?
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.480]   I know, but nobody wants to look at one screen.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.600]   I think it's a weird--
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:55.120]   We're still--
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:55.120]   We're still--
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.120]   We're still-- we're still--

[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:44.520]   We're still-- we're still-- we're still-- we're still-- we're still-- we're still--
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:51.520]   So do you believe that Google-- is there a way Google can give away WebM in such a way that you would feel comfortable with it?
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:58.520]   Well, I guess it just may-- it depends on whether they make like permanent and irrevocable representations about what the terms are of use for it.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.520]   Yeah. I mean, there is such a thing as a permanent and irrevocable--
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.520]   Good. So that's what we should be looking for.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:08.520]   Yeah, I think so. I think that's right. I mean, this may be a better question for Denise and this we can go off.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.520]   Right. Right.
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:15.520]   But it sounds to me like that's the kind of thing where you have to have really good binding long-term promises made.
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:25.520]   I don't know when the patents in the onto codec expire. I saw a demo of it in '99 presuming they didn't, you know, get any more patents filed.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:31.520]   Like kind of sort of think around 2025, maybe at the latest. So you kind of want promises that go out for another 15 years.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:42.520]   Let's see. What else? I think that's it for Google I/O. I think that's it for Facebook. We've thrown a little apple in there.
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:46.520]   Let's take a break and come back. We're going to do a little lightning round, a bunch of stories.
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:54.520]   Some of good stories too. I see that Toyota and Tesla are going to revive the Fremont Numi plant and start making electric cars there, which would be fantastic news.
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:59.520]   I think that's the local auto plant that was shut down just recently.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.520]   And the 23,000 reply all emails.
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:13.520]   We'll talk about that in just a second, but I want to mention our friends at audible.com. Yes, Corey. Audible.com.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:15.520]   You want to take a break?
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.520]   Good to say about Audible. What is that?
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:27.520]   So with makers, they agreed to drop the DRM for my audiobook. We still had some questions about it. We didn't end up going with them, but they agreed to drop DRM for my audiobook.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:32.520]   I thought that was really good of them. The problem was, of course, that Apple said if you don't put DRM in it, we won't carry it.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:35.520]   So an Apple's the major distribute.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:39.520]   So this is the real question is who is enforcing this DRM stuff? Is it the publishers?
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:45.520]   We had this conversation before where you said you tried to get Audible to do with that DRM and they said no, we're just not going to do that.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.520]   So they changed their mind to their end-of-the-life.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.520]   That's great.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:56.520]   Yeah, no, I think that's great. But Apple refused to carry it in the iTunes store. They said DRM or nothing.
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:01.520]   It's very frustrating because all much for Steve Jaws much of haunted hatred of DRM.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:04.520]   Yeah, no kidding. I don't know what that means exactly.
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.520]   Well, here's the news.
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:13.520]   With the record, if Apple would allow me to, I put all my audiobooks in the iTunes store like a shot with no crazy Ula and no DRM.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.520]   I'd be all over them like, why don't I?
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.520]   Wouldn't that be great?
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:17.520]   Steve?
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:18.520]   Steve?
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:23.520]   Hey, I did record an audiobook for one of your short stories.
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.520]   That's great.
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.520]   What's what happened with that?
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.520]   So that'll be coming up probably this autumn.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:34.520]   It's a short story collection called With a Little Help and it's made with a little help with a lot of my friends.
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:38.520]   So there's an audiobook that will be free and you can buy it on CD.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:39.520]   So it'll be free downloads.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:41.520]   There's a printed book.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:54.520]   You can either buy it with one of four different covers from Lulu or you can get it as a free download or there's a very limited edition heart cover where each book has custom end papers that are original paper ephemera from right on.
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:59.520]   So Jay Lake sent me his cancer diagnosis and Joe Haldeman sent me his watercolors.
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:06.520]   Kathy Kosha sent me her grade two report card and those original pieces of paper will be stuck in as the end papers.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:14.520]   And then the top top end was that you could commission a story from it for $10,000 but Mark Shuttleworth already bought that and I wrote that story.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:15.520]   He did?
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:16.520]   Oh, that's great.
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:17.520]   Oh, that's wonderful.
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:21.520]   That'll be out in the autumn and all the financials are published monthly as an appendix to the book.
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:26.520]   And if you send me a typo for the book, I'll correct it in the next copy, print it and give you a footnote.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:29.520]   So maybe you buy another copy to see one with your name in it.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:30.520]   That's very smart.
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:31.520]   Corey, as usual, pushing...
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.520]   I monetize typos.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.520]   [laughter]
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.520]   Now that's creative.
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.520]   With a little help, we'll look forward to that in the audiobook.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.520]   I'm on it.
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.520]   I know Neil Gaiman read a story.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:48.520]   And Mary Robinette Coel and Will Wheaton.
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.520]   A lot of great readers.
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:56.520]   And just to foster the open source of it, I did the recording sessions on Twit Live Live.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:57.520]   So they were...
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.520]   You're awesome.
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.520]   And it actually was really fun because people corrected me when my accent changed and they said, "No, no."
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.520]   Oh, that's great.
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:04.520]   I had no idea.
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:05.520]   That's my great story.
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:06.520]   It was really fun.
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:11.520]   I really enjoyed doing it and I think they enjoyed the story and I'm sorry I took so long but I'm glad you got it in time.
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.520]   You did an awesome job.
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:13.520]   And I would look forward to that with a little help.
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.520]   It took the way of reading.
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.520]   Oh, it was fun.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.520]   It was really fun.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:21.520]   However, let me talk about a little bit about commercial audiobooks from our friends at audible.com.
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:27.520]   Audible is, as many of you know, kind of a lifesaver for me.
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:30.520]   I first started using Audible when I was commuting to San Francisco.
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:31.520]   I did that for 10 years.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.520]   Two hours sometimes each way.
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:35.520]   And I would have...
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:42.520]   I'm sure I would have just gone bazooties if not kind of had some sort of road rage incident.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:44.520]   If it weren't for these audiobooks.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:45.520]   I'm not sure.
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.520]   First, listen to the cassettes.
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:50.520]   But when Audible came around, man, it changed my life.
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:53.520]   And now Audible's got 75,000 titles.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.520]   They've got a huge collection of science fiction.
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:58.520]   They're doing a lot of sci-fi that was never turned into audiobooks.
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:09.520]   They have an Audible Frontiers collection where they built their own studios and they're recording a lot of this great stuff that has never been recorded before, which is wonderful.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:18.520]   Audio, books, performances, radio shows, comedy performances, tons of wonderful stuff at audible.com.
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.520]   And I know Corey liked Audible books too.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:23.520]   He has a whole bunch of them.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:26.520]   So let me see if I can make a good recommendation for...
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:27.520]   I see this one.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.520]   I'm for nostalgic reasons I might get this.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.520]   The astronomer, a novel of suspense.
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:38.520]   It's on the front page narrated by Napoleon Solo, the man from Uncle Mike, Robert Vaughn.
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:39.520]   I just like his voice.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.520]   I don't know.
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:41.520]   I might just get it for his voice.
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:42.520]   You're agreeing?
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:43.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:44.520]   All right.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.520]   Anyway, here's the point.
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.520]   You get two free books, two credits.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:50.520]   That's almost any book in the house.
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:55.520]   All you have to do is go to Audible.com/TwitTo and sign up for the Platinum account, two books a month.
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:56.520]   That's what I've got.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:57.520]   I love it.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:59.520]   On the 22nd of every month, just happened yesterday.
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:04.520]   I get two new credits and then I have so much fun going through the audio books and looking for two new books to listen to.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:05.520]   All right.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:06.520]   Now I'm listening to...
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.520]   I actually love the time traveler's wife.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:13.520]   I have to highly recommend that the movie was beautiful, but the movie's two hours.
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:16.520]   This is a really excellent long book.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:19.520]   Have you ever read the time traveler's wife?
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.520]   Mm-hmm.
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:21.520]   That's a great book.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:23.520]   Do you know if they've got any Cathy Kojia, K-O-J-A?
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.520]   I will look.
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.520]   I know she's got a bunch of audio books.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:29.520]   She is one of my favorite young adult writers.
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:30.520]   And if you're looking for a book...
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.520]   They do.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:32.520]   Kissing the B, Buddha, Boy.
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:34.520]   Why isn't it B is great and Buddha, Boy?
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:35.520]   They're both...
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:36.520]   They're really good readings.
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:38.520]   I've reviewed both audio books.
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.520]   I'd really recommend them both.
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:45.520]   Anyone who's got kids, they're good kind of meaty, subtle books that never collaborate over
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:50.520]   the head about kids who are a little bit different and about how they kind of end up fitting in.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:56.520]   Kathy made her name as a really prominent horror writer and then gave it up to write these young adult novels that are just genius.
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.520]   Well, you've done two young adult novels now.
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:24:59.520]   That's right.
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:00.520]   It must be satisfying.
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:02.520]   It must be very satisfying.
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:11.520]   I have to say, one of my best audio, audible experience is getting a few great audio books like Bud, Not Buddy and...
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.520]   Oh, I can't remember a few...
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:17.520]   We got three or four and we drove out to Montana and listened to them.
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:19.520]   Now, talk about it together in this experience.
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:22.520]   It was really wonderful to listen to them together and talk about them.
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.520]   That is a great use.
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:29.520]   And a juvenile is by somebody who's really good is great because adults will enjoy it as much as the kids do.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:31.520]   So it's really something to talk about.
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:38.520]   Yeah, I think there's a popular misconception that young adult books are for young adults as opposed to books that can be enjoyed by young adults and adults together.
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.520]   If you like Alice in Wonderland or the Hobbit, you like young adult books.
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.520]   Exactly.
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:45.520]   Kathy Kojia, these are two good recommendations.
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:49.520]   K-A-T-H-E-K-O-J-A, Kissing the Bee in Buddha Boy.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:52.520]   Make those your first two books, especially if you've got kids around.
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:55.520]   Maybe like 12, 11, 10, they're about...
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.520]   I'd say like 13 and up.
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.520]   13 and up, okay.
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:25:59.520]   13 and up.
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.520]   Audible.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.520]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:03.520]   Two free books for you.
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:05.520]   They'll play on almost any device.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:07.520]   They're still working on the Android, although I understand that's in beta now.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:11.520]   I've talked to a couple of people who have the beta edition, so that's coming soon.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:13.520]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.520]   We thank them for their support of Twit.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.520]   So your new one is FTW.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.520]   What's the story of that, Corey?
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:26.520]   So for the win, it's a book about gold farming, which for those of you in your audience who aren't gamers.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:31.520]   Gold farming is when someone in a video game does a repetitive task to a mass virtual wealth,
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:36.520]   making shirts out of sheep to get gold or killing low-level monsters to get gold,
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:43.520]   and then sells that gold to other players who are either too impatient or too short on time to do those repetitive tasks themselves.
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.520]   And this is not science fiction.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.520]   This exists.
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:47.520]   Oh, that's real.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:49.520]   There's like 400,000 people who are living doing it today.
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.520]   Most of them are in poor countries, and most of the people who buy the gold are in rich countries.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:59.520]   And for the win, as a kid's book about what happens when the gold farm is from a union
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:04.520]   and use video games to outsmart their bosses and unionize and start the first independent,
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:09.520]   large independent trade unions in China and other countries where it's illegal to unionize.
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:10.520]   That's so great.
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:11.520]   And so it was a really fun book to write.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.520]   I borrowed a little gimmick from a great writer named Chemekloud.
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:18.520]   I called the union the industrial workers of the World Wide Web, which is a joke.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:21.520]   For those of you who know your labor history, it's a little funny pun.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:28.520]   And it's a book that's got lots of great adventure and action because they're fighting these
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:32.320]   pitch battles and video games and they're fighting pitch battles in the streets of Mumbai and
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:33.320]   in China.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:39.520]   But it's also a book about economics and about social justice, labor issues, behavioral economics.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.520]   It was a lot of fun to research and to write.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.520]   And the reviews have been great.
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.520]   And the tour has been great everywhere I've gone.
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:46.520]   It's been packed houses.
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:47.520]   That's so neat.
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:50.520]   So these are in New York next week for your New York readers.
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:55.520]   If you go for the win tour, you'll find it or just go to craphoundots.com/ftw.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.520]   You'll find the tour schedule.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:58.520]   That's awesome.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:00.520]   So instead of Wobbly's, they're what?
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:01.520]   Webby's?
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.520]   Webby's.
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.520]   Webby's.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.520]   Wwwww.
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:05.520]   The Webby's.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.520]   The Webby's.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:09.520]   The game will never be defeated.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:10.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.520]   They need a song.
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.520]   We have a song.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.640]   A quick round of stories.
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:23.440]   So my friend, Jason Calicana, has kind of gotten a little bit of a trouble the other
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.440]   day.
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:31.000]   He has an emailing mailing list that with more than 23,000 people on it, apparently misconfigured
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:37.040]   the reply all sent emails back to everybody on the list.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:42.760]   And so all of a sudden people are getting messages back, offering jobs.
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:43.760]   Somebody figured it out.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:49.520]   Said, "Well, I might as well include a shameless promotion since this is like a big party now."
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:50.520]   So Jason.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:51.520]   Time to subscribe.
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:52.520]   Just die.
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:54.880]   Yeah, because otherwise you're stuck.
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.840]   Jason discovered it in the wee hours of the morning and disabled the list, but there
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:05.720]   were 34 reply alls that went out to more than 23,000 people.
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:09.040]   The best thing I've ever done this year in terms of productivity is learn how to use
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.040]   Gmail's filters.
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.040]   No kidding.
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:13.040]   Gmail's gotten better and better now.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:16.560]   They're getting, they've got folders now and they've got, I'll tell you.
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:20.960]   I've written about 800 filters so far in the last three months.
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:26.200]   It just has made a dramatic production improvement on my email.
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:27.200]   Wow.
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:28.280]   I live and die by mail filters.
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:29.720]   My two favorites.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:33.440]   One, colors the message differently if it's from someone who's in my address book, which
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.440]   is just such a no brainer, it should be automatic.
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:38.960]   And I have it set so that every time I reply to you it adds you to my address book.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:42.840]   So I can tell email from people I've corresponded with with people from correspondence from
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:43.840]   people I haven't.
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:47.960]   And then the other one is that if it's someone I haven't ever corresponded with, but I'm the
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:51.480]   only person on the two line, it colors it differently.
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:54.680]   So it can distinguish mail like bulk mail from individual mail.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:58.320]   And those two things sorting it by color has been really, really good at making sure
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:01.760]   I don't miss the spam or the non-spam rather, the ham.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.760]   That's very endora of you.
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.880]   You do that with canine or what do you do that with?
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:06.880]   No, I do that.
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:07.880]   I don't do anything fancy with canine.
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:11.480]   I only use canine sort of walking between a place where I'm using my laptop and another
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:12.480]   place where I use my laptop.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:13.480]   Now I use Thunderbird.
[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:14.480]   Thunderbird.
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:15.480]   Okay.
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:16.480]   Cool.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:19.800]   Yeah, I got like three or four million archived emails at this point and, you know, sticking
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.800]   them up on Gmail or something, even if it wasn't written about the privacy stuff, sticking
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:25.600]   them all on Gmail is like, you know, months of uploading.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.520]   Yeah, you're surprisingly when you say you use popmail, you don't, you don't, is that
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:29.520]   why you don't use iMac?
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:30.520]   Same reason.
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:32.040]   You don't want to keep the stuff on the some, somebody's server.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:35.200]   Well, I used to use, I used to have the best iMac config.
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:38.000]   I had a local iMac running on my own computer.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.040]   This is back when I was using a Mac and I was using it under OS 10.
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:44.160]   So I had an iMac server running on my own computer and then I had lots of different
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.760]   mail clients on the computer depending on what I wanted to do.
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:50.000]   So some are really good at searching and some are really good at filtering and some
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.640]   are really good at composing.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:55.400]   And so because I can keep them all in sync with the same local iMac server, it was really
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.000]   easy to just use them all.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:03.160]   And then there was an update to OS 10 and it didn't, WFTPD or WIMAP, whatever, the Washington
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:06.840]   University iMac didn't work anymore and I just gave up and I never went back to it.
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:10.440]   And I was thinking the other day, you know, I'm up to like a 500 gig hard drive in this
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:11.440]   ThinkPad.
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:14.120]   I probably got enough room to make three or four copies of my mail school.
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:17.720]   I should really do that because it was the most, it was the best fun I've ever had with
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:18.720]   my mail.
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:20.680]   It was super ninja email stuff.
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:24.200]   Then you use proc mail and stuff and really kind of filter it like crazy.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:25.200]   Oh yeah.
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:30.200]   I just saw an amazing presentation by the woman who's the chief scientist at Bitly about
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:34.000]   her spam filters, which are so good that she no longer checks her mail.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.800]   Her mail sends her a text when there's something good in it.
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:37.800]   Oh man.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:38.800]   Is that online somewhere?
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:39.800]   I'm not an invonna.
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:40.800]   Is that online somewhere?
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:41.800]   I want that.
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.000]   She's putting it all on GitHub.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.080]   She's putting all her scripts on GitHub.
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:46.080]   All right.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.600]   Hillary, I've forgotten her surname.
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:48.600]   I want to say Mason.
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.600]   Hillary at Bitly.
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:50.600]   I'm writing it down.
[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:51.960]   I'm going to find a link.
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:54.360]   Buy.com is made its biggest sale yet.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:55.840]   It sold itself.
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:32:01.960]   $250 million to Rakuten, a Japanese company that runs the biggest e-commerce site in Japan.
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:07.080]   I was thinking of that because my iMac company Fastmail just got sold to opera.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:08.640]   So opera is in the iMac business.
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:11.400]   I don't know if that's good or bad.
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:12.400]   Hmm.
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.400]   Here's a story.
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:14.400]   No, agents are cool.
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.400]   They're cool.
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:16.400]   I like no legions.
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:18.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:21.400]   Think I awesome sweaters.
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.920]   They have to.
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:24.920]   Let's see.
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:28.200]   P expands recall of notebook computer batteries due to fire hazard.
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:31.200]   We always enjoy those stories.
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.240]   Bill Gates.
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:35.080]   More profit than profit.
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:39.320]   This is with an F and not a pH.
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:44.760]   This is a great article in the Atlantic analyzing Bill Gates's predictions from the
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:46.360]   last 15 years ago.
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.920]   He wrote the road ahead.
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:51.360]   Apparently not exactly the road ahead.
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:52.360]   He wrote about email.
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:55.560]   For instance, 15 years ago, electronic mail and shared screams will eliminate the need
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:56.560]   for many meetings.
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:57.960]   Well, that's good a meeting.
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:01.200]   When face-to-face meetings do take place, they'll be more efficient because participants
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.880]   will have already exchanged background information via email.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:05.720]   That's true.
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:08.520]   He said, "We'll be able to carry a wallet, PC in our pocket or purse.
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:12.040]   It will display messages and schedules and let your readers send electronic mail and
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:14.400]   faxes, monitor weather and stock reports.
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:16.320]   Sounds like an iPad.
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:17.320]   Maybe a smartphone.
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:18.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:21.720]   His prediction, the wireless network or the future will be faster, but unless there's
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:28.280]   a major breakthrough wireless networks will have far greater bandwidth, mobile devices
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.600]   will be able to send and receive.
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:33.840]   The wireless networks of the future will be faster, but the wired networks will still
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:34.840]   have better bandwidth.
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:35.840]   I get it.
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:36.840]   Okay.
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:42.880]   Mobile devices will be able to send and receive messages, but it will be expensive and unusual
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:45.080]   to use them to receive an individual video stream.
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:46.920]   I hope not.
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:47.920]   Wrong.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:51.440]   Let's see what else real quickly.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.440]   30 years of Pac-Man.
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:58.040]   Did you see the Google front page search had a JavaScript Pac-Man on it?
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:01.840]   Wait, though, Gates predicted 30 years of Pac-Man?
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:02.840]   No.
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:09.040]   15 years ago, Google will have 30 years of Pac-Man.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:12.600]   It's interesting because as a science fiction writer, I'm always struck by the number of
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:14.920]   people who think that I'm trying to predict the future.
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:18.320]   I think that science fiction writers have never been very good at that, but what you
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:22.680]   can often tell by reading someone's predictions about the future is what they're worried about
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:26.520]   in the present, what their hopes and fears are about technology in the present.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:30.960]   Mary Shelley wasn't worried that animated corpses would stalk Europe.
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:34.720]   Mary Shelley was worried that technology was getting out of control and that Frankenstein's
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:37.920]   monster would be a metaphor for all of us.
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:44.200]   Asimov had a lot of faith in big institutions like the New Deal and so on, and so he wrote
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:45.200]   about the foundation.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:50.640]   He wrote about a 2000-year future history projection where a group of wise people around a table
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:54.480]   could predict the next 2000 years of human history and make sure that it didn't go off
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:55.480]   the rails.
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:59.320]   It's a very new deal way of thinking about the future.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:03.880]   You can often learn a lot about the present and about the past from looking at futuristic
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:04.880]   predictions.
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:07.040]   You can rarely learn much about the future from that.
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:10.200]   You know where I think science fiction authors do influence the future, though, because a
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:14.800]   lot of future scientists read science fiction and then end up working on stuff that science
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:15.800]   fiction predicted.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:17.600]   Yeah, that's very true.
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:18.600]   Yeah, of course.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:22.200]   You've got the metaverse being echoed in Second Life.
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:26.280]   You've got Arthur C. Clarke predicting orbits that then people built in.
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:29.520]   But that's slightly different from predicting that this is counter-innovatability.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:31.080]   Anyway, let's talk about Pac-Man.
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:35.320]   Pac-Man 30 years old and on the Google front page.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.720]   Isn't that great?
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:42.400]   This is actually really as much a demonstration of what HTML5 could do.
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:47.000]   So first time I can remember a Google Doodle actually being animated like this.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000]   I think that's right.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.640]   And Google's kept it alive, by the way.
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:53.600]   If you go to google.com/pac-man, it's still there.
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:36:00.400]   So I think the next Doodle is going to be one of those under-construction animated gifs.
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.400]   And for what to do what?
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:08.600]   Just, you know, as I get 30 years of under-construction, I go on something web.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.320]   That's a good idea, actually.
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:13.240]   Somebody tell me if you insert the coin twice, you can get Ms. Pac-Man.
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:14.560]   Oh, yeah, there she is.
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:15.560]   Very good.
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:16.560]   I like that.
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:17.560]   Let's see.
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:18.560]   Twitter expects...
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:22.360]   You know, it's funny, before you go on the first goal farmer I ever knew, I used to
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.880]   hang out in an arcade in the Shepherd Center in North York in Toronto.
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:29.160]   And there was like, we would cut class to go in, but there were older kids.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.160]   You know, we were about 14.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:33.320]   There were kids who were about 18 or 19 who just dropped out entirely to hang out at the
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:34.320]   arcade.
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:38.640]   And there was one guy who was kind of like a part-time hashish dealer, full-time gauntlet
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:39.640]   hustler.
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.520]   And he'd be like, "Dollet all day long."
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.320]   And he'd cut after lunch.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:44.920]   He'd get in around one or two in the afternoon.
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:45.920]   He'd have you set up.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:49.160]   He built up like the most epic Valkyrie, and he'd sell it to you for a dollar.
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:56.560]   And he was like, "The world's worst-paid, stoner gold farmer of the late 80s."
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:58.320]   Wow.
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:01.120]   That's your right, a proto-gold farmer.
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.120]   That's right.
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:04.920]   Twitter expects hundreds of advertisers this year.
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:05.920]   That's exciting.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:09.600]   Twitter plans to have hundreds of advertisers using its new ad system in the fourth quarter.
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:14.040]   As the company ramps up to become a self-sustaining profitable business.
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:16.320]   Do you use Twitter, Corey?
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:17.320]   I see you on Twitter.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:18.320]   I do, yeah.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.080]   I find it, you know, I had no idea what it was for.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:25.480]   Like, I have sent me an invite when he first started it, and I had one person on my follow
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:27.800]   list, and it was configured to use my phone.
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:30.680]   And basically every time I turn my phone on, it would tell me a whole bunch of things
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:32.880]   about what this guy I barely knew was eating for breakfast.
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:36.080]   And I just was like, "Wow, this is the dumbest service I've ever had.
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:37.160]   What's wrong with you?"
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:41.160]   And then I was at the O'Reilly Tools of Change Conference, and we were using Twitter to follow
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:42.760]   it and comment on it.
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:45.680]   And all of a sudden it was like the scales fell from my eyes, so I started really using
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:47.000]   it a lot.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.240]   And now I use it all the time.
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:52.240]   Now it's kind of an all-day, everyday thing.
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:57.440]   It's actually one of the crazy, weird things about Twitter from this book tour is it's
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.800]   like getting the reviews in real time.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:05.080]   So we get off stage, finish doing, you know, a two-hour, three-hour signing.
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:09.520]   And on the way to dinner, I'll look at my tweets on the phone, and it'll be like this
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:14.600]   kind of all the stuff that people liked and didn't like about what just happened, which
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:20.720]   is a really interesting thing normally where you get the next morning you get a few emails.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.800]   But this was really real time.
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:26.360]   Yeah, I think you've probably experienced that as well, Robert.
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:29.800]   I mean, this thing now when we speak, you know immediately how you did.
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:30.800]   It's kind of scary.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:35.120]   I look at the reviews for the shows as they happen as the shows going on.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:38.840]   Well, while you guys were talking about books, I was reading all the tweets going on about
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:39.840]   the shows.
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:40.840]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:42.320]   And I'm using Buzz more and more.
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:43.320]   I really love Buzz.
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:45.840]   I know Robert, you've kind of given Buzz some love lately.
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:50.400]   I'm hoping Buzz kind of, which is the Google Twitter.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:52.360]   We didn't hear much about Buzz at the--
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:55.160]   No, but they did announce an API.
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:59.440]   They finally have an API, and it is possible now to write third-party applications.
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:02.080]   Make immediately did it on the seismic web.
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:06.800]   And I'm on an NDA beta program, and there's a bunch of features coming.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:07.800]   Good.
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:08.800]   I'm excited.
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:09.800]   I love Buzz.
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:10.800]   I really do.
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:15.840]   Yahoo has decided that they want to be-- I don't know what, a content company.
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:20.560]   They've just purchased for $100 billion one of these demand media type companies, associated
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:21.880]   content.
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:23.200]   You know what demand media is?
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:28.200]   That's where somebody looks and sees what people are searching for, hires somebody really
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:33.240]   cheap to write some really crappy content around that because they know it's going to
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:39.120]   drive a lot of traffic, sells ads on it, profit.
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:42.440]   And associated content complains to have something like 30,000 bloggers.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:45.560]   They pay something like $5 an article for.
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:48.280]   And now I guess Yahoo is in that business.
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.280]   Yeah.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:53.240]   It's funny because another word for demand media is magazine, right?
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:57.960]   Before the web came along and blogs and so on, the way that you would be crazy to like
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:01.960]   spend a lot of money publishing a magazine unless you thought there were people out there
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:03.240]   who wanted to read it.
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:07.440]   So the magazine formula goes, find something that you think other people care about, find
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:10.240]   someone who can write about it, have them write about it.
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:14.200]   And for me, the amazing thing about blogging now, which I've been doing for 10 years, has
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:18.600]   been it goes like, takes something that you're really interested in, write about it because
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:22.240]   it costs nothing to publish it, and then see if there's anyone else out there who likes
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:24.000]   the same stuff as you.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.840]   And boy, that's way more satisfying.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:26.840]   Maybe it's more indulgent.
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.520]   I find it so much more satisfying.
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:29.520]   I agree.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:30.520]   I agree.
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:31.520]   You don't like the tale to wag the dog.
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:33.680]   We do, we kind of do the same thing here.
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:36.720]   We think about what anybody be interested in this show, but ultimately we do the shows
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:37.720]   we're interested in.
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.720]   What's it cost you to do a show that you don't like?
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:42.760]   I mean, people go like, look at all those blogs that were abandoned.
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:44.200]   Doesn't that show that bloggers pointless?
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:47.800]   It's like, you know how much it used to cost to find out you want to publish a magazine?
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:48.800]   Right.
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:50.680]   You know, thousands, millions, people lost their houses.
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:54.280]   Now you can find it, you don't want to publish a magazine in an hour for free.
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:56.080]   Tom Merritt's coming over here June 1st.
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:57.600]   He's going to start with the news show.
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:00.320]   But Tom and I were talking, I think we're, it was his idea.
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.040]   And I really like to do this.
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:04.880]   Maybe it was Ken Sheperson's, another new hire, a show a day.
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:09.640]   We're going to launch a show a day in August, every day in every day, a new show.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:11.400]   And then we were all this week in dog hair.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:12.560]   Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:13.560]   Show a day.
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:20.480]   And then, and then, and then, and then we will use Kickstarter to say, okay, here's five.
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:21.480]   Wouldn't that be a good idea?
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:22.480]   Here's five shows.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:24.960]   The first show to reach $5,000 will launch.
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:26.960]   And we'll use that money to launch the show.
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:27.960]   Good idea.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:29.960]   Just same idea.
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:33.640]   So I shouldn't really knock demand media, except that I do knock anybody who's cynical
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:37.480]   enough to put out crappy content just because you'll find it.
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:38.480]   Mm.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:41.280]   You know, I like, you know, it's funny because like on the other side of that, you get all
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:45.600]   the spam for write articles for money, which is actually a really old scam.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:50.160]   If you, if you get like old copies of like popular mechanics for the 50s, the right articles
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:55.160]   for money scam has been around for, you know, I think that, you know, there's a cuneiform,
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:59.480]   I don't know, on a stone tablet somewhere that says etch tablets for money.
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:02.400]   How much money do you make etching tablets for money?
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:06.120]   Well, I think you get at least one go to month.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:09.600]   Robert Scobell, what are you up to these days?
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:10.840]   What's new for you?
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:12.920]   I know you're cranking up great video.
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:13.920]   I'm not too big for you.
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:16.960]   And I go to New York for the TechCrunch Disrupt Conference and then after that.
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:17.960]   That's it.
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:18.960]   That's on right now.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:19.960]   I know Sarah Lane is out there.
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:22.360]   Sarah Lane, she's going to start June 1st as well.
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:23.360]   Very cool.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:24.360]   She's out there.
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:25.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:27.160]   And so what do you expect at Disrupt Anything?
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.560]   Well, I've seen a few of the companies.
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.480]   There's one, well, I can't talk about them.
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:33.120]   I'll get them kicked off the stage.
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:34.120]   All right.
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:35.120]   We'll find it.
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:36.120]   We will find out.
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:38.640]   Well, there's some pretty interesting companies.
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:41.560]   One will make Windows dramatically better, which is really cool.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:45.880]   And one is going to bring social to TV, which is also pretty interesting.
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:46.880]   Sounds good.
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:48.440]   Whether it's going to win or not.
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:49.440]   We don't know.
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:50.440]   What's going on startups?
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:51.440]   Absolutely.
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:56.520]   Robert Scobel is the Scobelizer, S-C-O-B-L-E-I-Z-E-R.com.
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:01.960]   His blog post today got responses from Facebook's vice president of global positioning.
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:02.960]   Global positioning.
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:06.520]   That guy is awesome with a sat-nav.
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:07.520]   What is this?
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:10.280]   They know where I am.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:13.760]   I'm carrying two GPS's just in case they can't find the first guy.
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:17.320]   The man with the two GPS's never knows where he is.
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:18.320]   That's true.
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.320]   Like two watches.
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:20.320]   That's right.
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:23.640]   Elliott Tragan also an email from Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:27.240]   So I know you're the guy if people want to get a hold of you.
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:28.920]   Scobelizer.com.
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:30.760]   And we'll look forward to videos from disrupt.
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:33.720]   And of course, it's all there.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:35.680]   And you're still doing, what is it?
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:36.680]   Warehouse 52.
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:37.680]   What is the?
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:38.680]   Building 43.
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:39.680]   Building43.com.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:42.960]   The center of the Internet.
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:50.480]   Sorry, Dr. Rowe is at craphound.com.
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.480]   Find out about his new book at craphound.com/ftw.
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:52.480]   And you're right.
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:53.480]   And I edit "Boying Boing."
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:54.480]   Oh, I forgot "Boying Boing."
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:55.480]   Let's leave that out.
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:44:01.280]   "Boying Boing."net, which is the original vblog and a must read every single day.
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:04.640]   If you're not reading "Boying Boing," you're missing some great stuff.
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:05.640]   Really, really great stuff.
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:09.080]   Hey, that's what it looks like with the ad blocker turned off.
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:11.080]   Just kidding.
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:14.520]   Corey, that's what's going to say that.
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.320]   Oh, wait.
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:20.600]   At least he's not trying to goose up his own revenues.
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:21.600]   I'm kidding.
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:23.560]   I love it.
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:25.240]   We won't tell Mark you said that.
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:26.800]   Oh, I'm just kidding.
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:27.800]   Jeez.
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:28.800]   John Battelle's going to kill you.
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:32.120]   Yeah, so I'm going to be in New York next week for the book Expo America.
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:35.360]   I'm doing live events, two stores of Manhattan, one in Brooklyn.
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:38.360]   And then I'm going to be in Toronto on June the 4th for the big Canadian launcher for
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:40.240]   the win at the Merrill Collection.
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.040]   That's exciting.
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:42.040]   So you're hometown.
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:43.040]   It is.
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:44.040]   I'm going to see the family.
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:45.040]   Back home.
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:46.040]   That's where his server.
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:47.840]   Your home is where the server is.
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:48.840]   That's right.
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:50.800]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:52.680]   Don't forget, we do shows about all of these subjects.
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:54.400]   In fact, we're doing more and more live coverage.
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:57.760]   If you were watching Wednesday and Thursday morning, we did live coverage of the Google
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:03.520]   I/O keynotes with commentary by Kevin Marks, our own Larry Flanagan and Tom Merritt.

[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:23.840]   though to.
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:24.840]   I love it.
