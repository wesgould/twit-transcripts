[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by AOL radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   This is Twist, this weekend tech, Episode 62 for July 16th, 2006.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Lazy Sunday.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Sunday.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Maybe we should use the new Chinese Skype.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Is it a new Chinese Skype? No.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   It says a group of Chinese developers that they were versing.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Oh, they were versing in it. I did see that, yeah.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   And so they got a client that's going to be able to access the Skype network and you can play it.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   They were talking about the show. We are talking about it. The show has begun.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   John C. de Vorack.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   There's really a somewhere to be in a minute or two.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   You got a cook. Oh, you got to make dinner. Isn't that sweet? What's for dinner tonight?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Don't know. That's the problem. He's got a shop and then cook.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   deVorack.org/blog. Check for his great recipes online.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Actually, you know, I used to do recipes for board watch magazine.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   People read once or another asking me if I'd such you with that again.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I wish I could have even nerd-oriented in terms of the, you know, lots of tales of why these things are the way they are.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   But I'm going to dig up the old ones. I think I'm going to just bring them out of an archive and drop them on a page.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Absolutely. I bet you're a good cook.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I mean, many people don't know you started as a writer, as a wine writer.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   And I am a good cook. I bet you are. What's your speciality?
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Well, actually the thing that everyone moans about because I cook it too often is a London broil made from a flank steak that's been marinated.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And it's like probably the most spectacular thing you've ever had.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   If you don't know the great thing about flank steak, it's the tastiest meat in the world.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   But if you don't know how to cook it, which is what 99% of the people, well, they qualify, nobody knows how to cook it, right?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   But if you know how to cook it, it's a stunner. You're absolutely right. It's always available.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   It's too tough and it will curl up, but it's a lean, healthy meat.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Yeah. And if you know how to cook it, it's not tough at all. It's very tender.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   So it's like a trick. I actually, one of the recipes I think I did in board watch, it describes the process to do it the easy way.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Do you grill it?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Yeah, I do. I mean, you can broil it. I mean, that's what the original recipe was. It's why it was called London broil.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   But I put it on a, you know, 800 degree grill. Yeah, for sure. And it only takes about, you know, six, seven minutes.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Wait a minute. You tell me London broil is flank steak?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Yeah, one of the main recipes for London broil is flank steak. It's also done with the Chateau Breon, but generally speaking, it's a flank steak.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I had no idea. I am learning so many things from you, John.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   David Prager is also here from revision three. And we welcome you to the program once again.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   You may hear him clicking as I delete files from the hard drive. I ran out of recording space.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Also here. I thought you had a whole terabyte. I do. And I don't know what happened. I'm filled in.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   It goes quick. Podcasts do go quick. That's the voice of ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Mr. Robert Herron from DLTV. Hello, Robert. Hey, how are you guys?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   You probably use up a, actually this is an interesting question. How much hard drive space do you have locally, like on your local hard drive?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Well, my notebook is pretty limited, but everything in the room I'm sitting in right now, I've pretty much lost track.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   It's over a terabyte. But I keep buying hard drives. I think people nowadays probably put probably 500 gigs in every computer, don't you think?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   160, 200 gigs is plenty of room for most people. I mean, that's...
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I don't know. Everything I have now has 300 or more. How much space do you have on your own?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Oh, you don't want to... I live on notebook computers. So I've got stuff stored on external hard drives that live in closets, which is really sad.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   But I've got this tiny little think pad and it has a smaller form factor hard drive than most of the notebook hard drives.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   So it's 40 gigs and it drives me nuts. And the main reason is I subscribe to just say podcast.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And so every day I'm deleting stuff. 40 gigs is fairly enough.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   That's a little dinky hard disk. I think you can get 80 now on that little thing.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Are you sure I looked about three months ago?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   You start looking now at the perpendicular drives. I'm pretty sure there's an 80 out there for that little thing.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   That's not a standard laptop drive. It's even smaller than a laptop.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   It's smaller. Yep. It's annoying. It's got the same pin connections.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   No, it's probably the two point. I think the standard laptops are... Yeah, you're right. Maybe 1.8.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   That's small. Wow. Yeah. How much hard drive space, John, if you had to estimate it's sitting in that room.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   About three terabytes, I'd say. Wow. Wow. Maybe. I mean, I got three machines in this room and there's a terabyte drive sitting on the floor and a couple of half a terabyte drive sitting next to it.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   It's just about three, I'm guessing. Wow. You got to get this. Take a look at this in front thing.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I'll talk about it some other time, but I'm really loving it as a backup.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Oh, our network guy. Rated that very highly. I like the lot. It's a RAID 5. I've got a terabyte for less than a thousand bucks and it does the backup in the background.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   There's no software running on my systems because it's running Linux.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I told it back up these folders daily and it does. It's really pretty sure we picked something like that up and we use it on our network.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I bet you get with Gigabit Ethernet.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Whatever one supported Gigabit is. Now it's like with Gigabit into that, that's as fast as a hard drive connection.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I still have an issue with this backup philosophy. My concern is that what happens if you have a fire?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   No, I still have to do offsite. You're right. You still have to do offsite.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Where do you do your offsite? Where does it go? Do you do your own CDs?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I burn DVDs or CDs and I bring it home. I don't have. I'll be honest.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   You don't know what? I don't have offsite for the podcast stuff, but that's all uploaded to servers.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   The stuff I'm backing up is a step that I'm still working on editing.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   If there are catastrophic fire at the Twifton headquarters, we'd lose podcasts.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   It wouldn't be the end of the world.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   By the way, my son sitting here who you might as well introduce to, but he mentions that because of the Twit audience, they probably have us all backed up many times.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I'm not worried about that exactly. It's only the stuff in progress.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   The TV network, CBS, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC, NBC
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   The lowest ratings, the least watched week in recorded history last week.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   The end of the line for broadcast networks, what do you think?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   That's vacation time.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   It's traditionally the lowest.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   All the blogs go down in their numbers this month.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   This is a terrible month for everybody.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   It's traditionally the lowest July, or the July.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Have you looked at the offerings on television?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I'm very crappy at this time of year.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   It's always the reason.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   This is worse than ever.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   This is the worst.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I think it's the worst.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   There's nothing on television to watch.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Nothing.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   There's no sports on.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Maybe you're right.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Maybe just because World Cup is over.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   What's the daily show?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   That's it.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Well, the concert has been well.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Nielsen came out with it.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Nielsen Net Ratings announced on July 12th.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   6.6% of the US adult online population are 9.2 million web users that have recently downloaded
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   an audio podcast and they're seeing like the numbers going up and up.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   They're watching YouTube.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   They're listening to podcasts.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   They're not watching television anymore.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I think you watch.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I mean, this is, yes.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Admittedly, this is a slow time and maybe there's no good TV on anyway, but I think you're
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   going to see slower and slower and lower and lower.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   It's been the trend for a while.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.320]   The story you mentioned about it, they also said that the podcasts now are more popular
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.000]   than blogs and I really wonder about that.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   That's true.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   That's the story that came floating around from that Nielsen Net Rating folks.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Those guys, do you trust those guys as a numbers?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   They seem like they would be the most accurate numbers out there.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I do trust them.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   I think they got a lot of good people at these kinds.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I mean, they cannot afford to be wrong.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I mean, they're not going to be dead on, but I mean, they're just closer than anything else.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Are they talking about data transferred?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Because obviously the multimedia is bigger.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Are they talking about actual people that access it?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   If they said 6.6 million podcasts, that's a lot of podcasts.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   They said it's actual people.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   But the thing is I'm wondering how they're, you know, I think there's a problem categorizing
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   blogs.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I think there's two things that I learned.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   One, you have like on Malek, for example, with his blog, which is pretty famous.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   He refuses to call it a blog and he considers himself sort of like a little publication.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And I think a lot of people when they get on certain people's blogs, they really don't
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   know what it is they're on.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   They just think it's a cool website.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   And a blog is more personal than that kind of stuff, I think.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   That's journal.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Well, that's why I have a problem with the way some people are using the term "vlog."
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Some people have video blogs and some people actually create like little shows.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Yes, system is not a blog.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Because it's not a diary.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   It's not an online diary, which is what a blog is.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Right.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And it's not an online video diary.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   People have online video diaries.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   I'm not buying that online diary thing.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   The original blog or web blog was somebody who, and I remember this back in the '90s when
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   I was at CNET, there would always be somebody in a company who was really good at finding
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   websites like Save Something Like Robot Wisdom, for example.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And they would just say, "Hey, look at this site.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Let's get them to do it."
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Later, these diaries came online because the software made it so easy for them to do it.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   No, you're right.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Originally it was two kinds of blogs.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   It was linking to other sites.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   You're right.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   It was just a bunch of links, basically, with maybe a little commentary.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Yeah, it was a web blog.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   It wasn't a web diary.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Right.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   But now it is a way.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I think I kind of agree that people are assuming a real blog, that somebody writing, you know,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   just blathering on about themselves and what that happened.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   That G sandwich thing.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   That's just my space.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Which is not, I don't know, what my space is.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   We'll talk about my space just a little bit.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   But you know what I'd like to see is compare the network television numbers to the net Nielsen
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   ratings for websites.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And I bet you, at some point, we're going to see the lines crossed, don't you think?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   As networks go down and the internet goes down.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Oh, those are pretty good numbers those networks have.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   That's true.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   They said that for the first time ever, the lowest rated TV show got fewer than 10 million
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   viewers.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   10 million.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   But you know, even if everything's on the web, I mean, you know, the huge fan bases of good
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   productions are entertaining ones, like say ABC's TV show lost.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   If they could, you know, maybe it's not going to be always on TV, but if they create a good
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   show and figure out what model to put it out online on, because you can watch every single
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   episode on their website right now on ABC's website.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   I got it.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   They're going to have to figure out how these model, how they get, if they're going to pay
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   for it through the traditional advertising or not.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   I got an email from a producer who's really excited.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Her name is Susan Norcan.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   She recently produced a pilot that was bought by sci-fi network called the Amazing Screw on
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Head.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   It's an animated show.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   It's called Paul Jamati, David Hyde, Pierce, Molly Shannon, good voices in it.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   And she's really happy because sci-fi network decided the pilot is going to be aired, the
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   first show is going to be aired July 27th, but sci-fi decided to put it online first.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Before it airs, you can watch the pilot now on the web and for two weeks after it airs,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   which I think is very interesting.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Well, you know, we bought that a couple of days ago, my son again, you know, found that
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.760]   real quick, but mainly because we're fans, the whole family here is fans of this Brian
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.680]   Fuller guy who did the Dead Like Me show, which was always quite amusing with Manny
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:21.000]   Potemkin and then, or Patinkin, and then Wonder Falls, which was a killer, very amusing
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.640]   sitcom, which Fox ran it for like two shows and then killed it and left the rest of the
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.280]   can, which came out on a DVD and I would recommend people go out there and, you know, this typical
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.280]   Fox go out there and buy the DVD.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.640]   It's a really nice 13 episode.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.640]   It's amazing.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.000]   I guess they aired four and then killed it because there was nine and four.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.400]   This is proving David's point and proving frankly, this, this, the smartness of sci-fi
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.400]   dot com.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.240]   Look at the buzz they've got already.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.480]   You know, there's a kind of a built-in geek fan base who's going to spread the word.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.480]   They're going to tell blogs.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.480]   They're going to blog about it.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.200]   They're going to mention it on their podcasts and it's a great way to build buzz.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.480]   Does it hurt the ratings of the show when it finally airs on TV?
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.480]   No, not at all.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.280]   I think it probably puts it through the roof.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.680]   Smartness of sci-fi channel?
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.680]   That's not a good way to...
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   Man's Sceeto.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.680]   That's not...
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   Who's that there?
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.680]   Is that JC?
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.680]   JC.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.160]   We've never had JC on before.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.160]   That's great.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.160]   Good to talk to you, JC.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.800]   Hey, but they did Man's Sceeto.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.800]   I think it's...
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.800]   What's Man's Sceeto?
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   Is that a man anim-sceeto?
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.200]   They're a horrible movie.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:41.260]   The
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:14:01.580]   guy
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:27.900]   of
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:34.900]   the
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:41.900]   show.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:48.900]   I think it's a
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:55.900]   great
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:02.900]   description.
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:09.900]   I think it's a great
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:16.900]   view.
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:23.900]   I think it's a great view.
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:30.900]   I think it's a great view.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:37.900]   I think it's a great view.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:45.900]   I think it's a great view.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:52.900]   Keep playing it.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.900]   It's a series of tubes.
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.900]   It's not the greatest song in the world.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.900]   Do you think Rupert Murdoch killed it or an accident?
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.900]   There's a political angle to it.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.900]   Who knows?
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.900]   Does someone you know is going to tell us?
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.900]   The thing's all over the place anyway, so who cares?
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.900]   In a song.
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.900]   Best way to publicize something like this is to do something like that.
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.900]   It's amusing.
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:21.900]   You should definitely run it.
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.900]   We'll put it in and everybody can hear it.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.900]   Go ahead, Robert.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.900]   It's a knee-jerk reaction.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.900]   By the Myspace folks.
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.900]   They have the right to take anything off or on.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:36.900]   They want.
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.900]   I think knee-jerk is a good way to describe it.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.900]   It probably was.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.900]   I think the emphasis on the word "jerk" is part of it.
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.900]   We can take a really, hopefully, a careful look at it.
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.900]   They did eventually.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.900]   I guess it eventually reinstated it.
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.900]   Maybe that was it.
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:02.900]   I think the same thing happened when the Apple stores pulled that biography of Steve Jobs.
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.900]   It's the kind of thing you go, "Oh!" and you pull it.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.900]   We're greted at your leisure because, of course, it really helps promote it, frankly.
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:15.900]   Like you said, if nothing else, the artist of this video now has even more publicity and fame.
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.900]   Exactly.
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.900]   That's why people sell banned books.
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.900]   They say it's a banned book and everyone buys it.
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:24.900]   That's right.
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.900]   The guy just passed away who published the Anarchists cookbook.
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.900]   Really?
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.900]   Yeah, you remember that?
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:30.900]   You just bought that one.
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.900]   I was a teenager.
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:32.900]   No.
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.900]   You bought the Anarchists cookbook?
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.900]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.900]   What?
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.900]   They had a great modification for a rifle I had.
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.260]   I didn't even know that there was an author.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:45.380]   I remember back in the BBS days, like, you know, there was a big, huge document you can
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.900]   get that teaches you how to make underwater igniters and stuff like that.
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:49.900]   Right.
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.900]   I didn't know there was an author who was a publisher called Paladin Press.
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.900]   That's all of those.
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:54.900]   That's who died.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:59.900]   It was the guy who started the Paladin Press passed away a couple of weeks ago.
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.820]   He had already sold the book to another firm.
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.700]   He said, you know, we didn't publish it for political reasons.
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.700]   It was very controversial.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:12.700]   He had bomb making recipes, ways to make, you know, hack phones and stuff.
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:17.060]   He said, we just published it because we needed the money.
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:21.300]   In fact, the Anarchists said this is a terrible book.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.420]   It's now public domain, by the way.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.420]   You can't.
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.420]   I think you're right, David.
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.220]   I think you can download it.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.220]   That'd be interesting to see.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.620]   I got to look and see if I can find the original version.
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:35.260]   I know there's all kinds of quote unquote controversial stuff.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.140]   I've seen the text floating around on the internet.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.420]   You can definitely download it now.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.500]   So what did you make your machine gun and machine gun, Robert?
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.460]   Yeah, I was on that path.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.460]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.460]   See, he's lois.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.700]   I had no idea.
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.340]   I lived in the boonies.
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.740]   There was nothing else to do.
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.420]   I could safely blow up things.
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.420]   It was, yeah, it was a perfect kid environment.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.540]   And I worked in a machine shop and it was like, ah, I had everything up my hands.
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.540]   It's like, what can I do today?
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.580]   Well, I'm glad that you did that.
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.580]   And that did--
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.740]   No, it sounds like an investigation system.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.740]   Oh, please.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.340]   You still have the gun?
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.100]   I do.
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.620]   And it was never modified just for--
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.540]   but it's an excellent rifle.
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.860]   You didn't succeed in finishing it, huh?
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.260]   No, never did.
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.780]   I think it's better the way it is stock than it is to convert it.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.580]   It was more for target practice than anything.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.540]   You just wanted to blow something away, man.
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.740]   And it's not even in this house.
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.220]   It's like a couple hundred miles away from me.
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.580]   Well, the coolest stuff in there was analog phone hacks.
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.100]   Like a pile of them.
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.100]   Totally.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.100]   And then explosive.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.820]   How to blow stuff up creatively.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.420]   Can you buy analog phones anymore?
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.580]   I don't think you can.
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.580]   Wow.
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.580]   Yeah, of course you can.
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.580]   Come on.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:44.580]   Where?
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.580]   We're not Radio Shack.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.580]   We actually have a website we're going to find for you.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.580]   Analogphone.com.
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.580]   JC, get on it.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:50.580]   Does he--
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.620]   I doubt the guts of it are analog anymore.
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.180]   I mean, those are probably not made.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.900]   Those old carbon mics and all that?
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.540]   That and the true mechanical spin.
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.180]   I forget what they call that, the dialing wheel.
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.180]   [HONKING]
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.180]   [HONKING]
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.180]   [HONKING]
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.180]   I actually had it screwing up on the phones.
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:13.820]   I actually JC had this idea, which I thought was a good one, which was to have a cell phone
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.140]   with a dialing wheel.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.140]   That's a great idea.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.340]   A rotary phone on a dial on a cell phone.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.220]   I mean, you definitely get attention.
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.980]   You know who's done it already?
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.980]   Woz.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:30.220]   Woz brings he has an old Western electric handset with a dial that's a cell phone.
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:35.580]   And he carries it around with him and you can make calls.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.580]   I'm sure he bought it somewhere.
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.100]   I don't know if he made it himself, but--
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.660]   He may have made it himself.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.660]   He's crazy.
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:41.660]   He loves that kind of stuff.
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.420]   He loves-- it's just-- it's a sight gag to him.
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.940]   Oh, let me answer my cell phone.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.940]   I'll be with lasers and cell phones.
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:47.940]   It's a sight gag.
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.940]   Well, this one-- one of the usual ones was--
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:51.940]   Retrobrick.com.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.500]   You can get some old cello stuff.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.500]   Retrobrick.com.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.500]   Thank you, JC.
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.540]   Hey, this guy's useful.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.780]   Can we make him a twit?
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.340]   Yeah, sure.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.140]   He could be our junior correspondent.
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.020]   He's like the Jimmy Olsen a twit.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.460]   And actually, that's great because you're actually like the Perry White of twit.
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.420]   And Robert, you're like the Superman.
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.420]   Aw.
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.420]   And Leo?
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.420]   Yes.
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.420]   I put a cap on.
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.220]   No, I was-- I thought you were going to say Lois Lane.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.500]   I thank you for not going there.
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.740]   No, I could have gone there.
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:26.580]   Whitline Hanoi, more than 20 desperate students in Vietnam, paid up to 50 million dong.
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.220]   I didn't know that was their unit of currency.
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.220]   It is.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:36.380]   It's about $3,000 to don elaborately wired wigs and shirts that allowed them to cheat on their
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.980]   college entrance exams.
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.700]   That's a good idea.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.700]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.100]   During a week-- I'm sure you've blogged this already, John.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.100]   During a weekend--
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.460]   Yeah, you get to it.
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.460]   Get to it.
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.460]   You slow.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:57.060]   During a weekend, Ray and Hanoi police confiscated 50 mobile phones, 60 earphones, 150 SIM cards,
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:01.260]   8 shirts and 5 wigs.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:08.940]   I guess the idea was that they were going to phone in the answers.
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.580]   The reason they wore the wigs, because their hair was too short to cover the earphone.
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.580]   And then they would wire up the shirts.
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.660]   And it's pretty competitive in Hanoi.
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:21.940]   It says only 10% of the students who take the exams get in to the universities.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.500]   You know, I've been to Vietnam recently.
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.100]   And that's a really amazing place, because it's something they have something like 98%
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.100]   literacy rate.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.100]   Wow.
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.500]   Everybody wants-- everybody's just enthusiastic about learning as much as they can about
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.580]   everything they can learn.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.580]   Wow.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.940]   It's a pretty astonishing, good place to visit.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.300]   Little airports are a little harsh, but other than that, it's--
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.300]   I'd love to go there.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.300]   And the food's incredible.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.580]   I hear it's really a beautiful place, very nice people.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.900]   And their cheating's never right, but just the fact that they're cheating on an entrance
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.580]   exam to better their education.
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.620]   You can't blame them for that, huh?
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.620]   It must be very competitive.
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.620]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.620]   That's all I have to say.
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.620]   If they go to these lengths.
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.820]   $3,000 and a funny looking wig.
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.780]   Here's my bad electronic setup that might get you to pass.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.060]   We're going to have somebody feed you the information.
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.260]   We'll get the test ahead of time.
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.380]   And none of it looks good enough to pass the master.
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:18.620]   They don't say what the penalty is for these kids.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.980]   But I hope they don't throw the book at them.
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.020]   You know who they did throw the book at?
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:28.980]   And in fact, a judge just upheld the verdict.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:40.420]   A hacker who in fact didn't succeed got a nine-year sentence for trying the hack.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:45.300]   General Peels judge upheld the prison term on Monday for a hacker who tried and failed
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:50.460]   to steal customer credit card numbers from the Lowe's chain of home improvement stores.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:55.460]   Guys 23 has been in custody since 2003 anyway.
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.980]   An FBI stakeout caught him and a partner breaking into several Lowe's networks over an unsecured
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.780]   Wi-Fi connection.
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.420]   He's going to be in jail till 2011.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.500]   That's the first time he'll be eligible for parole.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.500]   That too long?
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.340]   I think the whole thing is ridiculous since he didn't really do anything.
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.340]   He was just wardrogged.
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.980]   He was an attempted to threaten somebody.
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.500]   Who the hell is his lawyer?
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.620]   What kind of crappy lawyer did he have?
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:26.540]   The kid was ward driving in Southfield, Michigan, found an unsecured wireless network
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:31.100]   and attempted, and I don't imagine attempted very effectively, to hack into the network.
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.540]   Maybe he had a serial or cane enable on his system.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:38.380]   If he had a decent attorney, the attorney would simply point out, was that unsecured
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.620]   access point even touching the corporate network.
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.620]   Well it was.
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:42.620]   It was stored.
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.620]   Well it was.
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.620]   Okay.
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.420]   Then somebody in their IT department then should be fired immediately.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.420]   No kidding.
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.540]   The pair discovered that just the job has not happened.
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.860]   They could jump from the Southfield, Michigan Lowe's to the company's central data center
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:58.260]   in North Carolina and from there to the local network's stores around the country.
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.340]   They should be paying that guy from finding that hole.
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:02.340]   No kidding.
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:04.300]   Lowe's detected the intrusion.
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.860]   So apparently they didn't have some security on there.
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.220]   They called the FBI.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.460]   The FBI stakes out the store parking lot.
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:17.180]   They eventually spot the kids Pontiac Grand Prix bristling with antennas that occupied
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.180]   by two young men.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:24.900]   This could have been Patrick Norton occupied by two young men typing on laptops.
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.300]   The agents watched him work for 20 minutes and trailed him to a little Caesar's restaurant.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.300]   Pizza Pizza.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:34.300]   You know, that's how we get advertising in here.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.500]   We could just do things like that.
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.500]   Just throw that in like that.
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.500]   Pizza Pizza.
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.500]   You could.
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.500]   And they were.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.500]   I think they were.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.500]   I think they proved the case.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.500]   Does anyone have a clue?
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.220]   Does anyone know anything about it?
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:49.140]   Maybe somebody out there who listens to us is from North Carolina.
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:50.940]   I think this is where it was, right?
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.740]   No, it was a Michigan.
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.740]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:54.740]   Yeah.
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:58.540]   Maybe somebody out there knows the.
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.020]   The case was prosecuted in Charlotte.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.020]   Right.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.020]   North Carolina.
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.020]   Because that's where it loads you.
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:08.220]   Because it's home to an FBI cyber crime task force according to the.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.620]   Yeah, you want them to commute.
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:10.620]   That's the good.
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.420]   No, they actually did get six credit numbers.
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.260]   I don't mean how long has he been in the can right now?
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.460]   He's already been in the can three years.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.380]   He's going to get another nine years.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:21.860]   So that's a year and a half per credit card number.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:22.860]   That's a little weird.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.100]   I mean, what is standard breaking and entering?
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.100]   Yeah.
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.260]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.740]   It shouldn't be any more than that.
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:32.780]   The sentence was largely based as according to Wired News on the amount of harm that would
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.780]   have resulted had the plan succeeded.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.340]   Well, I guarantee anybody who had a.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.660]   This is like a pre crime.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.940]   It's like a Tom Cruise movie.
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.500]   It's a pre crime.
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.100]   Where are we getting all these pre crime things going on?
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.740]   Nobody's saying anything.
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.740]   People are, you know, this always happens when there's something new and people are
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:50.740]   scared of it.
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:51.740]   I'm I would.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.740]   I'm surprised.
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.700]   I mean, I think it's like the Kevin Mitnick case where they kind of went overboard because
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.300]   it was new to them.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:01.380]   Maybe this is maybe they're afraid of Wi-Fi hacking or something.
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.300]   But here's the I mean, you probably shouldn't do this.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:08.500]   But if you compare it to other cases, for instance, the case where one of the leaders
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:13.300]   of the shadow crew fraud ring was sentenced to he'd use phishing and spamming techniques
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:17.860]   to steal credit card numbers, actually stole the numbers, made online purchases.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:18.860]   He got 32 months.
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.700]   That doesn't sound harsh enough.
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.340]   Yeah, that guy should get nine years.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.900]   Yeah, it's a flip flop.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:26.900]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.820]   But I mean, you can't really compare them.
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.420]   The judges different jurisdictions, different courts, but I just it doesn't seem right.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.740]   Nine years for this poor kid.
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.980]   It sounds like these people don't have good legal representation.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.540]   Might be might be.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:44.380]   But we shouldn't it means too bad you live in a country where you can't I mean, if you're
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.180]   rich, you get off.
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.180]   Come on.
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.180]   Yeah.
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.180]   Should I start playing the socialist music?
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.180]   In Tonasional.
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:56.620]   Did you see the pictures of the Dell laptop exploding?
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:00.060]   Yeah, I actually we blog that too.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.580]   But isn't that too much ago or something, right?
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.700]   It was a couple of weeks ago, but we're the pictures just started coming out of it.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.380]   Well, the Dell was investing in it.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.380]   Did they come up with it?
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.700]   Dell says they're investing in maybe that's why it's now a story.
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.100]   I just saw the pictures and the acquire a lot.
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.420]   How about wasn't that an apple blowing up to?
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.220]   I mean, these are machines made in China.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.300]   And I think there's some some issues.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.500]   You know, there's a fact that I was going to do a column on this, but I kind of swapped
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.180]   it out for something else.
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:32.020]   But you know, these counterfeit products that the Chinese do, then they get into the
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.380]   main stream production lines here and there.
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.660]   I suspect this is the culprit here.
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:38.660]   I agree with you.
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.660]   It's lithium ion batteries.
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.900]   They all explode if you overcharge them.
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:48.740]   And well made ones all have circuitry to prevent you from doing that.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.140]   But if something goes wrong with a circuitry or and I think you're right, John, a lot of
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:57.340]   this is that people buy, you know, so, you know, mislabeled counterfeit batteries that
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.340]   don't have any protections.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.820]   And I think that's where a lot of this goes.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.660]   Although Apple was having big problems with swelling batteries in the MacBook.
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:06.500]   I didn't have that, but apparently they were seen pictures.
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.260]   They're just like little fat batteries.
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.260]   They don't quite fit.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.340]   Maybe go back to having Americans make these products.
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.940]   I think it's lithium ion.
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.940]   I think that's part of it.
[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:16.940]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.540]   Well, you know, it's a dangerous technology.
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:21.100]   Anything with lithium, of course, was a highly explosive.
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:26.380]   In fact, if you bust open one of those cases, you'll see that they're actually the design
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:30.660]   in such a way that you could segment them out to be the size of a bunch of double-A
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.420]   batteries all lined up because of there's an FAA regulation that says you cannot make
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:39.900]   it lithium ion cell bigger than a double-A.
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.420]   And you'll see this characteristic every so often.
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:47.220]   Any lithium battery has to have some sort of a, some way of being segmented off as a
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.220]   double-A battery.
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:52.700]   Otherwise, it's against a lot of putting on an airplane.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.860]   But do you mean not?
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:54.860]   Unless there are little bitty ones.
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:55.860]   What?
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:56.860]   You can't be any bigger than a certain size.
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.700]   But like my laptop battery, that's, that's okay.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.700]   I don't have to take that.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:00.700]   Yeah.
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.180]   But I bet you, I bet you, I'm guessing that if it's a big battery, unless it's just
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.620]   a small one, but if it's a big one, that's, that's bigger than double-A size, if you
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.860]   cracked it open, I bet you find it looks like a bunch of little double-A's in there.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:13.500]   In case somebody asked me to take it apart, how do they ship them?
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.500]   Oh, good.
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.860]   It's some, it's just a way of getting around a problem.
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.860]   Right.
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.860]   I do they ship them.
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:19.860]   That's a good way.
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:20.860]   I guess I put them on a boat.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.220]   I mean, it's a dangerous technology.
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:25.220]   That's the thing.
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.220]   Yeah.
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.220]   Well, I'm afraid one of these things blows up in an airplane.
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:31.020]   What are you going to do that thing that you're talking about was a massive explosion.
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.020]   Look at it.
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.020]   Look at the pictures.
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.020]   We'll put the link in the show notes.
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.220]   It's, I mean, of course, you know, it's, it's hard to tell.
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.660]   It's very bright.
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.820]   It could be just a, you know, a little bit bright.
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.140]   It doesn't look, doesn't look right.
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.020]   It doesn't look like something you'd want to be sitting next to.
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:49.620]   And you certainly wouldn't want to have it happen in the cargo compartment of an airplane
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.460]   midair on your lap.
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.540]   Definitely not on your lap.
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:31:00.140]   Microsoft is, is as a new operating system called Windows Fundamentals for legacies,
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.340]   PCs.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.340]   So it's a stripped down version of XP.
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:08.140]   Well, yeah, we had a little with, we have to mark in fact that this is the week that
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:12.540]   Windows 95, 98 and ME are now out of cycle there end of cycle.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.540]   Yay.
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.900]   Well, you say, yeah.
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.260]   But what about all the people who use them?
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:19.100]   They can't, they're no more support, no more fixes.
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.700]   Well, nobody using that stuff.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.820]   Leo, I bet there's 30 million computers running Windows 98.
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.420]   Well, he's still on the software.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.420]   Hopefully that goes with that.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:29.340]   You know, if it hasn't crapped out by now, it's running fine.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:34.020]   What kind of, what kind of legacy support do you need for an operating system that's
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.020]   this old?
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.940]   Actually, I'm more concerned about security patches.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:37.940]   That's more of the.
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.460]   Oh, well, switch to.
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.460]   Yeah, what hackers are going to go after that?
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.460]   I mean, it's just.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.460]   Oh, are you kidding?
[00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.180]   That's that's gold for hackers.
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.660]   They look for Windows 98 systems.
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.660]   Yeah.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.660]   Are you kidding?
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.660]   They love that.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:50.660]   So this is the idea.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.220]   You have to be a business, unfortunately.
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:56.260]   This is for really what it is is for, you know, big businesses that have 30,000 seats
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.300]   and 10,000 are still Windows 98.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:02.060]   So they can get this basically turns it turns into a terminal.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.420]   Are you familiar with their software assurance program?
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.100]   That's what it says it's for who can be a member of that business?
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.100]   You have to be it's basically a licensed software assurance.
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.180]   It's basically a license.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:19.020]   It's for people who have a lot of seats and they buy, you know, a lot of Windows.
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.020]   And that's it.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.020]   That makes sense.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.860]   I mean, these guys, it's very expensive for them to replace their 98 machines, their
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:24.860]   Windows 98 machines.
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.780]   They just put this stuff on it and it turns into a terminal.
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:33.140]   So is anybody filed to story about the fire's file swappers, identities protected by Dutch
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.140]   court?
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.140]   No.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.780]   The Dutch appeals court throw it through or to the Thames by the Dutch anti piracy organization
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:44.100]   B.R.E.I.N. to get to the identity of file shares.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:49.780]   And so apparently they guess the government or the some group there, the courts are protecting,
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:54.500]   you know, file sharing in the Netherlands, which I think is a positive thing.
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.500]   Good.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.540]   Well, I think there are a number of countries now where they've said that in fact in Canada,
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.660]   they said file sharing is legal.
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:05.500]   In Canada, judge said about almost a year ago, eight months ago, told the record companies
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.500]   were doing the same thing.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.900]   These John Doe lawsuits were they're asking for the names of the people.
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.620]   They said, no, you can't.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.620]   It's not illegal.
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:16.660]   Wasn't there a case last week or two or some old ladies that, you know, decided to fight
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:23.500]   the RIAA and one of those John Doe lawsuits and they beat them and the court, you know,
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.020]   reprimanded the RIAA?
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.020]   Good.
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.340]   Go get them, lady.
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.460]   You got our support.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:35.220]   And apparently the RIAA is in a number of instances, at least one that I think we've
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:41.260]   blogged indicted or tried to indict a dead person for file sharing.
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.260]   Did they get them?
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.260]   Interesting concept.
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.740]   I think they got them dead to rights.
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:50.740]   I'm sure we could come up with more puns, but it's too damn hot.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.740]   No.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.700]   I sense the energy is low.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.700]   It's hot.
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:56.700]   Well, there's a couple of things.
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.180]   First of all, I don't know how we're going to get through the next two months because
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:03.380]   traditionally these are the slowest news months and we're just, there's not many stories.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.380]   As you can see, there's about 12 stories.
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.980]   And it's new court duo, man.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.980]   Okay, court duo.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:09.980]   Oh, you know what?
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:10.980]   We were supposed to get somebody on about that.
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:11.980]   Wait a minute.
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:12.980]   Wait a minute.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.980]   That's thanks for reminding me.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:18.620]   If Robert, did they have the bench, have they been benchmarking that stuff over a ZD?
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:19.620]   Yeah.
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.580]   And if you know what, it's faster across the board.
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:22.580]   That's what I mean.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:23.580]   What does that mean?
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.580]   It's across the board.
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.580]   What do I mean?
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.580]   Faster.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.580]   It's a benchmark.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.580]   They're throwing at it except thrice.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.580]   I believe one obscure benchmark.
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.740]   The new intel parts are faster than AMD's current top of the line.
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:36.340]   However, what I found kind of interesting was that for gaming in particular, when you
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:41.340]   start gaming at high resolution, not the CPU intensive, we jack the resolution all the
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:45.300]   way down, turn off all the features so it becomes a pure C-Pest.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.260]   For that, of course, you're seeing like 2X improvement with the new intel parts.
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:54.580]   But for high end gaming, where you're gaming at very high resolutions with maximum detail,
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:59.180]   the numbers are showing that in most cases you're seeing 10% or less.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:03.980]   And in some cases, a dead heat in terms of performance gains over AMD's latest.
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.740]   It really depends on what you're using.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:12.260]   According to PC World, according to PC World, who used the Worldbench 5 test suite, the Intel
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:20.420]   Core 2 Duo reference system that they built against an AMD Athlon 64 FX62, the Intel Core
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.380]   2 Duo outperformed by 17%.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:27.020]   I don't know the specifics of the Worldbench 5 test, but that's perfect.
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:31.580]   I was mostly interested in the gaming benchmark, so that's what I kind of focused on.
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.740]   And looking at that, I was honestly surprised.
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:38.860]   It looks very impressive when you look at 640x480 at 16-bit or whatever, but when you start
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:43.300]   cranking it up to full resolution, full detail, it was pretty much neck and neck.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.060]   The other cool thing being that Intel kind of drew the line in the set and said, "You
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.060]   know what?
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:51.140]   We're not going to go above 65 watts of heat dissipation for any of our new parts."
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:56.580]   And if they can maintain that and continue the performance improvements, that to me means
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:00.780]   more than anything else, because frankly, it was getting ridiculous with the previous
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.980]   generation of the Prescott Pentium 4s and even before that.
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:08.700]   But that last round of Prescott's were among the hottest chips I've ever had to deal with.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:14.180]   And in many cases, the stock cooler was totally insufficient for keeping that system stable.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:19.060]   I've been advocating a redesign of computers where you put those, actually, put the microprocessors
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:24.180]   on top of the computer, and then you can put coffee pots on top of the chips themselves,
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:28.500]   and then you'd have a coffee warming system that would really do a function computer that
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.100]   I think would be very popular.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:34.340]   Now, you're not going to be able to upgrade to these systems either without buying another
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:40.740]   new socket 775, which is the same as the Pentium 4 or Pentium D.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:41.740]   Really?
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.460]   But why can't more power?
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:44.460]   The port.
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.460]   But I don't know.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:47.660]   I'm reading the same PC world article.
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.940]   It says, "You can't pop a core to do a chip into the existing Intel-based PC."
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:59.660]   Well, it's like AMD's bouncing back and forth between socket 939-940 or 940, then 939,
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.100]   now back to 940.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.220]   And it's not the same 940 as before.
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:07.220]   It's not for technical reasons, it's just so that you have to buy it in motherboard.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.340]   And if you're going for a new chip for a new...
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:10.820]   Might as well get it in motherboard, huh?
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:11.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.500]   That's the cheapest part.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.940]   Has anybody gotten a response from AMD?
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:16.940]   Because they're going to...
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:17.940]   I mean, obviously...
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.940]   They claim they got something.
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:20.940]   Well, I haven't.
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:21.940]   You read anything?
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:22.940]   I haven't seen anything yet.
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.700]   Have you been in part lately?
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.740]   No, local transit system.
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:32.700]   Every ad, at least in the market street stations, the whole place is AMD ads for their Opturon
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.060]   server part.
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.060]   And they're looking at that.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.060]   What?
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.860]   The 4x4 setup is their low cost, low power server solution.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.700]   So they're focusing more on enterprise.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:44.540]   Well, they've always been focusing on enterprise.
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.260]   But they have such a good chip with the 64FX.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.580]   I would think that they would be looking at...
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:51.940]   I mean, that's a dual core.
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:56.620]   I would think they'd be looking at some way to kind of try to match intel on this.
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.620]   That's cool.
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:00.900]   Or even if the price just comes down to be even a ridiculous bargain.
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.900]   Granted...
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:02.900]   That's another way to do it.
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.140]   That doesn't help make money, but I love my X2 system.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:11.060]   And the half a dozen AMD-based systems I built recently last year or so.
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.500]   But even gamers now, I think, are looking at Conro as a better choice.
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:15.500]   Much better choice.
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:19.740]   If I were building something today, I'd probably wait until those chips are out.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.460]   Consider which one of them I wanted.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.300]   You know what I'm waiting for?
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.340]   I'm waiting for Vista.
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.340]   I'm just going to...
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.580]   And I think a lot of people probably will just wait till you can get it.
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.020]   Not a Vista-ready machine, but a machine with Vista installed.
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.180]   A machine built for Vista.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.900]   And at Conro, it will be great for that.
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.500]   Or maybe Merram, maybe the laptop part.
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:38.500]   When's that going to be?
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.780]   You're the only guy I've ever heard say something like that, Leo.
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.780]   What?
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:42.780]   That I'm waiting for Vista?
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:43.780]   Vista.
[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:47.220]   Most people, the word that you would use is dreading.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:52.220]   No, well, partly it's because I'm doing this Geek Cruise in February in which I've got
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:57.140]   like five seminars on moving to Vista, securing Vista, using Vista.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.940]   So I need to get Vista as soon as I can.
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:38:59.940]   Who's giving the seminars?
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:00.940]   Me.
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:01.940]   Oh, you are.
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.900]   Yeah, that's why I need to learn about Vista.
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.340]   Did you download the preview?
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.540]   You know, the latest beta?
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.540]   I didn't.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:10.780]   And it's again, maybe that's a case of dreading Vista.
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:11.780]   I don't really...
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.700]   There's no machine that I'm willing to sacrifice to the beta.
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.940]   Although I've played with it and I, you know, on other machine people's machines and it's
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:17.940]   very...
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.740]   It seems very good, very robust and it works.
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:24.140]   I guess I'll wait for the ready for, you know, the gold, the ready to manufacture and
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:25.140]   then I'll do it.
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:30.940]   I'm either going to get a bigger hard drive for my notebook or get another less expensive
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.140]   notebook and load up SuS101 on that.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.140]   SuS101.
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.140]   That's a pretty good choice I have to say.
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.140]   It's pretty compelling.
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:40.420]   I'd rather spend some time with that right now on something I can carry around with me.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.740]   Well, how many people are doing that?
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:46.860]   I mean, you think Microsoft's in trouble come January 2007 when Vista does come out?
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:50.460]   I mean, is it going to be people going, "I'm not going there."
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.460]   For the biggest numbers now?
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.420]   It's just going to be bundled with the new machines.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.420]   Yeah, just as much as you get.
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:56.940]   It's just how many people are going to upgrade.
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:57.940]   That's the...
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.300]   I mean, nobody I think is going to do that with their laptop because apparently you have
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:05.300]   to have these new hard disks that have a bunch of memory on them, you know, hard memory because
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.940]   they chew up the power for some reason.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:08.940]   Oh interesting.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.700]   And I guess there's all kinds of issues about Vista and it's disk-active.
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.300]   Accessing issues, I don't know.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.340]   Maybe people will be.
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:20.260]   Well, in a year from now when Vista comes out.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.740]   We'll find out.
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.300]   Yeah, late 2007 we'll find out.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.380]   You know, the fact that you have to get it to run, what is it?
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:27.380]   Halo 2?
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:28.380]   That's...
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.580]   How does JC feel about that?
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:34.020]   Is he going to make you buy a Vista machine as soon as possible?
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.020]   Does he want to play?
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.020]   What was that word?
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.020]   What was the word in there?
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.020]   Halo 2?
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.020]   No, no, buy.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.020]   Oh, buy.
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.020]   I'm sorry.
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.020]   I'm sorry, Xbox.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.020]   Huh?
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:44.020]   Let's find an Xbox.
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.060]   I'm waiting for Halo 3 on Xbox 360.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.060]   That seems...
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.060]   What is it?
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.060]   Is it one of the...
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.060]   Isn't...
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.060]   Which one requires Vista, isn't it?
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.060]   Is it any of those...
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.660]   Halo 2 does, but it hasn't come out for the computer yet.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.140]   But you could play it on Xbox last year or so.
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.140]   Oh, alright.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.140]   Older than that.
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.140]   I don't remember when it came out.
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.140]   So blurs.
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:05.540]   But the next one, Halo 3, which is coming out...
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.900]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:08.900]   They keep changing the date.
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.900]   When the Xbox 360, that's what I'm looking for.
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:11.900]   That'll be good.
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.340]   So right now you're playing the ship and pray?
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.740]   Yeah, I just finished pray.
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:20.500]   It's original and it definitely shows that it's done by 3D Realms.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.500]   They're the guys who did Duke Nukem and promising.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.380]   And when is Duke Nukem forever coming out?
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:28.940]   Right around the common Vista.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:34.140]   Alright, that's JC.
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.140]   JC stands for Junior Correspondent.
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:40.700]   Yeah, I've been named very odd names by my parents.
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.740]   But that was your name, the same name as your dad.
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.780]   Isn't your name the same as your dad's?
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:47.700]   Yeah, it just got a Smith in there.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:48.700]   So I'm not a junior.
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.020]   Oh, you're not a junior.
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.020]   Oh, alright.
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:53.820]   Alright, I'm really confused.
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.180]   So Mimi kept her name.
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.180]   Are you hyphenated?
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.380]   No, just a boric.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.380]   Alright.
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.380]   So there's a Smith...
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.380]   Yes, same cadences as his dad.
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.380]   He sounded like his dad.
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.380]   Just talking to him because he sounded like his dad.
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.380]   Like John sounded good.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.380]   I mean, he sounded good.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:12.900]   That's a mean thing to say to a 10 year old guy.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.540]   You sound like your dad.
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.020]   You guys are making me sick.
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.020]   So...
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.020]   You're proud.
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.020]   Come on, admit that.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.020]   Well, he knows more than...
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:26.660]   You know, he's one of the things that you get used to is when you have children who are
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:28.780]   computer savvy.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.580]   It really makes a big difference if you do what I do for a living, which is right about
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.580]   the stuff you like.
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.580]   He stands for them.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:38.060]   Yeah, I mean, there's certain trend lines that I simply couldn't possibly follow because
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.980]   it's just like, you know, there's only so many hours in the day and you can, you know,
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:45.420]   catch up with a lot of youth trends that, you know, I mean, let's face it, you know,
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.980]   we're not as young as we used to be.
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.860]   So that's what we got Prager for.
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:50.860]   That's for input.
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:51.860]   Prager's for our youth trend.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.900]   Am I the youngest one here?
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.540]   I think you are my friend.
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.020]   You're like, what, 18, right?
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.140]   He's the only guy under 30 on this panel.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.140]   Maybe...
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:02.140]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.140]   Go nothing.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.580]   Where are you under 30?
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:06.580]   I am indeed.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.580]   Oh.
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.860]   I know.
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.700]   So I don't know what the genesis of this is, but there was an article on Wired News.
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.380]   Did you see that Wired News got bought by Wired?
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.380]   It's about time.
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.380]   That was a story.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.820]   I don't think people even knew.
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.940]   I went to before.
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:27.100]   Lycos has owned it for like eight years.
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.380]   I don't think people knew it because it was so...
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:31.740]   I mean, when you go to Wired.com, what do you get?
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:32.740]   Wired News.
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:36.420]   With an ad big ad for Wired Magazine, but they weren't the same company at all.
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:37.740]   Yeah, they are now.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:38.740]   They are.
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:39.740]   They're back.
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:40.740]   That makes no sense.
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:43.740]   I think Wired News has actually in many ways turned itself around.
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.020]   They've got good colonists.
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:46.740]   They've got smart people.
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:47.740]   I agree.
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.420]   I think they've really become a pretty darn good site.
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:55.700]   You know what really surprises me is how good ours Technica is.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:56.700]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.420]   They're a great news site.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.420]   A long time.
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:02.100]   Weren't they just an enthusiast site for the longest time?
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.980]   But all of a sudden they're just totally great in those sites.
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.020]   You know what I like to go to a lot?
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.020]   What?
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.020]   Devorok.org/blog.
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.020]   Just to see what we're doing.
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:12.820]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:15.540]   So how much is Wired News worth?
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:16.540]   How much does it sell for?
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:17.540]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:18.540]   I don't know.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.540]   Let's guess.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.540]   Anybody.
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:21.540]   I'd say 20 million.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.140]   No, I ate million.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.980]   Oh, you're close.
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:25.980]   25.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:26.980]   25 million?
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:27.980]   That's outrageous.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.980]   Holy mackerel.
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.480]   That's cheap.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.980]   Boy, the writers are underpaid.
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.420]   Writers for Wired News.
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:35.420]   Ask for more.
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:36.420]   Cast off your whatever.
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.260]   That's a strike.
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:39.260]   Chains.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:40.260]   All right.
[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.620]   I got another as long as we're doing trivia.
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:46.340]   It happened on this day, July 16th, 1969.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.340]   Any guesses?
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.340]   Oh, that's a lie.
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:51.260]   It wasn't the moon landing, was it?
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.260]   It was a moon launch.
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:53.260]   Very good.
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:56.420]   Apollo 11 took off on this day.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:45:00.060]   Had it the first manned mission to land on the moon.
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.420]   I wonder if we can do that.
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:03.820]   Are we absolutely positive?
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:04.820]   Absolutely.
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:05.820]   This was an fake.
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.860]   They're bringing the shuttle back tomorrow.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.660]   Yeah, I'm glad we have a space program of some kind.
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:14.100]   I mean, it's not the most inspiring space program.
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.580]   Beat up old shuttle going up and down.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:21.860]   Well, this mission, there's a lot of people saying like, well, we've got these shuttles
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.220]   up there and the main goal is to finish the space station.
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.260]   Why don't they just send them up there unmanned?
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.580]   Send the shuttles up there unmanned.
[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:29.420]   That's what some people are saying.
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:33.060]   It makes sense, but I'll still stick with them.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.620]   It makes it that much more human, et cetera.
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.300]   Yeah, but this isn't inspiring.
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.300]   This isn't the kind of--
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.300]   No, that's what I'm--
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.300]   Even with people.
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.300]   Even with people.
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.300]   Even if it's fly the shuttle by wire all the way to the space station.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.940]   Oh, they don't have to put it forward by wireless.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:47.940]   Oh, sure.
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.580]   They could have got nine years of landing.
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.380]   So for acting, they could do it with a Wi-Fi adapter and a couple of antennas on its
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:54.380]   Pontiac.
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:55.980]   That's all it takes.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:59.380]   So they could easily, they could send the shuttle up, dock it to the space station.
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:02.380]   Have a basically they'd be dumping trash and unloading supplies.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:05.380]   Because apparently they got a big trash problem on that space station.
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:06.380]   Can't you just--
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:07.380]   I think--
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   Just putting it into the sun.
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.380]   That's a good question.
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.380]   I don't know.
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:14.380]   It seems like it could be an interesting idea.
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:19.340]   So there-- you may remember that the publishers, the music publishers were going after the
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:24.020]   lyrics sites, shutting them down, which never made any sense to me.
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:28.420]   Because I mean, if you're looking for a song and all you know is one line, you want to
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:29.420]   buy the song.
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.420]   What do you do?
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.420]   You type it into Google.
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:32.420]   You go to the lyrics site.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:33.420]   You find out what the song is.
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:34.420]   You buy it, right?
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:35.420]   This is good for music.
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:37.060]   I never understood whether trying to shut it down.
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.060]   Now I found out.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:39.060]   Now I figured it out.
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.060]   Grace note.
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:41.060]   CDDB.
[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:48.380]   Just sign a big deal with dozens of music publishers to what published lyrics on the internet.
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.380]   Good.
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.620]   So well, it is good because it'll keep it alive, but it's just, you know, it's typical.
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:57.260]   They're going to-- oh, you can't do it for free because we plan to monetize this sucker.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:01.220]   Well, can you access the data, though, from Grace note site for free?
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:02.220]   Right now you can.
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:03.220]   Right now you can.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.220]   Sure.
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.220]   I would hope that they would keep doing that.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:09.780]   If they do, that would be great because you could be listening to iTunes and legitimately
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.380]   the lyrics could pop up in a window or whatever.
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:16.380]   And I think actually that's something we probably need because, you know, without lineredodes,
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:21.380]   without album covers, you missed-- I mean, I like-- I used to like to listen to records
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:22.780]   and read the lyrics.
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:23.780]   Totally.
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.420]   That's one of my favorite things to do on my Tivo.
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.300]   I used a Java based app on one of my network computers.
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:33.300]   And when I'm playing music through my Tivo, either streaming audio from web-based stations
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.300]   or listening to my own tracks, it'll pull down the album.
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:39.940]   I'm not sure where it gets any of this, but it's grabbing the album art and the song lyrics
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:40.940]   for everything it plays.
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:41.940]   And it just shows me on the TV.
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:42.940]   And it's neat.
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:43.940]   That's really--
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:47.340]   Yeah, I can almost guarantee they're getting that from Grace note.
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.980]   That's one of the biggest licenses.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:49.980]   It says who they're getting it from.
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:50.980]   I just can't recall right off the top.
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:54.580]   Well, I think for a long time they're just like Amazon was-- you get the album art from
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:55.580]   Amazon.
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:58.740]   And maybe you-- Grace note now officially can offer the lyrics.
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.420]   I didn't know it was offering lyrics before.
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:05.020]   When I was over there visiting, they're local here.
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.020]   They had a scheme.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:10.020]   You know how they're the ones who started off by if you put a CD in your player.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.380]   Well, wait a minute now.
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:17.420]   The CDDB was originally like IMDB, a user-driven effort.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:22.740]   And then all of a sudden, along comes Grace note and buys the work of thousands of people.
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.540]   Yeah, well, that's the way they started.
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:28.020]   But anyway, the point is I was trying to make, besides this, I can see you have a grudge
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:29.020]   against them.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:30.020]   I do.
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:33.620]   The point I was trying to make is that they're supposedly-- I don't know if they've implemented
[00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:38.180]   this or not, but if you took and burned a CD of a mix that you did yourself--
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:39.180]   They could look at that.
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:41.300]   --of a very variety of songs.
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:45.820]   They claim that by looking at the signatures, they can recreate whatever song is and actually
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:50.380]   give you a printout of, in other words, they can do the same thing with your own mixes.
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:53.100]   In other words, your own ripped discs.
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.100]   That's cool.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:59.740]   The next step would then be to notify the Recording Industry Association of America.
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:03.180]   And then they'll keep track of how many times you've burned those songs and send you a bill
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.940]   after you burn them more than three times.
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:10.420]   I think there's a product out there that's called Music Brains, B-R-A-I-N-Z.org.
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:15.220]   And I think what they do is make something that'll go through your iTunes database for
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:19.220]   songs that you haven't labeled and then tries to identify some of the stuff that John was
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:20.220]   talking about.
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:22.220]   The godfather will do that on Windows.
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.220]   Okay.
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:25.540]   I mean, I think they use CDDB.
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:27.780]   CDDB doesn't have to just be album-oriented.
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:32.180]   If they have the length of the song, I guess they would need more than the length, though,
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.180]   if it's not on an album.
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:37.220]   I guess that's how-- I always thought, oh, they look up an album by some magic code that's
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.940]   embedded in the album on the CD.
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:42.860]   But no, in fact, what they do is look at the number of tracks, the length of the tracks,
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.220]   and they match it up that way.
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:46.620]   So how would they do individual tracks?
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:47.620]   So each song has a signature--
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.620]   Yeah, you get your signature.
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:49.620]   --some type.
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:50.620]   But what is the signature?
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:55.980]   It could be a lot of different things, but it seems to me that everything is going to
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:59.180]   have its own look in so far as the--
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:01.980]   Well, but if you encode a oscilloscope signature, for example--
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.660]   Well, maybe on the waveform.
[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:04.660]   Yeah, maybe the waveform is the way for it.
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:10.540]   It has to be the waveform, because if it's personally encoded, that MP3 is going to look
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.780]   different depending on who encoded it.
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:17.580]   If you've ever ripped a track on Stum Rippers, I'll even show you the waveform as it takes
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:19.940]   like a couple of seconds to rip a track.
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:22.180]   So it can quickly make a snapshot of that.
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.180]   That's probably what it is.
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:24.180]   It's always true.
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:29.540]   And there was that computerized musical ranking system where they could take a new song, put
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:34.460]   it into this program, and the program would buy the beat analysis or whatever it was.
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:40.180]   It would determine how likely it was to become a popular hit based on past popular hits and
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:41.180]   categories as well.
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:44.540]   And I was wondering maybe if it was tied into some kind of technology like that as well,
[00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:48.100]   but it might be a lot simpler just using simple waveforms as well.
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.500]   It's got you there that can make it too complicated.
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.860]   So you said they're local, are they in the Bay Area?
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.900]   I think they're over in Emeryville at the worst time.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.220]   There's some place around here somewhere.
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:59.100]   I vaguely remember where they are.
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:00.900]   I just went over there and hung out.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:01.900]   I think it's Emeryville.
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.100]   I should get a tour.
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:04.340]   I'd like to see them.
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:05.940]   Yeah, they got all kinds of cool stuff.
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:09.620]   What they have there is they've got all these players from all over the world because they
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:11.380]   have to test them.
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:15.980]   And it's actually kind of interesting just from that perspective.
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:16.980]   So I've run out of news.
[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:20.900]   Anybody else have another story they want to mention or bring up?
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:24.100]   Anything in the blog this week that you thought was funny, John?
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:31.700]   I went over to the, in Oakland they had a fire art show from the Crucible.
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.380]   I think it even runs tonight, Sunday.
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:38.380]   And it was like Burning Man in Oakland.
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:39.380]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:43.020]   And we got some videos up on the blog that show some of it.
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:45.940]   It was kind of the most interesting thing that took place all week.
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:47.740]   But it did give me an opportunity to call them.
[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:57.460]   I wrote this week, which will be NPCMag.com, is that I realized that with using these little
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:52:00.260]   pocket cameras to take videos, especially 480 possible.
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.260]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:02.260]   480.
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:04.940]   With some of them having a pretty good little microphone in them.
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:08.300]   And you could send them to YouTube and then post them like they were snap shots.
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:10.380]   It's astonishingly powerful.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:11.380]   It's perfect.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.380]   It's perfect for blogs.
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.300]   I've been doing it a lot lately.
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:18.700]   There are a number of sites besides YouTube that give you even more functionality.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.740]   I like this one called iSpot.
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.940]   We did an interview with Amber and I did an interview for Inside the Net that lets you
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:28.260]   mash them up so you can upload your videos, mash them with other videos, music, transitions.
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:33.820]   It's got little editing capabilities online, flash-based editing capabilities.
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:34.940]   iSpot.com.
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.660]   And then I like new, what is it called?
[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.460]   Videoegg.com also.
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:42.060]   They give you some capabilities like you can trim it and so forth.
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:43.060]   And they host it too.
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.060]   Yeah, they host it.
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:49.140]   It becomes a flash video that you could then post on your blog hosted from their site.
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.140]   Right.
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:51.140]   Embedded.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:52.140]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.140]   Cool.
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.140]   Yeah, I think...
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:55.140]   Yeah, no, it's fantastic.
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.140]   In a way, it's kind of a revolution.
[00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:59.260]   It makes it so easy for individuals to put video up.
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:00.260]   And you're right.
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:01.260]   I think digital still cameras.
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:08.140]   I just bought the new Fuji E900's 9 megapixel camera like 300 bucks.
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:09.980]   And it's pretty good because it's a really good still camera.
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:10.980]   But it's got great video.
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:11.980]   640x480 video.
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:15.420]   Yeah, I actually used that camera for a while.
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:16.420]   That's a nice camera.
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:17.860]   And it does take a good video.
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:24.060]   I was using a Kodak and I thought the video part was actually better than the still part.
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:25.060]   How long before we see...
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:32.180]   I mean, things like this, the exactity from Sanio and the Vario from JVC.
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:37.420]   How long before we see solid state video cameras that do a really good job, but are
[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:38.420]   there MPEG-4?
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:39.420]   You can upload them to the net.
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:40.420]   I mean, I think that that's...
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:41.420]   They could do it now.
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:42.420]   They should do it.
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.900]   I mean, they've done cheap ones like the $200 or the whole...
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:46.300]   Do some good ones.
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.300]   Yeah.
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:49.420]   Well, HD, how about that?
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:50.620]   Exactly the new exactity is HD.
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:52.780]   A pocket HD camera.
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:53.780]   That's what they've got.
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.780]   In fact, I remember JVC was showing an HD of Vario.
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:58.620]   I don't think they ever released it.
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:00.860]   But they were showing that a couple of years ago.
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:06.100]   We didn't mention Maccafee's little flaw.
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:07.100]   Poor Maccafee.
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:13.740]   They had a big bug in the software that large organizations use to protect themselves.
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:21.820]   They didn't tell anybody until Friday, business and US government.
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:27.740]   Maccafee Antivirus Corporate is really very popular in the big business environment.
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:31.980]   In fact, no lumber services use that as well.
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:36.020]   The engineers discovered the flaw, which allows attackers to seize control of computers
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:42.380]   to steal sensitive data, delete files or implant malicious programs.
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:47.060]   They updated it in February, but they described it only as new features.
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.060]   So finally...
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:49.060]   It's an overflow exploit or something.
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:50.060]   It probably is.
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.060]   It's finally Maccafee.
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:53.460]   We talked a little bit about it, I think, when that happened.
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:58.780]   But finally on Friday, I guess they acknowledged that in fact there was a problem and urged
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:04.300]   all customers to take immediate steps to protect themselves.
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:08.540]   I find the problem, I use Symantec corporate for my work notebook.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:13.460]   The only problem I run into is that the only time the script that does the updating is
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:16.740]   run is one that notebooks reboot, rebooted.
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:20.020]   It's starting to start up script for the domain login.
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:23.180]   I can't tell you how long I sometimes go between reboots.
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:24.180]   Yeah, I remember that.
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:25.180]   ZD did that too and it was.
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:26.460]   It was a pain.
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:30.340]   Unless you manually do it or unless I manually reboot the notebook, typically I just put
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:33.380]   the thing to sleep and then wake it right back up and just keep going again.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:37.660]   Why is it that the corporate versions of Maccafee and Norden are so much better than the consumer
[00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:38.660]   versions?
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:40.160]   I don't know.
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:45.260]   I did a fubar last weekend and installed two viruses in like 10 minutes trying to find
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:46.260]   a utility.
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:49.540]   If I tried to find a safe utility and it turned out the first two I downloaded work
[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:54.140]   totaled Trojan viruses that were trying to collect information off my system.
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:55.860]   Did you hear from the IT department?
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:58.260]   No, no, I was doing this at home, thank goodness.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.980]   But I tried a couple of quick online tools.
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:04.620]   One found nothing and other found them both.
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:05.620]   And I was really happy.
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.100]   It turned out it was a trend micro.com.
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:09.020]   Yeah, PC, yeah, that's house call.
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:10.020]   Yeah.
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:11.020]   Yeah.
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:12.020]   Superb.
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.020]   Superb tool that detects spyware.
[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:15.220]   We've recommended that for a long time house call about antivirus.com.
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:16.220]   It's a really good problem.
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:17.220]   Did a really good job.
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.220]   I was happy with that.
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:20.700]   Hey, there's one more thing I think we should mention.
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:21.700]   What's that?
[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:23.420]   Actually JC found this for me.
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:26.580]   It's which is it's a beta site called nine.yahoo.com.
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:28.140]   You guys seen this?
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:29.140]   No.
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.700]   Nine is the number nine.yahoo.com.
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:36.540]   And it's essentially I think Metafilter called it Metafilter with breasts.
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:41.300]   It's this girl who like comes on and she and there's a but you have a laundry list of
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:46.180]   check things you can check off on the right and she explains them to you.
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:47.900]   And they're all links to whatever.
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.700]   And anyway, it's it's you know, this is one of the.
[00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:55.260]   So this is like viral videos that she's talking about or like what people are talking
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:57.060]   about right now.
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:58.980]   She's about an eight.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:56:59.980]   Oh, she's cute.
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.900]   She's very cute and she's got a nice tan.
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:04.900]   But I think people should just check it out.
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:06.740]   She doesn't have a name apparently though.
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.340]   Fermi with Pepsi ads.
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:15.220]   It's just Maria Sanzon and the nine team scour every inch of the worldwide web and find
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:19.180]   the nine best weirdest and funniest photosite stories and videos on the you know, that's
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:23.300]   actually smart because isn't that really what you do with your friends is like, oh,
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:24.300]   did you see this video?
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:25.300]   Oh, look at this video.
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:28.940]   Yeah, that's true to a point except if you look at the top nine is everyone.
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:31.500]   The other one is something dot Yahoo dot com.
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:32.980]   Oh, yeah, that's a good point.
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:35.740]   But, you know, it's the nine best things on Yahoo.
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:40.980]   Nine best things that you know, don't usually consist of five things from Yahoo is amongst
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:41.980]   the best.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:42.980]   You know what I like?
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:45.420]   I like the interface the way you can click a number and it jumps right to that part of
[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:46.420]   the video.
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:47.420]   I think that's kind of neat.
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:48.980]   Yeah, this is worth looking at.
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:51.100]   So people out there get something from this week show.
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:56.620]   Hey, I think they got a lot including Doxy Devorak's recipe for flank steak.
[00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:57.620]   Allah, Devorak.
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:59.620]   Well, it'll be coming up.
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:00.620]   I have to post it.
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:03.380]   I will get that site posted by this time next week.
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:07.380]   I'll have a bunch of recipes online this week in cooking.
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:08.380]   Twick.
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:09.380]   I'm right.
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:10.620]   You know, there are a couple of things.
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.260]   There are a couple of new shows I would like to launch.
[00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:15.940]   John and I have talked about relaunching triangulation.
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.620]   And I think we're going to do that because it was very popular.
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:22.340]   And then I would also like to do it.
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:25.580]   We got to find a lawyer because I would really I think somebody like Larry Lessick,
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:27.180]   he's obviously too busy to do it.
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:32.700]   But don't you think there's enough kind of legal news to cover that weekly?
[00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:34.100]   This weekend law.
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:35.100]   Twill.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:36.100]   Twill.
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:37.100]   Twill.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.100]   I don't know, maybe not.
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:42.900]   But it seems like there's enough going on in the IP arena, IP law arena that.
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:44.900]   I think it's tedious.
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:45.900]   It's kind of boring.
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:48.580]   That's why you need a needs a good host and he's an any because you know, you don't want
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:49.580]   somebody pontific.
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:52.140]   I think we can, you know, once a month it would be okay.
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:54.380]   But you know, monthly is going to be done by playing.
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:56.020]   Anyway, I want to thank you all.
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:59:01.220]   I want to thank JC, our junior correspondent for showing up and turning us on.
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:06.220]   He will talk a little bit after the after the theme song about his newest game, The
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:08.060]   Ship.
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:10.180]   And we will see you all next week.
[00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:14.140]   Oh, I didn't even mention the biggest story of the week.
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:16.060]   The new Twit website is here.
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:17.060]   Did you see it?
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:18.060]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:19.060]   I like it a lot.
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:21.300]   I think it's very modern and advanced.
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:22.300]   It did.
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:23.500]   It looks like, you know, it looks like something new.
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:25.540]   It doesn't look like a retro site.
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:29.300]   It doesn't look like mine, which is like looks like something from the 90s.
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:32.780]   But I think it's hot and something I saw a couple of people complaining, but I think
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:33.940]   it's very, very.
[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:37.140]   There's always somebody, you know, we have a poll on the site.
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.140]   Do you like it?
[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:39.580]   And only 4% said bring back the old site.
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:41.580]   81% said loved it.
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:43.820]   So I think that I think it's been a hit.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:47.620]   It's you know, I'm not so much concerned about how it looks as functionality because what
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:50.700]   we really had a problem with was you'd go to the site.
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:51.700]   You wouldn't know.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:52.700]   What are the shows?
[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:53.700]   The latest version.
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:55.380]   You know, and this way it's very simple.
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:59.100]   On the front page, you can see the latest episode of each of the shows.
[00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.820]   You can quickly go to a guide for all the shows.
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.820]   Easy.
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:04.940]   And you can listen to the show right on the site, which is something we needed for a long
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:05.940]   time.
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:09.340]   So thanks to Amber MacArthur, actually, and her team at Archetype who did the design,
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:12.020]   I think her brother Jeff did the information architecture.
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.220]   And I think that's really where it excels.
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:15.220]   And then it is running on Drupal.
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:18.220]   Ted Cervinsky did a great job with that.
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:23.900]   They're off to MTV Europe where they're working on a Drupal site for them.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:27.620]   And actually they were very interested in how we survived.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:32.140]   You know, we were the number one dig story all day on Thursday when the site launched.
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:33.140]   I mean, this is crazy.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.020]   I mean, I never beta tested the site.
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:37.260]   We never had more than three people using it at the same time.
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:38.900]   We just put it live all of a sudden.
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:42.060]   And then all of a sudden it's the number one dig story.
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.740]   We handle it beautifully.
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:47.660]   If it didn't like, I think I told you before, if it didn't launch in the middle of the night
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:50.540]   because it hit the dig homepage and went all the way down as new stories came up.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:54.020]   If it hit the dig homepage or in the middle of the day, I think you would have had even
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:55.020]   more digs on that thing.
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.060]   We were the top story though.
[01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:57.580]   We had something like two or three thousand.
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:01.820]   We had a top story for the day anyway, 1500 maybe.
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:02.820]   And got a lot of traffic.
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:06.140]   I mean, our traffic was about triple what it normally is, but it scaled very nicely.
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:07.260]   So I was encouraged.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:12.300]   And so was so worthy of a lullaby guys because now they know that the MTV site will be able
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:13.300]   to handle the traffic too.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.900]   Strong Drupal is very robust.
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:19.780]   It's got a good caching mechanism, which is one of the reasons it can handle the traffic.
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:21.180]   So anyway, thanks to them.
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:24.180]   And yeah, take a look at the new Twitch site.
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.540]   No ads on it yet.
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:29.700]   Basically we're just, you know, except for ourselves, house ads.
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:30.700]   Yeah, house ads.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.860]   It's all the all the ads are house ads.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:36.460]   Yeah, I'm going to put a big the forex banner on there.
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:37.460]   What do you think?
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:39.140]   Hey, I'm all for it.
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:40.140]   The barcode.org/blog.
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.140]   Anything you want to play?
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:44.140]   That's my limit.
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:45.140]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:46.140]   You're is your limit.
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.140]   I'm hanging up on your right now.
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:52.220]   David, David, go to revision three.com and that's where you'll see system control on
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:53.860]   chicken.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:57.180]   There is a cooking podcast with Alex Albrecht and that's pretty darn good.
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.940]   They just they just shot gosh five or six new episodes.
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:01.940]   That's great.
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:02.940]   That's great.
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:03.940]   We'll look for those.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:09.500]   And of course, the screen, the closest thing the screen savers anywhere is dl.tv with Patrick
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.140]   Norton and Robert Hera.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:12.820]   I don't know where Patrick is.
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.740]   Give him our regards with you Robert when you see him next.
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:20.940]   Hey, I just did a good review of Samsung's new Blu-ray disc player.
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.140]   Oh, you like it juicy.
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:23.820]   Oh, it has a standalone player.
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:24.820]   It's awesome.
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.020]   It's a great, great piece of hardware.
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.020]   Great.
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.020]   All right.
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.020]   And I even give some insight into the formats.
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:31.980]   And if you're lucky enough to own one of those things, I put a cool Easter egg for all
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:34.100]   the new titles that are out there.
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:38.500]   I ended up looking at some test patterns and stuff to really get your TV dialed in.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.660]   They're in there as well.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:40.660]   dl.tv.
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:41.660]   Yep.
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:44.380]   And I thank you all for joining us.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:45.340]   We'll see you next week.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:46.340]   Stay cool.
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:49.100]   Another twit is in the can.
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:03:06.460]   And for my son, sir, he can do a review of the play.
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:07.460]   He's been playing.
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:08.460]   Oh, that's great.
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:09.460]   Bring him on.
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:10.460]   Apparently, he's a fun game.
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:11.460]   What's ship?
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:15.020]   It's an online hit film.
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:18.860]   It's an online deathmatch type game that we're using the Half-Life 2 engine, but it's done
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.940]   in kind of a cartoon-y, cel-shaded manner.
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:21.940]   Are you on a ship?
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:25.100]   Yeah, you're on a ship and you have to kill only one person.
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.980]   And there's another person who's trying to kill you.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:32.260]   But you have to identify who the person is and also hopefully not get killed by the person
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:34.580]   who's trying to identify you and kill you.
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:37.180]   Are there other players on the ship?
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.180]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:39.180]   They try.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.740]   They have their own missions to kill other people.
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.500]   Yeah, each person has one person to kill and one person that's going to kill them.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.500]   Is there friendly fire?
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:46.980]   Can they accidentally kill you?
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:51.940]   Yeah, they can accidentally kill an innocent person who's not-- you're not going to be killed
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:55.420]   by a or-- So you can't figure out that the guy's after you because he's shooting at you
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:57.780]   because it could just be some nitwit shooting at you.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:01.140]   Yeah, and you kill him and you get punished for it because he's not the right person.
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:04.540]   So how do you find out the guys after you?
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:09.500]   Because when people start stalking, another player is obvious because they start to mauling
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.500]   you everywhere and hopefully that's what's going on with you.
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.500]   Why?
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.500]   They can't kill you in front of other people?
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.300]   Yeah, you have to do it without anyone else watching.
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:18.300]   Oh.
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:23.180]   Makes it kind of play out like guests or flu but with a cartoony vibe.
[01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:24.900]   It sounds like fun.
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:29.100]   And so how do you lure somebody into a private space?
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:32.140]   You have to watch them, all of them.
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:35.500]   But also there's a really interesting system that keeps people from staying still.
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:38.220]   Well, I was going to say because otherwise you just hang out with some other people and
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.220]   you'd be sick.
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:41.700]   Of course you could never win but you'd never lose.
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:44.180]   It has a kind of the Sims needs system.
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:46.780]   So every so often you get-- Are you going to pee?
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:48.340]   Or drink or-- Yeah, it's a drink.
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:49.340]   You're going to pee.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:50.340]   I got to pee!
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:51.340]   But stressful.
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.860]   You can't pee in front of other people so there you go.
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:55.340]   You're vulnerable right there.
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:59.820]   Yeah, because all the stalls are playing.
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:00.820]   So that would be a good place to get.
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.500]   You probably people get murdered there a lot.
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:06.500]   Not as much as when they have to go to sleep which is the most stressful part of the game.
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:07.500]   Oh, you have to sleep?
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.500]   Eventually to sleep.
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.260]   It takes 30 seconds and your screen's black.
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:12.180]   Dad, you can't do anything for 30 seconds.
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:14.020]   You're vulnerable for 30 seconds.
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:17.260]   Yeah, and it's just enough to make anybody go nuts there.
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:17.780]   So--
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:18.780]   Crap, somebody's going to kill me.
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.620]   So if you really want to win you just follow somebody that they have to go to sleep.
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.220]   I hope you don't have to sleep first.
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:26.460]   Yeah, I hope they don't realize that you're following them and then they turn around and
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:27.460]   kill you.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:31.620]   Because they can't do so, they can kill in self-defense but they can't kill ones that
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.620]   are just rentable.
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:34.620]   This is excellent.
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.100]   I want to play this ship, huh?
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.860]   The website is at thisshiponline.com.
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:43.500]   Uh, and you have to buy it, right?
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.220]   Yeah, it's on Steam.
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.220]   Oh, it's Steam, okay.
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:47.860]   Yeah, because it's Half-Life, right?
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:49.860]   Oh, it just launched.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:50.860]   It's a week old.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:52.460]   You are so-- it's four days old.
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:53.860]   You are so with it, JC.
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:56.460]   Well, I've been only playing it for four days.
[01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:58.100]   Yeah, because that's how long you could.
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.700]   So let me ask you this.
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:05.380]   Do you want a career like your dad in journalism or what do you want to do when you head out
[01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.380]   to the world?
[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:07.380]   Well, it's game design, actually.
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.380]   Well, it's you.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.380]   You're well prepared for that.
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:13.380]   Yeah, I imagine you.
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:15.380]   Oh, man.
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:16.380]   Just like his dad.
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:18.620]   Oh, that sounds like a fun, established game.
[01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:20.580]   Shot with a jute to kill you or be killed.
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:26.060]   Finally, they're doing some innovative stuff.
[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:27.060]   Although--
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:31.820]   Because the amateur game developers that are more not these weird ones, this is a company
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:33.620]   that is garage--
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:34.620]   That's excellent.
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.620]   That's excellent.
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:36.620]   It's a valve.
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:38.580]   It's just somebody using this engine.
[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:39.580]   Ah.
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.820]   Can you buy the game online?
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:42.820]   Yeah, you can.
[01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:43.820]   It's not--
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:45.820]   I don't even know if it's on-- I don't know if it's in--
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.380]   It probably isn't, right.
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.380]   1995, it's cheap.
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:52.820]   All right, everybody, we're going to play the ship.
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:53.820]   We're--
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:55.460]   It's a local server.
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.180]   The closest one's in Dallas.
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.180]   I will.
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:01.020]   That's a great idea.
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.020]   The Twitch.
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.860]   The Twitch ship.
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:07.860]   I will-- you know, I'm going to Boston, but before I leave, I will leave the computer
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:11.740]   on running the ship.
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:12.900]   And we'll call it-- what do we call it?
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:14.700]   We'll call it Twitch ship.
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:15.700]   TWITSHIP.
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:16.700]   TWITSHIP.
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.700]   Is that a good name?
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:19.700]   Twitch.
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:20.700]   Twitch ship.
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.500]   I think I have enough bandwidth to make that worthwhile.
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.500]   I'll leave it on.
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:24.500]   We'll see what happens.
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:27.100]   Can people hack me if I do that?
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:28.580]   Nah, no way.
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:34.980]   If you get a flicker and you type in Kevin Rose as his normal search tag, I think that
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:39.340]   one of the top three most popular photos is him like signing some girl's chest.
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:40.340]   Oh, I got a funny guy.
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:44.740]   And the first comment is like, since when did podcasters become rockstars and it's kind
[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:45.740]   of true?
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.540]   Oh, he is a rockstar, absolutely.
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:48.540]   So, yeah.
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:52.740]   Aw, I saw the hottest chick the other day wearing a I love Geeks T-shirt.
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:54.260]   Now, it's just like, that's awesome.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:55.260]   I am one.
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:56.260]   I'm a geek.
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.260]   I am one.
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:58.260]   Over here.
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:07:59.260]   I never left the door.
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:01.460]   She said she loves Geeks.
[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:02.460]   Trust me.
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:05.580]   You go up to her with the broken glasses and say, "Hi!"
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:06.580]   Dad.
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:07.580]   I'm a geek.
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:10.300]   She's going to go, "How come the mind is over you jerk?"
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.660]   It's a fool's paradise.
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:14.620]   This is amazing.
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:17.620]   This is amazing.
[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:24.620]   I'm a geek.
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:28.620]   I'm a geek.
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:32.620]   I'm a geek.
[01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:35.620]   I'm a geek.
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:38.620]   I'm a geek.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:41.620]   I'm a geek.
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:44.620]   I'm a geek.
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.620]   I'm a geek.
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:48.620]   I'm a geek.
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:50.620]   I'm a geek.
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:53.620]   I'm a geek.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:56.620]   I'm a geek.
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:59.620]   I'm a geek.
