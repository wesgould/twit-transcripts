[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.080]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech, the show where we cover the latest Tech News with
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.640]   a panel of inspiring, brilliant tech journalists.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.840]   Starting to my left with a tan Patterson.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.560]   What is the last time you've been in studio?
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.200]   I've never been in studio but been on the show since '08 or '09.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.040]   You never bothered to come to visit us?
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.400]   It's heartbreaking when I come back to Sonoma County because I just want to save here.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.400]   You're from here.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.960]   My heart and soul is in Sonoma County.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.840]   We first started talking to you when you were at CBS Radio.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.840]   We're doing ABC.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.840]   ABC.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.840]   ABC.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.840]   So very good.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.840]   ABC.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.840]   You were doing some great reporting.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.960]   At one point you covered, I thought it was very interesting, you storeified a cover
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.160]   occupy Wall Street.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.160]   It did.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.800]   You've covered the presidential campaign.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   Three of them?
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.800]   Three of them.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.760]   There have been that many?
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.400]   Feels like I'll remember one now.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   They're all fake though.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   All of these campaigns.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   It's all fake campaigns.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.120]   I'm starting to wonder.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   He's currently a senior writer at Tech Republic.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.240]   Our friend Jason Heiners is a place a part of the CBS.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.160]   Is he your boss?
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.160]   Jason's my boss.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.160]   He's a great boss.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.160]   It's got to be a great boss.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.560]   It's a sweetheart.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.280]   If you think of drama, we are the anti-drama.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.040]   The Tech Republic is just good people doing good work.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.040]   I really like that.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.040]   And CNET.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040]   And CNET.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.040]   A friend.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.040]   Got a tip of the hat to CNET.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.840]   That's where our good friend Tim Stevens hangs his hat with Roadshow, theroadshow.com, where
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.200]   I think he says some of the best automotive journalism out there.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   He's also a racer.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.200]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   He races his...
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   An ice.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.000]   He's an ice racer.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Really?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   You've heard of ice road truckers?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Of course.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   He's an ice road racer.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.440]   Tim, I learned things about you all the time.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.440]   Oh, there's so much more to learn too, man.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.440]   We should just keep one of these lines.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.440]   Yes, yeah.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.560]   But not recently so much this time of year, but on the asphalt more now, the ice has gone
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.000]   sadly for now.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.600]   And we waited until the Indy 500 was over before we made you show up here.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   I appreciate that.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   Time that very carefully.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.360]   Also, your good friend, haven't seen you in a while.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.720]   Clayton Morris from Fox & Friends and his company, MorrisInvest.com.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.720]   Hi, Clayton.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.720]   Hey, guys.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.720]   Great to see you.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.720]   Thanks for having me back.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.720]   Thank you.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.600]   My little friend of Donald J. Trump.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   No.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   No.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.680]   The opposite would probably be true.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.400]   You would do me a favor the next time he's on.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.200]   Will you wear the Wookiee mask?
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.680]   Just go, "Oh!"
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.680]   Raw.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.840]   I think it'd be interesting to see what the reaction would be.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.080]   I don't think he likes me much.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.640]   I mean, I do...
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.880]   Has he ever tweeted you about you?
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.880]   No, no.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.080]   But I do ask, you know, I always ask tough questions of the people from his staff that
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.200]   are on our show, and I'm not afraid to ask those questions.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.840]   But I don't think he's...
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.600]   When other people are fawning over him, I'm not.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.640]   I'm not, and I'm just asked a straight question.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.600]   He does live tweet Fox & Friends.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.240]   Has he ever live tweeted you?
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.200]   Oh, he's definitely live tweeted things that literally we've just said or commented on
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.360]   stories that clearly no one else was covering and he was watching.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.360]   He's watching.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.760]   That must be a little intimidating to know that the president is in there and the residents
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.760]   watching you.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.760]   Well, it's true.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.440]   And, you know, this morning we had on a group of veterans who were riding to DC for the,
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.760]   I think the Thunder...
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.240]   Forgive me for butchering.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.800]   I know what you're talking about.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.360]   All the motorcyclists, maybe Tim, you might even know, there's like 96,000 of them come
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.120]   to descend on a rolling thunder.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.120]   Some come from Australia.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.120]   I was going to say Thunderdome actually.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.120]   It's just like that's where we're going lately.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.120]   The rolling thunder run.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.880]   It's like the sturge is run, but it's...
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.880]   Yeah, but it's to DC.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.880]   Honor those forgotten POWs.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.080]   I mean, there's tens of thousands that have gone missing, that are forgotten.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.800]   And anyway, we had the founder of it on this morning and we knew, I knew that the president
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.160]   was watching after his nine day trip to the Middle East.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.200]   And, you know, they're frustrated with the government spending thousands on the defense
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.400]   budget but not spending any money to find these soldiers and really trying to find and
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.600]   do as much as they can to get these folks back from these foreign wars or identify grave
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.160]   sites, et cetera.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.480]   And I said, if you had a message to the president, we know the president's probably watching
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.480]   right now.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.480]   Do you have anything to say?
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.480]   Wow.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.720]   He says, "President Trump, we'd like to meet with you.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.720]   We want to take..."
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.200]   So that's a powerful mechanism.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.200]   He was frustrated.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.200]   He's frustrated with this administration.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.040]   He was frustrated with the last administration.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.640]   Talk about a bully pulpit.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.280]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.280]   It's a crazy time.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.280]   I mean, it's okay.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.280]   Your schedule has changed a little bit.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.800]   What do you want Fox and Friends now?
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.360]   So I do the weekend show.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.840]   So Saturday and Sunday, I'll be on tomorrow morning, Memorial Day, 6 to 9 a.m. and I'm
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.840]   on Wednesday.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.080]   So I fill in during the weekday but Saturday, Sunday is the weekend anchor of Fox and Friends.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.080]   So the number one show in the world.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   What?
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.280]   The number one show in all of cable news and morning show in all of cable news.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.280]   Like even better than the...
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.960]   It's a time slot or you mean in general?
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.960]   In our...
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.960]   Well, cable news.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.960]   Yeah, in our time slot.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.960]   We'll...
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.960]   We'll...
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.960]   Nice.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.960]   Let's go say if you're number one in general, that's...
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.960]   Wow.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.960]   No, sometimes we beat...
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.440]   You know, we go up against the Today Show because they're broadcast.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440]   Right.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.440]   So but we neck and neck with those.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.440]   Some of those guys.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.440]   That's really a big deal.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.600]   It's crazy.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.280]   So here's a top story.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.280]   Just come in.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.680]   The Steve Jobs hype is over.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.680]   According to ZD...
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.120]   Sorry, ZDnet.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.360]   They auctioned off yet another rare Apple one.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.040]   I don't know if this was Mitch Waits.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.360]   We had Mitch Waite on the show.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.040]   He had an Apple one look just like this.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.760]   Was the auction in Cologne.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.760]   And it all...
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.960]   There are only eight working model ones.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.960]   Apple one's out there.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.840]   The guy who bought it.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.200]   130,000 dollars.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.880]   That's all.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.040]   That's all.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:08.920]   He sold for member for $666 back in 1976 or '77.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.480]   But the reason the guy was disappointed, this seller was disappointed.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.960]   One had sold for $905,000.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.520]   Another one sold last year for $815,000.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.560]   I think it's a little much to say that the Steve Jobs hype is over however.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.560]   That's a great headline.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.560]   Yeah, that's a great headline.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.560]   Got me to click.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.560]   Got me to click.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.560]   Right.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.080]   A German engineer bought it.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.200]   130,000 dollars.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.760]   But it did include the cassette player.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.480]   How many are there?
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.760]   Eight working.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.720]   There are many more not working.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.400]   So Mitch Waite, who was...
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.040]   Some of you members from the Waite group, publisher, he's now famous because he's done
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.800]   some really nice, believe it or not, bird watching apps for iOS.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.920]   But he has an Apple one that he got ages ago and he got a friend and they worked on
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.920]   it and they got it working.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   We did a triangulation.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.400]   You can go back and watch.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:06.480]   It was a working Apple one, but it was non-trivial to get it working again because these things
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.760]   really kind of have corroded over the years.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.880]   But I think Mitch will be disappointed because I'm sure he thought he was going to make
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.120]   a pretty penny off of that.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.000]   I love the idea that Jobs hype is over though.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.480]   I mean, that's really...
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.120]   Is it over?
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.120]   Is it really over?
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:27.120]   In fact, Steve's greatest accomplishments opening now, Apple Park, the brand new campus,
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.920]   that was his last...
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.160]   It's actually very sad when you look at the video of Steve presenting Apple Park at the
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:39.600]   Cupertino City Council because he was really on death store.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.880]   It's almost open now.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.520]   In fact, let me show you...
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.080]   Remember all those drone videos?
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.160]   Matthew Roberts, one of the drone videos, has made a time lapse of the construction of
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.760]   Apple Park which took several years.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.240]   He's got it down into a minute and five seconds.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.920]   The Spaceship Campus started in March 2016.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.120]   Why do they always have this music on these?
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.160]   Didn't they have some trouble with the glass?
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.640]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.120]   Maybe you heard me talk about that because I thought I had a scoop.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.000]   I probably should have written it up for some important journal like Tech Republic.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.240]   But we had an engineer in...
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.840]   He said, "You know, I'm working on the Apple Campus."
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.840]   I said, "Oh, really?"
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.840]   He said, "Yeah."
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.080]   And I said, "Oh, how's it going?"
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.440]   He said, "Well, it's settling."
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.440]   I said, "What?"
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.440]   He said, "It's settling."
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.760]   I said, "Anytime you build a building, it settles."
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:36.880]   The problem is these panes of glass are massive and they were breaking.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.520]   He said, "You know, the real problem is they're expensive.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.200]   They're like $100,000 each and you can't just make one.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.160]   You have to make them in big batches."
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.520]   They make a million dollars of these at a time.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:54.840]   If one breaks, you got to make a million dollars worth of glass windows.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.040]   I guess it stopped settling though.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.040]   It's done.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.040]   It's done.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.040]   Because they're moving in.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.760]   In fact, I talked to an Apple employee who was in the studio visiting us Saturday and
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.160]   I said, "You get to be in Apple Park?"
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.160]   He said, "Yep."
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.640]   I said, "When you're moving in," he said later this year.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.800]   They're doing that batches, right?
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.400]   Like 500 at a time, 300 at a time.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.520]   First people gone in are the ones who were setting it up.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.920]   Yeah, the important ones.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.960]   He's the guy who works on the human interface devices on the iPhone.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.960]   He gets to be in there.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:27.160]   And you guys don't have like any earthquakes in California, which is pretty good.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   Right.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.160]   Never really ever.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.160]   That's a relief.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.560]   No tornadoes, no earthquakes, no acts of God of any kind.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.560]   But it is.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.720]   Isn't that like four foot springs or some insane?
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   Oh yeah.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.560]   It's an earthquake proof building.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.000]   Nowadays when they build buildings, there's one building in San Francisco that's actually
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.360]   falling over.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.280]   Normally when they build them, they build them on big rollers.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.360]   So the building can move.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.200]   And I'm sure that they've done that with the spaceship campus.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.400]   I mean, joking aside, Apple Park is...
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.840]   I do hope that this is the last kind of job-zian effort that we see this little push up the
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.840]   hill.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:11.920]   And I hope this allows Apple to kind of move into an era that is defined by their successes
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.840]   and failures as well.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.800]   I kind of just wish they'd spend a little less time on that and more time on the laptops.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.800]   That's just my thing.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   Yeah, right.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.800]   That's precisely what I mean.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.160]   I would like to enter into an era with Apple where we can say, oops, we kind of messed
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.160]   this one up.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.160]   Well, they did.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.160]   They said that.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.160]   The macro.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.080]   After a couple of months of people matching about it.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.240]   A couple of months.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.960]   I bought it three years ago and they never updated it.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.800]   I actually had it as it was a doorstop for a while.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.800]   Literally.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.520]   I think you are seeing quite a shift though.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.440]   I mean, wouldn't you guys agree more to a more open at least?
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.440]   That's true.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.440]   You know, more open Apple.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.320]   You're hearing from executives doing, you know, Phil Schiller just did an interview the
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.320]   other day.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.040]   Jimmy Iovine in that music publication just did an interview.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.040]   But you're right.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.880]   They still have a long way to go if they're going to move completely in that direction.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.120]   I also think it's not a tear.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.520]   You know, they're also, I think, drilling down or doubling down on secrecy.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.960]   So we don't know a lot of what to expect at WWDC.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.960]   Remember past keynotes?
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.960]   Yeah, they did.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.440]   Everything was detailed.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.440]   I mean, we knew everything and it kind of took the shine off of, we don't know much
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.080]   about anything I think for WWDC.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.640]   That's a good point.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.680]   I don't really thought about that.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:31.440]   Mark Gurman of Bloomberg did say that WWDC, they will announce new laptops and upgrades
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.080]   for their, you know what?
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.800]   I don't mean new in the sense that the design will change in the least, but they will have
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.800]   KBL laptops.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.920]   But I think this was an intentional leak to kind of stop those drip, drip, drip of negative
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.600]   press about how bad this current crop of laptops is.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:51.000]   I almost feel like now when you see Tim Cook and Phil Schiller giving interviews, when
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.560]   you see leaks like this, that it's all part of an Apple campaign.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.560]   Yes.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.760]   To dampen expectations, to set an agenda.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.360]   Tim Cook has now several times said we're doing augmented reality.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.960]   You would never have heard Steve Jobs say.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.040]   That's right.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.640]   But what does that mean?
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.980]   I mean, you've got people like Robert Skoll, he's been on this show saying, "Oh, it is a negative
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.980]   day."
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:11.980]   You end of the year.
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.560]   You're going to be amazed and I'm thinking, "No, I'm not."
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.560]   Yes, but that's Robert.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.160]   To know I'm not.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.400]   No, I'm not.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.400]   I'm not going to be amazed.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.160]   It takes showers with Google Glass and so.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.720]   I love Robert, but you know.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   Oh, no, but right.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.720]   Right.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.720]   Right.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   Right.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.720]   Right.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.720]   Right, of course.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.720]   Look, you can't knock him because he's an enthusiast and I love Robert too as an old friend.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   Yes.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.720]   And I'm not knocking him, but I don't complete, we have a bet.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.760]   He says, "The next iPhone," I swear to God, he said, "The next iPhone will be clear."
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.760]   Right.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.120]   You said, "What, the one in the fall will be clear?"
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.640]   He said, "Yes, I said, "If it's clear, I'm taking dinner at your favorite restaurant."
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.640]   He says, "It's in Paris."
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.640]   I said, "Fine."
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.320]   So, I hope it's not clear.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.600]   Does he just mean no bezel?
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.440]   I mean, because I think we know that's...
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.440]   That's not clear.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.440]   We know it won't.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.280]   We'll be, you know, an OLED screen probably.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.400]   It'll probably be like the S8 and the LG G6.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.080]   It won't have much of a frame, no bezel.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.080]   But that's going to be the standard.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.080]   I think it's smartphones.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.080]   Or long term.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.080]   And for Apple as well, I think like the era of the next big thing, like the surprise
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.280]   Apple is long gone.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:14.000]   I think they want to try to delight users in their language.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.760]   But I really think that we will see predictable incremental upgrades from Apple for a very
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.760]   long time.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.440]   How much of that is Apple?
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.800]   And how much of that is the industry?
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.800]   It's the industry.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.800]   And the saturation is the smartphone.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.800]   We're really there.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.800]   We're in peak smartphone.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.800]   Right.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.560]   And it's not like, I mean, IoT is coming, but it's way more of a business thing.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.800]   It's not like consumers are going to get hyped up about their next wearable thing.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.640]   There's another thing Tim Cook's been hyping, I think.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:45.320]   He mentioned it at a in Scotland or Glasgow at a university talk.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.360]   He said, yeah, I've been wearing.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.760]   I just took it off.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:53.520]   A Apple watch that tells me my bludge, particularly, who's monitored my blood sugar.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.520]   He mentioned it again.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:02.760]   But if you read Rachel Becker's article in The Verge, no one has ever done a needless
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.880]   blood sugar monitor, at least none that's still on the market.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.520]   It's a very difficult thing to do.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.520]   Sure, it's a big market.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:14.200]   30 million Americans have diabetes and would want this because right now those I have type
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.480]   two diabetes, we have to prick our fingers several times a day, drop blood.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.160]   It's painful and it's annoying.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.320]   If Apple, it may not be Apple.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.400]   Tim didn't say we're doing it, he just said it's on my watch, probably be in the band.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:32.440]   If they have a non-intrusive blood glucose monitor, that would be huge.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.640]   It could be really huge.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.880]   There's plenty of others who've tried though and nobody else has been able to do this.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.160]   In fact, it's almost like a professional motion machine that a lot of companies have said
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.880]   they can do it, but none have actually managed to do this in a reliable, repeatable way.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.760]   It's the cold fusion of public health.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:56.600]   Having the idea of being able to take off different bands and be able to put them on
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:02.120]   the watch that interact with the watch, isn't there the lightning connector inside on the
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.520]   backside of the watch as well, which kind of hidden down in there?
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.720]   It's a hidden one.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.040]   Nobody's ever developed anything to do it with it.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.880]   It's just Apple uses it as a diagnostic.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.880]   Apple uses it for diagnostics and other things, but to be able to use the bands that are specific
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:22.040]   instead of just having a Nike sport style, there might be a special glucose monitor that you could
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.040]   be able to do it.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.040]   It would be amazing.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.200]   I think every diabetic would buy it.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:33.080]   Google remember it was working on a glucose monitoring contact lens, but according to
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:38.760]   Rachel's article, by the way, no one has said anything on this in the past couple of years,
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.320]   according to Rachel's article, it's really hard to do.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.520]   I did not realize this, but there's only about a sugar pack.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.240]   It's worth a glucose in your blood at any given time.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.240]   She quotes Mark Rice, who's a diabetes expert at Vanderbilt.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.560]   It's an incredibly difficult problem.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.960]   Everyone thinks they have a way to do it and everybody so far has failed.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.360]   Well, and then the other side of it is, of course, getting the regulatory approval.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:08.160]   I had a chance to moderate a panel on this exact topic a few years ago at CES and you
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:15.440]   had consumer medical device companies as well as ones in the industry that had to be regulated.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.120]   The problem, of course, is the lead time, two years.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:24.640]   Can you build something for an Apple watch that's going to be relevant and have the same
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.200]   size and shape?
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.800]   How Apple likes to change connectors and sizes and cases.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:35.520]   By the time you get approval, have they wanted to move on from that same technology, that
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.040]   same style, that same shape?
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:44.440]   I interviewed a company that was doing with heart rate measuring and be able to do on
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:49.520]   the back of the iPhone case for an EKG monitor so that it would snap on.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.520]   I have that.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.520]   The cardia.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.400]   It took, I think, two years for regulatory, but by the time then the iPhone is a totally
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.840]   different shape and it won't snap on anymore.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.680]   But this thing is cool and it works with Android as well as iOS and it's really small.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.880]   You don't have to snap it on.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.320]   They now come with a new clue.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.480]   The cardia, it's Vic Condrotra, the guy who was a big at Google, Google+, left to go to
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.400]   a live core.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.160]   But they did get FDA approval.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.400]   It is available.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.440]   It's 80 bucks.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:24.040]   And I have to say, if you have AFib, if you have a heart issue, Jeff Jarvis, one of our
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:30.400]   contributors on this week in Google, has been hospitalized for AFib several times.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.400]   He has this.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:36.480]   If he feels weird, he sends an EKG to his doctor and the doctor can say, within minutes, get
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.920]   to the hospital or it's okay.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.680]   That's huge.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.280]   But what I'm wondering, so now we know it's very difficult to do the glucose monitoring.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:51.120]   B, it's years away no matter what because they got to get FDA approval.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.360]   Why does Tim Cook keep bringing this up?
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.800]   Well, I think Apple really does care about health.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.400]   I think we saw that in the last...
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.400]   I think he's on the cynic.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.040]   I think it's like all a game.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.000]   No, no, no, think about this.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.400]   Think about, I don't.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:13.000]   I mean, marshaling the forces to when you realize that, hey, people, not everyone can
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   stand.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.840]   Well, let's literally devote an entire team to work with people who are wheelchair bound
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:27.320]   and have to monitor their activity, work with folks who are in wheelchairs and have to
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:32.600]   really study how they move, what types of exercises and really drill down on that.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:41.280]   Swimming, a whole range of different activities to get people moving and a better life.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.720]   So I'm not terribly cynical about this.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.720]   Also think about...
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.400]   You wear an Apple watch, don't you?
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.400]   I do.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.760]   And it certainly has made me healthier to hit certain steps every day and monitoring, breathing,
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.760]   chin and stuff.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.760]   I do agree with you.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.760]   And number one niche and it's the reason...
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.200]   But you're not wearing one.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.200]   It's fun.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.200]   You are wearing one.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.200]   And it's fine.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.400]   I think trust is at the center of this.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.520]   And I don't think the market...
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:12.120]   I think the market is emerging, but we're not talking about humans now.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.040]   We're talking about the market that will emerge.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.080]   And I don't think Apple is...
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.800]   I think they're looking five and ten years down the line.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.680]   And I think that you really have to bake in.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.960]   You have to start planting this top of mind awareness with consumers.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.960]   Really?
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.960]   Very early.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.960]   I think so.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.200]   Well, this really is a change then.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.200]   You're really...
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.320]   Well, I mean, I'm cynical, Leah.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:35.960]   I'm a journalist and it's my job to disbelieve all the things, especially when Flax e-mail
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.800]   me, I disbelieve all the things.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.520]   But I think that Apple sees...
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.800]   Maybe Tim Cook buys into this, maybe he doesn't, but what I think they see is an emerging market
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.600]   and they see an emerging market that may take a long time for Apple to earn consumer
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.600]   trust.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.600]   And go ahead.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.600]   Go ahead, Tim.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.600]   I'll talk to you about that Tim will speak.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.600]   Sorry.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.600]   Whoever wants to talk...
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.600]   You Clayton, go ahead.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.720]   Well, no, I was going to say I think that there is...
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.840]   There's a lot to unpack with this because Apple could also...
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.880]   If it's approved in the right way, this could be subsidized by your insurance.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.760]   So imagine an industry where these watches are subsidized by insurance.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.280]   Any of the...
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.840]   You know, drops the price.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:16.840]   There's no...
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.120]   Look, Apple is so big that probably they don't consider anything that's not a multi-billion-dollar
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.120]   business worth their energy.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.120]   This is a big business.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.480]   And if it were any other company, it would be an oversized company.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.040]   I mean, this is huge if they can make it.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.040]   I don't deny that at all.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.040]   I'm starting...
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:40.320]   There's a sniff test, that is what I'm saying, where I'm starting to sniff a number of leaks,
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.600]   quotes from Apple that feel to me like they're desperately trying to look like they are
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:50.440]   relevant and cutting edge when if you didn't look at any of that, but merely looked at the
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.480]   products they're putting out, it would be quite the opposite.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.760]   I mean, when you say the AirPods are the coolest thing Apple's released in three years...
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.760]   You said that?
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.760]   I say it.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.760]   Right?
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.760]   I think they are.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.760]   I think you're right about that.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.760]   Yeah, I know.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.400]   I would just say that when you say that's the coolest thing, a pair of Bluetooth earbuds,
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.280]   this is a company that isn't cutting edge.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.800]   And I think that they're really...
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.800]   Look at this.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   Another leak to Mark Gurman at Bloomberg a couple of days ago.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:21.840]   Apple is working on a dedicated chip to power AI on devices.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:27.600]   That's clearly an Apple house leak to say, "No, no, no, because Google said the same
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.320]   thing at Google I know."
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.320]   And no, we're doing that too.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:38.880]   I mean, I feel like this is Apple almost desperate, but do we have expectations that
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.880]   these...
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.800]   I mean, this is the way the industry works and the way it's worked for a long time.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.520]   And it's particularly the way Apple has worked for a long time.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.360]   I think that these leaks are...
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.360]   You say relevant.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:57.720]   I say top of mind awareness, but I don't know that cutting edge really is in the cards
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.720]   for consumers.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:04.800]   It reminds me when Microsoft, when Apple and SDI pad said, "Oh, we got a big-ass table.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.080]   Oh, we've been doing that for a long time.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.960]   The surface."
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:14.520]   And somebody in the chatroom said, "And I think I couldn't agree with them more."
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.040]   Apple's sliding into Balmerland.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.280]   The difference between...
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.280]   This is RF 2020.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.680]   The difference between public relations, propaganda, vaporware, and authentic marketing is difference
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.160]   between Steve Balmer and Elon Musk.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.880]   Apple is moving into Balmerland.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.600]   You know, I think we're going to see a lot of WWDC.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.600]   I'm fascinated to see what they do.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.840]   This is why I bring this up.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.840]   What happens Monday?
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.560]   Well, I mean, that's the curious thing.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:41.720]   I mean, I'm most interested, I run my entire company off of an iPad Pro.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.000]   There's huge areas that they can improve.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.160]   I mean, I use my Mac, obviously, for...
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.160]   What are you?
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.160]   The masochist?
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.160]   I love it.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.160]   I love the elegance of it.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.160]   You got to tell it again.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.400]   I grant you, but don't you wish you had a keyboard?
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.400]   I do.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.400]   I use the software keyboard.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   I love it.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.480]   I like the simplicity of it.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.120]   I really appreciate just having a split view.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.000]   I like being able to sit and just focus on what I'm...
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.520]   You know, one task at a time have split view open.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.960]   So you don't feel like it's a compromise for you?
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.040]   No, I really enjoy...
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.960]   And I like being able to snap it off and just hold it in my hand.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.480]   And the true tone display is gorgeous.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.600]   I mean, I wish all Apple products had true tone display on it.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.200]   And once you see it, like Phil Schiller said last year, you'll...
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.440]   You're never going to go back, by the way, and you're going to wish every device had that,
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.720]   which is odd that the iPhone still doesn't have it.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:36.360]   So I think with new iPad hardware, we'll probably see true tone display on everything.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.560]   But I think there's huge strides they can make with iOS for the iPad.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.680]   And I would love to see some really step up moves on the Pro side on the iPad.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.040]   Well, that's an interesting question right there.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.280]   What's happening with the iPad?
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.280]   They haven't really...
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.880]   The only iPad they announced, but they made was a cheap one.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.120]   They haven't announced anything new in the iPad in a while.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.120]   Right.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.120]   And that iPad was really a step back, if anything.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.880]   There has been expectations of a new iPad Pro and a new form factor, but ultimately,
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.480]   that was pushed back, presumably due to some sort of internal production or design issues.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.760]   More with the book, over.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:10.240]   The last MacBooks were delayed effectively because of some issues internally as well.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.560]   And that's why we wound up with new MacBooks with Touch bars, because ultimately, they
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.080]   didn't know what else to give us more or less.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:19.120]   So there were definitely internal issues with Apple as well, not only in terms of being
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:24.600]   creative and coming up with mind-blowing products, but actually getting these regular updates
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.600]   to market even.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:30.000]   And so I think I have a doubt even whether they can maintain a regular cadence of these
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.400]   new products, even if they are pretty predictable updates.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.600]   Do you think that Apple will announce new iPads on Monday?
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.880]   I mean, a week from Monday, Jan, June 5th.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.320]   I wouldn't doubt it either.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.320]   I mean, that's what they need to.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.480]   I think they're way overdue at this point.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:50.680]   But there's been suggestions that maybe there's a new form factor that's going to be shared
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.360]   between iPad and iPhone.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.400]   And so for that reason, we may not see the new iPad until the end of the year.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.680]   But I think it's time, even if it is just a predictable spec update for the iPad Pro
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.120]   and for the other iPads, I think we're overdue for that kind of thing.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:08.040]   And so unless they want to try to do everything in September, it would make sense for them
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.960]   to try to do that now, especially if we're talking about more productivity-focused updates
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.960]   for the iPad Pro.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.680]   And by the way, I actually use my iPad a lot for productivity now too, just like Clayton.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.920]   I really, actually, I've come to appreciate the fact that I can focus on a given document
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.360]   and write something without having notifications pop up all the time.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:29.720]   But I tried to do photo editing on my iPad at an event a couple months back and absolutely
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.440]   just wanted to throw that anything out the window.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.720]   So there are certain ways times when I certainly want to do that.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.360]   I think Lightroom on the iPad.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:40.760]   Actually Lightroom's a very interesting product for the iPad because it ties to your desktop.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.880]   But you can do some simple editing on the iPad or at least triage.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.880]   Right.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.760]   But the act of importing, editing, and exporting and uploading was, it took me hours and hours
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.840]   which would have taken me 20 minutes on my MacBooks.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.760]   In fact, I don't think situations without bad is in there yet.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.200]   Tim and Clayton, I'd actually be very curious about your process.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.200]   I have to produce copy but also video content.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:10.560]   And as a productivity device, that opportunity cost of time is, it feels insulting when I
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.800]   go, "Damn it, all I got to do is move this graph from here to here and this took seven
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.800]   minutes."
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   That's what I mean.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.800]   Well, that's an illustration.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:24.600]   I feel like my biggest, there are some areas where I do a lot in Dropbox on my iPad.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.480]   So if I'm sending something to a client and I want to have multiples of something that
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.280]   I need to send them, "Okay, 3 PDFs, not just one that's stored in Dropbox."
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.480]   And I have to go back and open Dropbox.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.200]   Again, go through that subfolder, go all the way down.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.000]   Why can't I select three when I'm in there?
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.120]   Nope, I can only grab one.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.320]   I mean, those are severe areas of restriction.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.560]   And I think hardware is clear.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.000]   I mean, we haven't seen an update to the larger iPad Pro, the 12-inch one since 2015.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.440]   I mean, that was the first one.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.160]   So it's been like a year and a half.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.040]   That's definitely long in the tooth.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.440]   But I want to see what they really do on iOS because, I mean, the hardware is fantastic.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.560]   I mean, the iPad Pro is pretty darn good.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.160]   The camera is pretty darn good.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.160]   It's pretty darn fast.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.160]   Obviously, you'll see me.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.040]   Clayton, you're not taking pictures of your iPad, are you?
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.120]   I have.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.800]   If it's near me, I'll grab it and we've got an eight-month-old.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.160]   In fact, no joke.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.920]   I didn't have my iPhone with me because it was in the house.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:25.080]   And the baby started crawling for the first time.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.280]   And my iPad owns there.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.000]   And I grabbed it and grabbed and shot video of her crawling for the first time on the
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   iPad Pro.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   So she's like, "Daddy, pick up your phone and put down my tablet."
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   She's like, "Daddy, where do you think it's going?"
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   There's a giant--
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   There's a giant, a tray.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   You're carrying--
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.520]   So I have to say, I have become a post-state.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.240]   I am going rogue.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:51.080]   I'm sitting in front of a giant Windows machine, the Surface Studio, which I happen to really
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.080]   like.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.000]   I really wanted to like the new MacBooks.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.360]   I bought the new MacBook Pro.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.760]   The Touch Bar is so problematic for me.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.280]   I traded down to the Touch Barless version.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.840]   And then I said, "But now I only have two Type C ports."
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:16.400]   So I ended up getting a Windows laptop with USB and HDMI and ethernet and two Type Cs.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.760]   I feel like I'm--
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.840]   And this is what I'm going to be doing in my Lightroom on.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.960]   A ThinkPad, not a Mac.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:29.080]   And believe me, I was an avid Mac guy for a long, long time.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.560]   I just feel like Apple's maybe lost its way a little.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:38.680]   But here's the leak, 9 to 5 Mac, apparently got a hold of some cases.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:43.480]   This is sometimes an indicator of what a new device will look like, the case manufacturers.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.040]   Although it's my understanding, I talked to Griffith some years ago.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.720]   Apple never gives samples of anything to anybody ahead of time.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.120]   They just say, "Wait until it comes out.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.040]   Then you can design your case."
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:31:00.600]   But Pelican, which makes a case, makes a rugged case, and somehow this leaked out.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.080]   And it is a different dimension.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.120]   It is apparently for a 10.5-inch iPad Pro.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:12.000]   If that's the case, if maybe they had some insight from Apple, maybe this will be announced
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.280]   on June 5th.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.480]   Maybe that's the--
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.240]   I would love to see it.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.420]   It's something-- I don't know how difficult it is for them to quickly change a camera
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.360]   hole on one of these things.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.560]   Just because it's just for your prototype, you think?
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.680]   I guess, with me Tim and Dan, you know this.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.080]   You'll get press releases immediately after Apple announces these things.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:35.040]   And they'll have all sorts of colorful pictures from Griffin, from Belkin, and all these
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.080]   cases will hit your inbox.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.080]   That's amazing.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.080]   How do they go?
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.160]   They're all just renderings.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.040]   I mean, I don't think anything actually really exists.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.040]   Maybe they do.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.040]   They've got prototypes.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.000]   They have some idea maybe where this camera hole will go.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.720]   I don't know.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.280]   And then they get them cranked out pretty darn fast.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:57.000]   You know, as much as that's funny, Clayton, you are absolutely right.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.520]   And let's not forget the lessons of this previous election cycle, the value of earned
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.520]   media.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.520]   Right?
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.720]   So a leak that shows up that it could be totally ginned up, but it shows up in your inbox or
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:16.280]   Tim's inbox or my inbox and then one or two or five or 50 of us all do a story, that branding
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.920]   alone is worth considerable money to the company that's pitching you.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.880]   They could be a peripheral company, whatever.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:26.200]   Like that company gets a lot of value even if the story isn't true.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.680]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.680]   Right.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.560]   So if you're like I, Bob's cases, right?
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.760]   Nobody's ever heard of you.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.760]   Yeah, Pelican's got a lot of...
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.520]   Yeah, look at all this advertising.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.520]   Right.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.520]   This is right.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.520]   Exactly.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.560]   And all you really had to do is render something and put it in a silicon mold.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.560]   Yeah, right.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:45.640]   This is earned media for companies and they pitch journalists in technology because they
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.680]   know a lot of us need to like rip out the door.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:53.000]   I mean, fortunately, especially if you're covering Apple, man, you're just desperate
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   at this point.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Jason sees that and he goes, "Oh, brother."
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   So is the snow.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   No, I'm a binder.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   So, Leo, I'm so curious.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.840]   What, I mean, this move to Windows, what would it take for you because I feel the same way
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.840]   about the MacBook Pro.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.960]   I mean, the touch bar, the only reason I use it is for touch ID.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.680]   I don't ever use, you know, I'm in some, I'm in calendar and I don't even know what's
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.400]   popping up in fantastic calories.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.400]   It's like food.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.520]   It's like a stop-gaff measure to something.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:25.520]   You want to be a Unix, but what would it take, what would it take for you to go back
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.720]   to a MacBook Pro?
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.720]   What would you need for it to be killer?
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.920]   Well, one of the things that's changed and one of the reasons I can actually even contemplate
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:38.160]   using Windows is that nowadays, and I think you're all probably in this book too, a lot
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.000]   of our computing is kind of operating system independent.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   I mean, I live in Chrome.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   It's in the cloud.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.160]   Chrome looks the same everywhere.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.000]   I'm using Adobe's products, Lightroom and Photoshop.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.280]   That looks the same on both platforms.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.600]   A lot of what I do is cloud-based, so it doesn't really matter what hardware I use.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:59.360]   So really, I'm choosing now at this point, I'm choosing machines.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.080]   The thing about the Windows ecosystem is there's hundreds of manufacturers and they're all
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.160]   struggling to do something innovative.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.720]   So with Apple, you don't like the touch bar, you're kind of screwed.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.440]   There's only one person making it.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.520]   With Windows, you don't like that.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.520]   Get this.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.520]   You don't like this.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:18.560]   My workday, my productivity day starts in Mac OS.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.920]   I then toggle over to Windows 10 and then I go to a moon.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.920]   Why do you use?
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.920]   And here's why.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.880]   So because I can get stuff done in Windows 10.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:34.160]   So I tip, the best Windows hardware is Mac hardware.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.160]   So just-
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.160]   That's what Walt Mossberg always said.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.160]   Oh, is it really?
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.160]   It is, I'm not kidding you.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.200]   I would disagree with you.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.200]   This Lenovo.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.200]   All right.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.800]   It's got a screen, 10 point touch.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.520]   It comes with a stylus.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:51.200]   It's got, you know, normally the trackpad on apples are light years ahead of anything
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.520]   that you can get on Windows.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.040]   This one is, I would say, as good as the glass trackpad.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.040]   It has a thinkpad.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.600]   Does it have the little red nipple?
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.040]   It has a little red nipple which you can disable and I did immediately because I never
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.240]   understood the value of that but some people love it.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.240]   It has ports.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.720]   It has three USB three ports.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.480]   It has two Type C Thunderbolt three ports.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.760]   It has a full size HDMI port.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.760]   It has a micro SD reader.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.480]   I don't know why.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:21.200]   I would like a regular SD card reader but that, I mean, and this is the same price as a
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.360]   comparable Mac.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.720]   And look at that, the Samsung Pro, Chromebook Pro for this.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.720]   That's an amazing Chromebook.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.720]   That's an amazing processor.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.720]   It's the M processor Intel M processor.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.800]   Why do I need a MacBook when I can blaze on that thing?
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.320]   Well, that's kind of my point.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.320]   And put Linux on it.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.400]   And I think Apple is suffering at a very bad time from a lack of imagination because
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.640]   there is competition.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:49.080]   And you know, for a long time, I really was, I felt very comfortable saying Mac OS is superior
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.800]   to anything else out there, even Linux.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.800]   Sure.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:56.000]   Because it had a BSD kernel because you could use a real terminal.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   And yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.400]   That's the biggest thing I miss on Windows.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.400]   Yeah, you got Linux for Windows.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.400]   Yeah, the terminal is.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.400]   I miss the terminal.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.360]   That's really a nice power tool.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.960]   But I tuned.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.960]   You miss iTunes?
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.960]   Who is this iTunes?
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.960]   No.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.960]   Who misses?
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.960]   Exactly.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.440]   And I left opportunity that was.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.360]   And another broken Apple product.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:20.320]   Yeah, there are little things that Apple does that you really wonder like, what, isn't there
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.840]   anybody in charge of this?
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:26.000]   Search on the Apple store is just broken.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.320]   And there are so many companies that game the SEO in iTunes or in the app store.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.320]   That is big business.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.320]   Apple knows that's a problem.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.000]   I think to get rid of that, but it's not been fixed yet.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   I don't know.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.320]   I mean, I don't mean to bash Apple.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.200]   I think a lot of people think I'm now an Apple bachelor.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.200]   I don't mean to.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.200]   I want Apple to succeed.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.840]   In fact, I'm rooting for them.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.880]   I want them to be the Apple of old, but I feel like, and there is that we started with
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.880]   the Apple campus.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.880]   There is that old story.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.760]   It's like being on the cover of Sports Illustrated.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.440]   It's a jinx when a company builds a giant corporate headquarters.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.440]   That usually means they're at the beginning of the end.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.600]   They're at the apex.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.000]   I will tell you, Apple treats me with respect.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.560]   There are problems with their product.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.560]   Well, look, I--
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.920]   As a consumer, as a journalist.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:10.920]   As a consumer.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:11.920]   Okay.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.080]   Well, let me give you a great example.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:21.160]   The iPhone 7, there is-- these are unlocked phones and there is the Apple upgrade program.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:26.000]   There is one model of that that is hardware locked to AT&T.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.840]   Apple knows about this and they communicate with their customers about this, right?
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.080]   So if you want to go to Verizon or T-Mobile and you want to leave, even though you have
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.640]   an unlocked phone, it is one model that's locked to AT&T.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.120]   AT&T, of course, is AT&T.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:42.000]   They're paying the neck to work with.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.600]   Apple will, for months, walk you through.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.840]   They won't take care of you this morning.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.520]   They'll let you unlock it.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.520]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.320]   I had the best experience with Apple.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.320]   Oh, I wonder how AT&T feels about that.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.960]   Not only that, they refunded me, the price of that phone.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.000]   They said, "This is our mistake.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.400]   It is our manufacturer.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.680]   We've had a tremendous--" and this is off record.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.040]   Well, I won't tell you the store, but they said, "We have had a tremendous problem working
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.280]   with AT&T.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:14.880]   This was the iPhone 7 and we just had a manufacturing batch that was tied to AT&T.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.400]   We are going to refund you."
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.400]   Wow.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.280]   I'm not kidding.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.280]   This was--
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.280]   I do feel--
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.280]   I do feel--
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.280]   I do feel--
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.280]   I do feel respected by that.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.280]   I agree with you 100%.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.280]   There's no better support anywhere.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.000]   You can go into a store.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.080]   They are really good.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.800]   They do say sometimes dumb things, but they're generally very good.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:37.240]   At least when it comes to their profit center, the iPhone, they do better than anybody.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.240]   At all.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.240]   Go ahead and try to get some support from Samsung.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.240]   Right.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.240]   Right.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.240]   Who are you going to call with your Dell or who are you going to call with your Lenovo?
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:50.240]   One of the reasons I bought the Lenovo is they still do good support.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:57.360]   I spent 300 bucks on next business day on-site replacement, including accidental.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.120]   It wasn't very expensive and they will come to me.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.560]   They're in 160 countries and replace it.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.360]   It was Corey Doctorow told me about that.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.600]   Corey only buys Lenovo.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.040]   Of course, he immediately puts Linux on it.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.880]   That's by the way, the other reason I bought it is there's a fallback.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.520]   I can always put Linux on it.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.880]   But he said, "No, because I'm a writer, I can't be out of pocket for a day."
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.400]   So I buy Lenovo's and he says, "The one thing I treat myself to once a year I buy a new
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:29.480]   Lenovo ThinkPad because I can get next business day on-site replacement and I will be able
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.480]   to continue to write."
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.320]   By the way, that's the other thing.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.040]   This actually has a nice keyboard.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:38.440]   You can't tell me any current Apple MacBook has a decent keyboard.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.560]   They're horrible.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:46.400]   That's why you guys don't mind typing on glass or a little flimsy fabric thing.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.400]   Oh, not top on glass.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:51.640]   I actually had the Microsoft iPad keyboard, which is actually not a bad typing experience.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.640]   That's right.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.920]   But yeah, I don't like the new Mac keyboards either.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.320]   And certainly I could not type on glass no way.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.320]   Go ahead.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.840]   Just play with that keyboard there while we take a break.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:02.840]   That's so nice.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.360]   Lenovo still makes great keyboards.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.360]   I have to say no.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.840]   I put Lenovo on the dog house after the Super...
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.440]   Oh, let me unlock it for you.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.440]   No, no, no.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.440]   I have to put the stroke.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.440]   It feels like a mechanical keyboard.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.440]   It feels like a nice...
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:18.440]   It's not as good as maybe five, ten years ago ThinkPads, but it's superior to...
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.440]   Superior too.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.720]   Superior to most companies now are just really putting crap keyboards because they want
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.440]   everything to be thin.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.440]   No traffic.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.040]   You get a solid hour and a half battery life out of that, right?
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.040]   That's just so good.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.480]   Can you believe this?
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.920]   They claim 15 hours battery life.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.760]   I don't know what they're doing.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.800]   I get three to four, which is okay.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.480]   I'm not going to complain.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.480]   But you're right.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.480]   It's nothing like your ten hour iPad.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.680]   I agree with you on that.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.160]   Yeah, that's kind of pathetic, isn't it?
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.200]   Our show today brought to you by ZipperKruder.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.760]   If you are in the...
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.760]   Hmm.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.960]   Powerful, but maybe not enviable position of doing the hiring at your company.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.360]   You know that everything's resting on your shoulders.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.600]   The person you hire can make the company.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.600]   A company is just a bunch of people, right?
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:12.360]   So great employees are transformative and a bad employee, you're going to be suffering.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.280]   You're going to be paying.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.760]   It's going to be painful.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.400]   So it's a big deal being in charge of hiring.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.600]   Of course, it always happens at the worst possible time.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:24.120]   You're at the end of a quarter or you're down a person.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:28.880]   If you're a small company, even that could be, you know, you're like in the penalty box,
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.240]   ZipperKruder is going to transform your life.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:36.240]   It makes hiring the right person easy as can be.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.760]   First of all, let's presume the right person's out there.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.400]   The question is how do you find that person?
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.680]   How do you get to them?
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.520]   There's more than 100 job sites in the world.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:47.560]   How do you get on the one that that person's looking at?
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:48.760]   You go to ZipperKruder.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:54.080]   One click of the mouse, one posting on ZipperKruder goes to 100 plus job sites plus Twitter,
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.080]   plus Facebook.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.080]   So it gets out there.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.600]   It gets to the most people possible.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.880]   And then I know immediately people say, well, that's terrible.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.320]   I'm going to get all those calls, all those emails.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.600]   No, no, no, no.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.760]   This is the beauty part.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.440]   It all flows into the ZipperKruder interface.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:14.680]   They reformat all the resumes so they're uniform so you can scan them quickly.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.720]   You can even put questionnaires on the posting.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.960]   Yes, no questions.
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.520]   True, false, multiple choice essay questions.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:28.440]   So you can have a screening process built right in, which means you can eliminate the wrong
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:33.160]   person fast, rank the rest of them, hire the right person.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:38.860]   In fact, over 80% of the jobs posted on ZipperKruder get a qualified candidate in less than 24
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:39.860]   hours.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.440]   That's how fast it happens.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.800]   And no juggling emails, no calls to your office.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.000]   Look at the million plus companies.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.960]   Some of the biggest companies in the world that use ZipperKruder, we use ZipperKruder.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.280]   We love it.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:53.200]   Clean rate and hire the right person fast.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.880]   Find out right now why ZipperKruder has been used by businesses of all sizes to find the
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.920]   exact person you need.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:07.400]   By trying it free, go to zipperkruder.com/twit, zipperkruder.com/twit.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:13.080]   We thank them for making a fabulous, fabulous product.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.000]   I think we can stop talking about Apple.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   It's funny.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.720]   It's somebody in the chair who said, "This is so true, Apple gets such unearned press
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.560]   constantly."
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.560]   We love talking about it.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.880]   I don't know, I guess it goes back.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:27.880]   It goes on.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.880]   It goes back to the two jobstays.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:34.640]   There's a ton of products that are about to be announced or not or are software.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.080]   And think about how many millions of people use their products.
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.360]   That's a good point.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.800]   I mean, they are the most valuable company in the world.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.880]   It's not like Apple's suffering and failing.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.160]   They're doing okay.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:53.840]   There is one more little Apple tidbit before we move on.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.600]   One way we kind of know when new products are coming out is that the Apple Store gets
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:03.520]   warned, the employees get warned, "You can't take a vacation."
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:10.680]   And the blackout dates for the Apple Store staff imply this is a memo sent to AppleCare
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:18.680]   workers, actually, that it will be September 17th that we will hear or maybe even be able
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:19.920]   to buy new iPhones.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.000]   Now, that's a Sunday.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.080]   But typically they do hold those iPhone events in September.
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.000]   This has got to be the first one on the new campus, right?
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.800]   Yeah, I would think so.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.200]   You'll come out for that, won't you, Clayton?
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.680]   I will, yeah.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.760]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.200]   That would be something to see.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.320]   I just want to see the new campus.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.920]   It's a challenge.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.440]   Apple, like everybody else, like Samsung has got to figure out something to make people
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:49.920]   come back to the store more than once every few years.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.840]   Not easy to do.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.640]   Let's talk about Google.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:59.000]   Big victory yesterday for AlphaGo.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.600]   Three in a row against the world's best Go player.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.760]   Could you?
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.680]   This happened in China.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:08.200]   I was told.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:12.040]   I have not been able to independently verify this, that the YouTube stream of the games
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.000]   have been blocked in China.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.920]   The government doesn't want people to see a machine building a Go champion.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.240]   The American machine.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.240]   That's right.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.240]   The American machine.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:25.920]   AlphaGo, and this is, it's retired now.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.560]   It beat, beat him decisively.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.280]   Three games in a row, and it's retiring.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.960]   Just like Niko Hamilton, F1, you win World Championship.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.360]   You step away and you know what else you're going to do.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:37.440]   Go out of the high note.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.200]   I wish a few football players would learn this.
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:45.480]   The research team, this is a press release from Google, behind AlphaGo, will now throw
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:50.440]   their considerable energy into the next set of grand challenges.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:54.840]   Developing advanced general algorithms at one day could help scientists as they tackle
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:55.840]   our most complex problems.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.880]   It sounds like it's following in Watson's footsteps.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.520]   Watson was based on Deep Blue, right?
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.560]   The chess playing robot.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.360]   Such as finding new cures for diseases dramatically reducing energy consumption or inventing
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.200]   revolutionary new materials.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:11.640]   There are some people who, within the machine learning community, I mean, some are like
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.880]   Ben Gertzel and they're a little aspirational, but some people really believe that Google
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.400]   is inches away from AGI.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.400]   Oh.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   Yeah, no, no, that's in the past.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.080]   We've already got this guy down there.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.080]   We already did that.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:27.600]   What is AGI?
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.680]   Artificial general intelligence.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:34.440]   So artificial intelligence is a frequently misapplied term that can be broadly applied
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.240]   to many different topics.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.280]   You get a little more specific when you talk about machine learning or you talk about
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:45.320]   algorithms, but these things, we are already living in an age that is defined by machine
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.680]   learning and will be continued to be defined by machine learning.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:51.960]   But often this is what's called narrow artificial intelligence.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:57.320]   This could be like anything from a game A to do, winning a chess is easy, right, but
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:02.880]   artificial general intelligence and what AlphaGo has done with Go.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:06.760]   And by the way, this Go, my very first, I've been playing Go for 15 years.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   Oh, you're a Go player.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.960]   I've been playing Go is a peaceful game.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:16.720]   If you want to both challenge your mind and kind of have a peaceful, relaxing experience
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.520]   with someone, I really encourage you to play Go.
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:22.200]   If you're on iOS, there's a great app called Smart Go Kiefu.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.920]   I have to try this.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.560]   I played Go when I was a kid.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.200]   I played chess much more seriously.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.200]   What's interesting.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.480]   I remember when the chess community, when Kasparov was beaten by Deep Blue.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:33.480]   It was a big deal.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.440]   It was not only a big deal, it was kind of depressing.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.840]   It was like, oh, our game is solvable.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:41.040]   A computer can be best a human.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.360]   And the chess community is kind of come around.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.960]   They now train with these.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:50.040]   This is the real interesting nuance of both Go and artificial general intelligence.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:57.760]   So what artificial general intelligence is are algorithms that first they teach themselves
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.920]   what Go is.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.920]   Oh, dear.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.920]   They teach themselves that Go is.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:02.920]   Good.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.120]   First, I have to know what a pixel is.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.720]   Then I have to know what a computer is.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:10.200]   Then I have to know that Go is a game.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.040]   Go is a game humans play.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:14.840]   Go is a game that I need to first figure out the rules.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:15.840]   Okay.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.320]   I figured out these rules.
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.320]   Now let me apply those things.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.120]   Do you see its layers and layers and layers?
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.280]   The artificial general intelligence.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:27.800]   And if it can learn what Go is, it can learn what I am and it can learn.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.800]   This is called recursive artificial intelligence.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:35.200]   Intelligence that looks at itself and its own failures and improves on that.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:39.680]   The challenge with Go, of course, is that there are a few rules that define Go.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:40.680]   Very few rules.
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:41.680]   This is in 19 by 19.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.720]   It's simple as it can be.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.160]   You play black and white stone.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.160]   There's only two.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.160]   One kind of piece.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.160]   Go is way chi.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.160]   It means to surround.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.160]   Right.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.160]   Very simple.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:54.320]   But the nuance of Go is that, I mean, the legend is that it was developed by a Chinese
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:58.880]   emperor to teach his son how to wisely rule his kingdom when he was gone.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.480]   So Go is full of proverbs.
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:07.280]   The first proverb of Go is a one stone jump is never bad, meaning no matter what, do not
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:11.560]   overextend yourself, but do not underextend yourself.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:15.480]   Push past your limitations as far as you are able.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.480]   Right.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:22.160]   And so when you take proverbs, right, there's another proverb, Hane, at the end of two stones,
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:26.920]   which means if you see two white stones together and you're playing black, Hane, play at the
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:31.640]   end of those two stones because it will increase your likelihood of victory.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:39.720]   So these proverbs, you extrapolate those to government, to politics, to interpersonal relationships.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:46.680]   Go is a game that is designed to teach you how to rule, how to run, and how to be a better
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.680]   person.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.600]   So in other words, a computer learning how to play this is significant.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:51.600]   Exactly.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:52.600]   You're exactly right, Leo.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.600]   It's light years beyond learning chess.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.600]   It is.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:55.600]   Chess is calculable.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.600]   Right.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:00.480]   You can teach a computer to look 40 moves ahead, which is plenty to win any game.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.040]   Go, you can't do that.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.040]   Right.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.960]   There are nuances to your humanity and there are nuances to go.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:12.480]   So when we have artificial general intelligence, it is beyond just machine learning or natural
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:16.320]   language processing, which are narrow AI.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:20.760]   When you get to the, when this happens, I start to go.
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.560]   Yeah, I'm going to be AGI.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:27.920]   So this is a picture of the end of the match, the video of the end of the match.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.000]   A couple of things to note.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.440]   First of all, Kudjia is the player on the left as a world champion.
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:33.440]   He's got 30.
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.440]   They started with three hours each.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:35.840]   He's got 32 minutes left.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:40.440]   AlphaGo has nearly two hours left because frankly, AlphaGo's got plenty of time.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.440]   It actually moved every minute just because.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.440]   Which is also a...
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.440]   Didn't want to embarrass the human.
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:49.760]   He component of AGI that it is speed as well as just ability.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:53.760]   The other thing I found interesting is AlphaGo doesn't try to, humans try to win, like
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.800]   win decisively, like crush you.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.840]   I don't know how it is in Go, but then chess Bobby Fisher always said, I am here to crush
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.840]   my opponent.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:04.320]   Physically, mentally, emotionally, crush him.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.840]   And that's how he was such a good player.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.320]   I'm sure Go is, you said it's peaceful.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.680]   And Go, you're supposed to learn from your defeat.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:13.480]   Well, and if I beat you, I'm supposed to help you learn how I defeated you.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:14.480]   Nice.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.480]   Well, we do do that in chess.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:19.280]   At the end of the game, both players will analyze the game, say, what if you had done
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.440]   this and that kind of thing.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.400]   So there is that collegial feeling.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.480]   But I have to say that what's interesting about AlphaGo is it's designed merely to win.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:30.920]   In fact, it won the first game by the slimmest possible margin, half a point.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.640]   Because that's as good as winning by a thousand points.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.080]   It doesn't matter.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.080]   Here is...
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:36.080]   Sorry, I guessed it.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.080]   No, this is great.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:41.200]   Could you look at all the food he's got on the right, the guy who's just making the most
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.840]   of the computers get nothing.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.840]   He doesn't need food.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:45.320]   He's the computer's doing all the work.
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:46.320]   He does.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.160]   I wonder the processing power that's required for AGI.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.000]   I mean, this is and for AlphaGo.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   Like I would like to know.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.200]   How many human batteries do you need to power this?
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.200]   Watch this though.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.480]   Watch this because this is the end of the match.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.120]   Kudja is making his final moves.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:06.120]   And what you really also see is a picture of exhaustion and frankly, the ejection.
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.480]   You could feel the human player.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.920]   They're actually, I think, analyzing now.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.880]   It kind of points.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.600]   Just like, oh.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.920]   You know, another new one to go is that the game isn't over until it is not like chess
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.520]   where there is checkmate done, right?
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:27.000]   In Go, the game isn't over until both players concede.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   So you could be losing end.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.640]   You could have to agree that you've lost.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.640]   Yeah, it's called pass.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:37.160]   So if I don't pass, I don't end the game, which also means that the human player has
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:41.560]   to accept defeat internally and say, I have won.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.560]   Right.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.560]   Or I have lost.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:44.560]   Right.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:47.600]   You see that other Google story this week, the Washington Post won about.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.600]   Sorry.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.600]   Sorry.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.600]   Oh, I'm just curious.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:54.080]   I mean, it's fascinating, but talking about that machine learning and what Google knows
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.360]   about us, what Google's trying to understand about the world.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:03.480]   And when we buy stuff at a brick and mortar store, that Google is able to now understand
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.120]   that it started with one of their ads.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.240]   That's fascinating too.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:09.160]   This is called Google attribution.
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.720]   And it's a way, it's something that we can't do here.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:15.440]   You guys can't do on Fox and Friends, which is tell an advertiser.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.960]   You know, Coca Cola buys an ad on Fox and Friends.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.960]   You can't really connect that to sales directly.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:26.040]   Google, because they have all the data, can say, yeah, you know, that credit card purchase,
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.120]   that's because of that ad on that banner ad on that website, we can connect the two because
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.120]   it's the same person.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.360]   They say they can anonymize it.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.360]   I hope they can.
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:36.360]   Right.
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:37.360]   Right.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:40.160]   Is there really anything as anonymized data at all?
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:45.440]   Well, we've seen in the past that that's, you know, that's kind of a myth that the people
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:49.840]   anonymize data all the time and we've always been able to figure out, you know, given enough
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:54.320]   data, if you, if you give me 10 searches, I can probably narrow it down to somebody.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.400]   Yeah, they're companies like Tiammium.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.040]   It's not tied to your name.
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.800]   If they know your address, your age, your date of birth, you're, you know, where you
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:05.280]   were for dinner last night, you know, even if they don't know who you are, exactly, that's
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.760]   enough identifying information, I think, for most people.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.640]   The other thing Google's doing, which I think is interesting, is these tensor processing
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.640]   units.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:18.120]   One of the things Google did is they gave away tensor flow, which is their AI engine.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.160]   So anybody can use it on the Google compute cloud.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:23.000]   And now they have hardware.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.880]   This is remarkable hardware.
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:32.640]   Each of these TPU units is a quad core that can do 180 tera flops.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:37.440]   And they put them together in big wraps, racks that can do 11 pettaflops.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.640]   That's 11.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:40.640]   What is a pettah?
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:41.640]   I don't even know.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:48.080]   It's even billion, billion floating point operations per second.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:53.640]   Somebody pointed out that one of the problems with this is it's, yeah, you can use it cheaply
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.080]   and you can use their software for free.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:00.360]   But it's proprietary in the sense that anything you do, all the data you generate with these
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:03.840]   TPU clusters, it's in Google's cloud.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.560]   You can't then use Amazon's AI or Apple's AI.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.440]   It's kind of the worry with AI that it will be.
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.440]   And company loan it.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:13.440]   Syload.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.440]   That's a good way to describe it.
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.160]   So what do you guys think?
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.160]   Is it over?
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.160]   Has Google won?
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.160]   Not yet.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:25.160]   I don't think we know what the battle is.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.160]   Exactly.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.160]   Well, the bet.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:28.160]   Okay, that's a good question.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.160]   What would the...
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.160]   So I can...
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:33.600]   Well, is it between Facebook and Google for user data and advertising?
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.840]   I think Google has twice the information Facebook does though, right?
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:38.840]   I don't know.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:39.840]   Do they?
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:44.040]   They wouldn't allow itself to show up in Google's search.
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:48.640]   That great battle, that great Wired magazine article was over, eight years ago, and that
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.680]   incredible battle where Facebook was keeping all of that data because that was the holy
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:58.960]   grail for Google, the more personalized data, the moods, the vacations, the information that
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:01.400]   you can't get from a simple Google search.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.560]   Did you think Google can get that data?
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.440]   I think Google gets it peripherally.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.240]   They tried with Google Plot.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:10.440]   I think that's why they stopped caring about Google+.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:15.200]   They're like, "Oh, the value proposition here isn't as strong as we thought it was."
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.200]   I could be wrong, but...
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:20.120]   They wanted to get Facebook stuff, but I think that's in effect what happened was they said,
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:21.120]   "Oh, we don't need that."
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.120]   They get it anyway.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.120]   Right.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:28.320]   Just because if you just use Google for all your searches and you use Google devices, and
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:32.640]   even if using an iPhone, you may be using Google Assistant, you probably using Google
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:38.080]   Search, they're getting so many signals.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:42.800]   Really, I don't think it's a question of how much data you have at this point.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:48.960]   It's how much intelligence you can apply to the data you have to make the connections.
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:55.200]   I feel like Facebook is certainly data rich, but I feel like computer scientists at Google
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.200]   maybe are a little bit...
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.200]   I don't know.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.200]   That's a really interesting question.
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.040]   Did you see this?
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:09.120]   Facebook, according to an Australian news website, which has seen internal research, saw that
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:16.280]   Facebook was classifying the emotions of teenagers, stressed, anxious, nervous, or otherwise,
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:23.320]   and then offering it to advertisers who could use it to hone in on teenagers when they're
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:27.560]   most vulnerable.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:31.800]   Coming to USA Today, this information was shared with an advertiser.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:37.480]   Facebook says, "No, we have a process in place to review the type of research we perform."
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:39.520]   In this case, "Oh, well, maybe we did it.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:40.600]   We didn't follow the process."
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:41.600]   That's right.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:42.600]   We have a process.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:45.760]   We didn't follow it, but we have a process.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.000]   I mean, how would that work?
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.840]   It seems odd to me, I guess, unless it's a high-level advertiser that's spending tens of
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:59.040]   millions of dollars in their ads manager, because there is a process in place.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.480]   There are only certain campaigns that you can run.
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.720]   There's only access to certain data that you can see.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:07.080]   But do you believe the Cambridge Analytical story or not?
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:08.080]   Oh, no.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:09.720]   I got sources that are like crazy.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.720]   So here's the deal.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.720]   I'll get...
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.520]   And then you can tell us what's true.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:16.160]   This comes to the Trump campaign.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:24.680]   Jared Kushner was charged, he started a unit in San Antonio to use data from a company in
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:29.080]   in Britain called Cambridge Analytica, which, among other things, it was alleged that they
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:35.000]   did Facebook quizzes to gather information about Facebook users, and that the Trump campaign
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.680]   then bought very targeted ads based not merely on whether somebody was likely or unlikely
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:43.800]   to vote for Trump.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:50.400]   That was useful because you could discourage a likely voter for Hillary Clinton not to vote,
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:55.600]   and you could encourage a likely voter for Trump to vote, but also even using sentiment
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:01.080]   analysis to things like, "Well, we know that there's a group X, there's a large set of
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:06.080]   group people who will vote for support of the Second Amendment, who will vote for gun
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.240]   rights."
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:12.400]   But more than that, we can then subdivide that group by emotion analysis as to why they
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.880]   care about gun rights.
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:19.760]   Some are hunters, some are worried about safety and security, some are libertarians who believe
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:23.400]   no government interference, and then targeted an ad specifically, and these are dark ads
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:27.800]   because no one sees it except that person targeted an ad towards those interests.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.800]   So that was the...
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:29.800]   That was what was alleged.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.800]   I'm sorry for jumping.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.680]   I don't mean to cut you guys off.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:36.680]   Is it true?
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:37.680]   Well, so the way...
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:38.680]   Because we've seen reports now go back and forth.
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:39.680]   Yes.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.680]   The way you characterized it.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:49.360]   This is the definition of data analysis on this previous campaign used many of those tactics,
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:52.920]   but you have to separate Cambridge Analytica from this.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:55.240]   They claim some say claim more than they really would get from the whole.
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:57.960]   So we have all this reporting in tech republic.
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:04.040]   I know the CEO of Cambridge very well, they got into hot water because, yes, they do quizzes.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.320]   Cambridge made up a lot of their data.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.420]   This micro-targeting.
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:09.420]   They use quizzes.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:12.080]   This micro-legend.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:17.340]   This micro-targeting is precisely the real company that there are a number of real companies
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:18.500]   that do this.
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.240]   One is L2 Political.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.800]   If you buy data from L2 Political, you can log in.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.760]   We could log in right now, and I could show you all of those things about every single...
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:33.200]   I can find you and see your social security number, how much money you make, where you
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.200]   live.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.200]   I can...
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.200]   You're all of these things that you say.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.540]   So everything you just said, Leo, is absolutely correct.
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:45.100]   Whether Cambridge did it or not, follow Garrett Lansing on Twitter.
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.980]   I'll leave that right there.
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:51.180]   But during the campaign, this was precisely what we covered at tech republic was the data
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.900]   and the data analytics.
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:56.980]   We didn't cover the horse race because the politics are less interesting than that.
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:01.500]   And as it turned out, you covered the right thing because this, in my opinion, this was
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.220]   the most significant development.
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:04.500]   We were finding bots.
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:08.600]   You can find this on tech republic, find stories from January 2016.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.580]   We were finding bots buried in the Twitter.
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:18.380]   You can look at the spikes in Trump and Clinton's Twitter followers and correlate them.
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:21.140]   Yes, these things happen.
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:25.980]   And the micro-tarding, every single political campaign, every smart political campaign is
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:29.140]   buying and from now on, if you're not, you're going to lose.
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:30.140]   Right.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.140]   Right.
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:34.380]   And being able to go to any of these towns, the real story was, yeah, I mean, the...
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:39.540]   The targeting of the ads was huge, but also then being able to use that data for speeches.
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:40.540]   Yes.
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:45.740]   So they knew down to a granularity that it was almost like the speeches themselves were
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:46.740]   crowd-sourced.
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:47.740]   Head, crews.
[01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:48.740]   So you could go into Phoenix.
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:49.740]   Well, Trump was very good.
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:52.980]   I mean, this was obvious if you watched him at reading the crowd and feeding them stuff
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.300]   that made them more excited.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:57.020]   I mean, he didn't have to use any analytics.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.220]   There was a direct feedback loop.
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:05.100]   There is...in fact, that was the lesson of the campaign, also follow Chris Wilson on Twitter.
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:09.020]   Chris was Ted Cruz's data analytics guy.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:11.140]   Ted Cruz really pioneered this.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:13.100]   And it was one reason he rose so high.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:17.260]   Clayton, what you said is precisely accurate.
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.860]   It is less about the G.O.TV, the Get Out The Vote.
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:26.820]   And it's more about targeting the right language that we know will elicit a response.
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.820]   And Garrett's an interesting...
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:29.820]   Is this Garrett Lansing?
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:30.980]   Yeah, that's Garrett.
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:34.740]   He was in charge of tech at the White House for about three weeks.
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.380]   Under Obama or under Trump?
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:37.380]   Under Trump.
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.380]   Garrett's a real good guy.
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:44.020]   And I'm not saying...all I know from Garrett is that he did analytics.
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:46.060]   So Garrett is not my source.
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:47.460]   And I won't get him into trouble.
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:49.420]   I won't reveal who my sources were.
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:56.700]   But Garrett is somebody who you could turn to for accurate information about data analytics
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:57.700]   in the current age.
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:58.700]   What's going on?
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:01.020]   So is Chris Wilson.
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.660]   And there's no fun with those guys.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:06.140]   Again, I really like the humans at Cambridge Analytica.
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:07.660]   And they're going to hate me.
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:11.260]   They're going to send some emails after the show.
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:15.380]   But what they did is not what they claimed to have done.
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:17.660]   They sent emails the day after the campaign.
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:20.460]   I was at Hillary Clinton's HQ through the campaign.
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:25.340]   As soon as the tide started to turn, Cambridge took credit for Trump's win.
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:26.340]   That night.
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.140]   So, okay.
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:32.860]   But irrespective of that, there are companies doing this kind of thing.
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:33.860]   Yes, precisely.
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.860]   It may not be CA.
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:35.860]   Right.
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:36.860]   But there are companies doing this kind of thing.
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:39.780]   Yeah, the way you framed that is precisely, rightly.
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:45.420]   And more of the point, Facebook will sell ads based on that data.
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:48.780]   Or data scraped from Facebook.
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:49.780]   Yeah.
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:50.820]   And how do you buy an ad like that?
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:54.020]   You don't say to Facebook, I want depressed teenagers though.
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:57.020]   You'll know before that you'll know who it is.
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.580]   That's my question because I do a lot of Facebook stuff.
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.900]   And for my company, and it's important that I do it.
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:03.540]   And without it, I'd be.
[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:06.500]   I don't know why anybody buys ads and I shouldn't say this out loud.
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.980]   Anywhere but Facebook.
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:08.980]   Right.
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:14.100]   I mean, you can really, that's talk about efficient ad spend.
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.100]   Right?
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.100]   Right.
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.100]   I mean, yeah, like I said before, I mean, think about it.
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:21.860]   If you're like a pet shop owner in a small town in Massachusetts or just take that as
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:22.860]   an example.
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:23.860]   Right.
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:29.700]   So, why would you put up a billboard or why would you put out, take an ad out in the local
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.700]   food?
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.060]   Why would anybody buy a billboard?
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:33.060]   You're right.
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:34.060]   Right.
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:38.880]   So why wouldn't you then just target pet owners in the three zip codes that your pet shop
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.820]   would service in the little downtown area and run a little coupon on a Sunday for a new,
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:44.820]   hey, we're new in town.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:48.060]   We just opened our store pet owners come to our store.
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:51.820]   You're going to get a free, you know, free doggy toy on this particular day.
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:55.700]   You're only targeting pet owners through the Facebook ad platform and web and.
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:56.820]   And do it all the time.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.820]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:04:58.820]   Right.
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:04:59.820]   And between 30 and 50 years old, right?
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:00.820]   Maybe you're not going to target.
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.700]   The only thing that saves us, by the way, is that at least people when they buy ads on
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.100]   Twitter, they know you're getting geeks.
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.180]   I mean, you're getting a tech enthusiast.
[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:11.900]   So just by virtue of the content, we are somewhat narrow niche.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:17.900]   But boy, I would really worry if I were network television, a newspaper, a clear channel selling
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:21.380]   ads on billboards, you can't compete.
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:27.020]   I mean, this is why this your sophistication is you are doing and you are advocating the
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.540]   exact right tactic.
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:32.060]   It is that other industries aren't as sophisticated as geeks.
[01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:37.180]   They're going to they're going to have trouble going down the road because Procter and Gamble,
[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:38.820]   which by the way, is that sophisticated?
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.980]   It's going to eat their lunch.
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:43.500]   And we have my question is, how are they getting this data?
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.540]   How are they getting the depressed teenager data?
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:49.020]   I mean, because if you go through the ads manager as a normal company, Facebook's not
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:50.620]   telling you you're saying, right?
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.180]   You can't find that data in there.
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:56.540]   You can find people's credit history and if they own a mortgage and if they have, you
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.380]   know, Facebook quizzes, Facebook quizzes.
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:02.940]   Listen to some sad music or like maybe they're posting feelings and sentiment data.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:09.060]   So if I if I create quizzes, let's say what what Game of Thrones character are you?
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:14.420]   And I create a quiz and those things spread virally on Facebook like wildfire.
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:16.380]   I get the data from that quiz, right?
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:19.300]   I mean, Facebook gets it, but I also get it, right?
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.740]   Is that one way to do this?
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:22.740]   How would you do it?
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.540]   I'm just trying to think through the ads manager platform.
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:25.540]   I don't know how that would.
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.820]   No, no, but you don't understand.
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:28.540]   I'm not saying through the ads manager.
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:30.860]   I'm saying you create content on Facebook.
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:33.140]   They cure exactly.
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:34.980]   And then you're retargeting.
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:36.260]   So that's how you're getting it.
[01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:41.580]   So then you're able to see if the 100,000 people that answered your quiz on your Facebook
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:45.140]   page, the Donald Trump Facebook page answered it that they are sad.
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:53.180]   And part of the reason this works is Facebook's very lax privacy policies, which allow you,
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:57.620]   for instance, if somebody answers a quiz to get not only information about that person,
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.260]   but about their friends.
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:00.820]   And right?
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:01.820]   Yes.
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:08.180]   And and we as individuals, we as individual buyers are not an enterprise company or highly
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:09.180]   influential.
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:12.180]   So we're not getting the good stuff.
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:16.660]   There are not.
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:21.860]   But you know, Clayton, you and I and everybody in the media, if I want traffic, I can arbitrage
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:22.860]   it.
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:26.660]   I can buy it off of Facebook and I don't necessarily need to get very granular about that until
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:29.380]   I have my own analytics systems on top of that.
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:33.740]   So if you think about political campaigns who don't only rely on Facebook, but sometimes
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:39.420]   rely on Facebook and you have your own analytics process, excuse me, processes and really
[01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:44.340]   smart data scientists who all want to be influential inside an administration or go
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:46.700]   to jobs in the private sector.
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.620]   It's not just Facebook data.
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.380]   Facebook data is part of the bigger picture.
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:55.380]   Again, check out L2 political if you want to see how this works.
[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:59.540]   Our political campaigns, the most sophisticated users of this data at this point.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:03.420]   No, that's why I'm saying geeks are because like Clayton, what you're describing is stuff
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:08.420]   that like a lot of those tactics, we kind of know or if you're small business or even
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:14.380]   a larger SMB, an enterprise company, you might know some of these tactics, but a political
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:19.700]   campaign, look, I know political campaigns, they're not that sophisticated.
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.180]   That's reassuring by the way.
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:26.860]   I'm very glad to hear that because whether you buy tied or not is less important than
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:28.620]   who gets elected president.
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:29.620]   Yeah.
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:31.860]   It's nice to know that.
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:37.780]   But I do have to say that there are people who do know this.
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:40.820]   They are going to survival of the fittest.
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:44.860]   They are going to become more and more successful, more and more powerful.
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:50.940]   Eventually this would become the province of election campaigns.
[01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:53.860]   How does this change?
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:59.740]   What we're really seeing is, and we've seen this for years, big data, more and more big
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:03.020]   data, better, better ways to process big data.
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:07.020]   And then there are some companies, and maybe Google's the one, but there are some companies
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:11.700]   who have a head start, such a lead in this, that they will only make them stronger and
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:12.700]   stronger.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.540]   Their lead will magnify as a result.
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:15.780]   Is that fair to say?
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:16.780]   Yeah.
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.820]   When do they become a monopoly of this data?
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:20.700]   They are though, right?
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:23.220]   Facebook is, I mean, you can't say Google.
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:26.020]   The data Google has is unique to Google.
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:31.060]   So then you have this move by cable companies.
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:35.420]   Google is everywhere you go on the internet is Google.
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:37.220]   Not Cox, not Comcast.
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:39.900]   In fact, what do you think Google's been pushing?
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:42.020]   HTTPS everywhere, right?
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:44.180]   This is Google's pushing this very hard.
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.300]   Your Google searches, for instance, are encrypted.
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:48.460]   Your ISP does not see those searches.
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:51.540]   All they know is that you're using Google.
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.100]   And Google wants this for every website.
[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:57.500]   In fact, they've even already said, we will rank you higher if you're a secure website.
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.900]   We make Twitch secure, not because there's anything on Twitch.
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.700]   There's no, we don't know anything about you.
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.860]   There's no account, you don't create an account on Twitch, but we made it secure because it
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:07.180]   helps our ranking is Google.
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:11.260]   So you think this is D, Google playing defense against the ISPs?
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:12.260]   You bet.
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:13.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:15.140]   That way Google has a monopoly on that information.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.140]   Nobody else does.
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.140]   Yeah.
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.140]   Well, I'm there scared.
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:24.220]   I spoke to an IT genius the other day and over coffee.
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.020]   And guys quite brilliant.
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:29.140]   He started a number of companies and sold them multi-millionaire.
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:35.580]   And he said, the real trouble right now for ISPs is that when you come home, most people
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:36.820]   aren't switching to Wi-Fi.
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:37.820]   Really?
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:39.820]   They're using their carrier.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:40.820]   LTE?
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.820]   Wow.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.620]   Because LTE is just fast enough, it's fine.
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:46.700]   And most people kind of forget to jump to Wi-Fi.
[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:51.180]   I know my mom, you know, parents get, come home, they don't jump over to Wi-Fi because
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.180]   they're home.
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:53.740]   We do it kind of instinctually.
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:58.380]   But now there's this real fight, you know, Verizon doesn't want to build any more fiber
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:10:59.940]   to the home.
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:01.940]   And now they're really targeting these new.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:02.940]   That's interesting.
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:07.980]   That would explain why Google and Verizon have stopped their fiber initiatives.
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:08.980]   Right.
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:09.980]   They're done.
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:10.980]   They're done.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:11.980]   You use the carrier.
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:16.180]   The future is the spectrum that's available.
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:17.900]   It's going to be wicked fast.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:18.900]   5G, right?
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:19.900]   Yeah, 5G.
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:20.900]   Probably not until 2020.
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:21.900]   5G.
[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:26.460]   Just in time for the next election.
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:29.780]   This is why, by the way, I think you can make a strong case that Mark Zuckerberg will
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:35.620]   run for president and other technocrats will run for president because they will be, I
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:40.540]   really feel we have a, we are at a paradigm shift.
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:41.940]   I hate to use that phrase.
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:44.860]   We're at the bend of the hockey stick.
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:46.300]   And things are going to rapidly change.
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:51.980]   The next five years, five years from now will not look anything like this today.
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:52.980]   I would guess.
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:56.180]   And AI will be the driving force behind that.
[01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:57.180]   Yes.
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.660]   You guys are smart.
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:00.060]   You'd think?
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:01.620]   Will the rock be the next president?
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:06.780]   Because he can, because he's stronger than the rest.
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:07.820]   Let's take a break.
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:09.500]   We've got a, we've got a great panel.
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.100]   Clayton Morris is here, Fox and friends.
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:16.900]   And let's not forget Morrisinvest.com where he teaches you how the miracle of residential
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:22.220]   real estate, which by the way, Lisa and I are all in on.
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:24.780]   We're, we're, I know we got to talk about it last time you were on.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:27.820]   I said, I went to Lisa and said, we got to do this.
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:32.700]   We've got so many Twit listeners have, yeah, yeah, come and thank you for the podcast.
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.620]   They're all working here for 20 more years.
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:36.620]   They're going to retire.
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:37.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.740]   Most people think it's super difficult to do it.
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:42.540]   And really, you know, if you think about, you add up your monthly expenses.
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:44.500]   Oh, that should be you.
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.980]   That should be you and Natalie.
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:47.700]   Oh, on our website?
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:48.700]   Yeah.
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:49.700]   That's clip art.
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:51.260]   I want you, Natalie.
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:52.740]   I want miles.
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:53.940]   I didn't want it to be about me.
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:58.820]   I honestly, I re I rebuilt the whole website to be about about people like other people
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:00.780]   helping them achieve financial freedom.
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:03.580]   We did pick a family that looks kind of like your family.
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:07.820]   I was like, all right, I just need some smiling people that look like they might be
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:12.020]   doing a little bit like you, except you need a baby in the back there.
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.020]   Yeah.
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:15.900]   I mean, honestly, the common investor that I work with is like, I'm tired of driving
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:17.740]   two hours to work back and forth.
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:21.780]   And they have got two kids at home, I'm tired of being selfish, you know.
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:23.500]   Also we've got the great Dan Patterson.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:27.100]   First, I didn't realize that he's been on the show any time, his first time in studio.
[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:28.100]   Wonderful to be here.
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.580]   I have met you physically though, haven't I?
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:34.340]   Yeah, many, but this is a truly wonderful thing to see.
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.340]   Thank you for being here.
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:36.340]   Thank you.
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:38.660]   So I think you got some stuff.
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:41.300]   I want to ask more questions about this work.
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:42.300]   You've been doing guys.
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:45.420]   No, no, no, I want to know you can read Dan at deck, Republic.com.
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.420]   Yeah.
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:47.420]   Yeah.
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:48.420]   Really interesting stuff.
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:49.420]   We talk AI.
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:50.580]   I get worked up.
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:52.340]   It's exciting.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:57.660]   And Tim Stevens, he's always a pleasure to have one from the roadshow.com up there in
[01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:02.100]   upper New York state where nothing changes year to year.
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:04.980]   They still have a milk man up there bringing you the milk.
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:05.980]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:06.980]   Matter of fact, we do.
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:07.980]   I know it.
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:08.980]   I know it.
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:12.500]   As long as there's a milk man, I think life can continue.
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.660]   Do you live up there near.
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:16.420]   There's so many celebrities to live up that way.
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:20.420]   Mark Ruffalo lives up there, right?
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:24.140]   Matthew Reese and what's her name from the Americans?
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:25.540]   I couldn't tell you.
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:27.460]   I'm carrying what's new.
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:28.460]   Yeah.
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:29.460]   Huh.
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:30.460]   Well, that's the point.
[01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:31.460]   They all up there, but nobody knows.
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:32.460]   It's secret.
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:33.460]   Right.
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:34.460]   So here you want your privacy.
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:35.460]   And I get that.
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:38.580]   Plus, there's nothing like the smell of manure in the morning.
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:39.580]   I love it.
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:41.500]   That was in the spring, Leo.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.500]   We're well past.
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:45.620]   You know, we used to vacation up in upper New York state of Cooper's town because my
[01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:48.060]   dad was a baseball fan in that Lake Otsego.
[01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:53.260]   And I always know we were almost there because I smell the cows.
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:59.660]   Actually, to me, the smell of sweet grass and cow manure is actually very pleasant.
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:00.660]   Like the look good.
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:01.660]   Yeah, it's good for me.
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:02.660]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:03.660]   I grew up in a problem of Vermont.
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:04.660]   It's so exciting when I smell it.
[01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:05.660]   Yeah, we're talking about Kickstarter.
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:09.740]   This is a new Kickstarter that you can order manure on the internet and deliver right to
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:10.740]   you.
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:11.740]   Is that true?
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:12.740]   No, but I'm going to start it.
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:13.740]   I like it.
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:14.740]   We've got the manure.
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.540]   You've got the raised beds.
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:19.740]   We've got the manure.
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:21.100]   Petaluma has a fragrance.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:26.060]   A couple of times a year, they fertilize.
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:27.060]   That's all I'm going to say.
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:31.260]   I don't want to conjure any particular image in your mind.
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:34.180]   It smells like victory.
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:37.140]   Our show today brought you by the nicest sheets I've ever slept on.
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:38.620]   These sheets are amazing.
[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:40.340]   Bowl and branch.
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:44.580]   Now, you may say, "Why are you talking about sheets, Leo?"
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:50.940]   But I got to tell you, I think we've learned that a healthy sleep, a good night's sleep
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:56.860]   is key to your overall well-being, not just your mental state, but your physical state.
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:02.380]   We know that cortisol, the stress hormone can keep you from sleeping, but getting a good
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:06.300]   sleep habit and a comfortable bed, we've talked about mattresses.
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.460]   Let me talk about the bedding on the mattress.
[01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:09.860]   That can make a huge difference.
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:15.980]   Bowl and branch sheets are made from 100% organic cotton.
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:16.980]   You could talk about cotton.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:19.300]   You could talk about thread-coun, all that stuff.
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:20.460]   But I could tell you this.
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:26.220]   I've made the mistake of buying $1,000 sheets that were not comfortable because they were
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:27.220]   too crisp.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:32.540]   Bowl and branch, it's the softest cotton you've ever—and they get softer as you use them.
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:34.620]   They're so beautiful.
[01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:37.860]   They don't sell at department stores, so there's not that crazy markup.
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:39.860]   They only sell online.
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:45.220]   You're getting about twice the quality for literally half the price.
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:47.900]   They say this and I've never questioned it more.
[01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:52.260]   Three former U.S. presidents sleep on Bowl and branch.
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:53.260]   You pick the three.
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:54.260]   I don't know who it is.
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.260]   Countless celebrities.
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:58.140]   I sleep on Bowl and branch and I love it.
[01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:05.340]   Feel good about your sheets, not only knowing that their organic cotton produced responsibly,
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:10.020]   but also ethically made sheets, but also the most comfortable sheets you've ever slept
[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:11.220]   on.
[01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:14.260]   Of course, you could try them for 30 nights and see for yourself.
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:15.420]   If you're not impressed, return them.
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:16.900]   You get every penny back.
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:21.060]   Forget lugging around a bed in a bag in a busy department store.
[01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:23.300]   Go to bowlandbranch.com.
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:24.300]   It's easy to order.
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:28.620]   If you use the promo code TWIT right now, you'll get $50 off your first set of sheets and free
[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:29.620]   shipping.
[01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:32.420]   B-O-L-L like the cotton bowl, right?
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:36.380]   B-O-L-L and not the cotton bowl football game, the cotton bowl, the bowl of cotton,
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:39.260]   the ball of the bowl of the never mind.
[01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:44.540]   B-O-L-L and branch, like the branch of the cotton.com.
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:49.420]   Use the promo code TWIT for $50 off free shipping at bowlandbranch, the softest bedding
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:50.420]   in the world.
[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:52.980]   I'm following two new people on Twitter now.
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:55.020]   I've got Chris Wilson.
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:56.220]   He's Wilson WPA.
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:58.340]   That was Ted Cruz's data guy, right?
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.700]   Chris is brilliant.
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:02.500]   And then I'm also following Garrett Lansing.
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.340]   Sorry, Garrett.
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:05.340]   Why sorry?
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:08.220]   He's an ancient Greek nerd, he says.
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:09.420]   Garrett's wonderful.
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:10.420]   He's wonderful.
[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:11.700]   Do you want to be under the radar?
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.980]   No, I don't want to imply that Garrett's my source.
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:14.980]   He's not.
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:15.980]   No, he's not a source.
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:16.980]   Nobody ever said that.
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:17.980]   Right.
[01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:18.980]   He's just a good guy.
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:19.980]   I just don't want to get Garrett in any trouble by implies.
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:21.980]   He said things that he didn't say.
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:25.980]   Garrett is just one of those guys who understands data and politics.
[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:30.980]   That's a great person to follow on Twitter is @ClaytonMoris.
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:31.980]   You should just add out the drink.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:35.980]   I hear he is not only brilliant but very handsome.
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:36.980]   Right.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:37.980]   Yeah.
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:38.980]   I like that Morris guy.
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:39.980]   It's too late.
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:40.980]   I'm already following him.
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:41.980]   How do you guys use in Twitter these days?
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:42.980]   We have this debate all the time.
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:43.980]   I don't know.
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:45.980]   Do you use it much anymore?
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:47.980]   I'm very mixed feelings about Twitter.
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:48.980]   Always.
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:53.180]   I'm pretty much just stream of consciousness, whatever is going on kind of thing.
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:54.260]   It's not really a promotional tool.
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:57.700]   But then for me, it was always just a means of communicating and kind of getting in touch
[01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:58.700]   with people.
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:18:59.900]   It was never much of a promo tool for me.
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:00.980]   I share what I'm up to.
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:03.700]   But I never look at it as a way to generate traffic as much.
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:08.980]   I have stopped tweeting kind of the random personal tweet.
[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:13.460]   And I realize that if you follow me on Twitter, you probably are following me for tech information
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:14.460]   and news.
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.460]   Right.
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:18.940]   So what I've started doing, I, as I'm sure all of you guys do, I have a beach.
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:20.580]   I check every morning, every evening.
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:22.180]   I go around, I go to tech meme.
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:26.060]   I go to variety, you know, hacker news, variety of sites.
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:29.620]   And I pick articles that we'll be talking about on the shows.
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:31.460]   I have always used pin board.
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:32.460]   P.I.
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:33.460]   Pin board.
[01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:34.460]   I am, which was so good.
[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:39.700]   It's when, when Yahoo bought delicious, they pretty much killed the API.
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:42.900]   Joshua, I think is revitalized or somebody bought delicious.
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:45.260]   But the way I work is I'll use pin board.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:47.100]   I have a little extension.
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:50.300]   And so all the articles are ended up on pin board.
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:51.460]   And you could follow me.
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:55.380]   It's a public feed pin board.in/u/colonleoloport.
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:20:01.060]   But I've decided to link it using, if this then that is appier, one of those tools to my
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.060]   Twitter feed.
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:07.420]   So now if I bookmark a story we're going to cover, I might modify the title for a little
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:09.820]   commentary and then it goes on my Twitter feed.
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:14.900]   And actually that's, I think the most useful thing I can do on Twitter, which is post articles
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:20.260]   that I'm going to talk about that I think are interesting with the slightest bit of commentary.
[01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:21.260]   How about you?
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:22.860]   Yeah, that's really all I use it for.
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:28.340]   I use, I use linky and iOS and make a nice little post about something I'm reading.
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:32.260]   I love my paranormal news and, you know, in addition to real estate.
[01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:33.260]   Are you, that's right.
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:34.260]   You're a ghost hunter.
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:35.260]   I forgot about that.
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:36.260]   Love it.
[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:37.260]   Yeah.
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:38.260]   I want disclosure, baby.
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:39.260]   And I think that's, so.
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:40.260]   Yeah, me too.
[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:41.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:42.260]   You're, you're into it too.
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:43.260]   I'm like, I'm.
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.260]   I just do the UFO podcast all the time.
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:45.260]   Absolutely.
[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:46.860]   Not necessarily prone to an input.
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:47.860]   Really?
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:48.860]   Really?
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:49.860]   I'm proud of it.
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:53.340]   I try to do as much of it as I can on Fox and because I think, you know, there's, there's,
[01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:54.660]   oh, there's so much there.
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:21:00.780]   Have you just, if you guys want to have your minds blown, check out Corey Good.
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:04.180]   And I would even recommend checking out if you're sort of Gaia.com.
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:07.380]   Check out this cosmic disclosure.
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:13.860]   It's a show on Gaia and Corey Good interviewed by David Wilcox, a great writer.
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:14.860]   And a journalist.
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:16.860]   He's been at this for many, many years.
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:19.660]   I mean, spoken to people at the highest levels of military.
[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:21.100]   Oh, please.
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.780]   He says there's a secret space program.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:26.220]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:31.660]   Just dive into some of the, just dive into some of the Apollo, you know, transmissions
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:36.020]   when they were seeing, they were, they were seeing objects on the moon following them.
[01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:38.220]   Secrets of the Apollo missions.
[01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:43.820]   I'm telling you, see, once you go down here and you go with an open mind.
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:46.220]   I have a completely closed mind.
[01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:47.460]   I think it's crazy.
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:49.380]   I think you're nuts.
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.620]   Here's a challenge for you.
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:51.620]   Okay.
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:52.620]   Here's it.
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:53.620]   I'll throw down a Leo challenge.
[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:58.140]   You have a, so the next time I'm on Twitch, watch, watch all of cosmic disclosure, watch
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:03.220]   some of those shows and we'll see if your mind has changed at all.
[01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:06.980]   And see if you, if you start to see, I'm telling you, you start to be an other, I have
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:08.940]   talked to, I've talked humorous.
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:09.940]   It's entertainment.
[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:13.180]   Like I'm going to bed and like, I used to listen to, what was that?
[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:14.920]   Like a little, a show or bell, right?
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:16.660]   Yeah, coast to coast to coast.
[01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:17.660]   Yeah.
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:21.300]   I've been on coast to coast and I always felt a little dirty afterwards because I feel like,
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:24.300]   here I am talking about real stuff like technology.
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:28.220]   And then the guy right after me is going to be talking about secret alien autopsies.
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:31.900]   And it's like, oh, please, it's kind of like penthouse stories because you could pretty
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:33.780]   much get on there and say anything you want to.
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:37.300]   And that was, that was, I think, energy is like penthouse stories.
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:39.180]   You'll never believe what happened.
[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:40.180]   It's true.
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:41.180]   I'm telling you.
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:42.180]   Dopamine reaction too, right?
[01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:44.180]   I think it's exactly that.
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:46.420]   But look, hey, you're a smart guy, Clayton.
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.260]   I'm not going to diss you at all.
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:50.180]   I'm going to listen to cosmic disclosure.
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:52.100]   And next time you're on, we can talk about it.
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:53.100]   Yeah.
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:55.300]   Well, haven't just watched every, there's like a couple seasons, go through it and listen
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:56.300]   to it.
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:58.060]   And I would love to hear your thoughts on it.
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:00.620]   I first engineered some of this stuff.
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:05.220]   I'm going to Machu Picchu, the ancient Inca ruins in Peru next week.
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:07.580]   Is there anything I should do while I'm there?
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:10.780]   Anything I should dig up?
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:11.780]   Look for secrets.
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:16.380]   When you're at the top and you'll know this, I'm not sure you've heard about this.
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:18.980]   When you get to the top, you're supposed to strip down, be totally nude.
[01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:19.980]   Totally nude.
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:20.980]   Totally nude.
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:22.780]   Regardless of how many people are standing around you.
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:23.780]   Okay.
[01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:24.780]   Deal.
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:25.780]   Don't even Google that.
[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:26.780]   Just go and do it.
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:31.460]   Next week in tech, Lula Port arrested for licking decency.
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:37.180]   I went, I'll never forget a few years ago, we went to Egypt and went to Luxor and went
[01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:38.180]   into the pyramids and stuff.
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:42.220]   And then we went into one of the, you know, the ancient tombs and there was a whole new
[01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:43.900]   age group there chanting.
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:50.380]   They were holding on to the altar going, you know, and I thought, oh, wow, we must be
[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:51.460]   at the center of something.
[01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:53.660]   I didn't feel any better or different.
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:57.580]   But you did buy a Banzai tree after that.
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:00.420]   But I'm floating one of that.
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:01.420]   You got me.
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:02.420]   You got me.
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:05.060]   Obviously, I do believe in Kickstarter.
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:06.060]   Okay.
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:09.100]   I have a deep rooted belief that Kickstarter is right.
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:11.100]   Fake, make, believe things.
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:12.100]   Oh, Lord.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:18.980]   Somebody in the chat room said that this, the Google ad conference, everybody paid attention
[01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:25.260]   to Google IO, but the Google ad conference was really the event that people should have
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:26.420]   been paying attention to.
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:28.940]   They call it their marketing next conference.
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:35.700]   And this is where they announced that tool for measuring brick and mortar sales after
[01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:38.300]   an ad campaign.
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:40.700]   He said in the chat room, he said, you should watch the videos.
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:46.700]   A lot of these videos have been put out here and advertisers actually are very excited.
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:50.020]   Advertisers would love to know more about our behavior and what we do and whether their
[01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:51.020]   ads work.
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:54.100]   That was always the saying, I know that half my ads work.
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:56.500]   The problem is I don't know which half, you know, half.
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:59.980]   If you want to be cynical, you could look at a lot of the stuff that came out of Google
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:01.420]   IO that was really exciting.
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:06.380]   The idea of 3D mapping within a building without having to have location buildings within the
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:07.380]   building.
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:12.100]   Well, now you can find your way to the Captain Crunch, but now, you know, Captain Crunch can
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:15.780]   know how long you stood there standing in this real line looking at that stuff too.
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:20.340]   So even Google automotive, for example, you know, there's been a lot of resistance among
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:25.180]   automotive manufacturers to put Android Auto in the car because Google needs to take some
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:28.780]   information out of that effectively to know where you are and where you're going.
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:32.660]   That too could be looked at as a skeptical, you know, a little bit of a tin oil.
[01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:37.060]   Tippo hat way of saying, you know, this technology is cool and it does give you benefit.
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:41.420]   But ultimately, it just makes Google better at serving you ads and learning more about
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:42.420]   you.
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:44.020]   So you can look at this stuff in a lot of cynical ways.
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:46.620]   And ultimately, I think it does make Google very, very, very powerful.
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:50.640]   Yeah, Geico could start sending you ads because it knows that you speed or blow through stop
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:51.640]   signs.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:56.120]   So how is Android Auto different from Google automotive?
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.720]   Tim, what is, explain what that Google automotive is.
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.640]   So right now, if your car has Android Auto, basically your phone is effectively working
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:04.640]   as a terminal.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:08.440]   It's providing an interface is effectively doing a video out signal and taking over a part
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.360]   of the dashboard of the car.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:14.200]   If you do run Android within the dashboard, as we saw some demonstrations from Volvo
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:18.160]   and from Audi, that actually is Android running natively in the car.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:23.680]   And in that case, if there is a native infotainment system there from, for example, Volvo's Census
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:27.560]   system or the Audi MMI system, then I should be running on top of Android.
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:31.640]   So it's kind of like turning things upside down, whereas you now have Android Auto running
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:33.600]   on top of the infotainment system.
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:36.480]   You then have the infotainment system running on top of Android.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:40.920]   But the net result is the same basic interface, the same basic apps, but you no longer would
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:43.160]   have to have your phone connected to the car.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.560]   You'd have Spotify running right there in your car now and you'd have a playlist right
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.560]   there.
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.640]   You'd have a connection into a car serving up that data.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:55.760]   These are a Ramadio at RONOMADIO at ARSE Technica was on Twig on Wednesday.
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:58.920]   And these are the pictures he took at the event.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:05.280]   So this is to compete with QNX and other car operating systems.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.280]   Microsoft's auto.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.280]   Right.
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:11.160]   QNX is a big player in basically providing the low level operating systems that then
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:15.200]   these infotainment systems like Sync 3 are built on top of.
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:18.840]   There's Linux in the car as well, which is making a big play to be used.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:20.760]   Arteslas are running on Linux.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:21.760]   Right.
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.040]   And look, there's a big push to make that a lot more sophisticated than it has been in
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.040]   the past.
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.000]   But this is a huge money maker for QNX right now.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.000]   And ultimately, Android wants to be in there as well to have more power down low basically.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.080]   So that really would mean the foundation of those operating systems would be Android based,
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.920]   which is again, Linux based operating system.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.000]   But it's also data for Google, right?
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000]   Absolutely.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.920]   I think you got to figure Google's getting a lot of that information anyway if you're
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.520]   taking your phone with you.
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:53.720]   But ultimately, having that in your car means that they know your destination.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:55.920]   In theory, they could know your rate of speed.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.760]   It remains to be seen exactly what Google would be able to take out the car.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:04.920]   But ultimately, if they're tied within the canvas of the car, they could in theory get
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:08.720]   access to anything they wanted to, even whether your turn signals are on or whether a traction
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:13.280]   control activated, which might mean that they could use that data to then serve ways.
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:17.480]   If you slip on a patch of ice in your car, maybe there's an automatic ways notification
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:20.000]   as posted that would then alert drivers behind you.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.360]   Again, there's a case for positives out of this.
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:27.200]   But if you are concerned about privacy, there's some negative implications too.
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.960]   And of course, some of what's outdated to the government perhaps.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.480]   And I'm not trying to be cynical.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:33.680]   I'm trying to be positive.
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:37.560]   Maybe could use that information to improve infrastructure and roads and the way that they
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:39.560]   couldn't before the way that traffic folks.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.720]   Self-driving vehicles, right?
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:47.280]   One of the problems self-driving vehicles faces humans driving other cars in the same environment.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.680]   That's a mess.
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:53.640]   But maybe if you're driving a car with Android, Google on a motor underneath, at least it
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:57.840]   can communicate with the self-driving car and say, "Look, my human's about to do something
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:59.000]   really stupid."
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.880]   So you might want to just hold back a little bit, that kind of thing.
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:06.400]   Yeah, I think a lot of this is way down the road.
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:10.600]   Right now, this Google system isn't really powerful enough to power all the systems within
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:11.600]   the car.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:15.680]   But definitely building it inside of the dashboard means it does have easier access to a lot of
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:16.680]   that data.
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:20.160]   And that means that it then down the road could certainly have a lot more power and
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:21.360]   a lot more communications.
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:26.960]   And Google has basically always said, "We don't need this standardized vehicle to vehicle
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:30.680]   communication system that the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration has been
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.280]   pushing for decades now.
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:33.280]   We don't need any of that stuff.
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:36.800]   Just give our cars an active data connection and we'll kind of take care of the rest."
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:40.080]   And this is another step in that direction.
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:44.800]   This is another R's technical article from Rana Manioh, the state of the car computer.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.400]   "Forget horsepower!
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:48.440]   We want megahertz."
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:52.280]   I don't think he's speaking for the car companies.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:56.280]   One of the things he pointed out is the car companies have a five-year development cycle.
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:30:04.120]   So many of the car companies that are running Android are running gingerbread, KitKat, really
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:06.280]   old versions of Android.
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:09.080]   So that's another problem for Google.
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:12.520]   Honda is one of the few manufacturers that has Android in the car right now.
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.600]   And yeah, it is quite old.
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.440]   That five-year life cycle is getting better.
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:20.000]   Ford, for example, did the Ford GT in under two years anyway.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.280]   So there are signs for improvement.
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:27.440]   But ultimately, the goal is with a system like Android in the dashboard, at that point
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:31.600]   you could basically do over their updates relatively trivially.
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:34.320]   But of course, that's a whole new thing for automotive manufacturers.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.160]   They're used to writing software once and shipping it and having it be supported for
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:39.520]   ten years as is.
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:43.880]   So the notion that you would need a software update for security reasons in your car, that's
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:47.520]   kind of a whole new world for a lot of manufacturers, something they're just kind of still getting
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:48.520]   their heads around.
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:49.520]   Right.
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:51.080]   Like, wife has the new Volvo, what is it?
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:53.520]   The XC, something, the SUV?
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:54.520]   XU-90.
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:59.240]   And recently, there were some software glitches and they had it, you know, you have to drop
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:00.240]   it off for a day.
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:04.560]   Well, they'll only take care of it and update the software decidedly inconvenient.
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:07.480]   Whereas a Tesla can overnight, you could set your download time.
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:11.040]   You know, when you want the software update to go and I want it 11 o'clock at night and
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:14.920]   it'll be done by 1 a.m. and then you wake up the next morning and it shows you what was
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:16.800]   in the update, you know, right on your screen.
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:19.000]   These are the things we updated.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.520]   And you know, so you have these manufacturers that need you to drop off your car to do a
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:23.520]   software update.
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:25.760]   Oh, I had an Audi for three years, never got it updated.
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:27.440]   The maps just went more and more out of date.
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:31.120]   But my Tesla, what, we would get updates like every few months now.
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:33.800]   It's very, it's, comes, happens all the time.
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:37.360]   By the way, Tesla puts an Easter egg.
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.120]   They're so funny.
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:44.340]   The latest one before when you, so you normally tap if you have autopilot, you tap the stem
[01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:46.360]   twice to turn on autopilot.
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:52.280]   If you tap it four times now, it does the Super Mario rainbow road.
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:58.000]   And for a while it was playing, I think a song from Mario, but now it plays, I want more
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.040]   cowbell from Saturday Night Live.
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:07.080]   And it's like, I don't even see you just wonder what else is in this thing at Christmas.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:08.640]   Did you do on my monolax?
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:14.600]   The door is open and played a manheim steamroller Christmas song and it was flying.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:17.320]   It was, they took it out.
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:18.320]   I was pissed.
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:19.320]   I wanted to keep doing it.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.920]   Oh, I want the Super Mario Brothers stuff.
[01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:21.920]   I got to check for that.
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:22.920]   Yeah.
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:23.920]   You have to have autopilot.
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:29.160]   I don't know what, I don't know, you know, there's a whole, you know, you can find it
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:33.360]   on the web, a whole bunch of, I guess, Tesla Easter eggs.
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:38.760]   So it's interesting because when, when, for instance, Microsoft did Microsoft car, they
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:41.040]   just wanted another market for Windows.
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.120]   It was a Windows CE.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:48.840]   Now you got to feel Google is fighting for more than, in fact, they're probably giving
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:52.120]   it away, like they give away Android because they want the data.
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:55.280]   Yeah, they want that time spent in car for you to be.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:56.280]   No, really.
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:33:02.800]   They really think they want that you to be producing 20 minutes, 30 minutes more data
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:03.800]   and send it.
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:05.800]   They want data from you every minute of your life.
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:06.800]   Yes, right.
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:08.320]   They'll put a sensor in your bed.
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:09.320]   Right.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:12.880]   They'll put a camera in your bathroom actually.
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:17.960]   Isn't that what Amazon's doing with the Amazon look and the Amazon show?
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:23.080]   And by the way, I immediately ordered both because I'm an idiot.
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:24.680]   You got, well, there's two ways to go.
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:30.720]   I mean, and I probably, I'm starting to regret the way I went, but you could either be paranoid
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:32.120]   and careful and tape over.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:37.120]   And I see lots of people taping over their cameras, forgetting that, of course, you have
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:41.160]   a camera conveniently in your pocket with a microphone and a GPS that's always connected
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.160]   to the internet.
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.160]   So who cares about your laptop?
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:44.160]   Those apps are listening.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.160]   They could be.
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:46.160]   In fact, some of them are.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.160]   They are.
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:48.160]   They're listening to the TV.
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:49.160]   Yeah, right.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:50.160]   Exactly.
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:51.160]   They are listening.
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:52.160]   So I just gave up.
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:53.160]   I said, oh, screw it.
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:57.000]   I'm not going to, when I install windows now, I say, do it all.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.320]   Turn it all on, Microsoft.
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:33:59.400]   I got nothing to hide.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.080]   I don't cover up my cameras.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:04.920]   I buy the look in the show from Amazon.
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:09.760]   I feel like I've just given up and like, what is the worst that's going to seriously?
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:12.800]   I ask, smart gentleman of the jury.
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:15.600]   What's the worst that's going to happen?
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:21.480]   When you just also ordered that Amazon stripper pole and you've got the Amazon look next to
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:22.480]   it.
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:23.480]   So what?
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:24.480]   No one was.
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:27.280]   I guess if you're bought in it.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:30.700]   If you're bought in, I mean, I'd like, you know, by the way, I will be naked at Machu
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:32.240]   Picchu about June 8th.
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:35.920]   It's reminding you that the excitement moment.
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:36.920]   Yeah.
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:37.920]   Get out your wide angle.
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:38.920]   Yeah.
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.920]   You're going to need it.
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:41.920]   I don't know.
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:44.600]   I mean, I guess I'm on the same way as you Leo.
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:50.920]   I could go off in the paranoid space, but then you really have to be all in on that.
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:55.400]   And you really have to start, I mean, you turn off location tracking on the phone.
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:56.400]   You tried.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:57.400]   Good luck.
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:58.400]   Good luck.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:01.280]   You won't basically you'll be going back to the 19th century.
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:05.360]   And then also don't leave your house because now there are traffic cameras everywhere.
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.200]   You want to go down the streets in Manhattan?
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:10.320]   Every corner has an NYPD traffic camera on it.
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:11.320]   Try going to London.
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:12.800]   The whole city is covered in cameras.
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.160]   I mean, what are you going to do?
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:15.160]   Should we fight this?
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:17.880]   Should we all be petitioning our member of Congress?
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:18.880]   What are we fighting?
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:19.880]   And why?
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.440]   I'm going to do it.
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:23.760]   We want privacy.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.760]   I want privacy.
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:26.680]   No, if I want, I don't.
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:27.680]   No, we don't.
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:29.480]   No, because I like all the modern conveniences.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.480]   Yeah, totally.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:32.320]   I want Google to remind me you better leave for work.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.320]   Traffic's terrible.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:34.320]   I wanted to do that.
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.920]   There's a couple groups of people who need to care.
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:38.200]   And that's the politicians.
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:39.280]   I think Anthony Wiener.
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.960]   I like that.
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:41.960]   I think that's great.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:44.040]   That's going to weed out the bad apples.
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:45.040]   Yeah, right?
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:46.040]   It will.
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:47.040]   Right.
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:49.040]   Did you see?
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:52.860]   on uh... on silicon valley
[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:56.560]   have you been watching the ladies oh my god this is my shot in front, i love the
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.660]   show
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:02.720]   they develop an app they, they they call it seafood soap, one of the guys living in
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.180]   the house
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:08.320]   actually wants to do twenty eight octopus recipes and he called it c_s_a_
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:09.200]   food
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:13.300]   but then they go to the pitch meeting and uh... and very quickly pivoted
[01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:16.400]   to s_e_e_ you see food you can identify it
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:20.480]   but he was lazy so all he could do is identify hot dogs
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.040]   so
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:24.080]   it identifies hot dogs or
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:26.520]   not hot dogs you take a picture of something
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:30.800]   so h_p_o_ in all their brilliance has developed a
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:33.800]   hot dog app that does exactly that
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:35.400]   you can download
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:37.120]   and encourage you all to do so
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:41.320]   the brand new h_p_o_ hot dog not hot dog app
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:44.400]   i don't want to mention what it ended up being used for
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:47.360]   but let's put it this way periscope what the company
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:52.080]   because it could be useful identifying things that are hot dog like
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:54.960]   but not hot dogs
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.480]   can you believe that
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:57.840]   there's jin yang the
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:59.280]   founder of the
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:01.520]   hot or not dog
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:05.000]   app not hot dog app it's called not hot dog
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000]   or less
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.600]   tv see this is why i want them to know everything about me so that everything
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:17.200]   i do every media event i consume is tailored to my particular
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:19.160]   bizarness wouldn't that be awesome
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:20.800]   everything's personalized
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:23.360]   even my insurance policies
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.600]   our show today
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.240]   actually you know what we do before that
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:29.040]   let's take a look at what you miss this week in a fun week
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:31.560]   and we've made a little movie all about it
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:32.600]   previously
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:35.200]   on twit
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:38.440]   happy three hundred the guy's happy three hundred and
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:41.640]   one every one three hundred that's why i'm all dressed in life

[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.040]   and right
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:36.600]   uh... and then sold it to google and ran the and read the vision for years left
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:40.120]   start running robots and left completely to create a new phone company
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:43.880]   he's been tweeting secret tweets can anyone guess what my colleague way is
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:47.600]   working on first look at that's obviously if you look at whoops
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:48.840]   obviously
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:52.400]   three d camera right he said if you cannot give you signed
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:55.320]   copy of our first product and then he tweeted this
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:56.760]   silhouette
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.920]   well it's obvious
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:02.600]   of the new phone
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:06.480]   would any why would anybody buy a new smartphone i don't care how sexy and
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:10.320]   bezel is it is with a three hundred sixty degree camera off the top
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:11.200]   we just
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:15.200]   that they get eliminated ten is just a few years ago another put that on
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:18.320]   i'm hoping that that's a removal so that you can then put in your pocket and
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:21.280]   then leaving your bag and then forget it somewhere and never see it again
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:23.400]   and i think that's
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:26.480]   yet because you know what this would be is an avalanche of
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:29.880]   really ugly three hundred sixty degree pictures
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:30.680]   mister
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:34.960]   will see uh... you know uh... i do remember this teaser picture that uh...
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:36.600]   he put out earlier
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:38.800]   something big is coming
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:42.600]   and i'm excited to see what it is but i'm a little bit skeptical that the
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:44.980]   world needs another high-end smartphone
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:47.760]   look at the companies that have kind of
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:52.200]   grounded on the rocks of that h_t_c_ pretty much yet gone
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:55.760]   uh... l_g_ i know they they're making beautiful phones but i gotta think they're
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:58.000]   not doing great so he's dropped kind of
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.240]   many of their uh... experience phones are still gonna do the high-end but
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:03.280]   they're not to do the mid-range
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:07.320]   it really is a samsung in apple world
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:09.000]   isn't it
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.440]   yeah and where and to ten points where do you go from here
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:16.560]   how do you do anything that makes people go out and buy you
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:19.440]   and you can only do so much on this device
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:22.600]   it right now but maybe to your point earlier the five years from now we're
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:24.640]   not going to recognize these new it
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:27.360]   things can be totally different but i don't know it's hard for me and i'm
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:30.560]   not terribly bright to wrap my brain about what more do i need from a
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:32.280]   smartphone right now
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:35.840]   well as we mentioned google and apple both say we're gonna put
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.680]   dedicated chips you got a c_p_u_ you got a g_p_u_ we're gonna put it
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:41.640]   a_i_p_u_ or something some sort of
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:43.960]   artificial intelligence chip
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:48.000]   i don't i don't feel like that's the the problem is missing processing power
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.400]   the problem is
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:52.720]   since these there may not be a problem
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:54.800]   yeah they're we're not missing a problem
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:56.600]   there's the market needs have been filled
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:59.480]   yeah well i talked to serie and i mostly i i swear it
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:02.480]   because it doesn't seem to understand anything
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:06.560]   and in when she does she gives me a useless information
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:08.840]   and the majority that's happening in the cloud i mean that was the biggest
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:12.480]   of the phone started to really be able to understand what you're talking about
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:15.680]   is when they stopped doing it on the phone to begin with the you know and
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:18.600]   that was back before data networks were anywhere near as good as they are today
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:19.400]   so
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:22.760]   now that we have all that cloud processing at our disposal and a lot more
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:25.800]   bandwidth than we did you know when serie first came around
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:28.560]   yeah i'm a little bit skeptical that that having something like that on the
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:30.680]   phone is actually going to make this
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:34.800]   that much better so you know maybe three sixty photography is that next big thing
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:37.920]   that will push the smartphone forward and make this
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:40.560]   you know the phone that everybody has to have but but yeah i'm a little bit
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:43.560]   skeptical that that's going to be the thing i but i'm you know i think the fact
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.600]   that they're thinking about that
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:48.320]   you know it's interesting they're trying something different we've certainly
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:52.760]   seen third party dongles will do that for further phones before to at least on
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:56.480]   the iPhone except that work exactly like that they snap over the iPhone and
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:00.160]   they've been i guess use me i don't know how they connect but they but they
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:04.160]   somehow but they look just like that so i don't yeah
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:06.800]   but maybe this means that they're also going to be trying some other interesting
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:08.160]   exciting things
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:11.600]   well google tango that was the idea of tango and it up to now is required
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:14.720]   giant phones that would map the space you're in i don't i never
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:19.200]   got that one either here's a we've already seen the face recognition on
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:24.080]   samsung's galaxy s eight phone uh cracked actually was cracked at the
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:29.280]   event when one of the publications brought up took a picture of himself
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:34.800]   on his existing phone and showed it to the samsung galaxy s eight and it unlocked
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:38.320]   uh now it turns out the iris recognition system
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:42.720]   is also hackable the chaos computer club in germany
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:46.320]   kind of one of the classic yeah the old ones yeah the ccc
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:49.760]   say what that's really simple we just take a picture and we don't need it doesn't
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:56.320]   even have to be a very good picture uh of uh of your iris with a with a
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:01.440]   camera here i'll mute the sound so you can see he's about 16 feet away but he
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:05.360]   has a zoom lens on his point and shoot doesn't have to get look how big the
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:08.960]   the face isn't even that big
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:12.720]   well he's not even a killer dslr anything no no it's just a crappy little point
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:15.840]   and shoot he's got a picture they now print out
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:20.160]   the picture of the of the eyeball they blow it up and print it out
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:24.240]   then in order to trick the samsung galaxy s eight
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.480]   they have to make it look spherical so they they print it out at life size and
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:34.480]   then they put a contact lens on top of it to make it look like an eyeball
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:40.240]   the contact lens distorts the picture to make it round i'll see it you'll see
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:44.720]   it in just a second so he's got his iris now registered into that phone
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:50.240]   and now he's going to unlock it using a just proving that he can do it now he
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:56.000]   takes a contact lens puts it i love the kia i just love these guys the ks
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.080]   computer club puts it on top of the picture
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:06.880]   and then uses the picture holds it up and boom the phones unlocked that was easy
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:12.880]   so i just a word of warning if you're uh depending on iris right i thought we
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:16.480]   were told iris recognition was the best of the bunch better than fingerprint
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:19.840]   better than face no
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:25.360]   uh wanna cry is probably not the end of the line excellent article in the
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:29.840]   atlantic uh today from bruce snire one of my favorite security guys the schnire
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:34.480]   blog is you know really great he talks in this article about the shadow
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:38.480]   brokers this is the hacker group that dumped
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:42.880]   embarrass the nsa by dumping a lot of exploits onto the internet that's
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:47.680]   where wanna cry's magic capability of spreading over your local area that
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:50.400]   came from came from the nsa and came from this
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:54.000]   shadow brokers dump the shadow brokers now say
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.280]   oh we're not done yet in fact we're thinking of doing a dump of the month
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:02.240]   club because apparently they have quite a few more exploits
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:09.360]   from the nsa and they don't seem to care much about uh publicizing them
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:13.680]   if this isn't an argument against stockpiling zero days i i don't know what
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:17.200]   is well that's an interesting question because don't you think that
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:21.600]   intelligence agencies also want you know need hacking tools to yeah
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:25.120]   hacking tools are one thing but stockpiling we have a story that kind of
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:30.000]   picks apart the reason the real nuance reasons why coming out on june first
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:35.760]   but the basics are easy to understand and that is if there are zero-day
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:39.520]   exploits within a system hacking tools are something different
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:43.280]   you have to give microsoft and other companies the ability to patch these
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:48.400]   holes if you stockpile them this will happen but if you will happen but i mean
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:52.160]   i'm playing devil's yeah yeah please bring it if you if you
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:56.560]   if the nsa and their hackers are working hard and they find oh this is great
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:01.760]   we can use smb one to spread you know i and by the way they wouldn't do it
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:04.880]   with the with encryption you know ransomware they would use it to spread
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:09.760]   a eavesdropping tool onto all of the computers in the russian embassy yes
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:13.520]   wouldn't they want to hold on to that why if they tell microsoft they can't use
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:17.360]   it and there is solid there is solid evidence you know we are six years
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:21.680]   now seven years past stuxnet but there's solid evidence that stuxnet put the
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:25.120]   iranian nuclear program backed by at least three years which is what we needed
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:28.880]   that was a hack negotiation their centrifuge so they couldn't
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:33.120]   enrich uranium so they couldn't build a nuke and and that helped us negotiate
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:36.880]   and it targeted seaman's industrial control systems scott us
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:42.480]   um yes scott is yep right and so i i understand that argument and i really
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:46.480]   empathize with people within the agency and within the nsa
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:52.720]   however i don't think any of that excuses stockpiling vulnerabilities that allow
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:51:00.720]   massive attacks like this to occur you guys agree
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:05.200]   yeah it's the top one because i think look we all want to put
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:08.400]   yeah it is we want the intelligence agencies to do their job
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:13.040]   we want them to protect us from terrorism we want them to do espionage as needed
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:16.560]   to protect us from foreign powers who are by the way
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:21.920]   you without any trepidation stockpiling yes and smiling on us i don't think
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:26.000]   the f s b in russia is having any debate at all about whether they should reveal
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:31.760]   these vulnerabilities so should don't we now there was under obama back in
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:35.680]   2008 something created called the vulnerabilities equity process and the
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:39.440]   theory was all the stakeholders come to the table
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:42.880]   and they and they actually had it was actually quite interesting a series of
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:47.920]   questions that they needed to ask about this vulnerability to determine
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:54.560]   whether the nsa should be allowed to keep it or the cia or the fbi
[01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:59.840]   uh... or should be required to turn it over let me see if i can find the
[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:03.920]   questions that they ask this is from epic.org the electronic privacy
[01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:07.280]   information center they have a lot of information about this
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:13.120]   vep and it's it's been around as i said since 2008 the questions
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:17.920]   seemed completely reasonable for instance how much is the vulnerable system in
[01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:21.520]   this case it would want to cry case it would have been windows
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:24.880]   used in the core internet infrastructure
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:28.400]   and other critical infrastructure systems in the u_s economy
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:33.280]   or in national security systems in other words what's the danger
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:38.880]   does the vulnerability if left unpatched impose significant risk how much harm
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:43.360]   could an adversary nation do with or a criminal group do with knowledge
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:47.280]   of this vulnerability how likely is it we would know
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:51.520]   if someone else was explaining it how badly do we need the intelligence
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:54.800]   this is a really important one the one the nsa's going to argue
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:58.400]   how badly do we need the intelligence we think we can get
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:01.680]   from exploiting the vulnerable what yes this is a cost
[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:04.880]   benefit analysis right the benefit would be well what would we get
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:08.800]   are there and this is good to are there other ways we can get it
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:12.240]   could we let's say utilize the vulnerability for a short period and then
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:13.440]   disclose it
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:16.800]   how likely is it that somebody else will discover it
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:20.400]   can it be patched or mitigated in other words if we tell michael soft can they
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:21.920]   fix it
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:26.320]   the problem is this process although it exists doesn't seem to have been used
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:29.760]   much i and
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:34.480]   there's liability that now it affects people at at tremendous scale
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:38.800]   so when you have the agency working ten years ago fifteen years ago
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:42.400]   the the vulnerability of intelligence leagues
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:44.320]   you can mitigate the damage
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:48.400]   if we look at what's happening with i_o_t_ and what we expect to see in the
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:50.160]   next five to ten years
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:54.880]   plus all of these really kind of poorly made firmware that's on all these i_o_t_
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:58.320]   devices right so the scale of damage
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:01.560]   well look at the morai baht yeah precisely
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:05.800]   and because this if you go to a pedestrian normal person on the street
[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:06.840]   you say
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:09.400]   hey tell me about the zero days
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:12.040]   yeah what are you talking about but but but there's a point because the
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:12.980]   morai
[01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:17.320]   about probably wouldn't it was useful in creating a deny distributed nylon
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:18.520]   service botnet
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:20.920]   but probably would not have been useful
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:24.920]   in fine you know in tarrin targeted intelligence gathering no which is what
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:26.360]   the n_s_a_ is up to
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:30.600]   so if they had discovered morai that one under the vulnerability equities
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:32.200]   process would have been
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:34.920]   revealed and and fixed
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:38.600]   but they might keep something that allows them to say hack your smart tv
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:39.320]   because
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:42.520]   well we can you know we can get at you know ambassador kiss leah we can we
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:44.040]   can see what he's up to
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:47.000]   by spying on through samsung
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.120]   i don't think you know i so
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:51.640]   i'm torn on this one
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:55.320]   by the way there's a move in congress to make this law this was just merely an
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:59.240]   interagency agreement well that is there's a move in congress to actually in
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:01.560]   trying this in law
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:03.640]   that seems like a good step forward to it
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:07.960]   at least you need a process you have those questions
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:11.240]   now we talked about this on tuesday and uh... security now steve kipson
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:12.280]   poopooed
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:13.640]   the idea of a law he says
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:14.480]   this is never
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:17.080]   stock and make it and it's a good come to the table every time saying no we need
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:17.520]   it
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:19.880]   okay thanks by
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:22.360]   that's not going to be a warrant
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:25.560]   this is like i think i mean i look at the fiza court even the fiza court looks
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:29.080]   like a rubber stamp this would be ten times worse in technology as we
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:30.280]   all know
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:32.360]   is always constrained by laws
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:35.640]   yeah right right so you could you can make a law it's not going to stop
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:38.760]   it's a different right it doesn't change anything and certainly won't stop our
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:42.360]   our adversaries yeah
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:45.720]   uh... i'm gonna be traveling out of the country i hope that i will be able to
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:47.800]   bring my laptop on the plane
[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:49.000]   unknown
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.440]   hahahaha
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:53.960]   just come back from european and i was dreading the whole time i was there
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:57.480]   they're gonna pass this new regulation was there
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:01.480]   and be exactly i do like what pet one password has done and i hope others
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:02.680]   will do this
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:05.720]   they've created this is a one password is a very popular password vault
[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:07.800]   something called travel mode you will
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:10.760]   you indicate on your passwords which ones
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:14.680]   you want to keep while you're traveling everything else will be deleted
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:18.200]   before you get off the plane you press the travel mode button that's brilliant
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:21.720]   did nobody can tell you've done that it doesn't you know it doesn't matter
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:25.080]   show that and then when you get home you just re-synch and all your passwords
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:28.840]   are back so i'm going to ukraine uh... in about a week and a half don't bring
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:31.080]   any electronics right well first of all
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:35.160]   tim i'm definitely not bringing a laptop and this this our number one concern
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:38.120]   is uh... fishing of those around us
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:42.920]   and the number two concern is what happens to any device i have and the
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:46.280]   password on it imagine you're coming back to the ukraine customs and border
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:49.320]   patrol gonna be looking at you saying can i give me your phone right give me
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:52.360]   your phone and and i believe in the work that customs
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:57.480]   does and so i not the ukraine in customs but the american customs i will
[01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:02.280]   happily give them my device but i don't want my passwords are
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:06.520]   where's my uh... john do you know where my steampunk laptop is
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:09.960]   i'll show you the laptop i'm going to be reporting it
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:13.560]   no actually i paid a lot of money for it uh the the guy who used to build these
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:16.120]   build all sorts of steampunk stuff he passed away
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:18.520]   but i thought somebody the chairman saying i think they're absolutely right
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:21.640]   bring the steampunk laptop that way if the border patrol keeps it
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:24.040]   it's like fine
[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:27.480]   the only problem with it it weighs about 80 pounds yes
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:32.920]   you're gonna look out the window as as those guys are throwing your bags into
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:36.680]   the carway it's it's yeah you're like bringing it
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:41.320]   that's what i'm scared about what is the chance that this laptop travel ban will
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:45.880]   uh it will will happen it i are they just floating this is a balloon or is
[01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:48.680]   are they seriously considering i understand the reason why we know because
[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:52.520]   donald trump uh told the russians in the in the oval office
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:56.040]   oh yeah we're worried because we got an israeli intelligence that there's a
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:00.280]   people are putting bombs and laptops are planning on that so i understand that
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:03.160]   yeah by the way they must have really thrilled the israelis when he did that
[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:08.600]   uh but so i so but that would make sense in in fact i kind of assumed that
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:11.320]   after all this travel talking about these bands
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:14.920]   on laptops that must be what they got some intelligence is said there's a
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:18.440]   plan afoot i you know i had a problem is that coming
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:21.960]   that took a jerk off it's gonna oh i was gonna say i i had a feeling this was
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:24.440]   coming if we had to take our shoes off
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:28.440]   i mean batteries inside of a laptop i mean it
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:33.400]   you know in this age of cyber warfare what what is a terrorist i did
[01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:37.960]   some sort of advanced organization like isis we know how we know how savvy they've
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:43.160]   been um you know online what they've been able to do uh
[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:47.480]   to recruit people i mean using using laptops was not that far afield for
[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:51.720]   them so um is it possible i'm gonna be gone
[01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:55.160]   june fifth through the 18th at sometime in the middle of my trip they're gonna
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:58.360]   say oh yeah by the way don't bring that lee your death check look we'd have to
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:01.000]   put it in check luggage it's not like i'd have to give it up
[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.000]   um but god how boring to be on a 12-hour flight
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:08.200]   it's not just laptops it's also it's everything but your phone kindles
[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:12.680]   yeah you can't bring your kindle right what how much how much devastating how
[01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:16.120]   much bomb could you put in a kindle this one right down here
[01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:20.680]   it's not this isn't my steampunk laptop but i think i might bring this one on the
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:25.160]   trip because if they keep it it will do it do it
[01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:28.280]   what are you funny only probably if they said
[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:31.080]   this is like uh what is this is old mac
[01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:35.240]   luggable the only problem is if they said can you turn that on i don't think i
[01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:38.680]   could this is a power book 145 look at that track ball
[01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:42.360]   man that was state of the art that might have been the first laptop i had
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:45.880]   and the best beautiful look at the size of that thing
[01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:50.360]   that's pretty expensive you know what you made them we should all revolt and
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:52.120]   all bring typewriters
[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:55.960]   on flights with really loud character
[01:59:55.960 --> 02:00:00.600]   electric and this yeah so everyone on the flight is there on their tray tables
[02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:04.520]   pounding away oh man tom hanks has a typewriter app if
[02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:09.800]   you've seen that app yeah yeah yeah it's called hanks writer hanks right h-a-n-x
[02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:14.840]   uh writer and it's really loud when you use it on your ipad
[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:19.160]   uh he's got they released three new uh typewriters for it including a
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:22.920]   selectric which is really good unfortunately i was very disappointed
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:27.160]   because the selectric while it has three different font typeface balls you
[02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:31.000]   know how the selectrics have those balls it doesn't have the speechwriter ball
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:34.440]   which i really like that was really giant text
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:38.760]   very silly app uh so you think they're gonna you think
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:41.400]   clinton that with all it's all likelihood they're gonna they're gonna do
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:46.200]   that i don't know i just felt like it was only a matter of time like this new
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:51.080]   utopia i mean think about it right we now we have to take off our shoes
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:54.040]   you asked how much bomb can you really fit in a kindle i mean
[02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:57.960]   how much bomb can you really fit in the soul of there was that guy who tried to
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:00.440]   light his shoes on fire remember i sure did
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:03.320]   uh uh whatever is there isn't a good bomb in a kindle
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:07.960]   can you yeah really yeah how do you know that
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:11.560]   well we're in kindle a kindle like a paper white thing
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:15.880]   one of my sources in kyrow we were teaching encryption to to Sudanese
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:19.640]   guys and we brought them from from different parts of Sudan up to kyrow
[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:22.440]   and we taught them how to use encryption on a mobile device so they can remember
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:25.800]   you were doing that it's very cool yeah so so one of my sources and this is i
[02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:30.040]   have a story it's been vetted like i'm not making this up but he was like
[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:35.960]   i'm so poor i'm going to either make bombs for isos or sell my kidney and
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:39.080]   so i'm sitting there with my meringues interviewing him and we vetted him
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:43.560]   through the u_n_ his story checks out he he was
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:47.000]   kidnapped when he was young in Sudan and
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.800]   taught how to make bombs and taught how to make
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:54.120]   very small very effective bombs that will fit inside electronic devices
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:58.920]   like c3 what would you use to uh i don't you know i didn't ask him as tactics
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:02.360]   actually though if you think about it if and this is why i guess if you check
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:05.640]   it they're not as worried if you're sitting in the
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:09.880]   cabin and you're right next to the wall you can put that kindle bomb on the wall
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:13.560]   all you have to do is blow a small hole yeah you just got to depressurize it
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:19.000]   and okay i take it back in fact please don't carry any devices on the plane
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.480]   please i don't i don't want to spy books and magazines couldn't you i mean a
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:25.880]   smartphone couldn't isn't that big enough you could make a
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:30.520]   oh man yeah i mean galaxy note seven yes
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:35.320]   don't bring that on the plane oh i don't write that on the plane
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:39.080]   shh jean brilliant all right well we're gonna wrap this up in a minute
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:43.240]   uh got a bunch more stories i want to talk to you guys about uh but but
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:46.520]   first a word from blue apron i made blue apron last night it was the best
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:51.080]   thing it was so good what is and my mouth waters when i do
[02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:54.040]   these ads it makes me so hungry blue apron

[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:08.600]   tonight we're doing blackened pork i can't wait
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:14.840]   last night we made a it's from nashville a spicy chicken kind of fried chicken
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:18.120]   i made mashed potatoes and i always in mash potatoes i used to use cream and
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:21.560]   butter and they did it with uh from ash block and butter and it was
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:26.520]   so good and then the green beans i sauteed the green beans up
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:30.200]   chopped up a shallot and then i put they had a little bottle
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:32.920]   it comes with a little bottle of vinegar put a little vinegar in there
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:36.600]   sauteed the green beans put them in the shallot vinegar mixture they oh my god
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:41.480]   it was your mouth the house smells so good in your mouth and it took me
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:45.400]   half an hour it is this gourmet meal and here's the best part i didn't have to
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:50.040]   buy one thing everything i needed including half a cup of milk
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:54.360]   in this little box everything i needed to make this amazing recipe now we have
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:58.200]   blue apron for two although you know partly that's because our son doesn't
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:02.120]   like fancy food and he just wants plain pasta you know or rice
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:05.400]   but the truth is there's enough in this meal that we can give him some and he
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:08.600]   actually really enjoys it sometimes it's a great way to introduce your kids
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:12.840]   to new flavors new tastes and they have a family plan
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:15.720]   which has more kid-friendly ingredients look at that
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:18.680]   what is that chicken schnitzel oh that looks good
[02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:22.120]   with fingerling potatoes oh what is that
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:26.120]   roll back up i want to see the recipe and uh marinated
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:30.200]   napa cabbage that's like coleslaw oh my god
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:32.920]   you can make this and the thing is once you've done it they don't repeat recipes
[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:35.480]   more than once a year so you're not going to get that recipe chosen you do get
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:38.840]   to choose that it's all online you choose what you want in the box
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:41.560]   you choose when you want delivery it's not subscription so you get it whenever
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:44.600]   you feel like it uh you get you see exactly the right
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:47.480]   ingredients everything's fresh even the meat the fish
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:51.800]   never frozen it's a refrigerated box uh and once you've made it
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:54.760]   you now know how to make it and you can go to the store and you can buy the
[02:04:54.760 --> 02:04:57.640]   ingredients and so it's like it's like a cooking school in a box
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:04:59.560]   actually i think that's why they call it blue apron
[02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:03.080]   because if you go to the cord on blue in paris
[02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:06.920]   the apprentice chefs wear blue little blue aprons and i think that's where
[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:10.680]   they got the name the box has a blue apron on everything like that
[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:14.280]   look at the recipes baked spinach and egg flatbread with sauteed asparagus
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:17.080]   and lemon aioli see that's vegetarian they have vegetarian meals
[02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:21.000]   they've you know they can assuit your needs you never get anything you didn't
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.800]   order and if and and so you totally customize it there's no weekly
[02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:28.600]   commitment their freshness guarantee promises
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:31.240]   every ingredient your delivery arrives ready to cook

[02:05:55.560 --> 02:06:00.680]   so you have to like fight over it blue apron.com/twit
[02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:05.960]   did you see this article uh tim uh tech analyst split tesla analyst split
[02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:09.000]   there's a bet i guess some people think tesla is the greatest thing since
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:13.720]   sliced bread and some people think it's gonna it's over the stock is over
[02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:15.880]   has been up let me stop bloomberg right here
[02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:20.680]   they say it comes down to whether you're a tech guy or a car guy
[02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:24.360]   right me being a tech and a car guy obviously i think the truth is somewhere
[02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:29.000]   in between uh the two extremes there but yeah i i think from a tech perspective
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.840]   it's pretty easy to overlook a lot of the complexities of developing a car
[02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:36.120]   just like you know i think tesla and you know on musk would admit
[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:38.360]   they did exactly that when they were launching their first cars you know it
[02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:41.720]   took a long time to bring the model less to market took a long time to bring the
[02:06:41.720 --> 02:06:45.160]   model x to market they're learning they're getting better but
[02:06:45.160 --> 02:06:50.200]   the real question right now in my eye is can tesla continue to be quicker at
[02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:54.200]   innovating than a company like like vose fag i like porsche like outy
[02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:57.160]   um can they be those guys consistently they've done very well i mean look
[02:06:57.160 --> 02:06:59.640]   they've done great you can't deny they've done great
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:02.200]   uh and they've ramped up and they're producing the model three and it looks
[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:04.680]   like they're going to get to whatever their goal is for
[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:07.960]   you know year what it was at a eighty thousand vehicles a year
[02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:11.960]   but you're saying okay fine now here come the big boys
[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:16.760]   right exactly and porsche is investing hundreds of millions of dollars into
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:21.000]   battery facilities into the basically the groundwork that they need to make
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:24.840]   a killer e_v_ uh and you know that's going to be a really good car when that
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:28.520]   comes out and if they can make a car that's better than the model s that cost
[02:07:28.520 --> 02:07:31.800]   less than the model s uh and from a brand like porsche
[02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:35.400]   i mean are people really going to continue to support tesla right now
[02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:38.840]   tesla's got a unique proposition you know they make a really fast really
[02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:43.560]   nice looking e_v_ um when everybody has a really nice really fast looking e_v_
[02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:46.680]   and you can buy one at any dealership just down the road and
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:49.560]   have a warranty that you trust and you know all the other things that come
[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:52.120]   along with buying from a major manufacturer that you're
[02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:55.000]   familiar with uh will tesla continue to have this
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.600]   this position and and that's you know that i think is the big question and
[02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:02.040]   ultimately i don't think anybody really knows the answer to that right now
[02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:06.680]   so but that's for investors for people buying a car would you say
[02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:11.880]   did i make a mistake buying a tesla well uh we talked about this before i'm a
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:15.480]   little bit skeptical of the model x uh reliability in the long run but no i
[02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:18.760]   think i think it's really great cars yeah i'm i'm different
[02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:22.280]   just going doors fall or falcoing whatever they call them fall off all
[02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:24.520]   then you know i'll be the first to tell you and it's
[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:27.400]   it's like tesla makes a car that drives like nothing else in the road right now
[02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:30.920]   i love my tesla it's fantastic and once you drive an electric car you don't
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:34.360]   really ever want to go back to a gas vehicle right
[02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:37.480]   right yeah i'm just going to go ahead to the clean
[02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:40.440]   was i say when you can go like zero to sixty in like three and a half seconds
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:43.720]   you're kind of it makes my head hurt though i don't do it anymore because if
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:47.560]   you like my brain hit the back of my skull it's like i don't want to
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:51.160]   hurt but with some of the upgrade what i was going to say about um you know
[02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:54.760]   and they sort of i don't know if it's sort of an apple approach it seems like
[02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:58.040]   it is but sort of an and tim you can speak way more intelligently on this than i
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:02.040]   can but the sort of apple approach to upgrades and fixes and
[02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:04.840]   it's sort of the wink wink nudge nudge hey if you have a problem with this
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:08.120]   we we just swap everything out this is a problem with the battery four years
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:11.320]   from now and we just yank it out of the floorboards and put a brand new one in
[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:14.680]   there for you there's not a lot of moving parts if we have any problems we check
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:18.200]   it once a year we fix anything i know i haven't brought my car there's no
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:22.040]   oil to change or anything yeah there's no engine that's one of the hidden
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:25.800]   things one hidden values of owning an EV is the lack of maintenance you know
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:29.080]   there's really nothing that you need to do about it is to replace the you know
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:31.640]   the washer fluid every now and again rotate your tires and you're pretty much
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:34.200]   good go yeah
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:39.240]   patreon what a success story and now they say uh now i think this is probably
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:42.920]   because they're going to go for either more investment or maybe even an IPO
[02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:47.240]   i don't know but they say they put out the word they now have
[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:53.400]   a million paying patrons one million they have that's doubled in a year
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:57.400]   the number of active creators on patreon 50 000 this is the site where
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:02.520]   and i and i actually support a number of podcasts and uh my linux distribution
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:05.480]   that i like i actually give the guy five bucks a month
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:10.040]   um it really is a great way for creators to get kind of patronized
[02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:14.600]   subsidized by patrons they are they are on track to pay out
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:18.360]   unbelievably a hundred fifty million dollars to creators
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:23.240]   this year that's just amazing now that doesn't mean they're
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:26.680]   amazingly profitable because they take a five percent cut so a little math will
[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:29.880]   tell you that seven and a half million dollars in revenue
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:32.520]   for patreon so they're kind of a small company
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:36.040]   but uh some congratulations i think in order
[02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:40.520]   uh for uh patreon and the success of patreon it's it's really kind of
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:44.920]   impressive and the success they enabled i i think this is also one of the
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:48.840]   blown opportunities of medium you know everybody thought for a while medium
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:52.280]   recently launched their subscription program for getting yogg's law
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:56.040]   which way does money flow in publishing towards the creator oh interesting
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:00.120]   medium wants you to pay them yeah to curate stories that other people have
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:02.520]   created there are bloggers on patreon aren't there
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:08.840]   yeah patreon takes a percentage of of revenue generated by creators
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:12.440]   so this is a huge missed opportunity by your absolutely right
[02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:16.920]   medium right it's yogg's law it's like all money in publishing should always
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:21.160]   flow towards a creator your agent takes it cut and the publisher takes it cut
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:27.720]   but in mediums case they wanted us to pay them instead of paying the creator
[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:31.960]   i'm way more loyal to a writer to somebody who creates software for
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:36.280]   living i'm way more loyal to those things than i am to
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:41.480]   uh some startup that's already well funded by the way i love i never heard
[02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:44.760]   it before but i am in love with yogg's law as a creator
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:49.320]   right right i think that's a good law i'd like to make that a lot
[02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:53.720]   robot police in Dubai right now they don't do much except salute and
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:58.840]   answer questions but uh could it be robocop Dubai says
[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:03.240]   that uh they want 25 percent of their police force to be robotic by the year
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:12.040]   2030 is this just a gimmick hello citizen
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:16.600]   i'll definitely see some limited security roles being
[02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:21.320]   easily done by then you know if it's just someone on patrol taking a report
[02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:25.080]   you know monitoring suspects that kind of thing that i think is easy enough to do
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:27.480]   and that's probably a pretty substantial part of of
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:30.680]   you know a day-to-day workforce of a security officer so
[02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:33.960]   that kind of thing i think sounds realistic but ultimately you know
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:37.640]   the idea of like a district nine style digital soldier walking down the street
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:40.760]   with a gun on their hip i think i think we might be able to further down the road
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:43.480]   in 2025 to get that thing oh we go ahead
[02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:48.040]   plane obviously we also age of Ultron you know you know how that goes
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:51.400]   you make that mistake i can see this being like metermaids
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:54.760]   you gotta have a kill switch if you're gonna make a robotic cop there has to be
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:57.320]   a plug you can remove you know unplugging plug right
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:01.160]   there's you know it's just obvious all you have to do is see
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:04.920]   robo cop and you know you need a way to unplug the thing that's all
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:09.480]   and we'll wrap up with a farewell to uh the dean of tech journalism walt
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:12.680]   mossberg's last column appeared in recode
[02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:17.720]   on may 25th uh he's been doing this
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:22.440]   longer than anybody except me he started in 1991 right about when i started
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:26.680]   doing a tech talk radio although i'd been writing about tech since the late
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:30.760]   70s long time to be writing first in the wall street
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:34.680]   journaling left the journal and started recode here's his first column
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:38.360]   and you know you could probably you know say the same thing again personal
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:40.920]   computers he wrote are just too hard to use
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:44.920]   and it isn't your fault the computer industry boasts its products can help
[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:49.160]   everyone be more productive maybe so but many people can't afford the time
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:51.720]   and money needed to get the most out of
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:58.920]   pcs so walt well done i hope i can retire someday too
[02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:03.240]   but meantime we'll stick around and fill the gap left by
[02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:06.520]   walt mossberg hey you guys are great thank you so much for being here
