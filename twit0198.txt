[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   That is Tom Merritt from Buzz out loud.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   He made his way up to the TWIT cottage with his lovely wife Elaine,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   and it's great to see you both. Thanks for making it up here.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Hey, thanks for having me. It's lovely up here.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   You're getting close to your 1,000th BOL.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Yeah, just a couple of weeks away.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Yay!
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Very exciting.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And you're going to be on.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Well, me and a lot of other people, I guess.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Yeah, but I mean, there's like a ton of folks, right?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   We're going to have Scott Johnson. We're going to have Remy.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   We're going to have listeners.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Remy Martin?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   No, Remy is one of our listeners.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   We're going to have a ton of folks.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   It's going to be an extravaganza.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   What day is it?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Thursday, June 18th.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Awesome.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   We're actually doing two shows tomorrow to make sure it's on Thursday.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Why would that--I don't understand.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Because CNET does a regular third Thursday of the week party,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   and we wanted to like siphon off of it.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I now do understand.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   You want to get everybody who's in the studio.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Totally.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Also here, you heard her laugh, Denise Howell,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   the lovely and talented host of our This Week in Law show.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And just a wonderful person in general.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   She's the author of the Blogarhythms column at ZDNet.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   You always get me confused with Doug Kaye.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   He writes blogarhythms.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I write logarhythms.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I added a B.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And bag and baggage.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   That is confusing.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And bag and baggage.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   And we're so glad to have you, Denise.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It's good to have you on the show.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I'm sorry I'm saying you're Tom Merritt.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I'm working on that right now.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   That's all right.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   She's a much better picture.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I actually, yeah, she's got a good shot there.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   This is nice.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   She took a little time off from her Sunday afternoon to be with us.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Also, you saw Maverick, Jason Calacanis.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Hey, how's everybody doing?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   From Mahalo.com.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Mahalo.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And we've got one newbie in the bunch,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   and that's Jeff Canata from the Totally Rad Show.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Hey, Jeff.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Hey.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   It's awesome to be here with all these tech luminaries.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I'm in awe.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   These people that I've been following for so long.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   It's awesome.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Jeff is just back from E3,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   so I trust you will have many things to say--
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Yes.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   --about E3.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   You saw The Beatles, for one thing.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I did.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And Steven Spielberg, all in the span of ten minutes.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   That's kind of amazing.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   That's a big day.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Wow.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   So we'll talk a little bit about E3 and about Microsoft's Natal.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   The worst name, okay?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Can I say it?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   The worst name for a project.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I think they're saying Natal, actually.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Yeah, but it's spelled Natal.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Did you hear about the port for Palm?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   The what?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   The prenatal.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   You should have saved that for Buzz Aloud.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   So the Palm Pre did come out yesterday,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   and I am holding in my hands, and I'm very happy to say,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   loving the Palm Pre.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And the reason I'm happy to say is because this--
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I mean, we've got to agree, it's the last gasp for Palm, right?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Can I ask you a question about that Palm Pre?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Screw you, Jason Katacanis.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I was going to ask it first.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Screw you.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Go ahead.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Go ahead, Jason, please.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   No, I have no question about it, actually.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   It's fucking dope.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Who'd shitbox in the PR department to get it?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   No, this is--
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   and all right, I think it's fair to ask where I got this.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And I tell you, a lot of people were not able to get it
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   at the Sprint store or Best Buy.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   A lot of them sold out.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Only had like two or three per store, right?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Two or three per Best Buy, and some stores--
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Sprint stores 25 to 60 or 70,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   but most of the stores I think sold out on Saturday.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And I understand more will come in on Monday.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   But, you know, it's not an Apple reaction.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   They're not the lines, not the press.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   They were lines, but they were short lines.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   However, I got to say, having played with it--
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   and I think you'll all have a chance to play with it at some point.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   In fact, here, let me pass it off to you, Tom.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Sure.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   This is an elegant device.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   If the Apple iPhone didn't exist,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   people would be just raving, raving about this thing.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I mean, they'd be going crazy.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   It's beautiful.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   The multitasking, the screen, the touch, it's just incredible.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   I think the iPhone still beats it
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   because of the range of applications
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   and just the maturity of the platform.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   But this is a really strong effort from Palm.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   I'm really impressed.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   I really like it.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Are you going to get one, Jason?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   What do you use?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   You use a BlackBerry or an iPhone?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I have both.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I have both.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And, yeah, see, I use the BlackBerry because of the keyboard.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   But I have to say, the pre-keyboard, it's okay.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   It's very small.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   I think I'm more accurate with the Apple keyboard
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   because the pre, unaccountably, has no type-ahead prediction.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   It doesn't even do what the BlackBerry does.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   So, like, the BlackBerry, when you get to the end of the sentence,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   the Apple iPhone, too,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   it puts a period at the end of the sentence
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   when you hit space twice and then starts a new--
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   this doesn't even do that.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   What I want is a phone that has the size of the iPhone screen
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   with the keyboard of the BlackBerry.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I don't mind if it's a little taller than a normal phone.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   When somebody makes that,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I think they'll have reached the singularity of phones.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I like the size of this.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I like the feel of it in my pocket.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   I think it's okay for it's this small.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   It's the same resolution as the iPhone, just a smaller screen.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   All I want from a phone is one that I can use from inside my own home.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   [laughter]
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I think there should be a--
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   When you go shopping for a phone or a phone service,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   you should be able to take the phone to your house
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   and see if you can make a phone call.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Are you having trouble?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Who's your carrier?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I have an iPhone, so I'm on AT&T.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And you can't make a call out of your house?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I have to walk two blocks to make a telephone call.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   That's pathetic.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   I can't make a call from AT&T in my office suddenly.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Within the past four or five months,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   I have to walk outside my office door into the common area.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Then I get a signal.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   You know, Sprint-- people hate Sprint,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   but Sprint has a very good data network.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   It works fine for me.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Verizon I use for data on the laptop.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Verizon's going to get this phone.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   We already know.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   That's what I'm waiting for.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Yeah, and the only question is how soon.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   I guess the question to ask is, OK,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   so Pre's going to get the weekend coverage.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   What happens Monday?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Does Apple come back and just knock the ball out of the park?
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   That's a lot.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   With what?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I mean--
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   With what?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Well, I mean, there's this rumor of the tablet side.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   You know, I don't think that's going to happen Monday.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   I think that's going to-- in fact,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   a number of people have said, and I think maybe they're right,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   that this is going to be held off to later in June.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   This will be the Steve Jobs comeback keynote
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   that won't be at WWDC.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   At WWDC, they'll say iPhone 3.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   They'll say Snow Leopard.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   They'll give-- you know, it's a developer conference,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   and then they'll save the big hardware announcement
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   for a Steve Jobs keynote later in the month.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Does that--
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   You think they'll save the iPhone hardware announcement for later?
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Maybe.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Yeah?
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   It's possible.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   I hadn't thought about that.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Has Palm put the pressure on them?
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   And does this now mean that they have to come out with it?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Yeah, because I think everybody-- there'll be an uproar
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   if Apple suddenly goes to their keynote
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   and doesn't announce the new iPhone.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Even the conservative columnist, Kent German at CNET,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   is always like, "Well, I don't know."
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   He's like, "Yeah, there's going to be a hardware announcement."
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   If they didn't, I think they would just rock people.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   So what makes--
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   what announcement does Apple have to make to eclipse the pre?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   What do they have to say?
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I don't think they have to do much.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   I think they just have to have cut and paste,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   which we already know is there.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   I mean, it's little things like that,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   and video, and better battery life.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   That's enough to make people go, "Well..."
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Pre-battery life, by the way, is awful.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I'll go ahead and go to the iPhone.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Yeah, the battery life on that's horrible.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   It's terrible.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   If you're already a Sprint customer, though,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   this is a very good choice, I think,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   if you don't want to change to 8-bit.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   I think that's what's good for--
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   it may be better for Sprint than it is for Palm.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Did you see this? This is the inductive charger.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   That's so cool.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   You have to buy that separate, though.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Yeah, $70.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   But it's got gecko grease on it.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And it sticks to anything.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Almost anything.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Hey-oh!
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Never mind.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Good thing it's a review unit.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   I really think that if they just say--
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Screw you, Palm!
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Just trying that out.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Just trying that out for size.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   If they do video on the iPhone,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   is that a hardware update or a software update?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Well, they can do some with a software update,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   'cause I have jailbroken iPhones
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   that can do all kinds of video.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   I have Quick on the iPhone,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   and it's very low frame rate, though.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Exactly.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   So if you're going to do decent video,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   they're going to have to do a hardware upgrade.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Quick on the iPhone is pathetic.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And it's not Quick's fault, but the camera's terrible.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   What is it?
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   And the bandwidth is terrible,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   and the battery life's terrible,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   which leads to a terrible experience.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Jeff, you were going to say something?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   I was just going to say,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   do you really think that if they just come out
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   and announce cut and paste and a few other minor things
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   that people--
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   I think there's an expectation for people to be wowed
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   at this point.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And I'll tell you, it's going to be--
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   I think it's not going to be a wow.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   It's going to be evolutionary, not revolutionary.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And I think the revolutionary platform at this point
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   is the Pre.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   The Pre could surprise people.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   If they come--if they move fast,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   they get applications in there,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   they already have pushed out a 102 update,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   which seems to have fixed some of the sluggishness
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I was experiencing.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   The multitasking is spectacular.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Messages and IMs come in in the background,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   so you see them.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   The UI is beautiful.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   You could do other platforms.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   This is--I mean, I presume Palm's going to do
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   the same thing they did with Palm,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   with the other Palm stuff,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   which is make a variety of things around WebOS.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   I think the Pre is fantastic,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   and I think it's going to be very good,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   but the reality distortion field,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   even without Steve Jobs, I think will come into play.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Well, there's also inertia, isn't there?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   And it just kind of pulls the wind out of Palm
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   that they've had their weekend, and it's over,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   instead of having months.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   There's inertia, and I think that--
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Tom Peters used to say this.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   If something's going to be--
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   if you're going to get people to change to a new technology,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   it has to be ten times better.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   It can't be one or two or three times better.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   It has to be ten times better to get people to move.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   That may be the case with it.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Is the multitasking the killer app?
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   I mean, is that--
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   It's pretty good.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   How does that actually work?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   If I have two or three things open,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   does my phone run slower?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Am I sacrificing--
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   It drains the battery, is what it does,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   but I don't think it--
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Have you found it to run slower?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   It's a little more sluggish.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Launching is not as fast as it would be,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   but no, it multitasks pretty well.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Is that what the iPhone does?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   It does it very--
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   I'm sorry, I have a picture of your wife on my phone,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   but that's just sometimes how that happens.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Screw you, Leo!
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   [laughter]
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   The way it happens is that
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   each background application becomes a card
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   that you can scroll through,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   and then you can tap to zoom in, make it full screen,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   and then slide it off the screen to make it smaller,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   slide it again to close it.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   That is elegant.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   That's really sweet.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   That's pretty sweet.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Blackberry will let you run processes in the background,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   but they don't allow that flip through.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   No, you don't even know what's running.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   You have to kind of figure out
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   what else is going on in the background.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   That's the big problem with Blackberry
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   is people all the time are like,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   "Oh my God, my Blackberry's running slow.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Something's wrong."
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   And it turns out they've just got,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   you know, sort of like Windows creep on it,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   and they've got application creep,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   and that's what maybe this solves it.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I don't know.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   What's the price point?
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Is it $199 for this device?
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   $299 with $100 mail-in rebate,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   and that's why Best Buy is the place to get it.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Yeah, if you buy at a Best Buy,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   they do the instant rebate,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   so then you don't have to send any forms in.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Of course, they only have two.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Yeah, that's why it's easy for them to do that.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   They need to get the--
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   the smartphone cost is still prohibitive
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   for mass adoption.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   They have to get these things down to--
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Well, not just the cost of the handset,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   but when people see the monthly cost,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   they really choke.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Too much.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Sprint's doing the $99 everything thing on this,
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   which makes it actually a pretty compelling buy
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   against the iPhone.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Yeah, you can get a $70 iPhone.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Well, that's why we're going to hear
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   about an AT&T price change, I think.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   'Cause they're feeling some heat from that.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   And if that's the case,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   that's why you want to support this competition.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Definitely.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   You need to have other smartphone choices.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Now, BlackBerry does very well.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   In fact, BlackBerry beats the iPhone,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   so it's a good competitor.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   But I think a three-way race is exciting.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   I think it's good.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   I think that John Rubinstein--
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   You don't count Nokia out, either.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   No, no, no.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   The N97's going to be out any minute now.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I can't wait to see that.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   I'm constantly excited about the N series
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   and then disappointed once it comes out.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   I saw the N97 at the D conference.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   It looked really ugly.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   I'll be honest.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Nokia's-- I had the N95.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   It's an elegant device.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   But it looks terrible.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   It's like a phone that time forgot.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   It's like a five-year-old design.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Look, it flips open, and there's a keyboard inside.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   I was like, "Wow, I saw that at '99."
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   There's a movie tying to Land in the Lost there.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   It really is.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   It's not--
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   That will never work anywhere outside of Europe.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Nobody cares about that ugly-looking phone style.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   I don't think kids are going to want that, either.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   It's just, when you have an object of art like the iPhone,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   now you have an object of art like the Palm Pre,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   and then you have the utilitarian BlackBerry
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   that has an incredible camera on it.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   I think the camera--
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   I don't know if you guys watch my blog,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   but it's a 3.2-megapixel camera.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   It's starting to look like my digital rebel.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   I can't tell the difference.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   No, that's the same on this Pre.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   I just took some pictures.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Alain, you just took some pictures.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   It looks good.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   The camera's very good.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   To have a 3-megapixel camera--
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And, of course, what is it, a 997?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Is it five or is it more?
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   It's five, I think.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   I think it's more now.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Is it more now?
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   I think the 997 is more than five.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   'Cause the 95 was five.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   These are cameras and phones.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   You don't have to carry the camera anymore.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   And then when somebody figures out--
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   There are two features that nobody's really figured out.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   One is how to make it a Wi-Fi network,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   like that new Verizon MiFi or whatever.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Wi-Fi, yeah.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Wi-Fi's so cool.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Like the cradle point.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   I have the cradle point that I put my thing into.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   That's just fiber.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Somebody will make that into their phone,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   and then that's it.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   It's like game over.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   And then, two, if they can figure out
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   how to get a flip video type thing working,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   where you get HD video and kind of store it,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   that's two years out.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   But when those things happen two years from now,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   man, I mean, the idea of carrying multiple devices
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   is gonna go away again.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Denise, let me ask you,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   if Apple makes a tablet,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   is that a compelling product for you?
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Is that something you would use?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Is that gonna replace your phone and your laptop?
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   I don't think so, no.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   The thing that I want more than a tablet is an Air.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Because it's--
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   What if you could get something--
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   It's everything and portable, you know?
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   I guess.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   What if you could get something so small,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   smaller than an Air,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   that would do all of that for you?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   I'd certainly look hard at it, you know?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Apple has a tendency to make me drool, so.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   It's funny, I went to the very first D conference
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   years ago now,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   and saw Steve Jobs say, you know,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   and I'm sure he said it more than once,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   but just to hear him say it live was pretty funny,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   that they'd never, ever, ever make a tablet.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   And they'd never make a video iPod either.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   He also said,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   "They make a video."
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   They don't make much video on anything that small.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Right.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   In fact, it's pretty much the case
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   that when Steve Jobs says it's never going to happen,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   that's when they're about to release it.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   So e-book reader.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   No netbook, no netbook.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Yeah, they just said no netbook, didn't they?
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   I'd like to introduce the Apple--
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   You think they'll do a netbook?
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   I think they'll do a tablet in lieu of--
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   I'm guaranteeing--
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   No, you think they will.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   I'm guaranteeing the Apple TV,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   which turns out now,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   my intelligence was right on that from two years ago.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Yeah, you made a big deal about the fact
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   that they were going to put an Apple TV in the TV.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   In the TV.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Yeah, that's going to happen.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Apple TV is intended to be an LCD TV.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   There's no difference between the 30-inch
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   and what they're going to,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   so that's going to happen.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   But a netbook's got to happen.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   I mean, in Japan, the netbooks are free.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   You get a $40 a month evido plan,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   and you get it for free if you have a two-year commitment.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   I mean, can you imagine if you could buy
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   an Apple laptop, essentially,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   for $300 or $400 subsidized,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   $500 or $600 subsidized,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   what that would do to market share for Apple?
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I mean, I was on a flight just with this Virgin flight,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   and I would say two-thirds of the people
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   were online on the flight, of the laptops open.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Two-thirds?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Two-thirds.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   There were about 15 laptops open.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Is that because it's new,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   or do you think it'll stay like that?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   No, no.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   People were doing Gmail.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   People were surfing the web, reading blogs.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   I looked at everybody's shoulders, you know,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   and the other people who weren't
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   were on Microsoft Word, like one or two of them,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   and then the rest of them were watching movies.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   And a couple of them were netbooks,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   and I'm seeing netbooks over and over and over again.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   I went to a couple meetings in New York.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   One of the meetings, a guy pulls out that Sony one
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   that's really nice that fits in your inside jacket pocket.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   I think netbooks are--
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   The P9?
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Yeah, that machine.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   It's beautiful.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Beautiful, a piece of art.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   It looks like Apple did it.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   $800, $900, and it's really slow.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   And it's not a netbook.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   It's not a netbook.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Don't call it a netbook.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   But I think the Apple netbook will come.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   That's just a no-brainer.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Really?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   I don't understand the desire for a tablet,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   because I figure once it's too big to fit in my pocket,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   I'm not going to have it with me all the time anyway.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   My friend Alex Lindsay says they'll make bigger pockets.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   (laughter)
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   They'll re-architect your pants around this device.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Isn't that what they said about the Segway?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Yeah, they're going to re-architect your cities.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Cities will be re-architected.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Yeah, totally.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Well, so when I use my Kindle, I have the same sort of feeling
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   as I did way back when, when I used my first brick-sized cell phone.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   And it sort of is made of that same color plastic, too,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   which just adds to the experience.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   And what was the feeling?
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   You're right at the beginning of something great.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   That you're using sort of a prototype device.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   No knock on the Kindle.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I love the Kindle.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   I have to say, the user interface work--
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   I'm sorry to bring this back up,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   but the palm is done on the Pre
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   shows me that a smaller screen, smaller device,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   actually can be useful.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   I think it may be we don't need a big tablet
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   if the UI is designed purpose-built for this environment
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   and is designed right for the environment.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Would you read a book on that?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   No.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Would you read a book on your iPhone?
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   I read on the Kindle reader sometimes.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Kindle's fine.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   But it's more of a stopgap thing.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Oh, the Kindle app on the iPhone.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Yeah, on the iPhone.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Yeah, but yeah, it's not as good as a--
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   But it's wearing.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   People don't read books.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Do you carry a Kindle with you everywhere you go?
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   No.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Do you, Denise?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   I do, yeah.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   But then I'm a girl.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   I carry a purse.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Oh, you have a purse.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Well, all right, so maybe this is going to be
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   the beginning of a new era in man purses.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   I was going to say, introducing the Apple man purse.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Steve Jobs returns with a purse.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I'd like to announce my new venture capital company.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   The iPurse.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   My line of purses stylized around the Apple logo.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   I think it could be the case.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   I think what Apple's-- if it fits Apple's pattern,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   what will happen is they'll say netbooks are stupid,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   nobody wants a netbook.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Then they'll come out with a device that is essentially
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   a netbook, and they won't call it a netbook.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   But it won't be a netbook.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   We've created a new device that fits a whole new category.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And we call it whatever i-name they come up with.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   It's not a netbook.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Because they didn't want to call the iPod video iPod video.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   It was iPod with video.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   They made a big point out of don't call it iPod video.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Right, with video.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   I think it could wind up being the MacBook Air something.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Like the MacBook Air mini or something.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Air mini or something.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Like a tinier version of the Air.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Extend that brand.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Plant shell.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Because they could make the Air with a smaller keyboard,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   smaller monitor, same frame.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   And idiots like me will pay $2,000 for it.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   The Air Puff.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Traffic Mike says he read Boiling Point on the iPhone.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Oh, did you?
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   There's a PDF for that.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   There's two things to get over.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   One is I wrote the book.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Second is you're reading it on an iPhone.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   That's a lot of speed books.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   We have a ton of stories.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   This is one of the busiest news days of the year.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Denise has some things to say about watching porn.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   We're going to talk about that.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   You can't say the word sex on Bing, by the way, if you're in India.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   We are going to talk about Digg has a new ad system
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   where you get to vote on the ads.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Don't you dare vote on our ads.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Genius.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Tony La Russa sues Twitter.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Stupid.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   And maybe a conflict of interest in the White House.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Is Google getting too cozy with Obama?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Yes.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   All right.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Well, thanks for joining us.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   We'll see you next time.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   And we're done.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   That's it.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Thank you, Jason.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   You really just cut to the chase.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   I think that's really important.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   There is a lot of news, and we're going to talk about it all in just a bit.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   And I do want to talk to Denise about it.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   I think you're going to do a twill on this,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   about this thumbnail issue on Bing,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   because this is a copyright issue that's just fascinating.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   And Bing, by the way, took the lead over Yahoo.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   A guy who knows a lot about search, Mr. Mahalo,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   we'll talk about that as well.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   But first I want to mention Squarespace.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Squarespace.com.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Denise, have you moved your site over,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   or are you about to move your site over to Squarespace?
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   No, I've been moved over for, gosh, I think it's been more than a month now.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   And?
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Bagandbagage.com is there, and I love it.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   It's wonderful.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   This is a -- I had never heard of them, to be honest,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   when they came to us, and I went over there.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   And the first thing you see when you go to Squarespace.com
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   is this amazing ability to create --
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   take a beautiful template, customize it with Ajax, drag and drop.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   I mean, it just is incredible.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   It imports all your stuff from WordPress or Movable Type or Blogger or TypePad,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   and exports, so you're never trapped.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   You've got -- it's not a blog engine per se,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   because you do a forum there, you can do a photo gallery, a forum builder.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   They've got Google Maps, amazing stats.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   And because they're using this kind of cloud architecture,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   they could throw more bandwidth at it at any time.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   You're never brought down by a dig, for instance, just kind of infinite bandwidth.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   So you've been pretty happy with it.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   I've been really happy with it.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   I was on Blogger forever, you know, since the cooling of the earth,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   when they started 10 years ago.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   And liked it, and it was easy, and, you know, there was some loyalty there,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   and I met the people a long time ago and just never really wanted to move.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   But it was clear that I needed more.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   I needed a blog engine on steroids, which is sort of what Squarespace is.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   You know, I was cludging together sites and then linking off my blog to elsewhere
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   to be able to send people to, you know, other information about me,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   aside from just my blog entries.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   So this was able to package it all up in one place, and it's super fast, too.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Isn't that nice?
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Yeah, it's just spoken fast.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   It's next-generation website design.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   And, you know, it's a hosted solution, so you're getting the hosting
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   and this amazing content management system.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   I'm getting so many e-mails from people who are saying,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   "I moved to Squarespace because of your ads.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   I've never seen anything like this. I love it."
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   People are just flipping out.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   I want you to try it free.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Just go to squarespace.com/twit, squarespace.com/twit.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   And if you decide to purchase, you'll get 10% off when you enter the code TWIT, T-W-I-T.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Now, there's also something else that they've just started.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Starting June 8th through July 7th, they're giving away 30 iPhones, an iPhone a day.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   All you have to do is send out a tweet with the #squarespace hashtag.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   So do a mini-review of Squarespace, put the pound--or whatever--
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   put the #squarespace hashtag in it.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Squarespace will choose one winner each day at random, no purchase necessary.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Go to squarespace.com/iphone for all the details, so you can win an iPhone.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   You don't even have to sign up for Squarespace.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Just put #squarespace in your tweet, and you'll be eligible to win.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Did I mention something about Squarespace?
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Yes. I didn't know you knew anything about Squarespace.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   I know all about Squarespace.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Very cool guys from New York.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   They applied for TechCrunch50 and weren't accepted because it was like a new version.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   We tried to launch new things at it.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Yeah, they've been around for a couple of years.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   I almost fell off my chair when I saw it, and I just want to take a moment--
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   because we do this on This Week in Startups--
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   to tell all the people who are fans of the show, This Week in Tech,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   should all say right now on Twitter, "Thank you to Squarespace,"
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   and then put #twit at the end.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   This way the sponsor knows that they've heard the thing.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   If they see 100 people mention Squarespace right now,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   they're probably going to advertise more.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   They're getting great results.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   They're very happy here, and we're really happy to have them.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Yeah, but want to say thank you to Squarespace.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   That's something a listener can do that takes 10 seconds
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   and really helps the show--
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   I never thought of that.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Thank you for saying that. That's a good thing.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Say thank you to Squarespace on your tweet.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   For supporting Twit.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   Specifically for supporting Twit.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   We appreciate that.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   How is that going, This Week in Startups?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Fantastic.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   I love the show.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Oh, that's very kind.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Yeah, no, the first time I watched it, I thought,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   "This is like King Jason dispensing his knowledge.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Come to Jason, he will tell you."
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Or the guru on the mouth.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Life is not a bowl of cherries.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Poor David Carrady.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Okay, a moment of silence.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   Moment of silence for D.C. Kung Fu.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   We just had 47 people in the last 90 seconds thank Squarespace on Twit.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Oh, that's nice. Thank you, everybody.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   But anyway, the show's doing really well.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Thank you for being cool about me borrowing the sort of This Week In.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   You've been really a bench about that, I have to say, because I did ask--
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   No, you asked, and I was glad to do it.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   You should ask Mel Allen, to be honest with you.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   He's got This Week In baseball.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   I also offered, like, "Hey, can I give a tributary or something?"
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   I don't know what the relationship is between--
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   But you know what we would like to rebroadcast?
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   We'd like to broadcast the live broadcast at some point.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   I feel like I've learned 95% of what I already know about podcasting from you.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Kevin's show as well.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   Anyway, I'm thankful that you're cool about me using the This Week In.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   And you're going to launch a new one?
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   We're going to do This Week In advertising, yeah.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Now, what would that be about?
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   It'll just be-- I think it'll be more like the Twit format than This Week In startups.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   This Week In startups is me giving advice, mainly, in an interview.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   It's not This Week In tech.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   But This Week In advertising will be like This Week In law or This Week In tech,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   which will be four people talking about social media, marketing, advertising, whatever.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   And I'm not the host. I just did this because I want to watch the show.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Who's going to host it?
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   You know my guy, Tyler, who is a strategy guy?
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   I have him be the host initially.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   And he's just going to bring on three people and talk about advertising.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   We do a similar show, but I don't know how similar it'll be.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   It's called "TWiM," This Week In Media with Daisy Whitney.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Yeah, so this will be just focused on advertising.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   So, Len, let me ask you about this Digg thing.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Oh, this thing is brilliant.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   This is really interesting, and I'm not sure what to make of it.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Thursday, Digg announced it was going to start allowing its users to vote on advertising.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Now, Hulu does it.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   We should point out the thumbs up, thumbs down on the ads it shows.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   But Digg's going to charge advertisers a price based on the user feedback.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   So the more the ad is hated, the more the advertiser has to pay.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Well, it's sort of the other way around.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   You get a discount if it is.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   So they're not going to penalize you for being bad creative.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Let's say you start at a $10 CPM.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   If it's really good, then you might go down to a five.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   But it's not going to penalize you up, because that would be like short-selling a stock.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   You have no limit to how much you can lose.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Doesn't this piss off advertisers?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Not if it's a discount.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Yeah, but I mean, I don't know if--
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   I mean, do you think advertisers like the idea of people voting?
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Look it, let me put it this way.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   You're not going to see this on CBS, NBC, or ABC.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   No, but--
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Maybe that's just genius.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   If you're stirring up your audience to, "Man, I'm going to show those advertisers.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   I'm going to hate their ads," they're going to go watch them.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Maybe it's not a bad thing.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   It's getting more people--
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   It's the GoDaddy, yeah.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   --starting advertising into content.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   They're going to make people want to--
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   They're going to make ads that they hope people will like.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   And that's a good thing, right?
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Yeah, that's clearly the motivation.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Which is, "Useful advertising. It isn't going to bother me."
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   We had this argument on Buzz out loud, and I was like, "Do you like movie trailers?"
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   And everybody who had been just bitching that moment before was like, "Well, yeah."
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   I'm like, "Those are ads."
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   But you don't think of them as ads because you like them.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   And that's what good advertising is.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   It's something that you don't think of as, "Oh, this annoying, intrusive ad."
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   We only hate advertising because it's intrusive and annoying.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   And it has to be sometimes.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   But if you can walk that balance to where it's both intrusive but not annoying,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   that's a good thing.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   Right.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   I stop my TiVo in the middle of fast-forwarding through ads
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   when I see the Apple versus Microsoft.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   And by the way, that--
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   PC versus Mac ad.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   TiVo records all that information and offers that for sale to both its programmers and advertisers.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   I remember we saw at Tech TV, they brought in a day--
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   the screensavers, the graph of rewinds and stuff.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   And it's the most amazing information you ever saw
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   because it tells you in a much more visceral way than ratings,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   in a much more granular way than ratings, what people like and don't like.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   You can see there's a graph, and it spikes when something interesting happens
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   because people rewound and watched it again.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   And it goes down when they fast-forward through stuff.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Wasn't it Janet Jackson?
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Janet Jackson.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Yeah, there was a good example.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   I rewound that about five or six times.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   I was trying to figure out what the jewelry was.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   So is this much different, though, than what Facebook does?
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Does Facebook do this?
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   They have you vote, "Yeah, do you like this ad?"
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   But they don't give a discount to advertisers, or do they?
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Maybe they do.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Yeah, no, they don't give a discount.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Tying the money to it is a good idea.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   We tried this on Weblogs Inc. and Engadget back in the day
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   where we had advert posts, and we said, "Post a comment of what you think of the product,"
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   and only one out of 100 advertisers would ever go to it.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Like you were saying, they don't want feedback.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   It's too scary.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   They can't even change their creative enough, a lot of these advertisers.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   And the agencies are building it for clients who don't even watch the store.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Now, if you dig down an ad, does it stop showing you the ad?
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   I don't think that's what happens.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Now, that I like.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   I don't want to see any more GoDaddy ads.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   They're gone.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   Ironically, though, I think some of the most effective advertising is some of the most annoying advertising.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   That's always been the case.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   "Please don't squeeze the Charmin" is famously successful, even though everybody hates it or hated it.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   It might actually be worth the extra money to the advertiser to have something that sticks in your head that you hate,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   but so many people hate it that that's kind of feedback as well.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   That's kind of something that--
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Bottom line in here is this is exactly what the hope was,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   that new media would be able to do some innovative, interactive stuff that would bring some value to both advertisers,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   content creators, and viewers, and this is an exactly-- I mean, this is wonderful.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   There's another reason why Digg is doing this, though, and other sites aren't, to be honest.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   It's not meant to be a dig to Jay and Kevin.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   We're obviously all friends, but the truth is the Digg audience is largely like an anti-commercial audience.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   The Digg format-- so they have AdBlocker on a lot of the time.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Second, the Digg system is the best of the web, which means if you try to put an ad up there you're competing against the best of the web.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   That's a terrible thing for an advertiser to have to do.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Advertising doesn't work on Digg.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   That's their main problem, so they don't have a choice but to do something really innovative like this.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   People are not going to click on the ads on Digg when there's 10 stories about Ron Paul and boobies
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   and seven stories about what's coming out on the Mac tomorrow.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   The ads just disappear.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   How can an advertiser compete with Mac?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   That's not Digg.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   I mean, that's a problem everywhere.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   No, but it's specific to meme trackers.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Meme trackers are so good, the content, that it's harder to compete.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   It's one thing to compete on the New York Times site or in Gadget when it's a lot of news,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   but when it's the best news, best of the best--
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   That's interesting.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   --you get magnitude horror.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   I didn't know this because I did the Netscape thing.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   I wonder if Fark has that problem.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Well, that's why Fark put the ads in the stream.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   They get paid for people putting stories in there, and they don't actually label it.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   It's a little bit shady, but Digg is trying to insert the ads into the stream,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   and by allowing users to vote them up, they can do that credibly,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   as opposed to Fark, which sort of did it on the slide.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Not that anybody cares.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   I mean, it's boobies, whatever.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   I think this is--look, I mean, advertisers in general face problems.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   People don't want ads.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   They do everything they can to avoid ads.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Anything you can do to add value to the ads or make it so that people pay more attention
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   is a good thing, and this is an example of how new media can do that.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   I think it's--
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   It's brilliant, and it's well executed.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Now, let's talk about Bing, Denise.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Bing is Microsoft's new search engine.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   It was called Kumo.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   It's really--I don't know.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Jason, is it much different than MSN Search?
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Do they really change the technology, or is it just relabeled?
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   I think if you compare what they had before, it was probably they had like a 4 or 5 out of 10
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   if Google's the 10 in Search.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Now they have like an 8, so they're catching up.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   The quality's very good.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   It's amazing what they've done compared to what they've done previously.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   It's not quite Google yet, but they're taking a lot of risks in terms of the design of it,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   so for that, they deserve a lot of credit.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   It is phenomenally well executed.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   And, by the way, beat Yahoo in--well, that's just kind of sampling, but beat Yahoo in Search.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   It's a legitimate contender, and that is shocking.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   And you've always told me, and I've quoted you many times,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   each percentage of the search market's about a billion dollars in value.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Yeah, I mean, that's why they were going to spend $40 billion, $30, $40 billion to buy Yahoo's 20%.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   I mean, they were going to pay a little more because Yahoo has extra things attached to it,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   like their investment in Japan.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   So Denise has a really good post on her logarithms column, the June 2nd post,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   in which she asks, "Is Bing paying fast and loose with fair use?"
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   What's going on? What's Bing doing?
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Well, Bing is providing live video previews.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   As many a 14-year-old has just learned, by the way.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Yeah, so when you go and do a search with the safe search controls turned on,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   you'll see that when you mouse over one of the video thumbnails that you get in the search results,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   it's not just a screen capture of what's going on, but the video starts to play.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   And there's an interesting interview.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   The person who flagged the fair use issue was Andy Plesser of Beat TV,
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   and he asked me if I'd taken a look at it, and I did, and then I put up my post.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   And Andy continued to look at it as well.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   The problem is--
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Didn't Google get in a little trouble for the thumbnails in the search?
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Google has had many--and lots of search engines--
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   For image search, right?
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   --have had lots of litigation over how much of something you can display in a search engine
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   in order to index and then point people off.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   But Google won that case, the porn thumbnail case.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   There was a porn case that involved still images that were inline linked.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Perfect Ten, that's right.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Perfect Ten versus Google.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Google won because even though they were showing full-sized images--
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   and that's problematic under the fair use analysis.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Under fair use, you're not allowed to detract from the market value of the original
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   or to do something that basically replaces the need to go and see the original.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   So that's why this Bing video search is somewhat problematic.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   They don't, it appears, play the full video of everything that's included in the search engine,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   although I'm still kind of digging around in it,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   and it seems like for short videos you're getting awfully close to the full thing.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   There's an interesting interview that Andy Plesser did with--Stefan Weitz is his name,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   and I just put a tiny URL for the interview.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   It's denise.howell.net/bing.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   And there's Stefan talking about how they organized this video search
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   and how they decided which parts of the video to display.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   And he goes ahead and says, "We actually do try and pull out something relevant
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   so that it's meaningful for you when you--
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   Well, that's good.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   Well, it's good, and it's dangerous from a fair use perspective
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   because if you're replacing the need and disincentivizing people
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   from actually going to see the original, if they can just sit there and happily watch the thumbnail--
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   It's the best of, yeah.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   This is brilliant.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   But the thumbnail only plays a few seconds, right?
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   I mean, it doesn't--
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   So this gets really interesting when you delve into the porno sphere
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   because if you turn off safe search and you just do a search for porn--
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   You can watch all that porn without leaving Bing.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   And if they're pulling out what they think are the most salient parts--
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   What is the best?
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Salient or salacious.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Let's just say--Can I just say the mission can be accomplished--
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   I'm a lot more salient part.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   --with the Bing search result, if we just leave it at that.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   The mission will be accomplished, yes.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Which means there is no reason to go to the porn site.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   Right.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   Therefore, as a legal test in this, you would say if the mission is accomplished,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   therefore it's infringing upon their ability to do trade?
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   You know, I don't know that the mission accomplished test was actually raised in perfect time.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   How about e-mission accomplished?
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gone that way.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   I don't get it.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   I don't get it either. I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   I don't get it, and I made the joke up.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   This is going to be shut down within a couple of weeks, guaranteed.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   This is way unfair.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   You know, I was honed in on the copyright issues when I posted about this,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   but the real outcry about it is parents and educators and libraries.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   No, I wasn't too pleased when I saw this, because I do have--I'm using OpenDNS to block,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   but you can't block Bing. Well, you could block Bing, I guess.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Maybe you should block Bing.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   It doesn't go into the porn stuff right away.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   You have to go in and turn off the safe search.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   But anybody could do that.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   I can't force my kid not to use safe search.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   You can't force your kid not to use--or you could force your kid not to use the Internet, too.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   There's safe search in Google for images as well.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   I'm just saying I can put OpenDNS on my router, and the kid can't change it,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   and then he's got a hard time going to porn sites.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   On the other hand, if he figures out he can Bing them--
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   He can Google images. I guess it's a matter of degree.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   It's significantly different than looking at a still image.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Oh, really?
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Folks are so inclined to go check it out.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   I think that if you turn off--
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   It's rather overwhelming when you first hit the Bing.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Try one of these. It is kind of amazing when you see these thumbnails.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Don't you think that if you turn off the safe search, it turns it into the Bada Bing?
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Hey-o!
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   It's almost like DJ kind of a thing, because when--forget about the porn search,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   but anything you pull up, if you just sort of roll over it in a row,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   you sort of get this weird montage of--
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   Yeah, because they don't turn off.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   They keep going for whatever seconds they're pre-programmed or selected to do,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   so if you just swipe across, it becomes a cacophony.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Somebody's saying in the chat room, "I seem a little paranoid.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   My kids are going to search for porn."
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   I'm just using them as an example.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   They're good kids, and they don't search for porn.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   You're using the metaphorical kids.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   The metaphorical kids.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   Henry searched for boobies once, but that was it.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   He actually searched for Ron Paul's boobies, which I thought was a little strange.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   Who hasn't?
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   Who hasn't, after all?
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   He found it on Dig.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   But here's an interesting thing.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Dig, for some reason, has decided that you can't search for the word "sex" if you're Indian.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   No, "bing," you mean.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   What did I say?
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Dig.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Dig.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Dig, Bing.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Don't disrespect the Bing.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Don't disrespect the Bing.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   So apparently, "sex" is a high-volume search string from India,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   ranking above 60 on a scale of 0 to 100 since 2004, according to Google.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   It's easy to change your country, though, with Bing, apparently.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   You can just say, "Oh, I'm not in India. I'm in the U.S."
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Oh, you're in India!
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   And then you can search all you want.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   If you say you're from China or Hong Kong or Singapore, no luck.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Arabian country, no luck.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   But you say you're from the U.S., they say, "Anything goes!"
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   Oh, you're from France! Ha ha!
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   And then searching for "sex" is much different than searching for "boobies" on porn.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   You could be searching for health information or gender typing.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   There's a whole lot of other things.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   I know it's not as fun to imagine that you might be including that search term on,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   that it's now blocking.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   Is there a legal reason, Denise, that they might want to do this?
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   I mean, do they have to do this for certain countries?
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   Yeah, the different countries have.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   And, you know, some countries are more restrictive than others
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   as to what they will permit search engines to deliver.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   And then it's up to the search engine if they want to do business in that country,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   if they're going to comply with the local laws.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   And I'm sure that's why Bing has made this decision.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   They'd rather not be blocked.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   They'd rather not be sued.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   Do you think this Yahoo lead is meaningful at all?
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   I mean, it's just everybody kind of--
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Bing became the number two search engine on Thursday with a 16.28 share of searches.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   I just went to google.in and searched "sex" and I got a lot of results.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Now, maybe it's because my IP address isn't masked.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   In other words, Google's not doing it.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   Do you have SafeSearch turned on?
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   I do.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Because you have to turn on SafeSearch on Bing.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   A lot of health returns.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   Health returns.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   No, I didn't.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   Did you get any thumbnails?
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Full free porn videos and DVDs is the first result on google.in.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   So as long as we're talking about international things--
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Yes.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Somebody DMed me right before the show with some breaking news from the EU.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   And that is that the pirate party has just got elected to a seat in the European Parliament.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   What did they get? 7% of the vote?
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   They got a huge--
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Is it proportional representation there?
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   Is that how that works?
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   19% between 18 to 35 year olds.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   You know what the good news about this is?
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   They're no longer going to have to cam the proceedings.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   They're actually going to have them straight to DVD.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   So is this a response to the Pirate Bay prosecution?
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Are there real candidates being affronted or is this just kind of a protest vote?
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   What's the story here?
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   They got a seat.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   So they're going to have to have a candidate.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   I think it's a combination of both.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   I think that this is a big enough issue and has been public enough there that people have finally just said,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   "Let's get some new perspective on these issues."
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Deep Tears says, "The EU has been boarded."
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Is that a Senate?
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   Tony La Russa is suing Twitter.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   Fail.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Sign stealing, right?
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   Yes.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   He says, "An unauthorized page that used his name to make light of drunken driving and two Cardinals pitchers who died damaged his reputation and caused emotional distress.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   The Superior Court of California in San Francisco seeking unspecified damages."
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   He's basically saying, "You didn't bother to authenticate that it was the real Tony La Russa."
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   In related news, he's suing Gmail for Tony La Russa 17.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   Fail.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   Well, it's the best group.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Tony La Russa 14.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   Let me give me a break.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   It's a stupid thing I've heard.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   ARF is handling this case, the Animal Rescue Foundation.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   He's saying that this is because of the -- he doesn't want a bad name.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   That's his big car, his big charity.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   Yeah, it affects their ability to get adoptions if people see this Twitter account and think that Tony La Russa is saying all these horrible things, they won't want to support ARF.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   What I don't understand is he says he tried to get Twitter to take it down and they wouldn't.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   And Twitter is usually very responsive in these sort of situations when they receive a request.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Well, it's worse because this lawsuit includes a screenshot of tweets with the heading, "Hey there, Tony La Russa is using Twitter," with a picture of the manager.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   And then it says, "Bio-parodies are fun for everyone."
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   Oh, he didn't dismiss that part.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   That's the page you see if you went -- it's the site -- the account is down now.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   But if you went to that twitter.com/tonylarussa, you'd see that.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   Anybody would see that, though.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   I don't know if that's --
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   The problem with the lawsuit is Tony's probably sued the wrong party, as Jason was pointing out, that we have broad sweeping immunities in this country for intermediaries like Google and here Twitter.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   They're protected.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   They're broadly protected.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   They're a carrier.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   They're protected.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   But it raises a really interesting issue because Twitter is becoming more and more like some sort of domain name registrar.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   The names there actually have some meaning.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   As far as -- there certainly could be trademark issues that could attach one way or another.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   If someone is using your trademark or your name and likeness without your permission, you've got some claims.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   But to go after Twitter here is a little bit difficult.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Didn't you say that at one point, Jason, on this show that if eventually everybody will have a Twitter, this would be like the phone book for the world?
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   Yeah, my premise is it's going to be the global login system.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   It's sort of -- and they're also going to launch a payment system.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   So it's going to sort of be like if PayPal and Facebook login were together -- or did I say they're going to launch a payment system?
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   Can you edit that out of the show?
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   They're going to launch a payment system.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   And when they have a payment system --
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   I hear you're going to launch a payment system.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   But are they going to launch one?
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   They're going to launch a payment system.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   And when they do, I could be like --
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   What would you pay for?
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   Anything, just like PayPal.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   I could PayPal a donation to a charity.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   I could send you $20 that I owe you.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   That's a good business model.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   You could send me the $1,500 you owe me from the poker game finally three months later.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   Screw you, Jason Callahan.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   It's been 15 minutes.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   I'm invited on the show until Leo pays off his poker debts.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   You know, Bill Stone has a post up on Twitter right now saying screw you, Tony LaRusso.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   No, seriously.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   It's called "Not Playing Ball."
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   He says, "With due respect to the man and his notable work, Mr. LaRusso's lawsuit was an unnecessary waste of judicial resources bordering on frivolous.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Twitter's terms of service are fair and we believe will be upheld in court that will ultimately dismiss Mr. LaRusso's lawsuit."
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   Then goes on to talk about a new business opportunity called verified accounts,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   where celebrities at first and maybe businesses down the road will be able to get a verified account by paying.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   They're going to announce verified accounts.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   Which goes to the concept of a payment system, which goes to the global login system.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   I like the payment system idea.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   This is where they're going to go.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   I think the logical progression of that is really exciting.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   I think that if all of a sudden I have @JeffCanada on Twitter and you can send me money that way, you can get to my telephone that way,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   that is just the way the Internet knows me.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   It does raise this issue though. If @JeffCanada isn't Jeff Canada and I send you money, that's not good.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   You have to have a way of making sure that the people who are who they say they are.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   It also means that if Twitter loses this case to LaRusso, that business model is not as good.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   By the way, that post you mentioned squelched rumors that the case had settled.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   That was all over the headlines a couple days ago. That the case had been filed and then immediately somehow worked out.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Sounds like it doesn't, that there's not much merit to this case.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   There is not a chance in heck that this will ever get anywhere. Period.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   I wouldn't want to beat Twitter.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   It's got some difficult choices to make.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Maybe going down the monetizing your verified account is sort of the best scenario for it.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   If they've got to put an infrastructure in place that manages this for everyone.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   They don't have to put an infrastructure in.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   What they'll do is, if it's unverified, then there's a reasonable expectation,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   just like the rest of the web, that you don't take it too seriously.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   I get spam all the time from celebrities or this or that. No big deal.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   That's true. You could send an email right now that says, "This is Bill Clinton."
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   "Give me back my cigar." And nobody, it doesn't have to be real.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   I'm guessing that this is some sort of a PR play by this guy because he's got a book coming out.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   I think Tony's genuine here. I know Tony. I think he's genuine here.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   I think he may not get Twitter and he may not understand. He's not getting good legal advice perhaps.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   And he's a lawyer.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   What lawyer? Is he desperate for cash or something?
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   What lawyer would ever believe this?
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   I think that Tony is understandably angry. He doesn't really understand what happened,
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   as a lot of people don't understand Twitter, and thinks that he's been impersonated in public.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   Then send a letter and turn off the account.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   The fact that he's going for a lawsuit and money is completely disingenuous.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   He says he did that. He says he tried to get the account turned off and it wasn't turned off.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   How did he try to turn it off?
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   We don't know, but maybe that would give his case some merit if that's the case, right?
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   That gets back to my infrastructure point. How does Twitter respond to...
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   They don't have the staff. If they're getting a thousand messages a day saying, "Hey, that's not my account."
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   They could easily have the infrastructure.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   There are companies that you outsource this to who handle it for you.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   They could easily get through hundreds of these a day, and it would probably be under a hundred a day,
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   even for a service like AOL.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   I only know one. Mostly Lisa tried for a long time to get Mostly Lisa back.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   She was able to get it back finally, but it took a while.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   Do we know many cases of people saying, "Hey, that's not my name."?
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   Jennifer Leggio at ZDNet had it happen to her recently.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   How hard was it for her to get her name back?
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   It was easy, but she knew folks at Twitter.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   I've helped a dozen people.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   If you've got an in, Jason, you can go to Ev and say, "Hey, dude. Hey, Biz."
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   It's not just that. They actually respond to the general email.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   I know people who've emailed the general email and have this taken care of.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   Maybe there was a window during the peak of Oprah madness that it took a day or two,
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   but send a certified letter to their office. I guarantee they handle it.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Sending a certified letter to an office is a lot easier than filing a lawsuit, Denise, I think.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   Wouldn't that be the proper protocol?
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   Absolutely. I'm not behind this lawsuit being filed.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   Always better.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   What would be the proper protocol if somebody doesn't respond to an email?
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   Emails can get lost, misplaced.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   Isn't the proper protocol before you file a lawsuit to maybe send three certified letters to before you file it?
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   Certainly something that's off the web. Yeah, something in paper.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   We actually printed up letterhead. We never had letterhead for these kinds of things.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   We actually had to make – what do you mean? We have to send snail mail?
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   So we printed up letterhead.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   Letterhead is some guarantee of authenticity these days.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   Well, you have to have it. You can't just send it to them on a lined piece of notebook paper.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   If you put something in mail, people take it very seriously.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   No, because nobody does it anymore.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   I've sent literally handwritten notes on pieces of paper like, "By the way, I am going to sue you."
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   Like sign Jason in a FedEx envelope, like literally two sentences, "Stop.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   I am going to sue you." Sign Jason Calacanis in a FedEx envelope to people.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   Once you do that, people behave themselves.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   I think the problem was that Tony LaRusso just stood across the street and then patted his head three times and rubbed his nose.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   You didn't see the signal.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   What? Come on.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   Are you blind? What are you blind?
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   All right, we're going to take a break. Come back with more stories for you in just a second.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   You were listening to TWIT with the great Tom Merritt and Mr. Jason Calacanis,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   aka Maverick, Denise Howell from Logarithms, no B, and Jeff Canata from The Totally Rad Show.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   I want to tell you about GoToMyPC right now.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   GoToMyPC makes it easy to remotely access your system from the – of course it's easy.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   Most of the folks at Citrix, they know remote access better than anybody else.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   They pretty much created remote access back in the golden days of Windows NT, and they've been doing it ever since.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   GoToMyPC is easy to set up.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   All you have to do is open up your web browser right now.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   You can follow along with me. You'll have it done before I'm done.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   GoToMyPC.com/twit, G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C.com/twit.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   You there? All right.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   Now you're going to sign up, create an account.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   Once you get the account, then you go to GoToMyPC.com and enter your secure username and password.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   Click connect from any computer, any computer that you can get online with, Mac or PC.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Whether you're at home, at an airport, at a hotel, at a sketch internet cafe in the darkest reaches of the continent,
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   you could just log on, and there it is, your office computer or the computer you set it up on.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   You can access your email, send and receive.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   You can run any program, download files from one to the other.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   Couldn't be easier.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   You don't have to worry about configuration with a router.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   You don't have to worry about security. It's 128-bit encrypted point to point the whole time.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   In fact, this is better than a VPN.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   Try it right now free.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   Go to GoToMyPC.com/twit.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   I've known these guys at Citrix for so many years.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   I've used their products for so many years, and I know you're going to love it, so give it a try.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   GoToMyPC.com/twit.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   We thank them so much for their support of This Week in Tech.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   I just wanted to give you an update.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   600 people have thanked Squarespace on Twitter.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   I'm not kidding.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   600 people have thanked Squarespace.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   Totem or--
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   Squarespace.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   You need to send two checks, one to Leo, one to me.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   And then two, I just want to encourage everybody to do a second tweet right now saying thank you to--
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   Citrix and GoToMyPC.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   GoToMyPC, GoToMyPC, and put #twit at the end.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   And specifically say, GoToMyPC, I really appreciate you supporting user-generated high-end media that has Jason Calacanis in it.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   Thank you.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   Anything with Jason in it is good.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   Absolutely.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   Anything.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   No, but really, seriously, it means a lot to support the show.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   I want to ask Jeff Kanata because he was at E3.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   Anybody else go to E3?
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   I think, Jeff, you're the only one here that was at E3.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   The big gaming convention was this week.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   You've been to them in the past.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   Is E3 getting bigger, getting smaller?
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   People seem to think this was the best E3 in a while.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   I think I would agree with that, yeah.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   It's definitely on the upswing as far as big to small.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   Last year was really much more subdued and low-key, and it was back this year to being a little more bombastic again.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   It's not what you expect from conferences in this tough times.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   You kind of expect them to be sluggish and slow and people going, "Oh, hum."
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   But the gaming is hotter than ever.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   Maybe bad economies are good for gaming.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   I'm sure they are.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   Well, we're hitting the stride of all these consoles that came out a few years ago.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   It takes a couple of years for the software developers to catch up on the new hardware.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   Now we're hitting really where these projects that started a couple of years ago, they're about to come out.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   It's really showing off what these next generation systems can do.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   Well, something happened that doesn't usually happen at E3.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   Mainstream media really picked up on the Microsoft story for two reasons.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   One, because they got Ringo and Paul together.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   That always helps.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   That's pretty big.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   And Steven Spielberg.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   And Steven's all on the same stage.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   And Yoko was there.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   A moving moment.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   [yells]
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   And Mrs. Harrison.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   Mrs. Harrison?
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   What is her name? Is it Patty Boyd?
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   No, no, that's the...
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   Son was there, too.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   I don't know his name. Something Harrison.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   Son.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   So, the big announcement for Microsoft was Natal?
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   Yeah, they're calling it Natal.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   Natal?
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   Not Natal.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   Not Natal, not pre-natal, not post-natal.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   It's a pretty spectacular bit of technology.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   And they pretty much blew everybody away with their stage presentation.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   It's taking the controller completely out of the equation
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   and letting you communicate with the system using your gestures
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   and a three-camera system that includes an infrared camera.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   It's pretty awesome stuff.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   But is it a product? Will it ever come out?
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   And is there anything more than just a great demo in there?
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   You know, Paul Theriotta does our Windows Weekly program,
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   kind of went off on it and said, "This is..."
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   I mean, he's a Microsoft guy.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   He said, "This is ridiculous. Come on.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   They didn't even announce a product."
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   A release window?
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   A release window. There's no product.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   Well, Peter Molyneux came out and showed what Lionhead Studios
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   has been working on, and he claims that will be a product.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   This Milo and Kate, I think it's called.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   He says that will be a game.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   Did you use it? Did you get to play with it at all?
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   I didn't get hands-on with it, no, but I saw the presentations.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   I mean, it looks cool, but demos can be so deceptive.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   They also had Burnout up and working on it.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   So they had an actual pre-existing game working with the technology
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   for people to use.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   What did Brian think of it?
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   Brian got to actually try it, and he said it worked.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   He was limited in what games he could use, of course.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   It's a very controlled environment.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   But he was able to make it work on him.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   Well, Felicia Day used it and looked good with it.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   They didn't calibrate it for him in advance.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   They could have calibrated it for Felicia.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   I'm not saying they did.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   Right, but he just kind of showed it.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   But he just walked up.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   So what do you think, Jeff?
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   Is this going to be on our system soon?
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   Well, I don't know about soon.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   I think it's far off, but I think that's kind of a great thing
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   about these kind of press conferences is that it shows you--
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   it gets you excited.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   It shows you what the future holds, and I think that they showed
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   two applications for the technology.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   One was kind of that doing pantomime in front of the screen
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   to pretend like you're doing stuff, which I will admit--
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   We've seen that before.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   The iCam for PS2, isn't that the same thing?
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   The iToy, yeah.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   iToy?
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   It is, and interestingly enough, PlayStation announced their own
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   motion controller, which has been completely overshadowed
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   in the mainstream press by Microsoft's announcement.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   I'll get to that in a second.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   But then this second application of the technology,
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   which is what Peter Molyneux was showing off,
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   is really something that allows completely new take on video games.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   And I think that where people get a little stuck with this
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   from an imagination standpoint is going, "Oh, I'm just going to--
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   "It's just going to be a replacement for my controller,
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   "so I'm going to be doing the same types of things,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   "except I'm going to be pantomiming and there's going to be nothing in my hand."
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   And that's certainly one thing they were showing,
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   but the Natal also has voice recognition technology built in,
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   and Molyneux was showing off this thing where you literally walk up
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   to your television and treat it like you're looking out a window
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   and talking to another person.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   So it's interacting with games in a completely new way.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   And that person, this Milo character,
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   this little 10-year-old boy that they had mocked up for the presentation,
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   recognized people, carried on conversations with them,
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   interacted with them.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   He was recognizing things they were wearing,
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   the color of their shirt, for example.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   He could tell by the tone of your voice whether or not you were joking with him
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   or talking seriously.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   It's pretty remarkable stuff, and I think that instead of concentrating on,
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   "Oh, well, instead of a controller, I'll be waving my arm around
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   "pretending there's a tennis racket in it,"
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   I think developers are going to take this technology
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   and run with it in a completely new direction
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   where video games have never really tread before.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   And I think that's what's exciting about it.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   All right.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   And you think that this game, Milo and Nerdy, will be out soon?
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   Well, I don't know. I'm guessing probably more 2011.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   Okay, next year.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   But Sony also showed off--
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   No, wait a minute. That's two years.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   Yeah, two years.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   My math is correct.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   I'm guessing. I have nothing to base that on,
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   but it seems like it's a little far off.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   But Sony also showed a motion controller
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   that's more along the lines of what the Wii has been,
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   which is sort of a wand or remote control-looking thing,
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   and much more precise than the Wii has ever been.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   And that was actually pretty remarkable, too.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   They were showing pinpoint accuracy and depth perception with that device
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   so that it really could be the kind of thing that would replace in your hand
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   a sword or tennis racket or lots of other things.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   And they showed a moment where the guy who was demoing it
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   literally stunned an enemy and then lifted its head a couple inches with the sword,
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   put the sword under the chin of the zombie
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   and lifted the head a couple of inches before striking it.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   I mean, it's very, very precise one-to-one recognition of your movement.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   And this is going to be out soon.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   Yeah, they're saying spring of next year.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   Well, I mean, I think we're going that way, right?
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   I mean, it's kind of inevitable that we do something like this.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   The Wii's success has certainly started an arms race of arms racing.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   [laughter]
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   It's clearly the way all these companies are putting a lot of their energies in,
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   and I think that it's exciting.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   I think the good thing about the 360 and the PS3's approach
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   is that I don't think they're going to replace your controller.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   I think this is going to be a new, different way for games to be made,
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   that will be parallel to more traditional games,
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   whereas the Wii really aimed to get rid of the controller altogether.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   I love this video that Microsoft put out of Dad being the pit crew.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   So the girl gets to drive, and Dad's so happy changing her tire.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   And then--
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   It's just like real life.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   It's just like real life.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   And maybe Mom will be the highway patrol officer who pulls her over.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   I don't know.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   Yeah, it's a shame that this stuff looks so ridiculous.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   It's not a shame.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   That's kind of a fundamental problem, is that you look like--
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   Look what happened to the segue.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   You looked like a dork riding it.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   It never took off.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   I guess you could play this in the privacy of your own home.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   But if you imagine a game--
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   [laughter]
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   Without anybody else around--
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   People do Dance Dance Revolution in public.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   That's true.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   This is not much different than that.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   People who dance much better than any of us.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   I got a Wii Fit, and I got to say, I played it once,
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   and I thought, "I'm never doing this again.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   This was awful."
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   The motion controller from Sony, I agree, Jeff, is really good.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   Is it enough to pull Sony out of the basement, though?
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   Because, like you say, it's pretty overshadowed in the press.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   Well, I don't know if that will be the thing that pulls Sony out of the basement.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   I think their incredibly strong lineup of titles that they showed this year
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   will be the thing.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   That's what they need.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   They need some games.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   They showed off some amazing stuff.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   God of War III, and a game called Heavy Rain, and Uncharted 2.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   I walked away from that conference wanting to play the PS3 games
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   more than any other console.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   Yay!
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   Look, I really want the PS3 to succeed.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   I think it's a great device.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   It's a Blu-ray player.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   I have two.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   One right there, and one at home.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   And I just think it's really lacking in software.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   It just doesn't have anything great to play on it.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   So that's good news.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   You think God of War will be a good game?
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   Oh, God of War looks great.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   It looks fantastic.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   I mean, if you like really visceral, violent games--
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   Yeah, baby!
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   There's ripping heads off of people.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   It's pretty intense.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   In slow motion.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   And the reason that Paul and Ringo and Yoko were there
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   was rock band Beatles.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   Yes.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   That's more my speed.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   Clearly a large chunk of change was dropped on that presentation.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   Do you think this will sell?
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   I mean, it's aimed at people my age.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   It's aimed at people 50 and older.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   You think it'll sell?
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   Dan's a young guy, our chat room monitor.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   He says, "Yeah."
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   Yeah, because the Beatles are popular across a whole lot of demos.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   Really? Young people would want to play the Beatles songs?
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   There's still huge Beatles fans in high schools and colleges.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   Oh, all right.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   That's a relief to hear.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   Beatles are forever.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   They got a lot of press for it.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   It certainly was a successful thing to do.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   Well, cool.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   Thank you for the E3 report.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   Let me mention one more game.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   It's really the Natal thing and Sony's motion controller.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   I think they're a big deal because that kind of magic.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   It seems like, "Wow, we're really in the future."
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   And there was another game that was under the radar a little bit,
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   but a lot of the hardcore press is picking up on.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   And it really captures that magical idea also.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   And it's a game called Scribblenauts.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   Has anybody heard of it?
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   Scribblenauts?
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   Yeah, like an astronaut, but Scribblenauts.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   It's a game for the Nintendo DS, the handheld system.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   And it's absolutely--walking up to it, you wouldn't think much of it,
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   but a few minutes playing it, it really feels like magic.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   What you do, you're a little guy in a two-dimensional world,
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   and you encounter a number of problems or puzzles.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   And the way you solve them is you pull down a little keyboard
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   and type in any noun you can think of.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   And that thing magically appears in the world, functional.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   How do it know?
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   It has a library of thousands and thousands and thousands of objects.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   And they were challenging journalists to come up and stump it.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   And it's absolutely spectacular, the kind of things that are in that game.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   Outside the box thinking, somebody mentioned they were having a problem
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   getting past one of the puzzles, and they couldn't figure out how to do it.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   They were like, "You know what?
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   We can go back in time to a point when this didn't exist."
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   So they wrote Time Machine.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   And the Time Machine showed up, and they stepped into the Time Machine,
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   and they went back, and they got a group of dinosaurs
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   and went back into the Time Machine.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   - No! - Yes!
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   - Oh, I'm so getting this. - This sounds so cool!
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   It's literally anything you can think of.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   People were writing Keyboard Cat, and the Keyboard Cat would show up.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   It's absolutely stunning.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   Dracula, and somebody wrote a Cthulhu, and a Cthulhu showed up.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   Wow! I don't even know how to spell Cthulhu. That's amazing.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   Is it available now or coming?
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   No, it's coming in the fall.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   I think the DS is a really great platform. It's really done well.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   Now, Sony announced its Go, right?
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   Is that going to be important, or is that-- this is a little PSP?
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   Yes. It's interesting, because they also announced the price point,
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   which is $250.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   It's a little bit much for a handheld game.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   A DS is, what, $150?
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   Well, you can get-- the new DSi, I think, is $179, I think.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   Something like that.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   So it's still a little expensive, I would say.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   But the PSP Go is a nice redesign.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   I think it's much smaller and lighter than the original PSP,
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   but that price point just seems a little high.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   Yeah. Wow.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   It's psychologically high, because it's above that $199.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   It should have made it $199.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   $199 is the sweet spot for something, and then you can drop it as the years go on.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   But $250, it just seems out of the sweet spot.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   I like that scribble nuts. That is really neat.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   Is that for you or for your son, Denise?
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   I'm thinking both. It sounds totally creative for him.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   I would not own a DS but for having a little boy.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   It seems like, Jeff, too-- tell me if this is right--
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   you're doing a lot with motion and interactivity
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   and that kind of thing for those small platforms as well.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   We have a Tony Hawk game where you make it move by moving the device.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   Yeah, the big Tony Hawk game that was announced
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   is going to deliver a new controller,
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   much like Guitar Hero gave you a guitar,
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   they're going to ship with a skateboard.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   But that's not for a handheld device.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   But even the handheld ones, it seems like--
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   I saw a commercial on TV with Beyoncé for some kind of rhythm game.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   Yeah, it's called Rhythm Heaven.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   The DS really started this whole revolution of new ways
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   to input to all kinds of video game systems
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   because when the DS was announced, the touchscreen and the stylus
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   were looked at as a kind of bizarre innovation,
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   and that really set the stage for what Nintendo did with the Wii,
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   coming out with the motion controller for that.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   And the DS initially seems very similar to me
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   to what this Natal Target video was,
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   where it was very conventional ideas of what you could do
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   with the touchscreen and the stylus.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   And then as things went on, developers started looking at it
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   as a way to create games that were not possible before,
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   that did things that really--
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   it wasn't just shoehorning existing games into a new control scheme,
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   it was creating new types of games.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   And I think that's the exciting thing about all these motion controller devices.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   Just out of curiosity, did Apple show up there?
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   Because, I mean, seriously, I think the iPhone is turning into a gaming platform,
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   and I'm wondering if Apple made any presence at all of these three.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   I didn't see Apple, but certainly there were tons and tons
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   of developers showing off iPhone games.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   And that has really been a place for independent developers
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   or low-budget developers to put out stuff easily, quickly, and cheaply
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   on a device that can do really pretty spectacular games.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   I would say the capabilities are even better than the DS,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   but maybe not. I think it's got a faster processor.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   They claim that it's capable of better graphics than the DS.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   Yeah, yeah. Interesting.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   I like the idea of portable gaming. I really do.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   Jesse, stay in the chat room. The friend of the chat room says,
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   "Ray, Scribblenauts, if you type in Twitter, the fail whale comes up."
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   No. I love it! Okay, that's it. I'm buying it.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   I think that was a joke.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   You know, if it's a joke, I bet Scribblenauts has it before they release.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   It's very interesting. Very clever.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   Yeah, there's tons of stuff like that.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   If you type in "Scribblenauts" into Scribblenauts,
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   another version of your main character pops up.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   It's like they thought of everything.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   The developers were there as people were challenging it
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   and writing down notes of things that if people found things that weren't in it,
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   they were going to add. It's really cool.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   There must be a lot of extra bandwidth in the DS,
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   or extra memory in the DS, because to be able to include that big a database
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   with all those objects, there must be a lot of extra memory in there.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   Well, the key is that they're very simple.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   Yeah.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   Let us talk about the Obama and Google.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   We go back to our stories.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   There is a story about Google perhaps getting a little too comfy in the Obama White House.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   Two senior Google executives have joined the Obama administration since the beginning of the year.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   Eric Schmidt is on the president's advisory board on science and technology.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   And now, concerned over the company's influence inside the Beltway,
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   two consumer groups are opposing the appointment of a third Google executive to the White House.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   Consumer Watchdog and the Center for Digital Democracy asked the president not to move forward
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   with the appointment of Google Public Policy Chief Andrew McLaughlin
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   as the nation's deputy chief technology officer.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   Is this something that concerns you, Mr. Mahalo?
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   Look at him with his cigar.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   Actually, this is not good for Google because it puts them under more scrutiny.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   It's easier for them to lay low.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   There are two antitrust investigations going on right now, I guess.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   Exactly. It's just silly.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   It wouldn't be so brazen as to add all these people and then try to skirt any laws.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   Google actually is not trying to skirt any laws.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   They have a couple of issues they have to deal with with some of the stuff that we all know about
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   in terms of these antitrust issues.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   But the reason they're adding so many people is because Obama is so tech savvy
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   that he is bonding with the most tech savvy.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   Who are you going to go to? You're going to go to Google, right?
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   You can't mistake cause and correlation.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   There's a correlation between the fact that Obama is tech savvy and Google is the most tech savvy company.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   There's not some cause that Google is getting treated any differently.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   In fact, what's going to happen is Google is going to be under double the scrutiny.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   So if Google was smart, they can't control their ex-executives,
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   but if Google was really sinister, they would be not involved and you wouldn't even know.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   Yeah, that's the way to do it.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   If you're the Illuminati, you don't take a role in the White House.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   It's so obvious.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   McLaughlin is not going to be employed. He's leaving Google.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   This may be where he goes, but Google has said he's leaving us anyway.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   The big objection is that he is a former lobbyist,
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   and the Obama administration made a big deal about how they weren't going to employ a bunch of lobbyists.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   So the Consumer Watchdog and Center for Digital Democracy are both saying,
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   "Hey, we don't care if the guy was from Yahoo or Microsoft. He's an ex-lobbyist."
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   That's what we're mostly concerned with.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   Yeah, I understand that.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   Did you all see the Brian Williams special where he was cruising around the White House?
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   I wanted to see that. Was that good?
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   What was so fascinating, it was good.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   It was very interesting to get those one-on-one impressions from people.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   I'm going to BitTorrent that. Now that the Pirate Party is in power, I'm going to BitTorrent that.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   It looked like a startup in there.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   Everyone's sitting in an Air On chair.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   Everyone's got their mobile device of some kind.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   Everyone's got their iPod dock behind them in prominent view.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   Well, it's a bad crime. We had some young, smart people in there for crime.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   Thank God.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   I'm sick of the "I don't read newspapers" party in power.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   I want everyone completely tied in at every minute of every day.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   They're probably watching FriendFeed even as we speak.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   I think they're in our chat room.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   They're in there. They're everywhere.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   You don't know they're in there.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   I want to mention a great advertiser, a great friend.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   Oh, no, don't. No.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   Yes, it's time.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   I'm taking my glasses off. Are you kidding me?
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   I'm not kidding you. No, I'm not kidding.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   Yes. Is it that time?
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   It's that time. It's the time Jason loves so very, very much.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   It's that Scott just got real.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   It's time.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   I can't believe it. I've been waiting.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   Jason, I think you just passed the mission completion test.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   Yes. Mission completed for Jason.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   Audible, audible, moving on.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   Audible, audible, audible. Let me tell you something about Audible.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   I just got another Audible book that I'm going to be listening to
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   when I go to the World Series of Poker, which I may be playing in.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   What? Tell us about that. Wait a minute.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   If I can free my schedule up, I'm going to the World Series of Poker.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   No, that just means you start at a table, you put $10,000 in,
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   and you hope you get farther, right?
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   Well, listen, the last three tournaments I played in,
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   I got in the top 15th to 25th, so it's not bad.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   We'd love to be able to root for you in the World Series of Poker.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000]   That'd be fun. Listen, I had sponsors for the last two.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   I got sponsored for the last two.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000]   Anyway, The Road is a movie coming out.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   Cormac McCarthy. What a great book.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   Now, I haven't read the book, but I see the trailer for this,
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   and the immediate thing I say to myself is, "This looks amazing."
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000]   I start seeing Oprah's on Oprah's Book Club, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   And I say, "You know what? I don't have time to read this,
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   but I have Audible."
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000]   So what do I do? Just two seconds, bang.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   Now I got it. It's sitting there on the iPhone.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   Just don't listen to it in the public. At the end, you will cry.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   Listen, I'm sure I'm going to cry. Audible has made me cry many times.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   That's why he has the glasses.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   You know who shouldn't listen to it is you, Denise, because it's about--
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   well, maybe you should listen to it.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   And I got no spoilers!
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   No spoilers!
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   I love Cormac McCarthy, but I haven't read that one yet.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   This one's about father and son. It's a beautiful book.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   Highly recommended.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   And there's two versions on Audible.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   So if you have the new membership and you get two, and you love the book,
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   get the second.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   No, don't get the same book twice!
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   All right, don't get the same book twice.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   That's terrible advice.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   But you can get The Road, and like Jason, you can listen to it
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   in the coming weeks before the film comes out.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   And then get No Country for Old Men, the other Cormac McCarthy,
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   or All the Pretty Horses.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   You can really do a Cormac McCarthy fest.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   This is what it's about, because you can get in there,
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   you can really get into something.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   And let's face it, we all have eye fatigue from being on our computers all day,
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   and we all have iPhones, iPods, this and that.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   It's just so nice to sit back and have somebody else do the reading for you.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   When I'm on flights, when I'm in the gym, when I'm in the car in the Tesla,
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000]   it's just what I do.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   I'm at the poker table, I listen to audiobooks on Audible.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   This is a genuine--
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   Can I tell you guys something?
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   Yes.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   I just completed my third marathon.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   Oh, congratulations!
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   Wow, that's impressive.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   Thank you.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   And the way I train for marathons is I listen to Twit,
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   and I listen to audiobooks as I run.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   Oh, that's great.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   What a great idea.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   I didn't even think of that.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000]   Anytime you can't hold a book you want to read,
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000]   there's no reason to put your mind on hold,
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   unless you need that downtime.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   Listening to a great book is just wonderful.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   It's entertaining, but informative.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   You can learn.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   I thank you for this choice, because I actually have listened to this
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   on Audible.com, and it's a wonderful book.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   In fact, I didn't really like the print edition,
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   and I got the Audible edition, and I loved it.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   The Road by Cormac McCarthy.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000]   Get the unabridged.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   Is there a sample?
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   Yeah, you want to hear a little bit of it?
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   Just a little sample, because I haven't listened to it.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   I can do that.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000]   Tom Stechschult reads it, and he's really one of their best readers.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   The soft ash blowing in loose swirls over the blacktop.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   He studied what he could see.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000]   The segments of road among the dead trees,
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   looking for anything of color, any movement,
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   any trace of standing smoke.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   He lowered the glasses and pulled down the cotton mask from his face
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   and wiped his nose on the back of his wrist.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   I got to say, it's always better to listen to the book
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000]   before you see the movie, because the book,
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   especially when you listen on Audible,
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000]   paints a picture in your head that becomes the story.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000]   When you listen to a book, it's like a movie in your mind.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   I love it.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   Get two books.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000]   Get this and, let's say, No Country for Old Men,
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   another great Cormac McCarthy novel,
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000]   by going to audible.com/twit2.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000]   You sign up for the Platinum account.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   You get two books a month.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   Your first two are on us, and this is, I thank you, Jason,
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   a great recommendation.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   And also, you don't--maybe not know this,
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   but Christopher Walken also read this book.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000]   Let me just play a little sample here of that.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   Is it okay if I play the sample?
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   Yeah, go ahead. Play the sample.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   Play the sample.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   He lowered his glasses and wiped his nose
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   and looked at the wind-safe landscape.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   The world was different.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   Wow.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   It's incredible.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   It's moving.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   It's even more moving.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   You can get to Christopher Walken as your third choice,
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   reading it.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000]   Anyway, we love Audible.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   We love you, Jason.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000]   Thank you so much.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   Thank you.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   You know, I got to do this.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000]   I have a--I don't know if you've ever heard this, Jason,
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   but somebody made a special Audible jingle for us.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   What?
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   No.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   Yeah, let me see if I can find it.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000]   That's impossible.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   With you in it.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   Well, while you're looking, I can mention
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   the Sword and Laser Book Club will be announcing
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   their next book in the next episode.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   It's probably going to be George R. R. Martin,
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   A Game of Thrones.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   Oh, that's on Audible.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   All four of those, Storm of Fire and Sword of Ice
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   and whatever it is.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   Song of Ice and Fire.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000]   Yeah, all four of them are on there.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   They're great.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   You know, listen to the man, Fell in Love.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000]   She doesn't like these kinds of books.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   It's Roz.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   Roz Savage is rowing across the Pacific right now.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   These audio books are saving her life.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   And she's a huge George R. R. Martin fan
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   because I had that book on my iPod when I gave it to her.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   And she said, "Where's the rest of them?"
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   And I downloaded them just for her.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000]   It's about 800 hours.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000]   I mean, it goes on.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   Yeah, he hasn't finished yet.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000]   Oh, you mean there's more to that saga?
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   I think each of them is 40 hours.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   I mean, it's a huge thing.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000]   I can't find the one with Jason.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000]   It's so funny.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000]   I think it's tinyurl.com/jasonlovesaudible.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000]   You're kidding.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000]   Are you kidding me?
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   tinyurl.com/jasonlovesaudible.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000]   Somebody just posted it in the chat room.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   (laughs)
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000]   That must be, I can't remember who made it.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   It must be the guy who made it.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   Let me just type this in here and see if we can find it here.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   That's hysterical.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   Is it like the jingle, like, "Audible, da da da da da?"
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000]   Yeah, it's kind of, except that it's got you moaning in it.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000]   (laughs)
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   Can I ask a question about book clubs, though?
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   If you're in a book club, if you don't read the book
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   and you listen to the audiobook--
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   That counts.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   But if you confess that to people who look--
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   ♪ On your way to work, on your way to school ♪
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000]   ♪ When you can't read a book, don't be a fool ♪
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.000]   ♪ Get Audible, over 50,000 books ♪

[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   That's another one.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000]   There's one with you moaning in it, too.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   What, is it Audible?
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   It's probably moaning.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000]   Yeah, you go, "Oh."
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   (moans)
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   That's something we didn't mention, by the way,
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000]   about the Bing search, "full sound."
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   Full sound, really?
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000]   Hey-oh!
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   Good callback.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000]   So don't go to work and do those searches, then, I guess.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000]   Oh, it's in the TwitLive chat room.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000]   Here we go, "Audible Calc."
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   Oh, that's another one.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000]   No, it's the same one.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   I think you just created the music video for that song.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000]   I think I did, yes.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   Somebody's complaining about me.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   And if Keyboard Cat shows up, I wouldn't be at all surprised.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   Why did I do that?
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000]   All right, last story.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000]   The news is out.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000]   Best Buy has leaked a memo that says,
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000]   "Windows 7 upgrades will sell for as little as $50."
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   Awesome.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   This is, I think, exactly what Microsoft should have done.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   Starting June 26th, we're talking 19 days away, 18 days away,
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000]   and Gadget posted this Best Buy memo.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000]   The official on-sale date is October 22nd,
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000]   and the memo, which dubbed Windows 7 as more than, quote,
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000]   "Just a Vista that works operating system."
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000]   (laughs)
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000]   Is that their tagline now?
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   It's more than just Vista that works.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   No, we've got even some new features.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000]   "Pre-sale of Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional,
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   $49.99 and $99.99, respectively.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   Buy the Home Premium, $50. That's for upgraders from Vista."
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   That is what Microsoft, I think, needs to do to make whole
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000]   all the people who had such trouble with Vista.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000]   So that is really, really good news.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000]   I hope that that's not a fake, but I don't think it is.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   I think Gadget's got a really good track record on these things.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   We got an email from a Best Buy employee saying the same thing.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   Same thing?
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000]   Same thing before that post hit, around the same time that post hit.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   So they weren't just reading it.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   Yeah, that's great news.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   I wanted Microsoft to do something like that.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   That's actually even a better price than I had thought.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000]   What's the price exactly?
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000]   $50.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000]   See, this is what they should make all operating systems,
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   should be like $50 and then $20 a year after that,
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   and you just subscribe.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   So for the rest of your life, you have the operating system.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   I don't like this spiky pricing, and then it goes back down.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000]   Just make it like a subscription model.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   Well, you want sticker shock.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   I don't know.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000]   Most people buy Windows by buying a new computer,
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000]   so they never see the price.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000]   But go to Staples and say,
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   "I want to buy the full version of Windows Vista,"
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   and you will fall over dead in your tracks.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000]   It's like $399.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000]   It's insulting.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000]   No, I did that and turned right around and left.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   Yes.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000]   And went and found an OEM version online for half the price.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000]   And that's what's dumb about it is because Microsoft is missing out
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000]   on some sales by having outrageous pricing, I think.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   And encouraging piracy.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000]   Encouraging piracy, you absolutely are.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000]   Just make it easy for people.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000]   This is why the Android netbooks are going to crush it.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000]   Crush it.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000]   Well, but this is what I have to say.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000]   I mean, you couldn't get Windows Vista on a netbook because it was such a pig,
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000]   but Windows 7 runs beautifully.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   I've put it on a number of netbooks.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   It's made for netbooks.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000]   It really runs beautifully.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000]   It runs better in virtualization, too,
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000]   because I've got it running on VirtualBox and VMware, both clean and simple.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000]   It's beautiful.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   It's really good.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000]   In fact, I think I got some ire because on a Mac break weekly a couple of weeks ago,
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   we do picks, and my pick was VirtualBox and Windows 7.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000]   And I think a few Mac fans said, "What, are you insane?"
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000]   But some of us have to run Windows, and it's really, for free, a good deal.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000]   What does this do for video games?
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000]   Because that was like the reason I still have my Tower PC here to the left
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000]   and I have my Mac and I switch them is because of video games.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000]   Is Windows 7 fully compliant with all the great PC video games?
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000]   Yes.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000]   Absolutely.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000]   If I were running it on a Mac, I'd probably run it on Boot Camp for video games.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   Don't run it in virtualization.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   Right, of course.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000]   No, but the point is 7 really is Vista.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000]   Vista drivers work.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000]   Compatibility is 100%, but it's lightweight,
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000]   so you're going to get much better results with your games.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000]   Has that been your experience, Jeff, that the PC games run well?
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000]   Yeah, they do.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000]   And $50 is exactly the point at which I will rush out and buy it.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   Yes.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   Otherwise, I would have probably waited until the next time I upgraded.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000]   Stolen it.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   Stolen it.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.000]   Well, and that's what people got to realize is your competition is not Mac and Linux.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000]   Your competition is BitTorrent.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.000]   You know, if you charge too much, most people who would buy it know how to steal it.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000]   Yeah, they get a copy from their friend or borrow their friend's copy.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000]   And as I understand it, that $50 price is only for the pre-order.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000]   Like once it actually comes out, I think it goes up to $99.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000]   Okay, well, that's good to know.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000]   It might not be something worth investigating.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000]   I mean, all this is rumor at this point anyway.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000]   Right.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:05.000]   If Microsoft was smart, they would make this free, put it on the Internet for, you know,
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000]   with a subscription model on the back end or something like that.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000]   Yeah, you might be right.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000]   In effect, they have.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000]   They've given it away free to everybody for a year.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000]   This beta is as good as the final version.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000]   So they did give the first one free, you know, in a way.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]   Yeah, it works until, what, March 2010?
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000]   March 2010.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000]   And then it works for another three months but shuts off every two hours.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000]   Which is probably good.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000]   Get outside, get some fresh air, get some fresh air in this program.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000]   I like that way too.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000]   That's a good way to enforce the copyright.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000]   It's like, hey, listen, you can still get your stuff off of it, but, you know, just you can't work on it for too long.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.000]   I think this is an important lesson for just pundits and also technology companies.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000]   Microsoft makes mistakes.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:50.000]   Sometimes they look really stupid because they take a lot of chances and they go big and it's a big company.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000]   But, man, in the long term, they solve things.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000]   I mean, Xbox, the next version of the Zune is incredible.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000]   Zune 2 looks beautiful.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000]   That HD, yeah, I'm excited about that.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000]   People criticize Microsoft.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   Microsoft's problem is they release stuff too often, too early.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   But that's a great business strategy, and so why should they stop?
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000]   The Xbox people didn't like it.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:18.000]   The other thing we didn't talk about with E3 is all of the really cool Xbox Live announcements with fully integrating Netflix,
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:24.000]   Last.FM on your 360, Facebook, Twitter on your 360.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000]   It's all smart stuff and it's all free.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000]   Yeah, I'm going to do that.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000]   Now all they have to do is make an Xbox 360 that doesn't keep me awake at night and I will be very--
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000]   Doesn't sound like an airplane.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   You can Twitter, you know.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000]   But if they can get us--
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000]   You can hear your movie, you can watch Netflix.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:47.000]   There's a company apparently making--I don't know if they show this at E3--making an Xbox 360 case that has all these heat sinks on it,
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]   and so it eliminates all the fans and stuff.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]   I'm tempted, I have to say.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000]   I'd love to have the Xbox 360 in my living room or my bedroom, but the thing is just way too noisy.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000]   It's in the garage.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000]   I'm with you, Jeff.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   I'm really excited about that Netflix that you can search the catalog instead of being limited to having to go to the queue.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000]   Wait a minute. I didn't understand that.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000]   That's the big announcement. It's not just that you have Netflix.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000]   But it does have to be a play it now.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000]   It has to be a streaming movie.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000]   Yeah, it has to be a streaming movie, obviously.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000]   But you don't have to go to the web and make your queue up anymore.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000]   You can just search the whole catalog.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   What does 1080p require?
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000]   Does it require hardwire, or can you do it over Wi-Fi, you think?
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000]   HDMI, I think.
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   No, I just mean for the internet access.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000]   You'd have to have a pretty good--
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000]   Well, they're saying streaming instantly, no wait.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000]   Yeah, this I don't buy.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000]   I haven't seen it in action yet.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000]   Well, you know what it does?
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:40.000]   From what I've heard is it does the little pixelation thing at first, so it's not HD until it catches up, and then it kind of upgrades it.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000]   That's a good way to do it.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000]   That's okay.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000]   Hey, I want to thank everybody for being here.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000]   You guys are great.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000]   Let's go around and give me your Twitter handles.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000]   Here's a chance for you to plug your Twitter handle.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000]   Tom Merritt?
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000]   You can go to me first because it takes the longest.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000]   Well, you've got the most ridiculous Twitter handle.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000]   Yeah, well, it's twitter.com/acedetect, without an E in the middle.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000]   A-C-E-D-T-E-C-T.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000]   Or you can go to twitter.com/tommerritt and find it.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000]   Oh, yeah? So you have Tom Merritt, and you still choose to use Acedetect?
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000]   It's a long story.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000]   [laughter]
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000]   Jason's easy. He's Jason Calacanis.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.000]   Yeah. More importantly, do /questions.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000]   Yeah, that's good. That's the Mahalo questions account.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000]   Yeah, the best questions.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000]   Great stuff, by the way.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000]   Pretty cool.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.000]   Denise, your Twitter account?
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000]   Dhowell.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   D-H-O-W-E-L-L.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000]   And on FriendFeed.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.000]   And on FriendFeed, which I don't know. I know Jason says it's too complicated, but you and I are using--
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000]   I see you using FriendFeed more and more. I really love FriendFeed.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000]   Yeah, I love it, too.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000]   It's where I live now.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000]   Jeff, you are?
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:51.000]   Jeff Cannata. That's J-E-F-F-C-A-N-N-A-T-A.
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:59.000]   You can catch Jeff on the totally rad show at revision3.com/TRS with some guy named Alex.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000]   I don't know.
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000]   Another guy named Dan.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000]   Some guy named Dan. Say hi to them, will you?
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000]   Me?
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000]   For me.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000]   Everybody.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000]   Yeah, my old friends.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:14.000]   You can catch Tom Merritt on Buzz Out Loud, their 1000th episode coming up Thursday, but make sure you follow it.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000]   Thursday, June 18th.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000]   June 18th. Not this Thursday.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000]   Week from this Thursday.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000]   Yeah, week from Thursday.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000]   It's B-O-L.C-N-N-I-T-H.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000]   You're counting down to 200.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   202 shows? I don't know what I'm going to do, Denise.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000]   Have a good time.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000]   Yeah, I don't have anything planned.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000]   Well, I'd say we'll drink, but that's--
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000]   Wait, the 200th show?
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000]   Huh?
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000]   Oh, my God, the 200th show?
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000]   Yeah, this is what I came for.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000]   I'm hosting a party for you.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000]   Oh, thank you.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000]   Jason Calacanis.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000]   What is that, two weeks?
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000]   You know, we'll just have everybody come in.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000]   It'll be fun.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000]   Yeah, we'll have a big party.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:47.000]   We have to have a four-hour show live in a place in San Francisco, live 1,000 people.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000]   Let's rent a space and make a whole thing out of it.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000]   That's actually a great idea.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:54.000]   I don't know if we could do it in two weeks, but I appreciate the thought.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000]   Come on, I'll give you Tyler and Alex.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000]   That's true, with some good, smart people, we could do it.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000]   We could go kitty, put them there, boom.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000]   Done.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000]   Jason Calacanis is at Mahalo.com, M-A-H-A-L-O.com, but make sure--
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000]   Two o'clock.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.000]   You also follow his shows, This Week in Startups.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000]   Thank you.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000]   Where should people go if they want to watch that?
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000]   Thisweekinstartups.com.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000]   Oh, well, that's easy.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000]   Yeah.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000]   All right.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000]   Did anybody I missed?
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000]   I miss anybody, Jeff?
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000]   I talked to you, I talked to Denise.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000]   Oh, yeah, I'm @LeoReport on Twitter.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000]   Thank the sponsors in your Twitter account.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000]   Right now, everybody take a moment, say thank you to Twitch sponsors.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000]   Go to my PC.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000]   Squarespace, Audible, yes.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000]   And Audible.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000]   Just thank all three.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000]   Those guys now are going to get hundreds of messages from you, the audience,
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000]   and they're going to say, "You know what?
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000]   There's only three spots on Twit.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000]   We have to buy them for the rest of the year."
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000]   And I'm telling the sponsors right now, "We're going to do this every show,
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000]   and you're going to need to buy these for the rest of the year.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000]   And if you don't send the check in advance, you don't get it for the year.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000]   Payment comes first, and then you've got it locked up for the year."
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000]   This is how he does business.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000]   I'm not quite so hardcore.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:03.000]   Hey, I want to thank Paul Mintchall at Pollywood.com for making some ringtones.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000]   In fact, if you start your recorder right now, you'll get some of the new --
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.000]   these are the new Twit ringtones, everybody.
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000]   Screw you.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.000]   [music]
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000]   Screw you.
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:23.000]   [music]
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000]   Screw you.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:38.000]   [music]
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000]   [laughter]
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000]   Genius.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000]   Genius.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000]   Leo, your best moment ever, literally.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000]   Literally.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000]   You troll.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000]   You left out -- you troll.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000]   You're a troll.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000]   This is going to be the greatest remix ever.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.000]   I'm telling you right now, whoever does the best remix of this,
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000]   I'm giving them a ticket to TechCrunch '50.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:15.000]   [music]
