Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's great to have you both we have a lot of stories that you will have something to say about  No doubt I suppose though we should begin  Because the time is running out on Twitter  Not the company just the logo just the name just the bird  Elon got up in the middle of the night last night. It started tweeting  Always a bad idea  He wants to get rid of the bluebird and replace it with an X  He  He said interim logo goes live later today, which is why I want to do this story now in fact for all I know  It's already live  Remember the company that owns Twitter the parent company is called X  In fact, I don't think there is a company called Twitter anymore. I think he renamed Twitter to X Corp  And it sounded as if  The richest man in the world just asked Twitter users to come up with a logo for him because he can't afford it I  Don't know they also want to change the color scheme from blue to black  And now I got it. Just check and see it's maybe another one of those Elon Musk's. I know how to get press  Moments. Yeah, it's still a bluebird  You know, there's a name for this bird  Did you know that what's the name of this bird  I didn't know it either, but it was a jeopardy question. So I figured it's got to be true  And I forgotten now. What is the name of the Twitter bird?  It was like Jack Bird's name is Joey X. Well circle Larry. Joey the bird. No Larry Larry the bird  Larry the bird Larry as in Larry bird. I see where this is going Celtics great  Biz Stone tweeted the name was chosen to honor Larry bird of the Boston Celtics  But I've never heard that before  But I I did get the answer right in my mind because I they you know  They said a social media site with a bird is a logo named Larry  But that's gotta be Twitter  So no more Larry and apparently no more bird except it hasn't happened yet  What do you so do you guys have an opinion on Elon because you know, we're all wondering what the hell

Start time: 426.96
End time: 451.46
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  I mean, we do have an opinion on Elon. What's your opinion on your Alex? Well, I'll start I I mean  Obviously the guy is a very talented entrepreneur. I think you can't really take away what he's built at  Tesla and at SpaceX and this idea of like the boring company is kind of cool  And who knows maybe his X AI company will turn into something  I mean he is also the founder of open AI or co-founder of open AI and

Start time: 452.56
End time: 464.10
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know PayPal so yeah, but he pulled out an AI when they said we're gonna make a profit and now he's doing  He knows another way he got in the press last week. He announced he's gonna do what an AI that's not gonna eat the world

Start time: 465.36
End time: 505.74
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  So yeah, we'll see we'll see what it turns into but he looks when you make announcements like this  I'm looking into what are the resources behind it and who do you hire and he's bought a bunch of GPUs from Nvidia  And he's hired people from DeepMind and University of Toronto  But you know how he's hired them by offering them inflated stock  Trick them into thinking but these people are smart like, you know, they they are they are worth a lot of money  They know that and listen anyone who spent time talking with folks working in Silicon Valley  knows that they are extremely aware of the way that they get paid and  It's very difficult to pull the wool over their eyes  So I think that they probably understood what they were getting into with Elon

Start time: 506.22
End time: 528.66
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But now he's valued is I think he's gonna call it truth GD at 20 billion dollars  And then goes to the biggest names in AI  You know the the real thinkers the doers the coders and says I know I'll give you 1%  which is worth 200 million dollars if you come on over and  They should really be thinking twice

Start time: 529.52
End time: 557.64
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  How many employees get 1% of a company right as at the start? So look is it gonna work out?  No, but it would a lot of like people in Silicon Valley say this is a worthwhile shot to take  I get 1% of a company that Elon Musk is founding. That's why people are taking the shot  I don't think that they like they know they can't cash out that stock and say from the day one that they're gonna be able  to make that money, but  You know 1% of a company is definitely nothing to sneeze at most people like, you know  You start you got a couple of basis points and you're thrilled 1% isn't bad

Transcript:  But I think let's take it back to Larry Bird  And  The fact that twitter.com is still blue and  Full of birds. I think Alex and I always get into this on our weekly segments about Elon  He spoke he made a major claim whether he follows through on it  I think this is the thing that in the medium to long term Elon is very  Interesting in the day to day in the short term. I think it's best to try to ignore him  It's very tough to do that, but I still wonder for me Linda Jacarino  What is she thinking? How is she gonna approach this because I mean from the business side trying to convince advertisers  especially with the rise of threads that we are a stable place come here come do business and  This is happening. I cannot imagine how tough those calls are

Start time: 611.40

Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  She had a very interesting tweet about this X thing  Where she talks a little bit about what the strategy of Twitter is gonna be  So X if you think about it is sort of this cross section and that's what she talks about X is the future state of  Unlimited interactivity now listen, there's a lot of cringe going on in this tweet  But let's just pay attention to the details for a second. She says it's gonna be centered in audio video messaging  payments and banking  Creating a global marketplace for ideas goods and services and opportunities powered by AI X will connect us alls all in ways  We're just beginning to imagine and she talked about how people this is sizing Twitter

Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  Interactivity. Okay. I had not seen that I see that that was about until you hit the rate limit  until we  Luckily, I must have hit the rate limit at that point  But man poor Linda just selling selling an ad just delivering a stable ad product  I think is the most important test right now versus trying to build the super app of the future and we've talked about this again  Perhaps that is an opportunity. Perhaps Elon is the one that can deliver it  But I don't know I still this kind of day-to-day operation, especially when your business is  Advertising I cannot see how this is gonna come out on the other side. Okay. Yeah, I'm with you after everything

Start time: 706.94
End time: 719.66
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  I said about you line the caveat is that what he's done with Twitter has been detrimental to him  I mean objectively bad for him and all of his businesses would be including his new AI company would be better off if he  Sold Twitter and that's what I think he should do

Start time: 720.62
End time: 740.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think what may happen is it goes bankrupt and the and the 13 billion dollars worth of bank equity  gets taken back and  Banks own it and I think maybe that's even what Elon would like because at this point I feel like well  Who knows what Elon wants? So he wants just nuts. I don't know what he's looking for

Transcript:  Square is that's what I've always dreamed it's always struck me  I almost hate doing Elon's stories because it feel I feel played when I do an Elon story  It always strikes me that he woke at midnight and saw it. Well, hey, I haven't been I haven't been  Presented writing about me in about 48 hours  What can I say that will get me a lot of coverage and that's oh, I will rename it X and give us yours thoughts  For our new logo and Bing bada-bung. We're talking about it  He seems like a manipulator of the media more than anything else to me, but he is a newsworthy person though

Start time: 781.62
End time: 801.64
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  I mean, he definitely is a media manipulator, but he is he does own Twitter, which is a very important social network  Maybe the second most important and then like he does I mean SpaceX and Tesla like he did he commands the coverage  I have to be better at covering him, but I certainly news where they snuck a spy into the

Start time: 954.93
End time: 1044.18
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  Yeah  Alex and I talked about this last week on our podcast. I think that  Coming out as strong as they did and making such a big deal about making it to a hundred million users was actually a big mistake  I think they even though they claim that they did no quote-unquote  Promotion Mark Zuckerberg had it threaded or posted to threads or whatever. We will call it  I think they clearly you know leveraged whatever they had at their disposal if you have you downloaded the app  Oh, I'm on it. Yeah, so it basically your Instagram  It you know pulls over all of your contacts it allows you to instantly follow everyone  You don't even have to enter information to create an account  So they clearly made it as frictionless as possible and leverage their billion strong Instagram user base  But now it's got to be interesting and normally I mean I really was thinking back what communities have succeeded  again YouTube  Succeeds it starts with creators homegrown creators people who really make their way up on the platform even Twitter if you think about it  It developed so well and so strongly because it developed its own voice it developed its own community  You know getting to a hundred million users who are not sure what to expect  Having Paris Hilton tweeting at Taco Bell and Netflix and Spotify and everyone else trying to be funny  I feel does not make for a sticky community driven platform. So I don't know

Transcript:  They got the brands to move right over there as fast as possible at even quite a few celebrity names  that's that's kind of  In latter-day Twitter was the thing that people said they stayed on Twitter for  the news the news brands the consumer brands  and the celebrities I

Start time: 1067.46
End time: 1106.32
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  Don't know. Yeah, and and I think it's an existential business threat  Twitter whether or not people stick around but again they are and  Alex wrote about this. I mean what how early advertisers is gonna get on there whether it's q4 this year  I mean, I think they are going to get every advertiser over there who's gonna run away from  x.com slash Twitter and  and they want a safe place to go and they want a place they can trust and  Meta owns  Advertisers and it's another place to go and they're gonna get every one of those ad budgets away from whatever is left at Twitter

Start time: 1106.64
End time: 1170.64
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's more than a safe place. It's metas ad platform, which is just able to target people and  Optimize in a way that's far better than any other social platform could dream of and Twitter certainly has never held a candle to  So I think when you talk to advertisers, they're not saying well, I want you know a place where like I have a more politically correct  Environment to put my audit my message in front of people  They just said we want platforms that can make our customers money and the meta ad platform is so good that  That's where we spend our time on meta and on Google and everything else is an afterthought  And this is kind of more of that in terms of the monetization potential of threads  but yeah, I mean it's like Ron John's totally right here that the the  overhyping of the user numbers in the beginning was a terrible mistake and just my experience I've been using threads a lot in my  experience there has been that the  The the usage is is just an engagement is way way down and growth has tailed off completely which leads me to believe that  You know, they hit that a hundred million user number pretty quickly, but they their curve must have just flattened

Start time: 1176.00
End time: 1211.58
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  Maybe people are just giving up on this format altogether. That's what I'm wondering. Yes, I mean, that's what's happened to me  Maybe it's the end of social, you know  Exactly. Well, it's like definitely like you you used to so the utility of these platforms was to know what happens in the moment  right and Twitter has because of Elon's algorithmic ranking changes and the end of verification of people that were making news has  Made that PC utility, you know much less vital  To the platform and then threads doesn't even want news on it. So it's like and your blue skies too small  So when Tony Bennett passed away god bless him RIP

Start time: 1214.54
End time: 1227.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Didn't learn about it on Twitter or on threads  Used to be that's where you'd find out if or at least go if you heard somebody passed  That's where you'd go, but I don't I don't think that that's the case anymore. That's just one example, obviously

Start time: 1228.08
End time: 1276.54
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  but the reason yeah, the reason that Twitter has been so  Has struggled to grow past 200 million users or 300 million users if you go monthly is  Because most of the population is totally okay getting their news on news sites and they don't need to know it that second  they can know it five minutes later when it's on like NY times comm or the Wall Street Journal and  You know while these platforms degrades, this is sort of the point I was building up to when these platforms degrade the  200 million or 300 million of us on Twitter and addicted Twitter  We are we are forced to go back to home pages again, and many people are gonna be like well, that's not too bad  And maybe I'll do that instead of yeah being on this app that makes me angry and is filled with outrage and you know  Just you know disgusting stuff and chat GPT influencers. I hope you're right

Start time: 1278.18

Start time: 1289.92
End time: 1357.26
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  I think that's a good point because even for me that question there  There's definitely been a transition period where I'm looking for someone to tell me what's happening right now  About everything and then after a few days you start to realize maybe you don't need to know  What's happening right now about everything at that moment?  Yeah, I mean I've started opening the New York Times app more like starting  Wow  News app wow going to a news app. It's like 2011 all over again. This is the future  Yeah, I mean it is and also  Being more topical and specific of only looking for things that I want to know about  Actually tech meme and going to their actual site sites like that. I think curators of news that you trust  I think all of these are gonna become much much more valuable than  We were all spoiled because again if you had built your Twitter feed in a way in a smart way  That really was the perfect way to tell you exactly what was happening, but it's just not the case anymore

Start time: 1357.60
End time: 1386.47
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's funny because I've been going to tech meme for probably a decade and a half  As my as almost my home page on the internet, but I am doing tech news. So that's the first place I go  But that's interesting because that is a very old-school style of site where they're aggregating  Stories from other news sites  And and they used to do it Gabe used to do it  Automatically now has editors and they do it manually. It's it is a very old-school  aggregator

Start time: 1387.60
End time: 1420.68
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  Yeah, but then even what I love that they do even add a bit of context any headline to try to add their own perspective  curate  tweets skeets threads whatever else they built into the CMS right now, but I think  It's it's it does a good job of for a community of telling you what's going on  Obviously how you do that across different interest areas and communities is definitely not solved right now  And maybe maybe doesn't get solved in the way it was before that's what's old is new again

Start time: 1420.76
End time: 1427.44

Transcript:  I knew that this would be a story for you guys for sure  Given your interest in finance and so forth  For the longest time in the US if we want to send payments to friends  We'd use the Venmo or PayPal or cat the cash app  It turns out and I did not know this in the rest of the world  Their governments provided clearing houses that were free and widely available and instantaneous  We just never had one in the US the Federal Reserve Bank has now launched it. It's called Fed now an  Instant payment service that costs nothing  Now of course, it's got to attach to your bank and your bank may end up charging you even though it costs nothing  For the Fed to do it. They're launching with 41 banks 15 service providers including JP Morgan  Chase Bank of New York Mellon  Bank Corp they plan to add more banks and credit unions as the year goes by  You know, the Fed has always run a clearing house that's taken days you write remember writing checks  You'd write a check you put it in the mail put a five cent stamp on it and you put it in the mailbox  They don't have any of that anymore by the way  And then it would arrive and the dentist's office would take it and they would cash it and the and the bank they cashed  That would send it to the federal clearing house, which you know, I think somebody  with sleeve garters and a green visor would look at it and then stamp it and then three or four days later that money would  Be transferred over from your account to the dentist. It would clear  That's how we did it until recently and I think the Fed is finally caught up with the 21st century  and the rest of  The world thoughts on Fed now you covered the bank the SVB bank run one one  Consideration I know Ron Chum was that this would really supercharge a bank run in the future make it a lot easier

Start time: 1560.94

Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  No, but I still I think this is a huge story because I think this is a perfect example of  Something a friction that has existed in industry over the last  15 20 years that  Anyone who has traveled anyone who has friends who live abroad especially in Europe or in Asia?  Who can send money to each other instantly? They don't think about what's the fee gonna be?  Is it a wire transfer? What app do I have to use all this stuff just works and it should work here  It should money should move back and forth very quickly  and I think it's a good it's a good reminder that sometimes, you know, like a  Federal centralized  Program like this that would be most efficient actually is the right solution  I think obviously the cryptocurrency dream that was sold for a long time around  instant payments and  You know ability to send money. Why can't you send money on a Saturday or when the bank is closed?  I think it's finally time that that becomes reality

Transcript:  Yeah, but it's it's also a good reminder again  I think public private partnerships and the potential for them and where they can work well  And this is always with payments having one centralized source that was connected to every individual bank  That could basically as you said as Alex said live the crypto dream and be that ledger  It does not need to be decentralized exactly centralized and it can match payments instantly  I think and then I mean banks can profit off of this and that's okay  I think you know, it's how much they charge and that level of competition  Obviously, it'll just kind of continue within the banking industry, but having that underlying infrastructure  I mean anyone again coming from a trading background, especially I worked in emerging market trading  So seeing how kind of you know, an efficient infrastructure could then grow entire economies or just help other things happen  I think it was a reminder that you know, it's something that's been lacking in the US for a while  I don't know how long ago you were at B of A Ron John

I think we're a reminder that it's this it's this eternal tension between friction  Especially when it comes to financial services, but remember Venmo had a lot of issues  Especially in its early days when it was trying to grow around fraud or illicit use at utility utilization  so I think it's just payments always a reminder that you know, it's a battle of between friction and

Transcript:  Utilities yeah, he's in utility this hysterical because I I'm with a bank that is not signing up for Fed now so far  they have a bill pay service and  Most of the time it's not an ACH the bank prints a check which they put in the mail sent to the payee  Why is it in the United States where we should be on the cutting edge?  We are so far behind every other country in the world  How does Canada or or France or any of these other countries? How do they handle the fraud issue?  How does the Fed propose to handle a fraud issue banks have said we don't want to be responsible if  If you if you Zelle somebody money, that's your problem, dude  We're not going to give it to you back if it turns out to be fraudulent

Transcript:  Yeah, one of the problems with that's happened with Zelle again is if you  Accidentally send to the wrong person right you send too much money  But I think these kind of things these are just like UX challenges, right?  These are however these things are built when Venmo started there was no two-factor authentication  So, you know like at a time where you don't even need a secondary input someone could grab your phone and send money  So I think you know every single bank  Maybe the Fed as part it to be part of the program does put some liability on the banks  Which would force them to put in some additional checks because remember so far with Zelle  Banks have been so desperate to compete against Venmo on volume  That they would do anything to get you over there and they remove all friction to get you to use Zelle  In the hopes that you switch away from Venmo now if they have a better more secure solution that works very well  Adding an extra button adding an extra. Are you sure you want to send it to this person?  Can you check the amount these kind of things? I don't think it's no longer  Going to kneecap them versus what was happening where they're trying to compete against Venmo. Yeah

Transcript:  You know, I used to say Zelle is fine  It's no worse on the radio show people would have because there were as another finance radio host who used to rail against Zelle  Probably for reasons of his own but uh, people would say well you shouldn't you shouldn't use Zelle  I said well if you it's no different than Venmo or PayPal or frankly an ATM machine  If you take money out of an ATM machine because somebody walked up to you and said hey, I can't get home  Can you give me 20 bucks for gas?  And you gave them that money?  Uh, the bank's not liable for that. Why should the bank be liable for that?  So i'm, not sure I really understand why people think the bank should be liable for a Zelle transaction  But i'm glad that they are at least kind of warning people that don't fall for this and don't fall for that

Uh is stepping back  It started with a uh injunction the ftc asked the courts to say hey  We're investigating this acquisition. Can you can you can you issue a temporary restraining order so they cannot?  Uh get together the judge took testimony from everybody from satya nadella from sony from everybody and said guys  There's no reason for this injunction. I'm not going to agree to it. I'm not going to bar it  Microsoft said all right, then we're going to the ninth circuit court of appeals  Who within seconds?  Said no, no  No, no, we're not going to stop it either  Uh microsoft and activision have extended they had a deadline of july. I think was the 18th  Uh, that was the that was the trigger for the breakup fee  They agreed no, no, no, this is going to happen, but we're going to extend this till october  It can't be very far off at this point  Except for this little  You know speed bump that we call the united kingdom  You guys have any thoughts on this I guess the first question I would ask

Transcript:  Let's turn it back on to you you're a gamer right? So the main concern here is that microsoft buys activision  Than big activision games like call of duty only if it can be available on the xbox now  They've signed some 10-year deals to say okay. It's going to be available on other platforms like the playstation  But isn't that the inevitable end here?  Which is that you get platform exclusivity and that's bad for all gamers because the price goes up  On xbox and you can't use it if you have a playstation. I guess it depends on if you believe microsoft

Start time: 2478.94
End time: 2549.66
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because microsoft has said no, no, no  In fact, you're right. They've offered a 10-year deal which they offered in 2021 and sony finally signed it after this latest setback  uh  Non-exclusivity they're going to continue to offer it microsoft says why would we not offer it?  On playstation we want to make money on call of duty  And x we lose money on xbox. We're not going to save xbox with exclusives  Really if you think about it if you're a gamer, you know that sony is far worse on exclusives than microsoft is  Uh far more likely to use exclusives to prop up a the game platform and it's worked for them  I kind of believe microsoft is not going to  Does not care as much about the xbox business as selling  Software everywhere. In fact, that's the new microsoft. That's the new sachet and adela is we don't  We we want to sell products to everybody on every platform  So I believe them on that but on the other hand  I also get nervous when I see giant companies merging because in the long run  That seems to me  Bad for gamers or bad for anybody uses their products  These the bigger the company the more chances they have to monopolize

Start time: 2551.38

Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  Yes, I think being I think being nervous is correct because to me the most interesting part of this  Ftc lawsuit was  And it was it was one of the first times where they really were betting on and they ended up losing on the idea  Of not just looking at the current state of market power  But also where is that market going and I know cloud gaming has kind of almost been laughed off because of its size right now  But I think it's instructive if you think about  In 10 years what's going to be dominant cloud gaming or console gaming if I were to bet I would bet on cloud gaming  If you start if you start to think about how does every cloud service work?  Like especially a cloud entertainment service right now look at netflix  Amazon prime video, how do they all get subscribers?  Exclusives so to me it's almost inevitable that for whatever they say right now about  A 10-year deal and of course we want console gaming and it's better for us to sell the actual  Individual units we all know  Where the market is going and it's going to be cloud gaming and we know how cloud business  Cloud entertainment services work. So to me  This is more it's actually a reminder of how hard antitrust enforcement is right now  Because it's never been done before where like, you know  Courts are really ruling on where the market is going and trying to make a prediction about that  But it's pretty clear that any kind of market power that's going to be accumulated again who I mean xbox gaming microsoft  Imagining how they can tie that back in other ways to entertainment to software  You know, it's just another thing that they will definitely own and I think sony  In the long run on that and I think it was I mean you guys talked about it here last week  Sony has been great so far at  Licensing the ip of its games into movies and other franchises where you know, Activision has not been yet  That's a definitely another place. We're leveraging the overall microsoft ecosystem  I think will be very very strong for them

Is it good for business or good for the consumer?  No, it's good for the business that has it right?  So when you ask about like what do we think about this deal? That's like sort of like well  Is microsoft going to play by the rules? I don't I don't mean look if you ask me if you have the opportunity to do monopoly  You do it if the government has allowed your job and you do it. Yeah

Transcript:  To me this is a reminder that the  Outdated antitrust certainly is is a huge problem here and and there's been a lot of debate  Should lena con and the ftc taken on these lawsuits, you know  Like she was asked in congress are you taking on lawsuits that you think you can win?  To me, I still think these these actions need to be taken because we're at least talking about it  What was your answer to that by the way?  Uh that that they do believe that they will not pursue a lawsuit that they do not think they can win  Okay, that they are but to me actually I mean even if that's what she's saying  I feel like I think there's value in them taking on the biggest players. It's a 70 billion dollar  Transaction that has huge implications for the industry. So the verse is you know for the past decade  The ftc either went, you know went after small and mid-size companies or took small actions on big tech companies  Meanwhile big tech, you know concentrated power to an unbelievable degree. So so I actually am still  Very much on the side of taking these kind of actions. Obviously  There's certainly endless blowback  For any losses that I think you know, like is uh, is definitely tough to overcome, but I still think it's the right thing to do

Well, you have the regulator that's underfunded  So anyone who's worked inside the ftc makes clear that they just don't have enough resources  I mean think about this you're going up against microsoft trillion dollar company trying to close a 70 billion dollar acquisition  Your budget is like 300 million dollars a year  For all for everything that you're pretty hard 500 million they recently increased it  Yeah, I mean you're you're a company that's meant to regulate facebook. Your annual budget is what facebook makes in an afternoon  So and this is what you're talking about with like the reaganism stuff is like after reagan  Yes, and and we went through a year where through an era where we wanted to keep these regulators feeble then  Democrats and republicans all of a sudden came together and they said well  Maybe we should team up on big tech antitrust they increased the budget a little bit, but not really enough  Um, and they didn't they haven't passed the laws that they've been talking about and bringing all these ceos in front of their committees  For their youtube moments, they haven't passed anything so, you know effectively you still have big tech in the power position

Transcript:  Yeah, and uh really good piece  Which I did put the link into the show notes for korey doctora who's as you know as you know  a very  strong  proponent of antitrust regulation  Uh this from the 14th of july why they're smearing  Lena kahn he's talking about publications like the wall street journal, uh  Constantly harm hammering on how many and congress too?  Let's face it on how many losses she has for she's  Oh for four and going to court against meta  Now against microsoft and others  Uh, but korey points out that kahn has also done a lot  Of good things and is fighting the good fight in a lot of areas  I think everybody listening to the show would agree for instance click to cancel which is most recently the ftc's plan to make it  Require that it be as easy to cancel a subscription as it is to make the subscription  That's not even  Debatable, right?  it's like just  Obvious, of course, it's not the way it is in most cases and there's and and the war on robo calls  I think we all agree that that war is the good fight  um  It's a it's a good piece it's a it's strongly worded  Yes, I think I think the word lickspittle is used  Uh and so forth, but uh, but that's korey. He's really good at this stuff and very convincing  He says microsoft has a long long long history of being a brutal  Abusive monopolist it's a convicted monopolist and it's bad conduct didn't end with the browser wars  You remember how the lockdown turned all our homes into rent-free branch offices for employees  Microsoft seized on that moment to offer our bosses keystroke and click level surveillance of our use of our own computers in our own homes  via office  365 that's the viva product that we've talked about on windows weekly  If you think a company that gave your boss a tool to spy on their employees and rank them by productivity  As a prelude to firing them or cutting their pay is going to treat gamers or game makers  Well, once they've spent the competition out of business, you're a credulous sucker  And you're gonna be so  disappointed  The enshinification play this is korey's new word, which I love is obvious use investor cash  To make things temporarily nice for customers and suppliers  Lock both of them in in this case  It's with a subscription based service similar to netflix and then claw that value back until that all that's left is a big pile  of poop  Is well is korey wrong, uh or or do you agree

Transcript:  I think that he's talking about the smears of lena con using his words  I think that there's a lot of criticism of lena con the one that we don't really hear  Often enough and I think this is a fair criticism  Is that operationally the ftc isn't working as well as it could  And because because of that we're starting to see the losses in these lawsuits now  You know you the ftc usually doesn't bring lawsuits that it doesn't think it can win, right?  Which I think is goes to ron john's point that they've been going after small and medium companies now they're going they're they're bringing these higher  Risk lawsuits, but they should still be winning them and I think that operationally, you know  That organization could be run in a much better way to the point where it's starting to bring to bear  you know all of the uh, all of the acumen of its legal teams and all the capabilities that it has and it seems like  You know just organizationally. It's just not working as well as it should be

Start time: 3184.50
End time: 3285.44
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is also where alex and I have debated this definitely  And I think cori doctor's piece really digs into just how  Entrenched a lot of the power structures are that I mean trying to overcome again  I think it was 31 out of 41 for uh recent ftc officials had worked for the companies that they cover  But even more so the judge who actually pushed this through their their argumentation was already  Pretty suspect and he had quoted matt stoller on this around the idea that you know  The executives essentially said we will not hold exclusives again  You know, it's in our business interest to not hold exclusives that everyone's going to always get call of duty  But and then because that the deadline was july 18th that she felt it was unfair to the companies and it was you know  disingenuous of the ftc to try to essentially break that deadline  Rather than having a full investigation into the potential of the merger itself  So I think already this is such a big merger. It's just on a notional dollar value  That it's worth having a full investigation into it  But just as also as a reminder of you know, how entrenched a lot of these power structures are it's the judge's son  Works at microsoft not in the games division. So she did not recuse herself  But it's just a reminder of what lena con and the ftc are going up against so I still keep coming back to  Not judging them on wins, but rather than judging them on  Where is the conversation?  How is antitrust move forward and I think again thinking about where we are now versus three or four years ago  No one would have even batted an eyelash on this deal

Start time: 3285.82
End time: 3320.10
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  But you have to judge on wins because there's ideology and then there's there's the grounding in the legal facts  And you could say that you know, they're in a good place  Ideologically and I think going after this microsoft activision merger is certainly one of those cases  But if your ideology can't match your legal legal grasp of the facts which will give you victories in courts  Then ultimately what are you serving? You're like going up there's the argument lawsuits, but you're not backing up trying to make your ideology  You know the law of the land and that's the criticism on con that I think is legitimate

Start time: 3320.32

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, but even going your ideology matches even going to trial can be harmful. Uh, I think there was stuff in discovery  During this that both hurt microsoft as much as it hurt sony  and so  Even going to trial and discovery can be problematic for these companies  Uh, and then there's always the risk that they're gonna lose. You don't know what the outcome is going to be  When you enter into this even if you think you have a strong case  And so it may cause companies to think twice before  I mean, that's the only argument you can make I agree that she it'd be great if she would win  But you're but probably part of the problem is not so much. These are bad cases, but that the antitrust law there  That's the foundation for these cases  Does not fit well to the current circumstance

Do you continue going after small and medium-sized businesses or do you take these swings?  And as they could lose if not every single one of these things goes right for microsoft  If they don't come in guns blazing with all their resources at hand  Maybe they do lose or maybe the next one, you know the next merger like this  Doesn't go through so I think I still think uh, yeah, you know pushing forward on these kind of things again  Two to three years ago the idea of looking at a future market  From an antitrust perspective did not exist in anywhere in the conversation  This decision makes us at least think about it.

Transcript:  Yeah, look there. Yeah, this is the thing look at their market cap, right?  If you're once you go in the trillion dollar range as a company  You need to squeeze all the growth out of every market that you operate in to justify your valuation  Yeah, so it's not like wants or doesn't want it has to it has to squeeze sony out of the game  Or else its market cap shrinks and then the ceo is in hot water  Okay

Transcript:  That's not a good it's not true it's not a good sign  If these are my financial bona fides v-days i'm in trouble i'm in deep deep trouble  Our show today  Fortunately, my wife really knows what she's doing our show today is brought to you by mint mobile  I do love mint mobile and you know these days with everything costing more. It's nice to have  Your cell bill  Cut in half or less  There's one company giving you a much needed break mint  Mobile it was the first company to sell premium wireless service online  Only no stores means big savings for you. They let you order from home  Save a ton phone plans start at what just before I tell you  Think about what you know, just kind of imagine in your mind your last cell bill 70 80 90 100  More probably right  How about 15 a month all in?  15 dollars a month  That it by the way includes unlimited talk unlimited text nationwide  Plus high-speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5g network  You choose the plan that matches how much data you need  They just really do it right premium wireless for as little as 15 dollars  a month  all plans  Are i'll be telling you the truth the secret running on the t-mobile network  So if you've got great t-mobile service where you are you'd be crazy to be paying t-mobile prices  When you can get it for 15 dollars a month bring your own phone  They will send you the sim for free or use e-sim  Many phones support it now all the phones that meet mint mobile sells themselves support it  So that makes it even easier. I think this is such a good deal. Use your own phone  Get a phone from mint mobile  Get 15 dollars a month  premium wireless service  15 bucks a month look at that  To get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month get the plan shipped to your door for free  Mint mobile dot com slash twit. I love them so much. I even have mint mobile socks  Mint i'm not kidding mint mobile dot com slash  twit cut your wireless bill  I must say one more time because it doesn't sound believable, but it's absolutely true  to  $15 a month  Just go to mint mobile dot com slash twit to see it's pretty much the best deal out there  If you're paying more the question is why mint mobile dot com slash twit. We thank them so much for supporting  our show  Uh antitrust is coming at  Microsoft and other companies though from europe in big time the guns are firing amazon and apple have now been fined  million dollars by the Spanish  Antitrust watchdog  Now this is saying that they colluded  I'm not sure I agree with this one, but they colluded to limit the  online sale of apple devices in spain  Uh apparently when amazon and apple made a deal  For amazon to send sell apple phones from apple on amazon  they agreed  Not to allow third parties to sell those same phones more than 90 percent  Of the existing retailers who were using amazon's marketplace to sell apple devices were blocked as a result  Apple's device cost went the prices of apple's devices sold online went up as a result  Of the existing retailers who were using amazon's marketplace to sell apple's devices sold online went up as a result  Amazon says we reject the suggestion that amazon benefits from excluding sellers from its marketplace our business model. Yarrada  Our business model hinges precisely on the success of the company selling through amazon  Um, I think alex you might have covered this in always day one  Amazon does these deals don't they?

Start time: 3820.72
End time: 3855.84
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  Yeah, this is this is part of the business and I also like don't really think that they care about the fine from spain  I mean a couple hundred million dollars to them is you know  Uh, it's a drop in the bucket ultimately and they can they can put their their legal team on it and fight it and come  To a settlement that's half or a quarter of that and continue to move on  And by the way, I also want to apologize to your to your listeners. I said that microsoft was around  A trillion dollars. It's actually I looked it up in the break 2.5  Trillion dollars, so you have times that so now it definitely needs to squeeze out the market but I wanted to make that clarification

Start time: 3856.98
End time: 3943.34
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  But I think this also is such a perfect illustration  About what alex was saying around how you have to just squeeze whatever you can because again  Let's think through the actual dynamics of this  Amazon clearly iphone's being sold on their platform is a good thing overall globally for the business  Apple willing to go on the business but doesn't want third parties to sell them  They want to sell them under the apple name a little deal is done  And you know globally that's potentially a huge business for both amazon and it's good for apple  But obviously within that limits consumer choice in a country like spain seems to be going after this the fact that they would even make  that deal  For the spanish market and almost I don't want to say waste their time  But something that's small in their larger business is a reminder that you know, the dynamics are set up internally where they are  Trained to squeeze every market for whatever they can  And this is also a reminder again, like these are the things where we're actually seeing results and wins in anti-trust  Around the world and we're almost all laughing it off and I am kind of laughing it off again  200 million dollars. Uh, it's an ftc budget, but it's a  Drop in the hat for them. So so I think it this case actually, you know  Exemplifies a lot about how big tech competitive dynamics work around the world

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's what is that the estimate I saw last time I saw was 11 billion a year. I think it's gone up from that  Uh, it's got to be more than yeah, it's a big part of apple's  Services revenue is money a check from google  Now it's instantaneous. Thanks to fed now, by the way  Yeah, apple says that well, we're just trying to keep counterfeits off of the spanish amazon  But really they're just trying to keep third-party sellers from selling iphones apple's always done that they want to completely control the channel  That way they control prices. Yeah  Yeah, it's good for their business and maybe it's good for consumers  You know, at least if you're buying an iphone and amazon, it's it's legit, right?

It's a lot more  Aggressive so you should apple has to let you actually repair your device you crack your screen  You don't void your warranty if you go actually get your screen repaired  but to me my favorite and the one i'm most excited about and the uh,  the realization of good policy  Is if the app the next iphone will have a usbc at least in europe?  Because they have to and they have to have single chargers and I can finally get rid of my lightning cables because  That is that the day that happens. I will just uh,  You know, yeah, let me channel policy meets. Let me channel apple fanboys though

I think the I think we're gonna see usbc quickly and and it's the right thing  Thanks to the eu  Yeah, and also maybe it would have happened anyway, because as you pointed out they've already done it with every other device of theirs  Uh is type c now?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, i'm with you. I agree with you. I'm not one of those apple fanboys who thinks the easy is doing the wrong thing  I think we need that  Uh, let's see. Well speaking of apple, um  Kind of a victory for apple remember there the apple epic lawsuit which epic lost in almost every regard there was the one  thing the court said  Is that apple should?  Open up to third-party app stores and in particular one of the things apple really didn't like was the requirement  That they undo their anti-steering rules  This is a rule that apple imposes on anybody who offers an app  On the iphone on apple platforms. They can't for instance, let's use amazon's kindle app  Now you and I know that you cannot on an iphone buy a book in the kindle app  But the kindle app is not allowed to sit put a link to the amazon web store  Where you could buy it because apple doesn't want you to do that. They want the 30%  Amazon's response is well, we're going to turn off  Buying in the kindle store and people just will have to figure out they buy it on the amazon store and then it appears in their kindle  It's a problem for spotify. It's a problem for anything anybody that has in-app purchases 30% goes to apple  On monday apple was granted a motion putting on hold the appeals court ruling that would  Push its anti-steering rules  Out and let outside developers link to a third-party payment mechanism  the  the appeals court  Stayed it for 90 days to give apple time  to appeal to the supreme court  District court found that apple had not generally violated anti-trust law with its wall garden approach to ios  But did order it to drop rules against letting developers include calls to action for outside payment methods  Now they've given them an extra 90 days to petition that with the  Supreme court, of course once the petition is filed. It's automatically stayed until the supreme court rules  So apple's going to have some time. It looks like  Unless the supreme court immediately says uh screw it get out of here go away  And then they're gonna have to do it  Why is apple fighting this so hard? It's how hard could it be to say? All right. Fine. Put a link to the kindle store

Start time: 4284.52
End time: 4288.04
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  I think they really want i'll go ahead around john. They want their 30 percent. That's what they want change

Start time: 4291.86
End time: 4336.44
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  It changes everything because I think there was a long period of time where apple was able to sell the idea that  Security, you know like a predictability that the app store brought something really specific  But now we're at a point that you know again buying a book on a kindle  Why does it need to be so difficult?  Once you're trained to know to go out and go to the website and buy the book  Then go back to your kindle you start to figure it out  but maybe maybe this one's going to hit hard because every supreme court justice has a kindle and has not figured out how to buy a  book on their uh  On their ipad or iphone. So maybe it'll hit but but I think it's just a reminder that  They if they give an inch they're worried about the overall app store tax

Start time: 4337.20
End time: 4388.28
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  And it just goes to show you like they've been so  Admin that the reason why you have to go through apple's in-app payments is because they're protecting you against counterfeiters  And or or fraud or whatever it is and this whole idea of like letting spotify say  Um, you know, you can't subscribe here  But if you want to subscribe go to spotify.com like they have such a problem with that  Like it does go to show you that it really is about the 30 percent that they're gonna make  Yeah, you know credit cards like they're they're intermediaries or their service they charge like three percent  That's like a normal transaction fee for the transaction fee on the apple store to be 30 percent  You know that something's wrong and actually going back to our theme. That is what you know  antitrust should be addressing and uh, and instead we have courts saying yeah go keep keep doing this like I'll let  Prevent consumers from figuring out where they can go to actually buy the services

Start time: 4388.80
End time: 4393.12

Transcript:  So do you think the ftc should take on the 30 percent tax think they can

Start time: 4393.64
End time: 4420.50
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  If they can win by the way, my whole point in this has not been the ftc shouldn't take these things on  It's that the ftc should it be  Less grounded in the ideology and more grounded in the legal facts when they come out to these case and just like their track record  Shows that they haven't been they should have if they have a prosecutor like a prosecutor does where a prosecutor assesses the likelihood of winning  The case before actually pursuing the case or deciding deciding what type of case to bring based off of the law, right?

Start time: 4420.82
End time: 4440.68
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think that the difference here is a prosecutor  Is not being mindful of how they are shaping the law overall, right?  Prosecutors should prosecuting an individual case is just thinking about that individual case  They're not thinking about how do I shape the entire economy and that's good rule of law going forward

Start time: 4440.82
End time: 4455.46
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  Yeah, so i'll concede that that we don't have good enough antitrust law to actually come in and bring this stuff  And you know if congress decided that it wanted to act maybe we could change that but it hasn't decided that so  We're left with this but that being said like I don't think that's a blanket excuse for all these losses

Transcript:  The ninth circuit judge however  Even though they did grant the stay the 90-day stay to apple was not at all happy about apple's arguments  Uh judge milan d smith writes while the arguments in apple's motion may not be technically frivolous  They ignore key aspects of the panel's reasoning and key factual findings by the district court. Remember apple won everything except this in district court  Uh apple appealed to the ninth circuit ninth circuit also upheld  Uh the the the ruling um  But subsequently has granted them 90s days to uh to to appeal  Apple ignores the panel key aspects of the panel's reasoning and key factual findings by the district court  When our reasoning and the district court's findings are considered apple's arguments cannot withstand even the slightest scrutiny  apple's standing and scope of the injunction argument simply masquerade  Its disagreement with the district court's findings and objection to state law liability is contentions of legal  error  They apple's arguments cannot withstand even the slightest scrutiny. So he spanked apple even while giving them the 90 days  To appeal it to the supreme court. I guess he felt like he had to give him that

It's just going to be  Uh, you know  To see catch is catch can we'll see we'll see what happens  You were excited. Uh, I think uh ron john about meta and microsoft introducing  llamas into the world  We talk a lot about artificial intelligence  Uh, we haven't talked a whole lot about this llama is the large language model meta  Has been working on and the next generation is llama 2. Of course. You notice microsoft got in there real quick  Uh, microsoft wants to make sure if it's ai that microsoft is there

Start time: 4659.84
End time: 4744.82
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  I think  no, but this is this is really really interesting because  Having done a good amount of work with generative ai for a while  I've been realizing that again the largest only working with the largest models or the most expensive models or directly with open ai  you can get  Very very good results for solving very specific problems with much smaller models open source models  So I think it's very smart meta coming in late to the game here  They probably are not going to build some large api driven business like open eye open ai is doing like google is opening to do  So I think this was the smartest play that they could make and again, we've seen that, you know meta has  Been well ahead from the technology perspective. Yann lacoon has driven a lot of this research and has been on the big technology podcast  I believe a number of times. I uh, I think this is very interesting  It is funny to me  As you said the fact that microsoft had to get into this press release because all they're doing is saying  It's compatible on the azure ecosystem. It'll work on that sure, right? Like yes, of course  Like it'll also work on google cloud. I'm sure  Yes, absolutely. It's a standard open source model. You can go on hugging face and pull a hundred other ones  so like I was very  Intrigued by the communications element of how that came together

Start time: 4744.84
End time: 4760.02
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you think microsoft gave them some azure credits because generating these models is very expensive  That maybe maybe that's what microsoft did is say well here. We're going to help you out here  To metto to metta's research department, maybe meta's got the money. I mean if metta's

Transcript:  What does it mean for microsoft and open ai right? Like does it change?  Microsoft is huge partners with open ai. So that's sort of what surprised me was to see them  Had uh, you know front and center on the metal microsoft got something for this. I'm I mean

Start time: 4779.96
End time: 4810.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Clearly microsoft wanted to make sure that you understood that this will work on azure, right?  So what what what facebook has done is they have open sourced llama 2 which is their next  Big large language model and they're making it available free of charge for research and commercial use  um, and of course  Misogyn and elec says oh, yeah, by the way, this will run in the azure. We actually it's in the azure ai model catalog  Uh, but but then facebook said yep, but it'll also run an aws and hugging face and elsewhere

Start time: 4811.52
End time: 4837.38
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  But they didn't mention google cloud  So that's like the dark theory here is that like maybe this is just something that they decided to the enemy of my kind of mess  Enemy is my friend. Now, okay  Is that because like google this is like one of the big business lines that google might have is like, you know  Opens or charging for their their lms and meta comes in and says, all right. Well here you could just have it  Is that what do you guys do think? That's a legitimate like

Start time: 4838.44
End time: 4852.98
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  Uh possibility here. Yeah, because if you think google could do it integrated across their ecosystem  They have lms. They have the cloud infrastructure. They have the the business consumer side  Of everything so so that's an interesting theory

Start time: 4853.42
End time: 4872.56
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  The restriction is that you can't you if you have more than seven of any products with more than 700 million users you have to ask  Uh meta for permission to use this and it's not so open anymore. So it's like well, who does that?  Who also is included in that?  Let me see it might be also google. Maybe google definitely not twitter not twitter

End time: 4909.98
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  They're giving away essentially the same infrastructure as a gpt 3.5 or 4  Smaller in scope in parameters potentially but still you can fine tune your own models off of them  These are foundation models that allow any company to do all the work of generative ai that we all want to do  It's just free and open and and as i'm talking i'm thinking is this like um

Start time: 4910.68
End time: 4919.54
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 4921.48
End time: 4935.94
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  Layers on top of it business processes around it  And the thing is all these things there have been tons and tons of other open source models or free models like this  If you go to hugging face, it's there's a whole community built around this the home of stable diffusion

Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's but it's it's an entire community of open sourced llms and and for different purposes different models  So as we're talking i'm starting to think like maybe microsoft also realized and there's a lot of people who have said  This really is an industry in an ecosystem that can move more towards open source  So maybe microsoft is hedging their bets as well with open ai that you know, that's their bet on closed  And this is their bet on open and they're a great point. They're making sure their satya is everywhere at the same time

Transcript:  No, but so this is where I think competitively gets interesting alex and I talked about this last friday  If anyone is a chat gpt plus subscriber  I subscribed to it just to try this new code interpreter tool. It's insane  It's like you can upload massive data sets to it of your own things that would break excel in an instant  And then you just say actually I want to organize the data this way  Can you query what's the average of anything that has like things you would write complex excel functions in the past?  You can literally watch it  Creating python code to actually do that analysis for you things you would have had a data scientist full time for before  So so I mean I was this is one of the coolest things i've seen in this whole generative good code  Is it usable code? Yeah, it it gets you the right answers and it works and it works on you know  Instead of there's no hallucination. This isn't standard llm where it's to you know, like working off a giant foundation model  And it's not even sure what it's saying. It's just creating python code that gives you an answer to a data query  But the thing is again right now it's worth me paying 20 bucks a month to open ai  Is someone going to come along and do this open source very soon?  I think very likely so so I agree with you that I think a lot of this stuff  Is going to just be the same across and it's going to be awesome for  For users and businesses, but how this plays out from a business perspective, I think this is uh,  This is anyone's game, which is maybe why satya is again everywhere

Transcript:  So we've used  I'm trying to understand this we've used  A thing called whisper ai to do transcripts friend of mine uses it to transcribe conversations  Feeds the transcript into chat gpt which generates an action item list  Uh based on uh, you know a recorded conversation  Uh whisper is using models  uh  Of it can use different models, right? It could use and it could use in theory it could use llama, right?  Is that the idea is that that's a front end?  To do let's say transcription or in your case to do python code and it sits on top of a large language model

Start time: 5147.36
End time: 5191.14
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean depending and we don't know whatever it was built on  I would say like people who got in early on this  Mostly were using a gpt3 or paying open ai for the api access  But any any service like that can definitely it's I mean as of now, maybe it's not completely but  You know google has models like text bison  Open ai has gpt 3.5 and 4 facebook has now introduced llama for free  All of those things could theoretically be somewhat interchangeable to do that kind of job, especially transcribing  creating action items  summarization like you don't necessarily need the  175 billion parameter

Start time: 5246.00
End time: 5275.94
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  I mean, i'm not sure I know the models that they proudly said are smaller  I think they have like and again you can try I think it's like a five billion parameter  The biggest one was 70 billion. So these are smaller than gpt4 gpt3.5  Um, and then even within those open ai models, they have different levels as well. They have like  Ada babbage kiri davinci of different sizes. So  So in terms of what exactly it's trained on i'm not sure is a smaller model dumber

Start time: 5279.08

End time: 5313.76
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  No, probably we don't know the full details. We don't know obviously a lot of the stuff is going to be on open source data sets  but  You know, they have access to the whole news feed. Is that the next front line in in ai?

Start time: 5314.56
End time: 5345.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In the battle over ai is where are you getting this data?  You know, we saw that sarah silverman the comic is suing  Open ai because she says it knows my book you must have given it my book because it can summarize it  The number of authors are also suing  Is that the next front line of battles? We're just going to see people saying well, wait a minute. You can't train on  Copyright data. You have to have a a process. Where did this where did this come from is a legitimate question?

Start time: 5346.40
End time: 5392.34
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  Yeah, I think both from a copyright perspective it gets more interesting because all it takes is one case and then suddenly  trying to understand  What a gigantic data set was actually trained on suddenly that could become a liability instead of just you know unending profit  but I also think  It and again like i'm almost hopeful or optimistic around this you start to get more  smaller verticalized models that are more geared towards solving specific problems again like  transcription model that's trained on  podcasts only could potentially be a lot smaller more efficient and  And do that job better than a gigantic model. So so I think it's it's it if it moves in that direction  I think that's a good thing. Okay

Transcript:  I obviously have a lot to learn  about all of this  By the way throughout our conversation. I keep checking to see if twitter has gotten rid of the bluebird  One thing that has happened is you can now go to x.com and it will redirect you to twitter  elon's owned x.com since the days of paypal  In fact, somebody in our chat room is saying that paypal  Peter teal took over from elon when elon tried to rename paypal to  x  So this is a long standing battle

It's great to have you  Uh ron john, it's great to meet you and have you ron john roy his friday co-host on the show  And man the interviews they get as you heard they've talked to yan lakun several times  just  Fantastic, you're you're just knocking out of the park. We're glad to have you on here  Our show day brought to you by collide speaking of knocking out of the park  Collide is the thing you need a device trust solution if you're using octa  Octa is great for authentication, but octa needs collide because collide  Collide  Ensures that if a device isn't trusted and secure it can't log into your cloud apps  It's not enough just to have authentication. You need to know  That that person is not bringing a payload in with them  If you work in security or it and you use octa this message is for you  There's one thing in common in all the big data breaches and hacks we've been reading about over the last few years  It's the employees now i'm not knocking the employees  But it's often that's the way that bad guys get in sometimes an employee's device gets hacked  Because maybe of unpatched software they've got oh, I don't know a copy of the plex server that hasn't been patched in three years  on their laptop  and then oh lo and behold somebody uses that to steal their aws credentials and  It's a huge cost in reputation and money to your company  Maybe sometimes an employee would leave. I don't know sensitive data in an unsecured place the ssh  private keys in the download folder maybe  And then of course, it's practically every day a hacker breaks in using credentials fished  From an employee now the problem isn't your end users. The problem is those solutions that you're using  They're supposed to prevent all of this  They're not  But doesn't have to be this way imagine a world just imagine this where only secure devices  Can access your cloud apps?  In this world fished credentials useless to hackers  And you can manage every os windows max even linux all from a single dashboard in this world  This is heaven you can get employees to fix their own device security issues without creating more for your it team  Good news. You don't have to imagine it. Just start using collide  k-o-l-i-d-e collide.com  Slash twit book an on-demand demo today. See how it works for yourself  This is an uh, just a must  For any company that uses octa. It's the it's the second piece of the authentication  k-o-l-i-d-e collide.com slash twit.

Transcript:  How'd you like it? How'd you like it? It was so it was just so cool. I mean you weren't nervous at all. I  I was nervous for like the first 10 seconds, but it drives so smoothly and like you just like sit in the back seat  And literally in the front seat, there's no driver and the steering wheel is moving you around san francisco  and I just think that like  This is much closer than a lot of people believe like there was this moment in 2017 where  Um, you know folks were saying okay  We're gonna get to self-driving next year and it didn't happen  So people just wrote it off for like the last five years. They're like it was supposed to be here  It's not here. Well in the background these companies have been progressing pretty impressively and having sat down in the car  You mean you see waymo's all over san francisco. Oh, yeah, it's just an unbelievable experience

Yeah, and i'm definitely gonna get in a cruise before before i'm here and by the way for for listeners  I have david richer the ceo of lift coming on the show in the next couple weeks. So  Stand out for that like yeah tune in for that because we're going to talk about self-driving also  But this is going to be a huge thing  It's going to be a new pillar in terms of the way that we get around. It's going to be rolled out  the thing about technology  Is you can you can roll out faster and scale faster?  Than the human mind can conceive and it's going to roll out in a bunch of different cities  I'm fairly certain and we're going to have a serious problem when it comes to labor  because  You know if this thing is continues on its trajectory then drivers and you know places like uber and lift and traditional taxi services  And then maybe even trucking are going to have to start dealing with this as a threat to their jobs  I mean it is it is extremely impressive the way that this thing operates  And I mean i've i'm going to spend the rest of my time here writing in these things because it's just unbelievable

Transcript:  I mean shout out to the grandma drivers. Yeah, if this can think and can approximate that then we're gonna have you know  We were looking up how many deaths are there there are 13 000 deaths alcohol related from driving in the united states every year  You know and then think about all the people who get duis  Right who uh whose lives can can be meaningfully altered because of this and if we turn driving over to the robots  That's that tens of thousands of lives saved or 10 000 lives saved in just one country  In a year and many thousands more impacted. So  I celebrate this I think that you know, we'll have to deal with the labor stuff. That's a really important issue  But if we can move to robotic cars, I think it's a great advance for humanity in our civilization

End time: 6000.60
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  Wait, but I I think  You'd made the point that it will scale like technology which is greater than the human mind can fathom  But will it scale like technology?  Because again, this isn't software. This isn't bits. It's atoms  Like it's uh, I think like what has what has impeded it from scaling to date?  I think is an important question because even for me like my honda's  Assisted driving mode on the highway essentially self drives like for a while. I think this technology has been there for a long time  Do you think to me? It's one of those questions where  To scale it there has to be some kind of public  Utility and trust around it there has to be some kind of accepted regulatory  You know approach to it. Everyone has to be on board. We have to start like, you know  Building highways around the technology which at least the way the industry has gone so far has not been the case

Start time: 6001.70
End time: 6021.13
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  I just think that a lot of these concerns are going to fall by the wayside once more people get inside these vehicles  And experience this it made you a believer  Absolutely, and I was sort of not I wasn't even a skeptic or I wasn't a believer beforehand  I was just like all right, that's never gonna happen  And then just be that was me. That's me still  You're convinced

Transcript:  When you talk to the lift ceo because really lift and uber were founded with on the premise that we wouldn't  It's not a sustainable business if you have to pay humans to drive the cars  It's founded on the premise that we will eventually all be self-driving

Start time: 6037.20
End time: 6044.64
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  Exactly, so we did talk about that. It's going to be his first podcast interview since taking over lift david russia  So folks should look out for that coming out in a couple weeks. Okay

Start time: 6046.10
End time: 6060.16
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think the reason people were willing to watch uber rack up huge losses year after year is that  There was this premise that at some point  This would be financially viable  But it's just taking longer than anybody thought

Start time: 6061.84
End time: 6072.38
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  Yeah  So I think it's gonna I think we're at an inflection point here watching the way san francisco is not exactly an easy  City driving and there have been a lot of stories about about cruise

Start time: 6073.12
End time: 6111.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  More crews than than waymo, but about cruise vehicles, you know blocking intersections blocking emergency vehicles getting lost  Having to there was one street in san francisco where there was just a constant parade of  self-driving vehicles  Coming down making a u-turn and coming back because they refused to turn  Making a legal left turn  Normal drivers just go yeah, right i'm not going and would make the left turn but the car would continue  Well, I can't turn there. I need to turn there. So i'm going to go down the cul-de-sac  Can make a u-turn to cul-de-sac. It's very interesting right turn  They obeyed the law  But it was a hell for the cul-de-sac people

Start time: 6111.90
End time: 6124.48
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  They weren't happy the one that I was in was also just like no not making that turn too risky  And it dropped me off a little bit further away from my destination interesting  Or just kind of an aborted mission in terms of the turn it needed to make but not the end of the world

Start time: 6124.64
End time: 6194.14
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  You were able to walk. No, you're looking absolutely. Yeah, but but I also I think that point you make around the  A normal driver would take that left but they're playing by the rules. I think yeah. Yeah, exactly  I think it's a reminder though that we need and and and I am very hopeful and optimistic around the technology  I hate driving. I hope like  You know this I can just sit in a four-hour car ride and do whatever I want rather than  Have to actually pay attention. That's the dream but  you know like we I think the more productive car companies can be in terms of actually  Engaging in how we build our roads and stuff. I think it's going to be  Really important to make sure this technology actually does scale and I actually think  Not to bring it back to elon again, but I think it's better the fact that  Waymo's and the crews and eventually ford and gm and everyone as they're driving this technology as well  They're going to engage with regulators and highway safety and make sure this stuff is done properly rather than trying to kind of you know  Bloat through everything and fight against everyone. So so I i'm i'm hopeful I do and I hope it comes fast

Yeah, it's not going to be people aren't going to read publications because there's a good ai  It might fill in some of the gaps in some ways  But it's not going to be able to do any of the differentiated writing  So for the writers that are on staff if you can't do better than the undifferentiated ai  There are bigger questions. You need to be asking besides ai's ability to take your work

Start time: 6310.10
End time: 6326.36
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It takes away the the grunt work articles the the listicles the the things that really know  You know, this is what cnet said what connie giliamo said when she was on our show  Uh is that nobody wants to write those articles and those are the those that's the grunt work and it can do those just

Start time: 6327.76
End time: 6392.42
Speaker: Ranjan Roy
Transcript:  Not that and that's the perfect representation of where it should or could work  Well is the idea that the grunt work the repetitive stuff the stuff you don't really want to do but potentially does need to get done  It does that for you and then you have more time to actually write differentiated content because again  Remember generative ai  Everything is about taking what's already out there  so if you're writing something completely original if you're  You should you will not be replaced. So i'm still  Bullish on the idea that it can do the grunt work  But I actually think the bigger implication for the media business is when everyone can write that repetitive  listicle article in near  Instantaneous real time like that actually changes the economics of how those businesses worked before  And again, like it's writing an seo friendly listicle might have brought in some ad dollars in the past  But if anyone can throw up a media site and get that traffic and create that same article  I think then it does pose a bigger challenge to media companies

Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  Yes, that's the other side of it  So like it's not going to take away like any actor's jobs right now  But there are some like yeah precedent setting moments where they can really have it make a difference here. So for instance  There uh, there's a a line in this proposed contract that allows background performers  So not like you know the tom cruises of the world but like the folks who are in the background of uh extras of a show  Yeah extras or even maybe someone with like one line. I don't fully know what the definition is but something in in that realm  They can get like scanned and processed and like then get paid a one-time fee and the studios can use their likeness for  Imperportunity if they'd like so, you know, I think that that is, you know one place where this you know  You could start to have your fight. But then again like we've also had cgi extras  you know for for a long time now, so  Uh, it seems to me like this is really about some other stuff and they're using this as like a rallying cry for their members  and you know by all means go ahead and do it but  Like I don't think that we're going to be in a position where we're going to have  Uh ai actors, uh start to create leading entertainment  And again if you're an actor and you can't do better than an ai  Uh, then it's time to ask some bigger questions than whether an ai can replace you

Transcript:  Yeah, and I think  Using ai is kind of the like central theme or talking point from like the pr side of the entire strike has been smart  I think like it makes it much more targeted rather than an entire business model is broken and talking about  The earnings of disney and like it was you know losses on streaming services and the changing nature of a broken business model  I think talking about they're going to try to steal my I mean when alex says that line like  I mean you're going to remember it. We all remember it the idea that they're going to scan me and then use my likeness in  perpetuity for a day's pay  No one anywhere is going to feel good about that. I actually can't believe  They put that into uh any kind of negotiation because someone somewhere should have told someone to not do that  But but I I think still especially visual especially acting  I think we're a long ways away from anything being like severely affected by ai

Of course, we just don't know what those requirements are and they really haven't  Haven't said yet. I think it's a great idea  Uh, they're talking about privacy as well as security one of the requirements would be  That the iot device can be updated over the air  So that you can I mean there are a lot of iot devices that have security flaws that cannot be patched these days  for instance

That's pumping soot onto my windowsill  Uh, what's the deal with the green?

It's been an actual standardization across all these different protocols that everyone has gotten on board  Everyone apple amazon google that every device should start to all  You know hit this same protocol and actually be compatible and I think it's something where  Thinking about it must have gotten to a point where they realized they will never be able to actually scale this industry  Because it's just too difficult to make anything work  um, so  When they actually have their back against a wall and something is not working for consumers  it was a reminder at least this one hopeful moment that they will get together and uh,  And actually make something good for the consumer kumbaya, baby

Transcript:  We can but hope  I have some hope in massachusetts. They're planning to ban the collection  of cell phone location  data  Uh, this is something that frankly the congress should be doing  Um, but there as uh, carl bode writes in tectr the u.s  Has long been too corrupt to pass even a basic privacy law for the internet  Most regulatory actions at agencies like the fcc are theatrical at best carl is another angry man  And while the fdc has been taking specific action against some companies  We're not doing it much in terms of an overarching solution for the broader problem  Which means it's often as often the case is left to the states  So massachusetts which is preparing to be the first state in the nation  To ban the collection and monetization of user cell phone location  Data, it's not a law yet. It's called the location shield act  massachusetts state legislature held a hearing last month  On it a sweeping proposal that would sharply curtail the practice of collecting and selling location data  Drawn from mobile phones in state  It would also institute a warrant requirement for law enforcement access to location data  Did you know by the way, they don't need a warrant?  They just need a it's called a pen register and they can  The fact that most of the cell phone companies have a portal  With law enforcement for a couple of bucks can just log in and find out where you've been what you're up to  The bill would also ban data brokers from providing location information about state residents without court authorization  You know law enforcement does not like a bill like this they like to be able to do this  It's much easier for congress to say tick tock china bad get rid of them than to actually pass an effective  privacy bill  Um according to carl and tech dirt it's it seems likely that this will this will pass  The bill is expected to be passed but carl says I wouldn't be shocked because he's a cynic  Because he's a cynic I wouldn't be shocked if it's dramatically weakened or modified before  That happens law enforcement and industry definitely doesn't  want massachusetts  To break a to disrupt a very broken and very profitable status quo several decades in the making right carl bode  But you all would be in favor of such a law, right?

Start time: 7155.10
End time: 7227.34
Speaker: Alex Kantrowitz
Transcript:  I like it for sure. I mean, I think that like i'm often especially with like, you know phones apps  You know, you see what they collect and they they obviously collect more than they need  And so yeah, there's there should be some protections in terms of like, you know, why isn't this?  You know something universal where they cannot collect this stuff like it doesn't it's just no there's no reason to especially like  You know on the phone for instance, like there are things that happen that should never happen  And you know, it's like nice to see that massachusetts is taking the initiative here  I don't know if it will actually spread. I mean, it'd be nice if it spread but I think that like here's a theory that  When snowden came out with his revelations because these all have like they're all downstream of that  people were initially like oh my god, what's happening and then  You know, they were kind of like, all right, whatever and the second that happened  It was almost as if like it was difficult for for any of this privacy stuff to gain  Momentum because it's like sort of like the biggest bombshells have already had already been revealed and the response is muted  So, you know, we'll see, you know little things like this and that's good  But in terms of like having something like this be the law of the land  A little more skeptical that that could actually happen  Meanwhile, yeah, go ahead

Transcript:  I was gonna say I I feel the regulation needs to be around  the profit incentives and the profit motives behind this stuff because  As as alex said and we've seen repeatedly like from a consumer perspective  It's terrifying at moments and then everyone forgets about it because it's so difficult to process exactly what's going on and try to like  You know see under the hood and the web of ad tech companies and data brokers and what's moving where it's like  Incomprehensible for the average person. So you just forget about it and scroll your threads and  Instagram feed or whatever else so so I think it's it it's up to regulators and  Policymakers to really focus on who's making money and where and what's okay?  because again, I think the I agree the law enforcement argument is almost guaranteed to derail this effort because  You know you go out and you say obviously there's some number of people that are always going to be wary of that  But the safety claim i'm sure will convince any  Enough people that they want this to be allowed for law enforcement to be able to track people  So I think it's just a it has to live at the layer of who's making money off of you  Your location at any point, which is still definitely a lot of people

Transcript:  Yeah law enforcement is always going to say but we do so much of a better job and we know where everybody is what they're up  To what they've been doing  so don't get in our way, but at least  in this country, we've had a long-standing belief that  Perfect law enforcement is not necessary  If it impinges on the freedom and liberty of the people if it's anti-constitutional  The senate is considering  a bill a new bill the bipartisan cooper davis act  on behalf of the dea  Requiring social media companies  Encrypted communications providers and other online services report drug activity on their platforms  To the dea it advanced to the senate floor on thursday  Today  It's for a good cause right it's named cooper davis was a kansas teenager who died after unknowingly  Taking a fentanyl laced pill he bought on snapchat  Well in that case, we've got to be we've got to be make these guys reported  Requires social media companies other web communication providers to give the dea  Users names and other information with the companies of actual knowledge that illicit drugs are being distributed on their platform. However  However  If this bill passes privacy advocates caution  There could be a death blow to end to end encryption  Because it includes  Language holding companies accountable for conduct. They don't report if they quote deliberately blind themselves  To the violation, how would they deliberate? Oh by encrypting?  And encryption. Well now they're liable because they uh that we need to know if this activity is occurring  So massachusetts residents, please write your state legislators and say  good thing please  Pass this bill protect us against data collection about our location and the rest of us write your congress critters saying the cooper davis act  is  You know, I think  uh a uh  Red herring it's being introduced  Yeah, save the kansas teenagers from buying fentanyl based pills on snapchat  But really it is to end end to end encryption, uh, and I think this is clearly problematic  And yet it's moving along quite quickly of course in congress because  You know, nobody's in favor of fentanyl based pills on snapchat  All right little break then a couple of final words with our great takeover from the big technology  Podcast  Alex kantrowitz great to have you I should also mention that  Our other guest also has his own newsletter on sub stack called read margin read margins  Read margins.
