We're going to do a great little show this week talking about the latest tech news here  in studio with me.  I'm really, I love this panel.  Of course, my bud, John C.

It only comes out once in a while.  It's when I see some huge deal at Costco, and actually after I'm in.  Yeah, you get it.  And then you write about it.  And then you go, hey, go sell it out.  Or K&L Liquors.  There's just a bunch of these different places.

Transcript:  So quite.  It's quite good.  Quite, quite.  Quite, quite.  Wait a minute, who's that?  There he is, ladies and gentlemen.  In his beautiful mountain lair, Burdish Garden South, Jerry Pornell.  The man who really inspired my career by writing those great Chaos Manor columns and bite magazines  still writes Chaos Manor.  You can get a link to that at JerryPornell.com.  Hey Jerry, good to see you.  Hi.  I shouldn't call it Burdish Garden.  That's kind of insulting.

Start time: 215.48
End time: 226.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't wonder that Hitler liked it, but I do not think that.  That's because one likes Burdish Garden, one becomes Hitler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No implied endorsement.  And you don't have a German shepherd named Schatzi, so.

Start time: 234.46
End time: 250.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I not only don't have a German shepherd, but nobody else does.  There has never been in the history of mankind, there has never been a case where a German  shepherd was known to shepherd anything.  There's a story here.  These dogs mainly, but.

Start time: 250.96
End time: 252.88

Start time: 257.69
End time: 299.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Man, that's fantastic.  We've broken Godwin's law and learned about dogs all within 30 seconds.  And now John will don a fez.  All in favor of Ataturk's rule that no fezzes should be allowed inside the Twitt Cottage,  raise their hands.  So John, I think we're going to do something different today in honor of Andrew Keane being  here.  I don't know what we do on Twitt.  Or he wouldn't be here probably.  I think we let the chat room choose the stories.  There certainly was a lot of tech news.  Apple had an announcement today or this week.  Google's got an announcement coming up on Wednesday that's kind of mysterious.  But I think you wanted to lead John with a story that.  Oh, the good story.  The good one.  Craigslist is dropping adult ads in the US.

Start time: 299.52
End time: 301.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no more hookers on Craigslist.

Start time: 302.32
End time: 311.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The last time we talked about this, I actually went to Craigslist.  You looked for hookers?  Yes, just to see.  Oh, OK.  And I got in trouble with my wife.

Start time: 311.84
End time: 319.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was she dogging your searches?  No, I drove.  Did you click the privacy button and get rid of all those searches?

Start time: 320.59
End time: 330.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's actually not that sophisticated.  She doesn't know how to do history searches.  But we were driving by a place in town and I said, oh yeah, that's a massage parlor.  I saw that on Craigslist.  And she said, what?  Maybe just shut up.

Start time: 330.96
End time: 331.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be easier.

Start time: 332.82
End time: 343.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She said, and it does sound kind of frankly pathetic when you say, well, honey, we were  covering it on the show and I just was.  Oh yeah, right.

Start time: 343.90
End time: 345.37

End time: 358.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Research.  It was all research.  That's what when radio hosts get in trouble for the sites they visit online, it's always  research.  Didn't work for Bernie Ward though, did it?  Didn't work for Bernie.  No, is he in jail?  I think so, yeah, unfortunately.

Start time: 358.24
End time: 362.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's one of our local radio show hosts.  It's an inside joke.  So Gawker.

Start time: 364.16
End time: 369.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, research.  I am doing research.  Yeah, he wanted to see how his new clubs would work.

Start time: 370.98
End time: 392.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I want to thank the folks.  I want to thank Nick Denton and the folks at Valley Wag for putting together a post-Craigslist  guide to buying sex online so that you really don't have to worry so much.  And I'm not going to give you the addresses, but let's just say there are plenty of places  still to go.  Why did Craigslist dump adult stuff?

Start time: 392.88
End time: 426.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They became the lightning rod for this whole bogus kind of witch hunt.  And the fact of the matter is, it's now going to create more problems than it solves, this  elimination of this.  Why is that?  Well, because you want to compartmentalize the hookers.  And I believe, by the way, this is why I've been pushing for almost 20 years the .xxx  top level domain.  And that was the fight over it, by the way.  Even the pornographers didn't want .xxx because they felt like they'd be ghettoized.  They were ghettoized.  That's the idea.  That's why you want it.

Start time: 427.32
End time: 430.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but red light districts, for God's sake.

Start time: 430.12
End time: 434.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's exactly the same as a red light district.  But do you want a red light district?  Who wants a red light district?

Start time: 434.60
End time: 438.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Baltimore sure as hell did for a lot of much of its existence.

Start time: 439.31
End time: 456.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You remember the street in Baltimore?  No, I don't, Jerry.  You want a red light district.  I just want my wife to know I do not remember the street.  Amsterdam has a red light district, doesn't it?  It's very small.  In fact, that's what they named it.  No, actually they have about three of them.  Isn't that what they named it red light for?  Because of the red lights in Amsterdam?

Start time: 456.46
End time: 458.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Has anyone ever said to you it's very small?

Start time: 458.98
End time: 463.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Roxanne.  I got the joke.  I got it too.  I just was going to pass.

Start time: 463.34
End time: 490.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have no idea whether the street in Baltimore is as big as it used to be.  Back in the 70s and 60s when I had aerospace contracts over there at Fort Detrick and those  places, sometimes a bunch of us would go down and tour down through that street not for  buying anything, but just to look at it and it was an amazing place.  It really was.

Start time: 491.28
End time: 494.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even know if I want to ask any questions about this.

Start time: 495.68
End time: 501.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can ask questions because any answer I give you, I guarantee, is broadcastable.

Start time: 501.44
End time: 506.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they still have hookers in Los Angeles around Hollywood Boulevard or Sunset or anything  like that?

Start time: 507.55
End time: 508.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  Do they have anything else?

Start time: 510.41
End time: 514.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess that's a yes.  I just would like to remind everybody.

Start time: 514.88
End time: 519.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you may get them in any sex, any gender that you prefer.

Start time: 519.60
End time: 544.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the problem I have with the Craigslist deal.  Now these girls who are going to be scrambling around like ants.  You kick over the ant hill and the ants go all over the place.  And so you're going to be looking up, you want a Pentax lens or a Nikon or a Canon lens  and it's going to be an ad for a hooker right there in something else or something.  They're going to try to trick you into seeing these ads all over the Craigslist.  That's true.  I don't want that.  That's why you want to get away with it.

Start time: 544.68
End time: 552.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A XXX domain, which we do have now, is a great idea.  Although, what does Playboy.com do?  Does Playboy.com go to XXX?  No.  It's not XXX.

Start time: 554.19
End time: 559.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have to be in the XXX.  The idea is to slowly gravitate people like that to the XXX.

Start time: 560.13
End time: 578.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  You want something scary.  Watch or listen to this video from consumerwatchdog.com.  This is a video that they aired on Times Square over and over again, spending millions of dollars  to scare you about Google.

Start time: 581.98
End time: 582.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Start time: 582.94
End time: 586.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey kids, get your free ice cream.

Start time: 587.26
End time: 596.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Free ice cream.  The guy looks like Eric Schmidt with a Nazi mustache.  He actually has a Hitler mustache.  They should know there's no such thing as a free ice cream.

Start time: 597.43
End time: 598.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give me a dozen full body sands.

Start time: 598.84
End time: 602.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, you played the audio of that on the radio.  Come on.  Yeah.

Start time: 604.05
End time: 608.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I already know you.  Have you seen the video yet, Jerry?  This is really terrifying.  Yes, I did.

Start time: 608.88
End time: 610.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I went and looked for it after I heard you play the audio.

Start time: 611.26
End time: 628.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's terrifying.  Who paid for this?  Well, the Rose Foundation has given millions of dollars to consumerwatchdog.org.  Kevin Rose?  I don't think it's Kevin.  They opted to spend some of this money making this very high quality profession.

Start time: 629.28
End time: 638.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You think it's going to have any effect whatsoever?  The people who know who that is are not likely to be much affected by that ad.

Start time: 638.80
End time: 639.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good point.

Start time: 640.49
End time: 641.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks like Larry Less.

Start time: 642.24
End time: 648.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, kids, I want to share our newest invention with these Google Y spy glasses.

Start time: 649.44
End time: 670.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can see everything.  First of all, question one.  Ad hominem, right?  I mean, what did Eric Schmidt do to piss these guys off?  I know something.  I mean, this is terrifying.  I have no idea.  This is terrifying.  Question two, is Google, by the way, and I'll give them the plug here, your privacy is no  laughing matter, go to insidegoogle.com.

Start time: 671.48
End time: 672.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And get bored.

Start time: 673.30
End time: 691.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This could be a shakedown.  It's a little odd.  You know, there's a lot of these operations out there and I, you know, Jerry, you know  who half of them are.  They seem like public service operations and then they find some corporation and then they  essentially shake them down for money.  And they go after them.

Start time: 691.12
End time: 692.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that what Greenpeace did to Apple?

Start time: 693.52
End time: 699.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a possibility.  I would say almost half of these groups do this constantly and there's all kinds of stories  about it.

Start time: 700.28
End time: 704.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You all know a bunch of civil rights groups that do that.  They do it constantly.

Start time: 704.30
End time: 711.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've been doing it for 20 years.  But that's how they get funded.  And this looks like a shakedown video to me because there's no, I mean, it's just ridiculous.  Yeah.

Start time: 712.28
End time: 713.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's the background on the foundation?

Start time: 713.80
End time: 716.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm trying to, looking at it, it looks pretty responsible.

Start time: 716.28
End time: 721.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They all look responsible, but they still do shakedowns.  Yeah.  That's how you get big.

Start time: 721.68
End time: 724.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a bit cynical though, isn't it?  It's a fact.

Start time: 725.76
End time: 730.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but Andrew, do you think they're right in attacking Google in this way?  Does that make sense, what you just saw there?

Start time: 731.58
End time: 736.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's obviously a little exaggerated, but there are some relevant themes.

Start time: 736.56
End time: 741.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, here's the question.  Google gives them $10 million the next day and that ad goes away.

Start time: 744.59
End time: 746.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Try the Reverend Jesse Jackson.

Start time: 746.80
End time: 748.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Jesse Jackson is well known for pulling this.

Start time: 749.52
End time: 755.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But did Google also play the game?  I mean, the rumor is they fund a lot of the network neutrality stuff.  Yeah, I would if I were them too.

Start time: 756.98
End time: 775.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, this is the link they want you to go to.  It says, tell Congress we want, bandwidth limit exceeded.  Great.  I guess it's working too well.  Tell Congress we want a do not track me list if you try to go to that site.  Bandwidth limit exceeded.  And in the shadows, pitching that they can't hear, you got to work the mic.  So, but I guess what they're lobbying for...

Start time: 775.78
End time: 779.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is this a good or a bad example of the need for network neutrality?

Start time: 780.42
End time: 784.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't think this is network neutrality.  I mean, it's free speech.  These guys have the right to run what is...

Start time: 785.80
End time: 788.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I meant that you were getting bandwidth exceeded.

Start time: 788.92
End time: 828.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good question.  They obviously should have taken some of the roses...  We will show you what we think of this.  They should have taken some of the roses money and bought a bigger server perhaps.  But this shows you the success of the campaign.  You know, here's what I said.  Now, you probably heard me say this on the radio, Jerry.  If...  Okay, fine.  You should, we should watch Google.  Absolutely.  I'm not against paying attention to what Google's paying attention to.  But don't forget your internet service provider who knows far more than Google about what  you do all the time and has a box in most cases in their rack that the federal government  mandated that keeps track of this for several years.  That's who you should be.  Why aren't they talking about that?

Start time: 829.31
End time: 829.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So does the ISA...

Start time: 830.52
End time: 839.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or the operation over at AT&T's in San Francisco.  The wiretaps, the NSA wiretaps in the closet.  The echelon thing sitting over there on 2nd Street.  Absolutely.

Start time: 840.94
End time: 850.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do presume that anybody with small kids takes the responsibility for doing a little  bit of limitation on what they can do on the net.

Start time: 850.28
End time: 853.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's not what we're talking about.  I guess what they're saying...

Start time: 853.10
End time: 867.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's what the ad was.  It was all about little kids.  With adults, for heaven's sake, you go get better privacy for Firefox as an application  and just erase all of the crazy network third party cookies every time you turn around.

Start time: 868.74
End time: 872.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, first of all, we don't really know what Google's doing.  They obviously have a lot of information.

Start time: 872.24
End time: 878.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But isn't that the problem that we don't know what they're doing?  Well, should we?  Should there be disclosure?  I think so, don't you?

Start time: 880.24
End time: 883.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Technologically, we can certainly deduce what they're doing.

Start time: 883.24
End time: 891.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They know everything you search for.  In fact, if you go to google.com slash dashboard, they do kind of say, here's what we know about  you.

Start time: 893.20
End time: 899.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really orientated toward environmental stuff.  They must have...  Somebody must have gotten irked about something going on at Google.

Start time: 900.40
End time: 902.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go to google.com slash dashboard.

Start time: 902.24
End time: 909.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing about Google is the more they know about us, the more profitable they are.  I don't think they're evil, but they certainly like to know us for commercial reasons.

Start time: 909.48
End time: 932.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I don't think they really care about Andrew Kean per se.  They care about us in aggregate or if Andrew Kean...  Somebody called me on the radio show, said I...  Actually, I was talking to Wayne Resnick on the radio station in Los Angeles.  He said, I searched for something called Tough Grips once on Google and I see ads for Tough  Grips ever since.  Well, that's what Google wants.  They want to make sure that if you're interested in a product, you see ads for it, right?

Start time: 934.41
End time: 939.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And kids don't know that.  The problem is that kids don't know that.  Kids have no understanding of that.

Start time: 939.32
End time: 951.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That ad's not aimed at kids though.  It's aimed at adults who will go to a site and say, we want Congress to have a do not  track registry.  Is that a solution?  To have a registry that you could...  Just like the do not call registry where you say...

Start time: 951.12
End time: 958.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And when the congressman gets a letter from a 12 year old saying, I want a do not track  registry, does it really register with the congressman?

Start time: 993.06
End time: 1006.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's excuse for that is that, well, we got the best deal we could get.  We got Verizon to come to... get in bed with us and say, we want net neutrality on landlines  but anything goes on wireless and we hope Congress will make a law.

When you take a look at Microsoft and this once pile of competitors that are all gone  or bought up and people are buying up competition.  I always like to point this out.  All the companies that made utilities programs for the PC, Norton, Mace Utilities, the seventh  Oh, Mace, I remember that.  There's a whole slew of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Paul Mace and Bill Gates.  Scott Mace was a writer.  It was an enormous shouting match over how big Microsoft was getting and how much of  monopoly it was coming and how Windows sucked.  This was in the early days in the transition from DOS to Windows.  And it got so, literally so heated that my wife physically got between them because she  was afraid that one of them was actually hit the other.  And we were standing on the balcony of like the ninth floor of the Desert Inn.  So Bill went to a lot of things like that in those days.  This was before he was married.

Start time: 1281.04
End time: 1305.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it was an interesting point that he's pro net neutrality.  Who is Joe Nassarra, first of all?  He's the business tech correspondent columnist for the Times.  He's against net neutrality?  Well, he's in principle for it, but it was a very realistic piece which sort of tried  to take out the evangelical quality.  Because I think the problem with net neutrality is it's become a religious debate between  fundamentalists.

Start time: 1333.98
End time: 1396.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to back up.  Here's the deal.  This is the...  Are you still doing Rose Foundation digging?  Yeah, because I remember talking to Little, one of the guys at the Rose Foundation.  These guys were really irked about what happened when the watchdog, the Google watchdog came  out and made some claims that Google is trying to go behind everybody's back to get a certain  laws changed so that you can get into people's health records so they could index them or  something.  And then the guy, one of the guys who's still at Google made all these public pronouncements  that these guys are full of crap.  And then they went to the Rose Foundation and told them, you should stop funding these  people.  And Little at the Rose Foundation told me that this is the first time anyone has ever  tried to pull a stunt like this.  So they made an enemy.  And so they got into this big beef.  And so now they apparently, you know, you're going to end up with stuff like this.  And the kicker is, is that Google says, yeah, yeah, we made a mistake.  We apologized.  And Little at the Rose Foundation and the people at the watchdog operation, they both  tell me that they never got an apology.  The apology was a lie.

Start time: 1397.12
End time: 1415.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this now, this is good.  You got to the root of it because anybody who looks at that ad that was created by consumerwatchdog.org  paid for by the Rose Foundation, it was going to scratch their head and say, what?  Wow, that's strong words.  That's a, that is an evil portrayal of Eric Schmidt.  What happened?  Now we know.  Now we know that it's a personal thing.

Start time: 1416.12

Transcript:  Google did this week cough up eight and a half million dollars to settle the buzz, the  buzz privacy suit.  Remember Google in the initial stages of buzz, they're kind of Twitter clone, handle it in  such a poor fashion that people could look at your buzz account and figure out who you  corresponded with.  There was a class action lawsuit.  I think a doctor said, look, you know, people now know who my patients are.  A woman said, now my stalker knows where I am.  I know that was great.  It was a big deal.  Epic and the EFF, US lawmakers, foreign governments all criticized it.  So Google's settled this class action lawsuit.  They of course fixed the problem, but they've also now agreed to pay eight and a half million  dollars, not to the victims, but to an education fund to educate buzz users on the issues of  privacy.

Start time: 1530.76
End time: 1535.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what that's Google's position was.  It's a compromise.  Right.  It's not perfect, but at least it's a movement.

Start time: 1535.82
End time: 1548.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But at least they're trying to figure out some solutions to it.  I think, though, that I.  And Google has been so vilified by the loonies.  Right.  I mean, as if I mean, what are your position on Google on this?

Start time: 1550.14
End time: 1550.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm neutral.

Start time: 1551.89
End time: 1559.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Neutral.  I think trust, but verify with Google.  I think at the moment I trust them, but I think we need to watch them.  It's appropriate to say we should watch them.

Start time: 1560.60
End time: 1599.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think we should watch them.  But I think I really wish that the computer community would get behind the Google author  settlement, the one that was put together by the Authors Guild, the publishers and Google  on this Google book scanning, for instance.  Everybody's against it.  And I don't see why.  I think it's literally the best we'll ever get.  But they're they're offering authors is 60 bucks for the insult of scanning your book  without your permission.  And they have to ask your permission before they can do anything with that scan.  I feel there's anything wrong with that.

Start time: 1600.20
End time: 1629.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that the net neutrality issue, though, from an author's point of view, is important  because if I'm going to, you know, as as fewer and fewer people read books and buy their  digital stuff online, I want to be able to buy the highest quality services.  I want to be able to buy prioritization.  I don't have a problem with that.  As an author, I think that we've become so obsessed with flatness and the democratization  of the Internet that we've lost sight of its core business issues and importance.

Start time: 1631.30
End time: 1639.74

Start time: 1664.96
End time: 1681.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's not what the debate is, though, to me.  The debate is not so much who gets sped up, but who gets slowed down.  Yeah, I think to me that's the issue.  And it comes down to things like, well, if you're Verizon, do you deprioritize Skype  packets because you have a telecom business?

Start time: 1682.10
End time: 1693.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think that that misunderstands the nature of these large corporations.  It sees them as these hugely conspiratorial organizations.  They all sit around in the morning saying, who can we kill?  Who can we slow down?

Start time: 1694.57
End time: 1696.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it? Are they not designed to maximize profits?

Start time: 1697.02
End time: 1701.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what you're saying is that there are people in Verizon who every morning would sit down  and say, how can we slow down our competitors?

Start time: 1702.08
End time: 1730.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not at all. What they say is, who are our competitors?  What's going to hurt us?  How do we keep our business alive?  Oh, my God, here comes voice over the Internet.  They want to use wholesale bits on our network instead of the premium retail bits that we  charge for as phone service.  We've got to make sure that those wholesale bits are deprecated and the premium bits are  promoted.  Yeah, but you know what?  They're not doing it in the US, but, Jerry, they do it in Canada.  And they do it here.  They may do it here.  We don't know.

Start time: 1731.34
End time: 1738.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But even with Skype, I mean, even with Verizon, if you're using Skype, you've got to go over  the Verizon network.  So in a sense, they're monetizing it.

Start time: 1739.10
End time: 1764.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're not monetizing it as they wish to.  So and this is the same issue, by the way, we're going to get to Apple's announcement.  This is the same issue, I think, that cable companies have with BitTorrent and other ways  of watching television, including IPTV.  You're using their less expensive wholesale bits, using them as a data network, as opposed  to the premium services of HBO and others.  They really need to.  They want to sell.

Transcript:  Leo, for years, I was either chairman or vice chairman of the piracy committee for science  fiction writers of America.  And we really went after pirates and it was pretty hard to do.  How did that work, Jerry?  Not very well.  What it does is it works with the people who have good motives.  The kid who scanned one of my books because it's out of print and he thinks it's a shame  that that book's out of print.  Little distance back before nowadays when every book can be put in print by its author  simply by delivering it to Amazon.  And by the way, the best way to get an electronic readable copy of a book that you published  in 1974 is to go out and find a very conscientious pirate.  The fans.  Yes.  You're engaged fans.  Don't punish them.  Those are the people we could persuade to turn it off.  Right.  Because they care.  The Pirates Bay, the people who are scrib D, which simply want other people's work to  draw a crowd and then sell something else after they've got the crowd there.  Those people only pay attention to lawsuits, which means that basically they can pirate  anybody in the world except Harold and Alison.

Start time: 1958.08
End time: 1975.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting.  You could ask the issue.  You could, you could, if you were, um, and of course they have a private network, but  let's say Kindle was using as they are now, wifi as well.  And you're Comcast and you say, I have a book business.  I don't want to let the Kindle bits come through as fast.  I think it really comes down to more slowing than speeding.

Start time: 1975.49
End time: 1990.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  But slowing down a book doesn't do anybody any good.  And it doesn't, it's not very effective.  It's not going to do much to slow though.  So it takes me six minutes to download Janet, their Vanovich is latest book as  opposed to four.  So why deal?

That's the problem, which is like this show and this show versus an equivalent porn is  what I'm trying to get her to understand how net neutrality would distinguish between  this show, which we all agree ought to be unrestricted and the kid down the street who  spends 24 hours a day downloading porn and he's slowing everybody in the neighborhood.

Why would you go to it?  All right, let's go there.  I'll show you why I go to it.  They, the old dig.  I agree with you.  I didn't go to the old dig very much because the old dig was a bunch of this small group  of people saying this is what they thought was news.

Oh, I see.  It was kind of, you know, crowdsourcing editorial, not stories, but editorial,  you know, in the sense of this is the big story.  It was unique.  I think it's a great idea.  Very unique.  It was flawed because it turned out that the people who were most involved had a  kind of an odd sensibility, didn't share mine anyway.  This new dig, one of the reasons I like it is you get to pick whose opinions you  care about and that is just like Twitter in that sense, but it's news focused

He is a 70,000 mile flyer this year.  So he spent some time on Virgin America, loves Virgin America.  This cranky attendant didn't really do anything through the whole flight.  However, as they started to descend, the captain comes on, asked everybody to  shut down their computers.  The attendant walked down the aisle immediately following the captain's  announcement and tapped my computer to indicate I should shut it off.  I looked up, nodded and indicated I needed a second to finish an email.  And he's one of those and walked in.  The guy walked on by the time he returned 69 seconds later, I'd finished the  email at exactly five 33, according to email records, and I was closing the lid.  He stood above me and said in a loud voice, I told you to close the  computer, you need to listen to me.  You need to obey my orders.  I am in charge.  I told you to close the computer.  You need to listen.  I am in charge, not you.  I don't know if he actually sounded like that.  That sounds good though.  I like dramatic reading.  I like it.

Go ahead.  If you like, he's probably Italian.  I've done nothing wrong.  Go ahead.  If you like, I have done nothing wrong.

The TSA gets involved.  Uh, meanwhile, the captain comes over and berates him.  The Virgin America captain lectured me twice on the importance of turning off  the computer without even listening to my side of the story.

Almost all of our Google AdWords or AdSense money comes from search.  Yeah.  Because if people are searching for something and the AdWords shows up in the search results,  people are likely to click on those.  So 90% of the money we make, Jerry, so if you have a search on your page...  Search box.  Have a search box on your page.  Make it a Google search box.  And that's...

So yours is too old to have the SYNC cherry in it, but the SYNC is an amazing, it's hands-free calling, turn by turn directions.  Even if you don't have a GPS screen, it'll tell you how to go.  And it's really cool.  You can, it's hands-free music search, traffic search.  It reads text messages.  So when somebody texts me on my Android phone, my Ford SYNC beeps and says you have a text message and reads me the message.  And sometimes it's kind of funny in the robotic voice to hear what some people send me.  I love Ford SYNC.  In fact, I think it's good enough.  And I know there are people, I've talked to people who actually bought a Ford because of SYNC.  The good news is Ford's making great cars.  I mean, the pride really is back, I have to say.  And you get the Ford SYNC in there.  Ford Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.  You can find out more by going to the website, SYNCmyridepodcast.com.  The idea, of course, is safety first.  Your hands are on the wheel, your eyes on the road, but you tell the car, you know, play Twit 264 or play Leonard Cohen or play Bob Dylan or whatever you want to listen to.  You say, give me directions.  If you have an accident, it calls 911 for you, feeds them the GPS coordinates, plays a recorded message, turns on the microphone and says, what would you like to tell them?

This is the new iPod.  It has a 240 by 240 screen on it, the new nano.  They took the camera out.  They shrunk it.  Eight and 16 gigs, but I love this because it has a watch face on it.  Yeah.

So I thought, well, I can do this.  They never said it any time.  Uh, I held up the thing.  Now here's the problem.  First of all, Steve sees me.  Second of all, this frame is a capture from Apple's official video of the event.  Not only they see me, they got me on camera.  So you think this maybe is why I don't get invited anymore?  You sure?

Transcript:  You know, there is one piece to this, um, that we haven't thought about, which  is the change in the industry.  It wasn't that long ago that Microsoft would have been the one that was trying  to embrace and extend the iTunes music, that type of thing.  What happened to Microsoft?  Microsoft, they would have kept trying until they got it right.  It would have tried a couple of times and it would have flopped and they would  have tried again and it would have flopped, but eventually they would have  found some hardware maker to get into partnership with them and between them,  they would have produced something that did pretty good.  Look at it.  For instance, there's only two major mice companies left in this world.  It took Microsoft a long time to get, get it right.  But once they did that Microsoft red-eye mouse kind of swept the industry.  Didn't it?  A lot of stuff like that Microsoft is they sort of embraced and extended.  Now they haven't been doing that since Gates left the company.  And maybe that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  I think that once Gates left that company really became an also ran.  That was the difference.  I, I don't for a moment believe that, that Microsoft was an accident.  I think Bill Gates was one of the brightest people I've ever met in my entire life.  And by bright, I mean, even when he with 10% of his brain, he deigned to look at  commercial aspects of things and he did better than most people do.  Um, I think.  You agree, John?

Transcript:  So, well, I'm, I agree about the overall situation with the company, but I have to  say that as a maintenance CEO, Balmer has actually done a pretty good job.  The companies really doesn't lose money.  They are still on a growth path.  I mean, it's for, if you're a shareholder, you can't be complaining too much, except  for the fact that there's so little excitement at the company that it doesn't  generate any interest in the stock.

You have to have a computer.  This is kind of Apple's...  Sometimes I question...  Achilles heel.  I think it's an Achilles heel.  Even the iPhone needs to activate through a computer,  and you certainly can't copy music to it without a...  No, no.  You go buy an iPhone and try to make it work  without iTunes on a computer.  You can't.  Unless you get them to activate it in the store for you.  But then you can't put any music on it.  So I suspect that's why Japan...  They're still buying CD players  because they don't have computers.  Hmm.

Go to meeting, a great product for people who do not want to travel and yet want to be effective and get things done.  By the way, as long as we're talking about the iPad, they've got a great go to meeting app on the iPad.  So let's say you get invited.  Go to meeting works Windows or Mac.  You can start a meeting.  You can do it ahead of time.  Send an email with a link.  Or you're on the phone with people and you want to kind of raise the tone of the conversation a little bit by showing them the drawings of spreadsheets, the PowerPoint presentation.  So you say, go to go to meeting.com.  Here's the idea.  If you're if you're if you're meaties have an iPad, you just say here's the meeting ID.  They launch go to meeting on the iPad and they are seeing your screen on their iPad or their Mac or their PC and they're hearing the audio through the speakers.  You can even talk because there's a microphone on the iPad.  So anywhere there's Wi-Fi.  I've had meetings out in the in the yard out here.  It's just incredible.

And I just read an interview with an oncologist who said, you know, this is these these you're exposed to radiation with these these backscatter.  I think they cause cataracts.  These are dangerous.

Cocktail to make out of.  But it worked.  I mean, it's gone.  The lump is gone.  There is no piece of it left.  Most of my balance is gone, too.  But that's not a bad price to pay.  Such good news.  You had an inner ear affected from the radiation?  Well, yeah, because the the lump was in such a place that that they got some damage to the ear.  That they got some damage to the inner ear pieces as they were going in there.  I've been deaf since the Korean War, but the balance business was was largely due to radiation damage.  Yeah.

Transcript:  TB we're going to look back on and say wish it were like it.  But no with cancer because we're going to have genetic.  We do a show called Futures in Biotech and it's fascinating subject.  They're getting very every cancer is different.  And if you could sequence the cancer that you have, you could make a cancer drug that would be target that particular cell and no other.  So the effects of chemotherapy would be totally benign.  You wouldn't need radiation and you have effective treatments killing all cancer is is a cell that reproduces without check.  You'd be able to kill those cells by sequencing those cells.  And I think that that is from what I hear from the geneticists.  Not so very far off.  So you're right.  And we might say five years from now, we might say as we do about polio today, glad we dodge that bullet.

Start time: 5815.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was at polio maybe back to the problem is a lot of these say it.  I mean, cancer is not a bacterial infection.  It's damage problem is transcription error.  Yes.  But bacteria and viruses, to a lesser extent, the bacteria in particular evolve very rapidly.  They have many generations in a short period of time.  And that's why you've got so much of this MRSA and TB resistant, you know, antibiotic resistant tuberculosis vaccines and things.  And of course, the Russian prison camps, other places, too, but Russian in particular, are just breeding grounds for that because they give them some antibiotics, but not enough.  And as a result, you are essentially breeding resistant bacteria.  I think cancer is probably easier to lick as a long term thing in for the human race than tuberculosis.

Transcript:  They monitor Twitter traffic during the Steve Jobs talk.  And they, based on that, say that the most interesting thing, Steve said, they say popular.  I don't know if that's a fair characterization, was the Apple TV.  2,271 tweets per minute.  That was the highest rate of tweeting.  Apple was racking up 38 tweets a second.  136,260 tweets an hour.  Apple TV, 25%.  iPod, 16%.  Ping, 8%.  iOS, 7%.  So there you go.  I don't know what you make of that.  But I wish I had that.  Wouldn't it be nice if we knew we could do a Tweet-o-meter?  John, do you tweet?  Yeah, of course I do.  Oh, boy.  You asked him three years ago.  He wouldn't have said that.

I had a quote from...  It was about Obama's and the tech was for MarketWatch.  It was on deadline.  I needed this quote accurately and where he said it.  I just asked the audience and just within two minutes, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,  they all dug it up because I couldn't find it because it was buried.  That's what I use the chat room for.  The chat room is like that.

Transcript:  That is interesting that you can do that with Twitter.  I mean, one of the big advantages of being us, one of us, is that we all have access to tens of thousands of very smart people.

Start time: 6244.24
End time: 6313.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it worked this way. What happened was that he had no money.  And he sent me this copy of the thing, and I looked at it, and by golly, it was the best Pascal out there at the time,  and I wrote that in a column.  And I bought it, by the way, because you said that, Jerry.  I sent him a copy of the... an early copy, because remember, Byte in those days was paper magazine,  so it took three months from the time I wrote something until it came out.  And he looked at that and went to the Byte salesman in the Bay Area and said,  look, I'm going to get this great review.  You've got to advance me the money and let me own credit by a full page ad in the magazine.  And the salesman looked at it and said, yeah, it looks good.  That probably will work.  And then he took that and he went around to every other magazine in the business,  and he told people, look, Byte's giving me credit.  And by golly, when it came out that month, he had full page ads in every magazine in the industry,  and he sold something like 100,000 copies of Boylan Pascal in three or four weeks,  which built his company from nothing.

Transcript:  Well, our chat room has come up with this article from Byte Magazine, the Chaos Manor column, in 1987.  The first published reference of the annual Pornell Dvorak Comdex party sponsored by Wilhurst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 6524.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's another Googler. You can Google that.  It's hard to come up with a question that isn't easily Googled.  The thing that I use the Twitter for is when you have something that's so much in the news that the answer to the question can't be Googled.  Because if you try to Google it, it's buried.  It's down because you had a million things that are on top of it.  And that's when the crowdsourcing works. Otherwise, you can just Google it.

Start time: 6526.35

Again, yearly, I suspect there might have been an earlier one.  No.  The party behind is an alternative party for writers and celebrities and anyone who could find it.  There would be no written invitations.  Unfortunately, there was no acceptable place to hold the party.  Wes had lined up the Neiman Marcus Fashion Mall, but some nervous administration...

Food and liquor donated from InfoWorld, 800 Software, Gates Distributing, Computer Currents, Hercules.  The party began.  Philippe Cahn made his annual good luck appearance with his traditional public announcement of  champagne for everyone.  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the thinking behind the party was that if you had some big names, and Jerry and I talk about this stuff all the time,  you put some big names, you got Hearst, Purnell, DeVoregan, and you organize a party,  you throw in a few big names out, and then everyone just gravitates to it.  And so it was very successful for year after year, and then of course it became too big.  Here we go.  That became a problem.

I decided to organize a Thursday night party as a last minute ad lib to save the show for myself and friends.  I call my friend Will Hurst and fellow columnist Jerry Purnell.  This is it.  This is the beginning.  It would be the first annual no-name party.  And the date is December 24, 1984.  And the chat room got it.
