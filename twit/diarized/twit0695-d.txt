Transcript:  I feel like they've gotten big enough and we're starting to see the pieces start to crumble, you know  They've gotten so big that's been the goal for all tech companies for the past decade and now that they're so big  Oh, they're influencing elections  They're like people are using their platforms and site riots and they have no idea how to control any of it and doing their best to like  avoid responsibility  So it'll probably still be around but I'm really wondering what tech companies are gonna do to like deal with this problem  Once you get so big you can have some serious impacts

Start time: 541.54
End time: 547.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's another issue. Yeah, and I imagine there'll be governmental regulation  There'll be societal pressure

Start time: 549.69
End time: 562.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm surprised we haven't like dealt with regulation yet because I'm thinking back  I remember the 90s the big thing was like Microsoft antitrust web browsers in Windows. Oh my god  I know who cared by the timing now by that time that Microsoft

Overlay that says we protect your privacy  Please click here to accept and then that's on top of all the regular kind of full-page ads that you get  I mean browsing the web has has never been less enjoyable these days. I'm not I'm not kidding. I'm all for the  Appification just I mean it is a horrendous way to to surf the web now

Start time: 615.52
End time: 618.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 645.46
End time: 669.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's that's exactly what's happened is people get more and more  Frustrated and annoyed with the way the web works for them. Either they're seeking out paid sites that have you know less of that  Or they're going they're moving to apps. I think it's your Facebook's primary  Presence is on apps is on its app and it's a lot less annoying that way than it is on the desktop

Start time: 669.18
End time: 738.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's definitely there's some evidence of this because of course we had the biggest shopping day of the year  last week on Monday  Cyber Monday it was Amazon's biggest day ever  Beating Prime Day  But the evidence is that a lot of the sales that we saw during Black Friday  Cyber Monday giving Tuesday, which apparently is mostly about giving me something  We're about not not charities which you're supposed to do but giving ourselves things  We're online a huge number of these were on the phone Thanksgiving Day a billion dollars worth of commerce on the phone. I  Can only I guess the thing is imagine what the holidays look like now I  Don't have to imagine I know you eat the meal  Try not to talk about politics you eat the meal you try not to talk about politics as soon as the meals done you  Immediately scatter to look at your phone the football games on your soporific your coma toast practically from all that food and you buy stuff  That's the holidays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, I'm just saying Amazon always sends out this press release every year  It's the same thing like the biggest day ever on the days you'd expect  So I'm just surprised we're still seeing this of course, of course, this is where the commerce is  Of course, this is what's happening now. Yeah doesn't feel like news to me. Yeah Adobe somehow got in this business

Start time: 761.74
End time: 813.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know how with Adobe Analytics. They're the ones who now do all the big stats  They say cyber Monday  Sales hit seven point nine billion dollars. So it wasn't just Amazon  It was the largest online shopping day of all time in the US still dwarfed by singles day in China  But still a significant holiday 20% growth year over year. That's what I thought was interesting  Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday 28% growth year over year  So really kind of a surprising Saturday and Sunday  We're also big new record as the biggest online shopping weekend in the US six point four  billion dollars  so, you know, you could point to all sorts of economic indicators, but it sounds to me like people in the United States anyway feel like  Happy days are here again, and they're spending like crazy  What is singles day in China? What is that?

End time: 868.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so singles day sales in 2018  Let me see business insider has the has the numbers it's half of all of Alibaba's sales  Happen in one day  Wow  Yeah, it is 30 billion dollars. Here's the here's the graph just to give you a  Sense of it 30 billion dollars for singles day cyber Monday 7.9 black Friday 6.2 Thanksgiving  I'm still blown away the Thanksgiving Day sales 3.7 billion 1 billion of that online and that's that's really a  Big shift. That's like a 30% shift from last year

Start time: 871.22
End time: 884.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way Adobe got into that because of their acquisition of Omniture  a lot of corporate  Customers use we used to use it at hers and so that's where they get all that data is from Omniture now in the UK

Start time: 885.12
End time: 892.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nate, I mean you don't do Thanksgiving, but is it still a big day on Friday to shop. It's become a huge thing

Start time: 892.18
End time: 946.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, black Friday. It's it's is absolutely everywhere  You know  There isn't a store you can go to pretty much within the whole of Britain that isn't trying to push something to do with  Black Friday to you, but it's not even just on the day frankly  It's more like a black week and you actually get stuff for you several days before the Friday and several days after the Friday  Everyone just you know jumps right in  I think one of the interesting things about the UK though that always stands out to me as being  Notably different to the US is that about twice as many  Rather that the percentage of people who shop online in Britain is around 20% of all retail sales is done online in the UK in  The US it's about 10% according to some recent figures. I've seen so more people are physically going to stores in the US  Then in then in Britain and so I think our  Average spend online on something like black Friday actually skews slightly higher just because of the number of people doing it online now

Start time: 946.88
End time: 977.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's actually a new  acronym  Which I had never heard before I think it's called Bop It  Which is buy online  Pick up maybe it's Bop. I don't know what it's buy online pick up in store  Boppis buy online pick up in store and  That's I think Walmart chiefly has pushed that but these brick-and-mortar stores have actually come up with a clever way of keeping their business  going  Boppis was increased this year

Start time: 979.54

Start time: 990.74
End time: 1017.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's great because it's great for the people who don't decide and gifts early enough because the shipping window  That's the that's the downside right for if you're like, yeah  If you just wait to the last minute being able to buy online just run to a store and grab stuff is super great  I use that right most of the year to best buy has been doing it for a while  It's great  You never have to like go searching through an aisle  You can't just go to the main thing and walk out with the DVD or whatever you need another thing that's changed

Start time: 1017.32
End time: 1044.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It might be help helping drive  This is Amazon you used to be able to go to Amazon avoid sales tax and now that you have to pay sales tax  No matter what jurisdiction you're in  There's no advantage price advantage Amazon over buying at Walmart online and then picking it up and there's the advantage of no shipping cost  So that might save you money and the speed  Just going down and pick it up. I mean, yeah, and as you say a lot of people wait to last minute  Although it wouldn't be last minute

Start time: 1045.36
End time: 1075.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In November though a lot of the things that Walmart does they don't actually have in the store you order it and then you still  Wait two or three days and then you go get it. Oh, that's interesting. Yes  Walmart in Houston has been experimenting with these like towers. They're like self-service kiosks  They're like ten feet tall and you walk up to it and you put your credit card in and you put a code in and  It's essentially the thing the monolith ejects your your product and so you don't even have to deal with a human in it

And an order something that you want, you know in an hour's time  And when you you pass through a station and it'll be there for you to pick up  We could order your breakfast and they'll be sitting in your seat when you leave  And it sounds crazy  But you think about what's going on with with drone technology and with Amazon's like two-hour delivery thing on groceries  I'm not sure if that's the same in the US, but they have that they're here. I can totally believe it  I can totally believe it. They did an experiment I think in in in  CES a couple of years ago where they had drones delivering stuff to it or to an autonomous vehicle  And that was supposed to be the future is that you want something in the car and the drone will just drop it through the sunroof  Not even kidding what okay, so that's the future

Here's how the beer comes  I'm gonna give you guys choice even though you don't to get I only get to drink it  I have two Hopsy's this is the they get them from all over the country. They partner breweries. This is actually brewed  at the strike brewery in San Jose shoeless Joe brown ale or  From the Coronado Brewing Company in San Diego guava Islander IPA, which would you like?  Too bad. I'm putting the shoeless Joe in  Alright, I think you'd want a brown ale. Wouldn't you Nate? Yeah, I always want a brown ale. I think so  Yeah, so in the cap this is so cool is the little  Doohickey the mechanism this is this is kind of like Al Capone's vault here  I don't know. I don't we don't have a shot of this, but I'm gonna open this up and the hatch opens  And use you slide the Hopsy in here and then you have to put the connector through here  So I'm gonna slide the beer in here. This is fresh  it's so good and  I'm gonna close the top and then I'm gonna close this seal this up  That's how easy it is to put another mini keg in there and turn it on now  It's gonna take a little bit to chill  It's gonna chill it up a little bit  Although I can't get you keep these in the fridge so that they're gonna be cold to start with you start by selecting your holiday package  Bestsellers which are your favorite beers from the best craft breweries. I mean, these are really good breweries  You also can choose I know a lot of you like IPAs and pale ales if you like those hops  hazy West Coast session and pale ales in there or the  Easy drinkers summer on tap from lagers to Colchis to Pilsners. That's probably where I would go  But you see you could choose beers curated to your tastes afterwards  You'll get four mini kegs of your choice as part of the monthly subscription plan  Each mini keg stays fresh for 30 days. You want this fresh the whole point of this is fresh  Outside of the sub home draft system and then once you put it in the sub and tap it you've got two weeks to drink it  We really had a great time at Thanksgiving. This was a big hit to tap this  We had a nice IPA for Thanksgiving now is a perfect time  To gift yourself for a friend Hopsy just for the holidays a great deal.

What the heck  Tap this out a little bit. Oh  I feel so left out. This is so good  I'm getting a nice brown ale try hopsy comm slash tweet. This is my kind of advertiser. I  Want more like this?  Well, we probably buried the lead the big story of the week we all agreed before we started  The Marriott hack  500 million guests  Revealed there and a lot of information revealed about them this Marriott acquired the starwood group SPG in  2016 I think  Apparently what they didn't know is they also acquired a system that was hacked in 2014 and not only did they not know it then  although you would one would think due diligence would have  Revealed it they didn't know for another two years. So for four years  Hackers have been roaming the starwood system  And have had apparently full rain Marriott says we learned about it last week and  And  They're getting a lot of heat over this. So let me tell you what has been  Revealed almost everybody has a starwood account. That's or a Marriott account. That's probably why it's half a billion people  For a three this is what Marriott said  for 327 million of you the information includes quote some combination of name address phone number email  passport number account information date of birth  gender and arrival and departure information  for another  137 million of you it also may include encrypted payment card information  But they couldn't rule out the possibility the encryption keys had also been stolen  So they can't say for sure  whether that information has leaked out I  Have to thank GDPR because it's I without a doubt there's no way Mary I would have told anybody about this for quite some time  They had to it's 72 hours, right? Yeah, they have 72 72 hours

Start time: 2216.26
End time: 2236.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and and companies that that that are found now to be in breach of GDPR  They face fines. I think it's up to 4% of their global annual revenue  So, I mean you look at a size of a company like that or any of the big tech companies  I mean 4% of your annual revenue. That's not a small figure. That's not worth the risk

Start time: 2238.48
End time: 2268.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So one of the interesting things about this story is that it actually  Was only the starwood hotels and people who had stayed there who were affected  It was not people who had accounts with if you only had accounts with Marriott or courtyard by Marriott or that brand  But a lot of the press in headlines and sometimes in the stories never made that distinction  It was if you you know, this was a Marriott hack as opposed to a starwood. Yeah, it was the starwood reservation. It's different

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here's one thing and I haven't seen anything on that  So so today I didn't know if I had a starwood account and I went in and discovered that I did have one  But I don't think I've stayed there since since before 2014  I mean I hadn't since then but what's interesting is that there's also a notification there that  Marriott in August had merged its reservation  Database with starwood so beginning in August they were putting together  So if you had a Marriott and a starwood account, they actually were merging them, which means it's possible  But I haven't seen anything about this that the hackers who were in there until they discovered them  Then began to get access to the Marriott accounts  So it is really interesting it's possible, but I haven't seen anything on that at all

Start time: 2345.41

Start time: 2359.00
End time: 2383.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, apparently they were taking the they were taking the data and encrypting it before they shipped it off and  If I remember reading the story correctly the hackers were the intrusion system right the hackers did the intrusion system was designed to look for  Data that was moving offline that was not encrypted. So they used encryption more on the site in order to move it out

We're gonna we're not gonna see the end of this until there is  Maybe that's just grandstanding. I don't know Brian Krebs on security  Talks about what companies should learn from this and number one is that  Cybersecurity has to be part of the culture. It can't be an afterthought. It's not a necessary evil. It literally has to be  Job one part of the culture  but he also has lessons for individuals and  You know for most of our listeners who aren't running major enterprises  You know my suggestion if you are you might check with you know, some good security people  We have an actually we have a sponsor this an intrusion detection system that's really awesome  it's those things to canaries and they look like they would have they would have discovered this immediately because  You disguise them as NAS or a Windows share or a file, you know payroll or something  Just something attractive to to bad guys and the minute they touch it  Either try to open it try to enter a password do anything it immediately phones home  That's I mean, obviously Marion had nothing like that on these systems  for individuals Brian says  You got to accept two unfortunate and harsh realities  reality number one  Bad guys already have access to personal data points. You may believe should be secret but aren't  Including credit card information social security number mother's maiden name date of birth address previous address phone number and yes  Even your credit file thanks to aqua facts  Reality number two any this is really important any data point you share with a company will in all likelihood  Eventually be hacked lost leaked stolen or sold  Usually through no fault of your own and somebody called the radio show said well if I use two-factor authentication, is that better?  No, it isn't because you're secure  but but Marriott is not and  He says if you're an American it means at least for the time being your recourse to do anything about it  When your information is hacked lost stolen leaked or sold is nil  Nothing you can do. I love it  Marriott well, you know what they're doing the usual they're offering a year's  worth of service of  Cyber monitoring  From a company owned by security firm Kroll that advertises the ability to scour cybercrime underground markets for your data  He says should you take him up on it?

Transcript:  You know  They always get the headlines and it's and it's important that they that they do and hopefully get reported on in the in the right way  But I mean I I just I did I had a story for Bloomberg two or three weeks ago actually about  Just the number of large websites large and small websites actually that are just routinely  Leaking low-level customer data as a result of just not protecting how their websites are sending data to  To Google, you know within things like site maps or letting site pages that shouldn't be indexed be indexed and it's amazing  you can there there is personal detail leaking out of  Like something like 20% of the biggest e-commerce websites in the US, you know, I found golf clubs. I found charities I found  You know restaurants all kinds of stuff and some of them they're only leaking  What looks like very innocent data, but it might be full names address  Donations made to certain charities your state, you know email address all that kind of thing  but it's enough for somebody who has that data to be able to you know, call up that person who may be vulnerable and  Put on a pretty good impression that they are  Legitimately from this institution that you paid money to and it's so common it is so common and it's just it just never seems  to go away no matter how many of these breaches we see I

Transcript:  Every time I have a credit card stolen  one of the first things they do  to test the credit card number is they donate a dollar to a charity and  You know some small often as a UK charity. I'm not sure why but  The reason is the charities have such lax security that they can almost always  Put the charge through and without raising any alarms and that way they know they they have a good credit card number  So yeah, I mean and I'm you know what charities don't have a lot of money  I can understand that but a company like Marriott really should have better

Transcript:  So so I do recommend that you visit  Brian's website because I think it's a very good article on what it all means and at the end he quotes senator Mark Warner  Who says it seems like every other day we learn about a new mega breach affecting the personal data of millions of Americans  Rather than accepting this trend as the new normal  This latest incident should strengthen Congress's resolve. We must pass laws that require data minimization  Ensuring companies do not that do not keep sensitive data  They no longer you need and it's past time we enact data security laws  Ensure companies account for security costs rather than making their consumers shoulder the burden and harms  Resulting from these lapses. I hope he does this that sounds like JDG DPR, right frankly  Pretty much. I think that's where we're headed. I think we're that Facebook knows that Tim Cook at Apple said we need it

Yep  Sad but true sad but true I should give you a pause before we take a break  Let's leave you with a positive note  The New York Times great article this week  We've all seen the pop-up alerts and windows that say  This is from support dot Microsoft comm  Microsoft warning alert malicious  pornographic spyware  riskware  Detected, please call us immediately  Do not ignore this critical alert if you close this page your computer access will be disabled to prevent further damage to your network  Your cut your cut your computers alerted us has been infected with with a pornographic spyware and riskware  Whatever a riskware is the following information is being stolen financial data Facebook logins credit card details email account logins photos stored in this computer  Contact us immediately so our expert engineers can walk you through the removal process over the phone to protect your identity  That'll be $300 these pop-ups and pop-ups just like them match phone calls  We've been getting for years from I got I got one from Windows  I'm driving in my car your computer is infected  Well Microsoft has worked with Indian police in New Delhi and  They've traced a lot of these two boiler rooms in New Delhi, which is apparently I thought Bangalore was India's capital for  call centers, but I guess it's New Delhi and  A lot of these guys doing these scams and a lot of people the text you'll get when you call these numbers  Are actually date by day real tech support call centers  that moonlight at night  To to hack you they got all the equipment right there. We're right there. We got yeah, we just go right ahead  On Tuesday and Wednesday police from two Delhi suburbs rated 16  Fake tech support centers arrested about three dozen people last month 24 people were arrested in similar raids and 10 call centers  The these are scammers who have extracted a lot of money from  Mostly I would say elderly victims American and Canadian  With the pop-ups the victims would then be offered a package of services ranging from $99 to $1,000  to fix the problem Microsoft did a survey and  According to Microsoft  When these pop-ups show up or people call about five percent of people who see him respond  five percent and  Once they respond about six percent actually hand over money and allow these guys remote access to their computers  The advice from a  researcher who  Who studied this Najma?  Miramir, Connie who did a research paper from Stony Brook University  She estimated that a single pop-up campaign spread over a hundred twenty four hundred forty two web domains  Brought in ten million dollars in just two months. She said the best thing just don't pick up the phone  Sure don't stand away from the phone  By the way you get ready because the next thing that happens in the next three months is IRS calls also fake  And I guess we should point out that neither the IRS nor Microsoft will call you or put pop-ups on your screen  That they are they're scammers and you know, the sad thing is it often is elderly people people are less sophisticated  Technologically I hear from people all the time.

They were actually coming from  Pinterest's servers and were the result of a technical fault and then the email chain moves on and

Start time: 4803.44
End time: 4821.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It wasn't real  But the fact of the matter is that there's still thousands of other emails that this gentleman has that now the this parliamentary committee has  Seized and we're we know we're sort of sitting on the edge of our seats  To get hold of them which as I say I believe will be this coming week

Start time: 4822.04
End time: 4828.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think there'll be a smoking gun in there?  I mean the smoking and what would a smoking gun reveal that Facebook knew about Russian interference and did nothing

Start time: 4829.70
End time: 4872.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that's that's that's what they want to find. Yeah, and and it's it's too early to speculate because we haven't seen enough  We don't know enough about it  there's also  it's not for me to gossip about the way that the these emails were discovered but you know, I would just encourage people to do a  bit of googling and and and look at some of the background to how this  This these emails were discovered in the first place  But certainly that's what the committee that sees them is is looking for it's looking for a smoking gun that says  Facebook knew about Russian meddling and Facebook did not do anything and obviously Facebook  vehemently denies all of this and has vehemently denied it up until you know as recently as this week  So it will continue to do so. I'm sure but it's definitely a story that's going to keep on giving

Start time: 4873.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't know the story of six four three, which is the company that had the emails they had they'd received them in  Discovery apparently they're suing Facebook for something

Start time: 4884.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they they made a tool a Facebook app that allowed you to find photos of your friends in bikinis  It's really it's highbrow stuff  So that's that's their

Start time: 4899.14
End time: 4950.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, that's no, I'm sorry. I just know  And so he's suing and then Facebook provided in legal discovery some emails presumably relevant to the case  They were sealed by the court  But as you said the the the founder of the company was in London on a business trip and accosted by a committee of UK  Lawmakers, this is a movie man. Give us the emails. I won't give you the emails  Give us the email they finally gave him the emails  Facebook's now saying we want sanctions because he violated his court order  Sealing the documents that hearing I think is just happened on Friday  Yeah  Facebook's but what would be so do you think that these emails?  Revealed in discovery would somehow have to do with Russian involvement and why would they?

Start time: 4951.70
End time: 4960.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean that's basically that all of this is to try and put pressure on  On getting Zuckerberg into into the

Start time: 4966.08
End time: 5049.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, I certainly I think that they're going through it to seeing if they can find anything because if there's even this  Shred of detail in there that allows them to put additional pressure on Zuckerberg then they're gonna use it  I mean to give you an example of how heavy-handed they're being with this while the  Parliamentary hearing was going on last week. This is the one where Facebook's privacy chief  Was being interviewed for several hours, you know these go on for hours these hearings. It's ridiculous  the public relations team on behalf of the committee sent out a  photograph professional photograph of a  empty seat with Mark Zuckerberg's name on it and  the whole of the committee  looking towards it just to say he's not shown up again and  You know when I got that email I was like guys seriously, this is such an obvious PR stunt  But I'm also I'm almost kind of glad they did because it validates my theory that  Everything they're doing is to just put more and more and more public pressure and potentially  Embarrassment on the Zuckerberg until he gets on a plane and comes here and answers some questions  And you know, there are many people who agree with that. I mean Christopher Wiley that the whistleblower behind it  I know him reasonably well these days  I speak to him quite often and and he's adamant that the main reason that he that Zuckerberg won't come to London is because he knows  It's the only place he's gonna get given a properly difficult time and a hard time answering questions

Start time: 5071.66
End time: 5091.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's that's been  Again like a massive reason for this committee trying, you know  They want to get to the bottom of this they want to find out the truth because if there is belief that brexit was  unduly influenced by any kind of  rigging or  persuasion then they you know

End time: 5155.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean talking about doing a do-over the brexit a second referendum in Britain right now is sort of it's on all the all the front  pages  There's a lot of calls for that to happen  It's it's a very very controversial one because you know for those who are interested  The the people who are against this think that it's it's it's a punch in the face of democracy that you know  You don't do another vote. We didn't like the results. So results so we're gonna do it again  exactly, but the argument that I personally a little more on the side of is that  So much has come out since then in terms of either whether it's how people were advertised to as part of campaigning  We have you know, they're exceptionally strict rules that have been provably broken  But also the fact that we didn't even know what kind of a deal was on the table  There's a lot of people that think that you should at least have a vote for the deal that we now have or no deal  But that's it's not really a tech topic. So I shouldn't be on my topic which I think I I I feel I

Start time: 5157.22
End time: 5203.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Feel like there's a certain amount of finger pointing  both in the US and the UK because a large number of people didn't like the results of the vote and  The finger pointing is at tech companies because they make great scapegoats  And I don't know anything about the UK situation, but here in the United States  It seems pretty clear to me that no matter what happened on Facebook and Twitter  That the will of the people was reflected fairly accurately by this vote that it wasn't a question of  Convincing people to vote against their best interests or do something they wouldn't have done. Otherwise  It certainly helped encourage people and gave people a chance to to vent  But I don't know if you could say the vote was

Start time: 5204.96
End time: 5215.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or could you it was a pretty close election though? Like that's the thing. Yeah, it was so close both  Yeah in the US and same, but it's always close. It's so this is the point is that yeah, it's close because it's close

Start time: 5216.24
End time: 5243.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is a definite this disagreement that there's two different populations the United States and they disagree and it's and and they're fairly  Equal in size and it's fairly close and so it's easily but basically it means it's a system that's close to tide  Yes, you're right. It could be thrown either way. But even if you say well it nudged the needle the point is it's still close  I mean, it's not that different from  half the people wanting this I

Transcript:  Don't see any problem like holding Facebook to task certainly like between what we're seeing with the what the Russian troll operation and  this and everything happening like clearly a  Lot of people were using these platforms in bad faith and figured out ways like socially engineer a lot of that  And I agree with I think these platforms deserve. Yeah, they deserve to be criticized for not seeing

Start time: 5264.30
End time: 5279.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree with you on that. I think that a lot of it though comes from people who want to do over  And that's I don't agree with that. I mean if you want to go after them for these these issues  Fine, but but not because it changed the result of the election. I guess I mean

Transcript:  There are some very interesting things that have come out as a result of all this  There was another story that I wrote earlier this week  based off something that that Christopher Wiley had said that the  preferences of  People's fashion and this was this was in the US. This was ahead of the presidential election  their fashion pressure preferences the brands that they  They showed affinity towards this is a great article by the way  Thank you. What were a massive factor in determining whether somebody was more inclined towards the  Republicans or the Democrats specifically that you know, if you wore Wrangler jeans, you're more likely to be persuadable to vote  Republican and if you were a shopper of Abercrombie and Fitch or  Macy's then you are more likely you could be persuaded in voting Democrat and you know  It's amazing when you think about it  But the bottom line is that everybody has to make a choice about fashion like it nobody walks  Well, some people walk out the house naked  But most people have the decency to put some clothes on which means they have to go into a shop to buy some clothes  They'd make that choice. They interact with those brands. Maybe online  Maybe they're shopping for Black Friday deals that data is there on Facebook and can be used when you know  triangulated with other data points to pretty accurately reflects  their political leaning

Transcript:  Yeah, you can tell who wants I bet if you like country music you're more likely to vote Republican exactly the issue though  As Nate brought up is can you then say ah, well this person is influenceable  Can I nudge them in the direction? I want them to go and that's basically been the job of PR for many years

Start time: 5437.34

Transcript:  I mean you can go back to the chap Edward Bernays  You know a lot of people call him the father of PR and he was being you know  He had a campaign to promote cigarettes. I think maybe lucky strike  I'm not I'm not sure but it was something like that  They were they were green and essentially the way he did it is he manipulated fashion trends  So that people liked a particular color of green because the color of green was the same as the cigarettes and therefore the cigarette sales went up

Transcript:  He was a Sigmund Freud's nephew  Was he really oh quite a character? Yeah, he claimed uncle Sigi gave him a lot of ideas about the unconscious mind and how to influence it  He's the guy who did four out of five doctors  He was hired by the pork council because they wanted people to buy more bacon  So he went out and he's yes. I doubt he making anybody  Yeah, I doubt he interviewed anybody but he said for I think he gave them a kind of a suspicious questionnaire  Do you think people should have a hearty breakfast? Oh, yes four out of five doctors recommend a hearty breakfast including bacon and eggs  And in fact completely changed American diet  We didn't need bacon for breakfast until then he convinced women it was okay to smoke  Because he had suffragettes smoking lucky strikes in a in a in a parade  in New York City and  what he can't even came up with a name for lucky strikes like  freedom strikes that like if you believe in the women's right to vote you should smoke and if you're a woman it's okay and  Completely introduced smoking for women in the United States. So it yes, this is an old and long  known  principle  Nothing new here and I'm sure every politician, you know, and every political campaign has done tried to do sometimes less  successfully than others but has tried to do the same thing  Admittedly Facebook Twitter social media give you weaponized are able to you can weaponize these things  Because for instance, you'd said you can do dark ads instead of putting an ad where everybody can see what you're trying to do  You can show these ads only to susceptible people and no one knows what you're doing

Transcript:  I don't think you know Facebook has put several things in place in an attempt to kind of fix this and there was some  Indication that they had some success in the midterms in terms of preventing it  But but when you look at kind of what they are doing and the scope of it  I think they just feel like they're lost like they don't they have no idea how to really keep this from happening again  And I think you know, I don't necessarily feel very good about the 2020 election in the United States

Well, I but I don't think necessarily that there was  the indications from what  We saw in the in the stories writing about it was that there wasn't kind of the attempts that were made  weren't on the same scale as  They were and maybe that's why not  Facebook well and it could be that also this is a distributed election the focus they focused on one thing  in the  2016 election and that was the presidential election and I think in in  2018 it's a distributed election, you know  There are so many people running and I just don't think that it necessarily was the kind of thing where it would be easy to

Transcript:  I mean that's so I suppose as a tech  Supporter I should I should defend these tech companies and say look this stuff happens all the time  You can't blame the election on Facebook  Sure stuff happened, but it but it's just because stuff also happened in magazines and newspapers across the country  These are the media that people consume. This is where if you're going to try to exert influence you will and  And that's just because Facebook's part of the American conversation  There weren't there no worse than anybody else. I disagree.

It's very personal  It's very intimate and it's very easy to target  You know, it's very difficult to target, you know a major newspaper  You see everybody sees that but as you said you could weaponize it in social media and it's it's very personal  It's on your phone, you know, it's on your computer. You see it at work. You see it all the time your friends share it  It's a much hotter medium. I think it's much more influential

Transcript:  Well, yeah, we talk we talk about like less tech savvy users not being able to determine like when a fake  You know malware call or something is coming in this stuff can be weaponized in many ways  We were hearing about what's happening in India with whatsapp and the potential of like somebody forwarding a fake message  To their groups of friends can lead to a mob of people killing somebody. It's been like that's insane  Yeah, that's pure messaging and that's I would put a lot of blame on the technology platform for at least not doing something to help  Maybe prevent that sort of usage.

I'm not sure what that's  coming from  Nixon  Used Admin brought Admin into the election for the very first time used television effectively  And and you could probably make the case in 1960  I think some have that people who watch the Kennedy Nixon debates thought Kennedy won people who listened to them on the radio thought  Nixon won television had a huge impact, but there weren't congressional hearing or maybe there were  I don't think there were congressional hearings calling television to task because it it gives  Politicians new ways to sway American voters. It's just the nature of technology

Transcript:  Well, I think if you love technology, you know, there's a problem and just if you love your country you want to fix that problem  I think that those of us who are boosters of technology  We've got to write this ship or it is going to come down on our heads with maybe some really onerous  Regulation that does more than just what it needs to do because let's face it our politicians don't understand it  They don't I think they're now beginning to understand the implications and the power of it  But I don't think they really understand how it works  And I think that you know, I'm one of as I said one of the things I'm really happy about with this new crop of  Democratic house members is that a lot of them are younger and a lot of them by nature are going to understand tech more than their  predecessors well spoken

Transcript:  Mean this is this end of school is part of the problem with something like GDPR that we were talking about earlier  Which is that often things like that are written with good intentions. I think GDPR was written with very good intentions  But it actually misses a huge part of what makes some of these platforms so powerful  There's a hypothetical example that I like to use to illustrate this  which is if you are an individual and you have a  Hereditary medical condition, let's say and it's it's something that you you post about on social media  Maybe you list it on Facebook for whatever reason you do that  But you you you you believe your data is to be completely private and secret  Let's say you then have a brother who is directly related to you who doesn't list anything about that medical condition at all  It's theoretically possible that that brother could be targeted by  Whatever kind of messaging because an advertiser or a platform knows that a direct blood relative has a hereditary  health condition  Therefore it's highly likely or certainly possible that you know that relative may also have a condition  Or certainly may pay more attention to adverts about that condition and that's not something that you know that data about that  Brother that other person is not really covered in a lot of the data protection  Systems that we've seen discussed and it's not something that's very easy to explain to lawmakers who are trying to put these rules together  and that's why I think you know as was said the  Newer generation a younger generation  Hopefully will make technology kind of front of mind in all of their policymaking

This is this is not interesting  But I think like this conversation about Facebook and the elections and the responsibility  we've reached a new point for all these tech companies where I think we're looking more at the human impact of them and  This is a new phase of maybe how we're looking at tech because it's so deeply embedded in our lives  But we're seeing this on all friends right like Amazon  Yes  and labor practices and what their shipping factories are like even around Red Dead Redemption 2 a  Game which a ton of people are super excited for there's been a lot of great coverage around the labor  Practices at Rockstar and kind of what they force workers to do to make something that big in that detail  so  You know, I love tech but I want to hold all these companies to account and they're having more of more of an impact on our  Lives in ways that we can't even control so we really have to like step up and make sure they're criticized properly

We're just having a bad attitude  This breaks the both social networks rules on user surveillance and data privacy  But I think is a brilliant use of data scraping  You know  That's better than a background check.

I don't know why  What if what have I done?  Glad to be on that list  According to the Beijing government the city will have a blacklist. It'll be made available for market access  public services  travel and employment  Residents with bad social credit scores will be limited in terms of movement and accessing services in the city those with good credit scores  Will have easy access to services in the city  Here's the Bloomberg story  This is going to go into place  On 22 million citizens in Beijing by the end of 2020 they announced it. They posted the plan online  You know the problem is that there's probably a good group of people who say that's good everybody will behave better in public  That's a good thing. Uh-huh  And I imagine there are a few people the United States who wouldn't mind that either and it's certainly for tech journalists  It's a good thing. What's that? What's that black mirror episode?

Transcript:  So Ryan Gallagher added again in the intercept he's got great sources inside of Google project  Dragonfly that was the project to build a search engine for China a Google branded search engine  That would censor categories of information about human rights democracy peaceful protest  My guess is his  Source is Yonatan Zunger who was at Google for a while  His source is Yonatan Zunger who was at Google for many years 14 years left, but has been very outspoken about this he's  He's quoted as saying  He was president some of the early meanings about dragonfly  He says he pointed out to executives managing the product Chinese people could be at risk of interrogation or detention  If they were found to have used Google to seek out information banned by the government  Scott Beaumont head of operations in China and one of the key architects at dragonfly  Quote did not view Zunger's concern as significant enough to merit a change of course according to four people who worked on  The project they shut out members of the company's security and privacy team from meetings about dragonfly and  Tried to sideline a privacy review of the plan that sought to address potential human rights abuses  Zunger is the only one of the four who spoke on the record  But this is this is credible. It's a little disappointing  So, you know even American companies can be complicit in this scheme the social credit scheme  Apple was in the Supreme Court this week. We talked a little bit about this throughout the week  It is that it kind of an interesting suit the Supreme Court justices are going to only be ruling on standing  The lawsuit a class-action lawsuit accuses Apple of breaking federal antitrust laws by monopolizing the market for iPhone software applications  Which causes customers to overpay Apple says no no, no, we're just an agent. We're just we  We we we don't actually sell direct to the customers  The companies that make the software do so there's no standing to sue us  Go sue that company not us  The Supreme Court will have to decide whether the lawsuit can go ahead so they're not deciding on whether Apple's a monopoly  But merely on whether the lawsuit can go ahead  It's all based on a 1977 precedent called Illinois brick  I don't know if I want to go in on and on about this. I've become an expert in all of this though over the last few days  Neil Gorsuch wondered whether Illinois brick was still valid in a modern marketplace justice Roberts said he agreed with Apple's position he  Expressed concern that for a single price increase Apple could be held liable, but both consumers and app developers

Transcript:  Illinois brick was a suit that Illinois the state of Illinois  brought against a consortium of brick  manufacturers saying that they had  Colluded to keep prices high  But the Supreme Court said well you don't have standing state of Illinois because you're not buying the bricks and  Through the court the case out and that's been precedent for some time  ever since

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well Apple doesn't Apple doesn't set the individual price for each app Apple has tiers and the developer picks the tier  So, you know to say that Apple keeps prices high is not necessarily true  Because the developer could charge 99 cents and the developer could charge 899 or whatever they want to charge  But it just has to be at that at that tiered step and that to me that's not that's not a monopoly

Start time: 7087.82
End time: 7092.12

Transcript:  And Ben Thompson as usual a great article on strategic re why Apple is right  In this case as as you said to Dwight  However, there is there is a good point to be made about Apple's App Store monopoly  It is in fact the only way you could put an app on iOS  Mm-hmm Apple's contention is this keeps iOS secure  But Ben says Apple is an abusive monopoly  And I'll tell you where it really hurts is companies like Netflix and Amazon  Or even audible  Who on Android you could buy an audible book or through the audible app on the Kindle  You can buy a Kindle book through the Kindle app  They don't do it on Apple's App Store not because Apple forbids it  But because Apple would take 30% of the transaction even though they add no value  That's Amazon's choice. So that's Amazon's choice to make the consumer experience worse  So I know they want to make 30% more they want to make 30% more

Start time: 7167.86
End time: 7192.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They want to make as much money as they can but it's weird to me that Amazon is a company their first reaction to all this  The same thing happened to a comix ology when that thing even had an app. There's not even an app anymore for that  But yeah, you couldn't buy those digital comics through through iOS and now there's not even an app. It's all through the web  There's an argument to be made there. The difference is so fortnight is a good example because epic games had to sell it through the internet

Start time: 7192.94
End time: 7239.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There the difference is so fortnight is a good example because epic games had to sell it through the app store on on  Ios and as a result Apple made millions of dollars on in-app purchases because the game is free, right?  But all of those in-app purchases went to you know, Apple made literally million  I can't remember what it was 115 million dollars in three months for fortnight. That means Apple made more than 30 million dollars  So when epic came to Android?  They elected because they don't have to sell through the play store  They elected to offer it as a direct download, but in order for consumers to get it. They have to turn off a setting and settings  Download it turn it back on for their protection  Fortnight makes more money that way you could argue. That's a worse experience for consumers

Start time: 7241.84
End time: 7271.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's more friction. But like fortnight by the time fortnight hit Android  It was enough of a phenomenon that people will jump through fire to get that game on their phones  So, you know, it kind of works out there, but we were just talking about yeah  I mentioned the Microsoft and interesting what if Microsoft was locking off, you know apps that were running on Windows in the 90s and saying  You know, we're the only we're the sole provider. We're only we can approve what's coming on there  Yeah, I guess our definition of how we determine the monopoly and how we look at these tech companies has changed a lot in two decades

Start time: 7272.48

Start time: 7305.98
End time: 7321.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think a lot of that is also for education because it's a lot easier for schools to deploy those machines knowing that they are  Out of the box perhaps either slightly more secure or it's just less distracting for you know for kids  I think I might be part of that reason

Yeah, and if the developer isn't on the approved list?  Yeah, you have to go into the security settings and basically say yeah, even though these guys you don't know anything about them  I'm gonna go ahead and and approve this so they make you jump for it on the Mac  Even though you know you can get it if you can get almost anything you want on  The Mac App Store, but in the prices there are kind of interesting, too.

You're gonna be you're gonna be going out. So that's the hip the hip new one  You're gonna go out you're gonna get a loan and if you're gonna get a loan don't go to the big bank  Believe me. We did that five years ago. That was a nightmare  First of all, you've got to go to the big bank got to dress up fill out a long application  And then your homework your troubles begin. You've got to find pay stubs from previous jobs bank statements  You've got to find a fax machine and fax that to them and it takes a long long time  Let's get in the 21st century with quick and loans the number one  Mortgage lender in the country. They've been a number one now in volume for a year, but that's because for nine years  They've been number one in customer satisfaction according to JD Power  Nine years when you focus on customers  Eventually you become the biggest the best that one of the ways they did this with rocket mortgage  We've talked about this before an entirely online mortgage approval process that takes minutes  Not days and requires a trip to nowhere. You could actually do it in an open house on your smartphone  It's an entirely online process step one. You answer a few simple questions. No big long application  They check your credit and you get pre-qualified approval. They tell you what loans you qualify for  They've got great rates you choose the rate you choose the term you choose a down payment and you're in that's the part one of the power  Buying process but then the next part starts over the next 24 hours in most cases without any intervention on your part  Just kind of automatically they'll verify income assets and credit and they'll give you verified approval  Now that is big that means you have the strength of a cash buyer  You're good for the money when you go to make an offer in a house. You've got a letter that says yep  We approve them there. They've got the loan. There's no contingency  That's huge, especially I don't know what it's like in some other parts of the country  But here in the California area when you're putting an offer on a house  There are five other people bidding for that house, too  And if there's somebody with cash, they're gonna go way ahead of you unless you've got this letter that says there's no contingency  they got the loan and once you're verified step three kicks in and this is fantastic because  Interest rates have started to tick up that adds some anxiety if an interest rate goes up  while you're shopping that house could cost tens of thousands of dollars more unless  Unless you're using rocket mortgage then  You've got rate shield approval all new exclusive. They lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop  Once you get that verified approval you qualify if  Rates go up your rate does not it stays the same if rates go down your rate drops. So that's nice, too  Either way you win. It's kind of like  Exactly what you'd expect from a customer focused lender  America's number one mortgage lender rocket mortgage and quick and loans get started today go to rocket mortgage comm slash twit to  rocket mortgage comm slash twit and the number two  Rateshield approval is only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions additional conditions or exclusions may apply  Based on quick and loans data in comparison to public data records  Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access dot org number 30 30. Just remember this rocket mortgage  Dot-com slash twit to and we think rocket mortgage. They've been a great sponsor all year long  Just really appreciate their support  MIT media or I'm sorry MIT technology review had the story. There's now maybe spin some  Doubt cast on it, but I think if this is true. This is the story of the decade the first  example of crisper being used  to edit  In-vitro an embryo  The  Gene they removed was CCR 5 the idea was to give the baby  resistance to HIV smallpox and cholera and  According to the doctor who led this team  hood young quay  Two baby twin girls were born with this edited gene data if this if this is true  This is a watershed moment I think in human history  Devendra you agree you just had a baby would you if you could would you have edited that gene out?

We're using crisper kind of like  You know a sledgehammer in certain ways. We don't know how various bits of  DNA interact we don't there's a lot  We just don't know in 20 or 30 years when we kind of you know know exactly how everything's going maybe yeah

Transcript:  when this if this was all presented at a big  Conference genetics  Conference this week and at the end of the conference the organizers said that under no no  No civilized nation thinks this is a good idea if this did happen  It's probably illegal and it's certainly unethical. I don't know about that  But I you know the the doctor doctor her posted a video to YouTube at 2017 describing  preliminary experience experiments on mice monkeys and more than 300 human embryos  The concern the concern you have to Vindra and others have is that crisper isn't perfect and that it can introduce perhaps  accidental mutations  Remember when we first cloned a sheep dolly she died in a very quick pretty like a couple of years  Yeah, because it turns out the cloning didn't didn't reset the clock and so she was old before when she was born  Her says in our tests  Few or no unwanted changes in the test embryos  So they went ahead and did it

It sounds horrible, isn't it?  But you know for children to be born in a way that genetically makes them more suitable for life  Outside of earth and that's the side of this that I find extremely exciting. We'll never get to see it in our lifetimes  I don't think but  That I imagine I could I could see  Happening in you know, a hundred hundred fifty years time. That's a dystopian novel, right?

It could be AI. It could be who knows what?  Climate change is a very important part of the world  Climate change is also something we're dealing with and not stopping. So it's like

Yeah, yeah, we all grew up with the threat of nuclear war of global annihilation  Under a Soviet Union that was armed to the teeth and the United States was armed to the teeth and could at any moment  You know end the world we grew up under that  Yeah, but now there's multiple possibilities. It's coming from every direction  I'm actually less worried about the end of  Mankind if that's what happens probably it's a good thing  But I am more worried about creating a world that is just inhospitable inhumane  grim gloomy depressing dystopian and  Then our kids and our grandkids will grow up in that that's really sad

So the thing that I've noticed  because of brexit  And I'm sorry to bring up brexit again, but I have a very good reason to do so is  That I have never in my life  seen so many young people  motivated by politics so many people care so passionately and  You know if if if this all goes through and we do end up leaving Europe  We are gonna have to at least right now two generations of people living who almost certainly didn't want it on the whole  You know, it's known that the the older generations favored to leave and younger  favored to stay and  They are the people that are gonna have the power and the influence and the motivation and the drive to do something  About it and to make the future better and I think that as long as there are people that fear that things will get worse and  Motivated to try and prevent things then we're gonna have people that are gonna be trying to make the world a better place  And that's that's that's the thought that keeps me very hopeful  I'd be far more worried if things like brexit was taking place and nobody seemed to care and there were no  Protests because that would mean we've given up and then we really are all screwed

I  Have a podcast called text message  which is  Basically everything you just heard me say for the last two and a half hours  but but every week rather than every now and again, so  Yeah, it's it's it was quite interesting because a lot of the the the technology podcasts in in the world are obviously very global  Because our tech companies are so global and I sort of thought well if you focus quite specifically on on your country  Then you sort of you create a little unique voice because no one else is is  exclusively talking about that and what's been so interesting is that it's so many American listeners because  They say why it gives you so much more context on what's happening in your own country. You don't hear the same stories twice  It's been really it's been really interesting to to get the feedback. Yeah, we focus on our country, but unfortunately
