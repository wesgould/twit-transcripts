Transcript:  San Francisco and over 500 people talking about how to better their laid off time. Isn't that wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah that's great. So I guess you're looking for you hope for less people to show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh that's a good point. Yeah I was going to say I don't know if I mean not to take anything away  from the effort but we'd all rather have happily employed and searching for better jobs camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely although Leo and I were discussing the future of work and how we might you know use

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Laid Off Camp to. It's kind of an opportunity. Yeah. To say. I'm not going to. It's very Republican up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Finally turning the corner from this liberal lifestyle. Yes it's an opportunity to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  no it's an opportunity to reinvent yourself and reinvent the nature the notion of work. You don't  have to go back to the cubicle if you don't want to. Of course you have to make a living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to make a living. But that's what Laid Off Camp's all about is. Yeah finding a new way to  find something you're passionate about and make a living out of it. And branding and using these

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  new tools these social media tools. We're just talking about Twitter. Exactly. In fact there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a it's twitter.com slash Laid Off Camp. So there's twitter.com slash Laid Off Camp and twitter.com  slash Hutchins is me. Is you and Shaylor is. Brian Shaylor. Brian Shaylor. B-R-I-A-N-S-H-A-L-E-R. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't follow me because I have too many followers anyway. Actually I'm looking for a tool that will

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  delete followers if anybody can find one. You'd have to block and then unblock them. That would

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  work. Block and unblock? Yeah. Well what I'm thinking though is doing it en masse because I  what I want to do is find a tool that will say if you don't have a picture if you haven't tweeted in  what is it 30 60 90 days we'll figure out some time arbitrary time. If you're only following  you know the 12 people that Twitter suggests plus me then I don't then you're a bot or something  and I would. Or Al Gore. Or Al Gore. No Al Gore is posting. Somebody. I think that's that tool Leo  that you're looking for is called Facebook. Is it? Story one. Facebook wants to be the next Twitter.  Facebook announced Mark Zuckerberg. First of all Mark Zuckerberg has created a crypto twitter  account. He's finked. F-I-N-K-D. He only has 4 000 followers quick. This morning. This morning yeah I  think it's too late now to follow him. He's probably at his limit. 5 000 followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh Twitter doesn't have that problem. No I guess not does it. 6533 followers. He did tweet I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about having unlimited followers on Facebook. Oh did he? He said. For his most recent tweet. I find

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it funny that it's on dig that I'm here. I'm looking forward to when people can have unlimited  connections on Facebook soon. It's too bad he doesn't have any clout or anything. There's no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  way he could make that happen. I wonder if that's an architectural issue for them. Oh really? Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know something I've noticed with the follower limit. It does seem to take a long time to  populate certain lists that you're using while on Facebook. For example if you're searching for  someone or using some kind of application. It seems that the more friends you have on Facebook  the harder it is for it to find things and for you to be able to use it properly. So maybe it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is something on their back end. Well I think they need to re-architect a lot of their different  features. Like those drop downs that allow you to search through all your friends. You know it  should start maybe doing a hierarchy where you have friends lists and then you only pull 100

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  people from there instead of all 5 000. Well it's true. Any tool that looks at all your friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you're screwed. The left column of the new Facebook page has friend lists. That's one of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  features. Oh yeah. It's hard to tell exactly what the new features are because they're kind of  blurry. It's not a great screenshot. So okay so one will be friend groups. It looks like they're  going to have a real-time streaming status update. Like it's going to scroll up. That'll be kind of  cool. I saw it still shut. Well I got the impression. Maybe I just thought it would look  a little bit like friend feeds real-time feed which would be very cool. Well they do have a live

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  button on Facebook. Are you not talking about that? Yeah. Yeah. But what does it do? Nothing?  It auto-updates. Oh okay so they already have that. Yeah. What they don't have that really bugs me is  that I have friends lists which is great. Then they have the live feed which is great. But you  can't do live mode on the friends list. So you know if you want to get away from the noise then

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you can't have live. Does it make sense for Facebook to you know if you go there right now  it says changes to the home page are coming soon. Does it make sense for them to go after Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that what they're doing? What is that? I think they're definitely going after Twitter in a big  way. I mean they're trying to open it up and make things a little more public so you're not so locked  into the friends that you already have. So you can have that public live feed type of situation which  is very similar to what or exactly what Twitter is doing. That's the big difference right now isn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it? Because you're on Facebook it's only you know your friends. Right. That's I have found that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  only use Facebook for family and friends and I'm on it less and less the more and more  I just become enamored with Twitter. There's the problem. Therein lies the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  175 million people are signed up on Facebook but something like 50 million people use it weekly.  It's a huge that's a huge number. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's certainly successful.  The real question I have is can they go can they become an open standard? Some people are saying  you know this is an opportunity for them to get away from the kind of walled garden that they are  and to support open standards. They signed up they're on the open ID committee now which is  odd because they have this Facebook connect which is kind of a competitor of open ID.  They they've just this week they kind of made some f made some movement towards the open community  which is kind of an interesting thought. What is that the would that be the key to making Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the success it really needs? It's weird because they actually position themselves as having the  walled garden means more power more money. So in a way they they're positioning themselves or they  have been as it's a good thing to be the walled garden because then we can take on Google in this  way that they can't fight back. You know they can't search our content because it's closed down so  they become open then they're letting in all kinds of competition. But if you're a developer an

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  application developer and you have to work within their walled garden you're running a huge risk  because you know they could at any point they could pull the plug they could say hey we don't  like what you're doing. It's like Apple right? Doing an Apple. Yeah it's very similar. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I mean the I think though it the the only reason Zuckerberg cares about Twitter is because  A. Twitter is becoming popular and B. it's becoming a de facto means of disseminating information.  You know what I mean? Like think about that huge argument Calcannus and I were having about whether  or not Obama should be on Twitter. And not once not once in the course of that argument  did anybody say you know the White House needs a Facebook page. I think it does. You know Obama's  got a LinkedIn page. Does he have a? Yeah but how many citizens are there in the United States Leo?  Upwards of 300 million so 5 000 citizens get to be part of the Facebook page. Right. Oh yeah that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  why you can't do it. Well no but I mean they can have a fan page. Right that's unlimited. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah but I think in terms of though I think what Zuckerberg's looking at is something it is taking  away mindshare and becoming a communications tool that in a way that nobody ever really thought of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook. That's exactly why they're trying to promote these fan pages and the public pages  because they want to have an open door policy for companies and businesses and public figures to have  a landing page of their very own that lives on Facebook that can be promoted outside of your  network. Do you use a fan page Veronica? Yeah I have one but it's not I don't get as many requests

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  for that as I do my personal. People want to be your friend. Exactly they want I mean they want  the contact. They want to be a part of your community. That's what connectivity is all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish there was a way that I could migrate people from the you know my personal page to the fan page  but it gets very confusing and complicated. I would like to do that because I opened is there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a way because I opened I opened I'm you know I'm up to 5,000 and I don't have any distinction  between friends and family. I'd love to have a Facebook page that's a real page. I saw Gary

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vaynerchuk reading about how he had so many friends that he couldn't add more friends so he had  emailed someone at Facebook and they transitioned all of his friends to a fan page. So they will do  that for the right person which I all of you probably are. Oh no right person. Oh you're the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right person. I'll say if you hit the limit you're probably the right person. But then my mom will  get really teed off when I put her on my fan page and she can't be my friend anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But then so what you presumably would do is you'd say oh but I know these 200 people I'm going to  move them back. Yeah or you would manually. I don't yeah that would be different. But what is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  saying to your fans. That's the problem you can't do it. Right. That's a slap in the face in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't do it. I love you man but I'd like to kind of move you off from my page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sticky subjects because I think the best way is to gently remind people if you're in the situation  that you have a fan page and then hopefully either they'll go over there or still be friends you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  whatever works. I just gave up. I just gave up on Facebook using Facebook in a normal way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hmm well I'm going to try and hang on to it but is is MySpace just a dead horse now. Do you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a MySpace page LaVar? No I don't. I don't either. Anybody here have a MySpace page? Nope. I do but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm the weirdo that uses it just for friends and not as a promotional tool. I got it all backwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I mean I know a huge number of people who would never would basically would never have  touched any of the other kind of web 2.0-ish kind of stuff and didn't get into MySpace but are  constantly rediscovering friends from high school and college on Facebook and using it as a means  of communication with their friends and it's kind of interesting to actually see that happen for a  lot of these people because it's the kind of stuff that they would never have done this on MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that the perfect application for Facebook? I mean for really keeping your immediate circle  in touch with you and you with them. That is the correct purpose for Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My mother just joined Facebook. Big big move. Are you going to allow her to be your friend?  She is my friend. I walked her through the process but now she's since connected with all of her  college buddies and now they're planning a reunion and there's like hundreds of them coming and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See Facebook is for real people. Twitter is for the Dijarati and Ashton Kutcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't agree with that these days. Have you taken a look at the top 100 on Twitter now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't help it because I'm like 98 now. It's so depressing. I was like in the top five and then  everybody else arrived. I wish it were just quiet and small and only people I know again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just think of yourself as a trailblazer. These things always get way blown out and then mainstream  figures out about them and just take comfort in the fact that you were an early adopter and  you spread the word. In that case I feel better because I was in the top five before you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  there. Yeah well I was there twice. I came and won. I'm like 21 now. We're 25 now. But Brian,  yeah you were Brian. You were like very high up early on. But now I try to avoid that page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Twitter counter, the Twitter holic page. It's really depressing because

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah you've been through this. Help me. Council me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay so first of all I was fairly lucky to have a decent mindset at the beginning of like this  isn't all that big of a deal. I'm not going to think I'm important because I have 3,000 followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was my mistake. I thought I was important because of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I started saying it and I kept telling myself I don't care, I don't care, I don't care. But then  I checked and saw that I went from 100 to 400. Now I'm over 500. Yeah. You start to care.  Well it still hurts a little bit. And I thought exactly I'm with you Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know why it doesn't hurt? Here's why it hurts. I think that when you are in the top  two or three on Twitter, you know it's Barack Obama, Kevin Rose and you, that people say  something. That says something. People kind of value you don't they? Yeah you're absolutely  right Leo. And now I'm just another guy and Veronica's like the top person. No I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No I'm, you know, it's all, it's becoming major news organizations and actual real famous people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well you know what it's not even that. It's not even that. It's whoever Facebook puts there  because they, their suggestions page when new people, I'm sorry Twitter puts there,  when you sign up they automatically populate unless you uncheck it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's, let's, let's, let's call, let's just, let's be straightforward. See you know if CNN,  Barack, Twitter or Britney Spears or Stephen Fry or the New York Times are suggested by Twitter,  they're going to get a hell of a lot more followers than I am. Yeah. You're going to meet  a lot of more people know about Ashton Kutcher and are automatically going to adopt something like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that. Yeah. So I'm happy to be able to have a conversation with the people that follow me.  I agree. You know who know who I am and it's nice to have, to have that list and to be on there.  It's cool. Yeah. I won't deny that fact, but you know, I have a feeling that once all the people  that add me immediately realize, oh, well she's talking about a lot of technology stuff. I'm not  really into that. I'm going to move on to someone who's more interesting to what I deal with in my  everyday life. You know, that's fine too, because I want to be able to have good conversations with  people and I want to share my, my stuff that I'm doing in my life and jobs that I'm working on with  the people that care about it instead of just people who are like, Oh, you're a chick. What's up?  Yeah. So you have to, it's, it's quality over quantity, right? Do we know how many people there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  are on Twitter? No one knows. I guess 3 million, 4 million, something like that. It's definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  over 20 million, 20 million registered accounts. Definitely. The trick, I haven't done it in a while  because you can look, there's a number, right? There is an ID number. If you can find it,  yeah, that's right. Essentially what you do is you go to someone. So was it, were they serialized?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it like one, two, three, four? My mother recently, I put her on Twitter. You can check

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  she's pretty in the last couple of weeks. Well, what, what do you do is you actually find their,  their RSS feed link, right? Also tell you a number dot RSS. And that number is your ID number in the  database. And it's all so it's over 20 million. Well, that's pretty, that's pretty impressive  registered accounts. That doesn't mean anything like you can create accounts pretty quickly  and easily. And there are tons of fake accounts, tons of spam accounts. So it's not a very good,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there has been a lot of spam lately. I have a friend who has like 200 Twitter accounts. What?  Because he took the, you know, he took the, he got on early and said, you know, Celtics, you know,  all he's got, he got LaVar. He got LaVar. But now he has since decided that he doesn't want to be  the guy that sells them. And so he's going to just put them up and say, if anyone's legitimate,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  come grab your, your Twitter handle. One last Twitter story. Then we'll move on. Twitter was  hacked again, about 200 accounts hacked, but you had to be one of those dumb people that clicked  on a link to see fishing, to see a video of a girl. Was it fishing? It's really embarrassing.  Click grabbing or whatever they call it. No, it wasn't, it wasn't click grabbing. It was,  it was actual, you know, you have to look at this picture of a girl and then you'd, you'd go,  you'd click it. So it's kind of embarrassing if you're one of the people that got hacked  because you fell for it. Because you were the one clicking to see the girl. Yeah. You kind of,  you kind of, it shows you up. I'm proud to say nobody here was, was fished as far as I know.  Right. enough Twitter. Who cares? It's, it's, it's, it's what it is. But I need to remark on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're used with Twitter to use all the apps and whatever out there. You're, they, they,  they get you into this model of typing your password everywhere you go. Oh, it's terrible.  It's a terrible, a very disturbing idea that they're, they're leaving it like that for as  long as they have, they need to have API keys. Supposedly they've got a Wath in process. They've

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  got a beta, but it's pretty appalling what they're doing. Are they going to put it in as an option

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and not break backwards compatibility with all the other apps? Right. I've said it many times and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  people see it as, as a, as a bitterness, you know, but I think Twitter is not the best  custodian of this type of thing. Definitely. And I'm a little, you know, I don't think Ev likes me.  Ev was at the White House, by the way. Did you see that? He was part of an economic summit.  I saw him on TED. He's all over the place. He went and he, he met with a, this was actually  a strange event at the White House. Barack Obama met with young entrepreneurs, an interesting group  of people, including Evan Williams, the founder of Twitter. I'm not sure what they told him that  he's going to have any use for in terms of, you know, it's not, it's not great economic advice.  I don't think there's a model we can all follow. Well, you go, you get some rich guy to give you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $20 million and you hire a Ruby programmer and the rest is a gravy. And then two years later,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  start talking about a business model. Yeah, exactly. I mean, he brought in a bunch of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who aren't making any money. So you were wondering why Ev doesn't like you. Yeah, I know. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter is a tool and we're all tools for talking about it still. So let's move on. So yeah, what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is the audience total gone back down below 4,000 again? As soon as you start, no, actually almost,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  almost almost six. You know, it's Levar Burton. He brings them in and, and, and for the record,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to pimp you on Twitter. Like there's no tomorrow. That's okay. Levar really is. I,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in fact, I see a story here from msnbc.com. Oh my God, shut up about Twitter already.  This is Helen A.S. Popkin. Actually, it's a pretty funny story if you, if you want to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So after talking about Twitter for 10 minutes, we're going to talk about not talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter for five minutes. Let's talk about what they have to say about Twitter. Okay. Who cares

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  about Boxy and Hulu? Does anybody care about? I love, I use Boxy. I love Hulu. I want Hulu to  be supported on Boxy. And I, and you know, what's the story? Hulu said, Hulu's partner said, we

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  don't want you to be using us. Hulu says their content partners said they do not want to be on  Boxy. Right. Boxy said, okay. Then they, they, they take access out. The next step is that somebody  either inside or outside of Boxy makes the ability to point to the RSS feeds from Hulu, just like any  browser would look for them. And then, and then Hulu calls back and says, or Hulu doesn't call  back. Hulu then shuts down by browser identification, shuts down Boxy's, Boxy's ability to access their

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  RSS feeds. Dave Matthews, yeah, it came back. Dave Matthews, who is a friend of ours, actually,  he created the QCAT of all things. He's an evangelist for him. He says, these guys, Hulu,  are so short-sighted. It's an RSS reader. What our open source community will do is just make the  Boxy browser look at the Firefox browser. You can't do it forever. No, there's no, there's really no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  way to block it time and time again. People are just going to find workarounds for it. And if they  really want the content that much, I mean, hasn't that already been proven before? Yeah, I don't  really understand why Hulu wants less people to see their content. I don't think it's Hulu. If the ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  are still going to be running on it. Well, it's Fox or who? I mean, NBC Universal, right? Hulu is Fox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And why, I don't understand it. Well, Hulu, think of who's behind Hulu. Well, Hulu's a website,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so they're, it's not directly competing necessarily with, oh, so they say, if you're watching it on  your TV, we don't want you to use Hulu. And so, Boxy's setup is here's a way to take your computer  and kind of set it up as a media center. And now it's replacing your TV. And it's fantastic. I love

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Boxy. It shouldn't, it shouldn't make a difference whether you're watching it on your television or  on your computer. It's one way to watch the content that's going to keep you from watching

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the content. Another way. Well, if you think of it as, if you think of the difference between ad  revenues based on online distribution through Hulu versus ad revenues through. But the ads,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  are embedded in the video. Right, right. But are you going to cut through? You're not hearing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm talking about the actual amount, if the amount of money, the CPM, you, you, you, you, you sell  advertising into twit. Now imagine if twit was, imagine if twit during through one avenue was,  you know, worth a heck of a lot more money to you than twit through another avenue. Sons of

Transcript:  bitches. Are they broadcasting twit on Boxy? Shut them down. Actually, they are. Believe it or not,  they are. Change their model then. No, we're on, we're on, we're on, we're on Boxy. They rebroadcast  the odd TV stuff. So the video's on Boxy. I have no problem with that, but I understand what you're  saying, Patrick. If for instance, somebody takes the way we get monetized is there, the link has  a referrer in it, which our advertising agency, PodTrack uses to count the number of unique people  who downloaded the product. And that's what advertisers use. They pay us by the thousands of  those. And you're right, Patrick. If some, there's no reason why you couldn't strip that out. In fact,  there was a guy in Britain doing a rogue RSS feed of twit minus those. And we had, we, we sent him  a nice no. We, truth is we can't legally shut them down because we're Creative Commons licensed.  As long as he's not doing it for money, he can't, he can do anything he wants. We just said, hey,  you're undermining our revenue model. Can you not, can you, can you include the referrer link? But  you're right, Veronica, all they have to do is rethink their revenue model. No, no, no, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's not about rethinking your revenue model. It's about revenue contracts that are in place.  It may be about their, it may be about a party's distribution deals with the cable companies.  Remember all the stuff with the MSOs that, that tech TV went through? It could be, the problem is  we don't really know, or it could be a MacGuffin and Hulu was just ticked off that Boxxy was using

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  their interface. You gotta love John Stewart and his reaming of Rick Santelli and CNBC. Did you see  that? Oh man, that was last night. Oh, you got it. Well, now see, I would normally say go to YouTube  and watch it, but no, Viacom doesn't want you to watch it that way. Oh, Sumner. Well, you heard

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about the new, the new YouTube music video channel. What is it Vivo or Veev, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a deal with a record company. Yeah. So they're starting to wake up. Different models are,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're trying to figure out a good way to have people see their content and still get paid.  Although I think it's funny that YouTube has to make an entirely separate business in order to  lure the content providers into a sense of comfort and place their videos online instead of, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  God forbid it's actually on YouTube. The good news is Veronica, my bandmate, you know, Veronica and I  performed together on the stage of the great American music hall along with Merlin Mann and  a guy you might know, a little guy named Jonathan Colton. Wow. Yeah. The Beatles rock band debuts  September 9th. Oh, and the world goes crazy. Maybe, maybe, maybe the Beatles waited a little too long.  You think maybe they should have hurried up with that digital distribution model?  I didn't realize they had a digital distribution. They don't. This is it right there. 59.99. You  can get the game and another hundred bucks. You'll get a bass guitar that you play with your left  hand, a microphone and Ringo Starr's signature drum kit. Wow. That's sad as they'll probably  sell a lot of that. I'm going to buy it. I've always wanted to be in the Beatles.  But I'll stick with songs like octopus's garden. I won't do like the signature songs.  It is a signature song.  Under the sea. I can do any Ringo song. How many were there?  In octopus's garden, in the shade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're such a songbird. It's in you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When are we getting the band back together, Veronica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someday. Someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's take a break. Come back. All this talk about money is making me itchy. So I think I'm going to  mention the folks at Audible right now. Audible.com slash platinum. I'm sorry. Slash twit two for the  platinum plan. The platinum plan gives you two. Yes, two. Two books a month. They have a gold plan.  They'll get you one book a month. Now I happen to go through two books a month because I listen to  Audible books everywhere I go. I'll go to a business meeting. I've got the earbuds in.  What? What did you say? I'm sorry. I can't hear you. I'm listening to David Sedaris  Me Talk Pretty Someday. I do it at the gym. I do it in the car. I'm doing all the time. I'm  listening to Audible.com. Audible is basically an online bookstore. 51,000 titles. Amazing stuff.  LeBar Burton's on Audible. He's got quite a few books on Audible.com, including that Grammy  winning performance. What was that? The Malcolm X? What was the Grammy for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right. MLK's Autobiography. MLK? MLK? I say that like I knew him. MLK's Autobiography.  Marty. We call him Marty. No, it's actually a beautiful book and you do a beautiful job  reading it. But that's what's different about Audible. These are performances.  You're an actor. I mean, you don't just go there, sit down and read it like you would,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  like you're reading the daily paper. No, it's storytelling. A biography like that is one thing.  Other titles that are nonfiction, you get an opportunity to play all of the characters.  That's kind of fun. It's absolutely a blast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know you'd like to do more. You'd like to do some public domain reading and so forth.  We are actually in a conversation with your good friends at Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love that. I'm glad.  Yeah. We don't know what it's going to look like or sound like yet, but we know that there is  commonality there and there is a strategic alliance to be made and we're in the process  of figuring it out. Oh, that's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you treat it like you would a movie script where you see the quoted text and that dialogue  and think of... Do you come up with voices for people, for instance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You do. Absolutely. You absolutely do. And oftentimes, it depends upon the producer.  Sometimes you do it on the fly. It's absolute basic storytelling at its highest. I just,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I totally, totally love it. Yeah. I did one short story,  the tale of a little golden riding hood. It sounds like a joke, but it's actually the name  of the book. And it was really fun. And I did, I made up voices for everybody. But it was more  like a table read where you just, you haven't seen it before and you're just kind of going through it.  And I think it'd be so much fun to spend some real time. And I know Jim Dale will  create a voice for every character and he has hundreds of voices and then record them.  So then when he's about to do Hagrid in Harry Potter, he'll listen back to the tape and get,  and oh yeah, that's the Hagrid voice and have that voice. And it's a unique voice and it's the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  every time. Yeah. You want it to be consistent. You want those characters to sound the same every  time they come up in a story. And you know, Jim Dale is a master. He is one of the best there will

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ever be at, at audio literature. It's theater and I love that. And so you get an audible book and you  are listening to a performance, you're listening to theater, but bringing a book you love alive.  And I just, it's so much fun. Sometimes I'll read a book and then listen to the audio version of it,  just to kind of, to have that extra experience. So here's how you can get involved. Go to audible.com  twittoo. Sign up today. You're going to get two credits. And by the way, that's your first month  is free. So if you, if you stick around, of course you can continue, but even if you don't,  you get to keep those books. They're yours to keep for free forever. I can't recommend this more.  You might want to listen to the autobiography of Martin Luther King read by a cat named LeVar Burton.  That's audible.com slash twittoo. And by the way, little golden riding hood, that's free.  They couldn't charge for that. It's short too. It's five minutes, but it was fun. I just got  to experience what it was like. They have the audible now has these studios. You go in,  it's really nice. You have a producer sitting across the glass from you and you know, he keeps  saying to me, slow down, slow down, stop slurring your words. Are you drunk, sir? That kind of  thing. It's really fun audible.com slash twittoo. We thank audible so much for their support of  this week in tech. They've been a really great supporter for the show. They love you, Leo.  They do. And I love them. It's a mutual admiration society. You got to feel for this lady. Oh my  goodness. She, her name is Billy Park. She lives in Oklahoma. She saw a radio check that has signed  out front, a hundred dollars for a netbook. And the deal is you sign up for AT&T contract.  You've got EVDO built in the netbook and you got two years of AT&T, 60 bucks a month. She said,  this is a great deal. I get the, I get the netbook for 99 bucks. I get the always on internet  service. First bill they say she knew it would be a little bit bigger because there's a $36  activation fee and they bill you a month in advance and some pro rated charges. She didn't  realize that any internet usage over five gigabytes would cost her like a buck a megabyte. Her first  bill $5,077 from AT&T. Ouch. It's unfortunate. Even Sprint who actually until recently, like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  November had unlimited EVDO access. They don't have, it's punitive in the case of AT&T.  And I want to say Verizon, but especially so in the case of AT&T, if you go over their five  gigabyte cap, they are going to make your life miserable. It's, it's, you know, now they say we

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  disclose this. Here's, I'm looking at the data rate plans and here's how they disclose it.  It's $60 a month for five gigabytes. And then after five gigabytes, it's an additional 0.00048  per kilobyte. That doesn't sound like much, right? What is that? There's a lot of zeros in there.  That's pretty cheap. That's, you know, nothing. But it adds up to considerably more. I think it's  48 cents a megabyte and it doesn't take long before you're up to $5,000. Her point is, yeah,  they might've disclosed it. She says they didn't tell me. AT&T says, AT&T says it's right there.  You see that 0.0048 cents? It's right there. I got to tell you, I don't think that's disclosure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's suing them. I got to wonder what, what, what, what was the woman using all of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hulu. She was watching Hulu. Of course. Well, if you watch high definition video or if you start  downloading selling applications, I mean, if you watch, we actually went through it on Tekzilla  two weeks ago where we actually went, this is the data rate for something like Hulu regular versus  Hulu HD. This is what happens if you start downloading movies from Netflix or Amazon.  And it can add up, you know, it doesn't take a lot of work to get to 10 or 20 gigabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Turns out maybe she was watching Twitlio. Yeah. Well, that's the problem as somebody who streams  a lot of data. I can, I can see these, you know, five gigabytes sounds like a lot. And it is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you're just looking at email. You know, five gigabytes is, is, is, uh, you know, three and a  half movies, three and a half, you know, near HD movies from almost any of the online services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing. Well, people were getting upset about Comcast and that's 250 gigabytes. I mean,  five seems just like you could hit it in a day. Right. Yeah. And all of the, all of the, the, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  all of the EBO providers now have a five gigabyte cap. Um, Verizon, AT&T and Sprint. Sprint was the  last, Sprint was the only one that really had an unlimited cap anytime recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, I think it's good. They should be a little more maybe forthcoming with the overages charges,  but at the same time, people have to be kind of informed about how all this stuff plays out  because if you're just not reading the small text or not paying attention enough to what the terms  say, then you're going to get in trouble. There's no two ways about it. Like you have to figure that  stuff out before you start downloading films and movies and all sorts of other stuff over EVDO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got to check because I, you know, I have a Verizon card and they didn't use to charge.  They just would say at five gigabytes, we're going to cut you off. And now they charge it and they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  charge a pretty high rate. Now, which would you rather have? Would you rather have it? They cut  you off? Yeah. Would you rather have it charge you? You don't want to get a $5,000 bill. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you really can't, what are you going to say? I mean, she's suing, but she, it's not a slam dunk  by any means. Uh, you know, right. AT&T is saying, well, we told you what, you know, it's all very

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  clearly disclaimed. Well, one thing that I think is a bad play for them PR wise is when these people  get slammed for five or $10,000, they're not being told that they're about to go over that they have  gone over. They find out when they get their next bill. You need, you need to let me know. Yeah.  Call, call you up and say, you know, at this rate tomorrow, you're going to be over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know it's kind of a different thing, but with like PG&E, for example, I do auto pay every month.  And if for some reason my bill goes over a hundred dollars, which it almost never does,  they tell me, they let me know that this is happening before they charge my account.  It would be better if companies like AT&T and other EVDO providers could definitely have something  like that. I mean, that would be nice. You can check, you can check. They, they say there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  tool on the computer that you could see how much you've used, but it doesn't, it doesn't flash a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sign up. But I had, I had Verizon before I had an iPhone and I got an, I got a text message at one  point in time. And I don't remember frequently saying I'm, I'm out of minutes for the month.  That's nice. So they have that feature. They have the capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not as clean cut with an EVDO modem or a tethering device as it is with a cell phone usage.  You know, but I mean, they could send it to an email account, but it's not like they can  actually have the EVDO modem show on its personal screen. Like what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you, if you watched us, not even all day, if you watch this eight hours a day,  five days a week, it'd be, you know, a terabyte a month. It'd be a lot,  500 megabytes a month. It'd be a gigabytes a month. That'd be a lot of data. And if you then  download a few podcasts, watch a little daily show on Hulu. I mean, it wouldn't be hard to get up.  You're not going to get to 250 gigabytes maybe, but, uh, unless you're a really avid Twitterer,  right? 140 characters at a time. Oh, I thought you were saying watching Twit. No, that's right.  Don't confuse Twit and Twitter. I know. I thought you said watching Twit. No, you're actually,  I should do the calculations because we, it's, uh, it's 500 kilobits a second. So I can, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh boy, Patrick just fell right over. 60 kilobytes a second. That wasn't me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was, that was at my house. That was your. I'm actually, I'm outside this afternoon and we got

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a huge gust of wind that blew over the umbrella. Oh, you're outside on the pool and the porch with  the umbrella. I thought he was living it up. Now I am sad we didn't get video of this show. Now I am

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  sad. I told you we went to great lengths to set it up for you here, Leo. Thank you. I'm sorry,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Levar. We'll do it next time. Next time, next time. At about 200 megs an hour. Yeah. 176 gigabytes  a month if you did watch 24 seven. So even then it'd be hard to get to that 250. Easy to go past

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  five. Yeah. Trivial. I mean, it's interesting because the, the five gigabyte cap, um, you know,  I want to say AT&T had one, Verizon put one in place. Sprint finally followed up in, uh,  Sprint finally followed up in November of 2008. And it's, you gotta wonder what was the motivation,  you know, where people drink, cause I suspect people were dropping, uh, people were dropping  other accounts or satellite internet to be able to use the. That's why AT&T won't let you tether

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  or they wouldn't let Apple sell that tethering application. You have to pay extra to tether your  iPhone. Oh, they introduced. They are going to introduce a plan, but it will cost you extra.  Of course. Unless you were one of the lucky people that downloaded that tethering application within  the first 12 hours. And if you were, can I have a copy? Any application downloaded through the store

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  can be disabled. Yeah. They haven't disabled it oddly enough. Well, with the new, with the new app

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  store, you know, the third party app stores that are coming up like, um, Cedia, there actually is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a tethering program available on that store, but you have to jailbreak. You have to jailbreak,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  jailbreak, and then you search for PDA net. Not, I'm not saying that I've done it because what they  weren't, weren't they threatening that Apple said individuals could also be, be not finder, but no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple says it's illegal to jailbreak your iPhone. Take a chance. Yeah. So I'm not going to admit  that I use anything. Veronica, have you jailbroken? Of course you have. I have, my current iPhone is  not jailbroken. My previous first generation iPhone was. I jailbreak and jailbroked jailbriked

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and unlocked my first gen just, you know, for fun, but I, I haven't touched my second gen  because you know what? The app store kind of solved my Jones 90% of what I want. Yeah.  Especially when you need to tether, uh, except for tethering or background apparitions or cut and paste  or, but other than that. So this is one for you, Chris Hutchins, a creator of laid off camp email  scams get a makeover for the recession. Turns out phishing scams now are laden with links to, uh,  well, here's a good one. Uh, sorry, we can't give you a job, but here's your resume back,  hoping that you will open the file to see whose resume it was and maybe, uh, read it. Um,  spammers are sending emails, pretending to reject people for jobs. Instead of retrying to recruit  them. It says you weren't selected and here's your application back. You know, because I'm sure you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  couldn't keep a copy on your computer. When you printed it out, that was the only copy. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you know, it's not yours, right? So you go, Oh, I wonder what you, but you're going to open it,  right? Curiosity killed the cat. Um, also messages laden with links to, uh, uh, you know,  job app, like here's a job application, fill this out or come to our website. We've got a job for  you. That's really low kicking the people while they're down. That is so low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Man, but yeah, but spammers, man, they, they know all the tricks in the book. They don't care. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  don't care. Believe them. There's scumbags. They are scumbags. They're also students of human nature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, they really, they, they, they, they target. Yes. They, they, they, they exactly right. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  know what they're doing. And the mortgage companies and politicians and both parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. One more Twitter story. Oh, okay. Nevermind.  Just one more. Okay. Ron Sylvester, reporter for the Wichita Eagle in the court,  Twittering the trial. Uh, Sylvester has been using Twitter for a year to cover hearings and  trials in state courts. He's covering a racketeering trial of six Crips gang defendants  in federal court. The judge, he asked the judge, judge, uh, US district judge, Jay Thomas Martin  said, go right ahead. You may tweet from the control room, he, uh, the courtroom. He, uh, he,  he says he's recounted testimony and offered courtroom color, including quote, judge Martin  is talking to reluctant witness in chambers with a court reporter transcribing the conversation or  quote, the witness who was yelling in the hallway early has not returned to the courthouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually an interesting idea. I think much more functional than the guy who tweeted his,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  his wedding. Yeah, that's pathetic. That's just pathetic. But you know, I always hated those  sketches that you do, you know, with the, you like those, but they're always so awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why they're hilarious. I would like to have like 10 of them and just frame them and put them  up in my office. Why doesn't anyone have a trial? They're like caricatures basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That would be fun. I met the artist who did a lot of the OJ Simpson trial. Really? Yeah. He was a  storyboard artist. I used him for a commercial that I directed last year. The man is an, uh,  an incredible artist and, and, uh, and he, he promised me, he promised me an original Lance  Ito, judge Lance Ito. Oh my God, that would be so awesome. Absolutely. All right. I take it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. You change your tone. I take it back. No, now I'm thinking. Yeah. That's history right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on the wall. Right. Like the ones with Michael Jackson and stuff are so cool and like creepy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  looking. That'd be perfect. They don't really look like anything, but it would still be fun to have.  Are you going to go to his comeback tour? You have to go to London, right? But it's a little weird.  He said, I'm not, this is the last time I'm playing London. He didn't like say I'm retiring. He said,  I'm not going to be here again. So by a lot of stones in the, uh, in the hoop,  we might be retiring this time for sure. Very noncommittal. This is the last time I'll be  playing here for the next two years. I went to see the stones the last time when they were in town.  I can't, I just think it's amazing that this guy, I mean, this is an old guy like me, Hope,  this guy in his sixties is dancing and shaking and he's got, you know, the lips and the thing  and he's doing the whole thing. It's amazing. And, uh, of course, Ron would look and well,  Keith, Keith Richards looks like he's been dead for 20 years, but  yeah, but he's looked like that. He's always looked like that. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As long as they can keep doing what they love and they're doing a good job.  God bless them. Yeah, exactly. They're happy. Good on them. Good on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, let's see what else here. Did you see, we were talking about this before we started. I don't  think we talked about on the show, uh, Wolfram, who's famous for Mathematica,  is creating a new website that will allow you, it's, I guess, kind of an artificial  intelligence site to ask any question. It will give you any factual answer to any question you ask.  Steve Wolfram is a genius, some say. What do you think, Patrick? Is this, I think it's kind of a  cool idea. Do you think he can do it is the question? Well, yeah, I mean, the thing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  kind of fascinated me was it was one of those things that first burbled up in the, in the,  the blogosphere and then it's up on slash dot and tech crunch. Um, you know, he's saying he has an  initial version of a computer that answers factual questions. Wow. A la, and I quote,  Star Trek ship computers, uh, from an anonymous poster on slash dot. Um, so it's a web-based  application Wolfram Alpha, and it's a really interesting idea that it's going to respond  with, you know, rather than a link of web pages, it's going to give you a actual answer. He says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's not, yeah, it's not Google. Uh, it's, um, it's, uh, they're, they're, they're hand entering all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the data. This is like, yeah, this is more like pseudo touring stuff. And that's what I want to  know is like, is it actually doing this? Um, you know, they're calling it a computational knowledge  engine. Um, and it's a really interesting, you know, it's going to open in May and it's a really  interesting idea there because Wolfram's not talking a whole lot about it yet. Um,  you know, but they're saying you ask it a question and it will compute an answer for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that somebody said, well, what about biases? You know, you can say, he says, well, it's only  going to answer factual question. You know, what was Apple's stock price on January 20th, 2000?  But you know, you could, you, you might ask it about things that are more controversial,  like climate change and, uh, certainly whatever, there's some bias, isn't there? And, and the data

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's been entered in there. So there's people entering in answers to questions that may or may  not be posed to this service. I don't think it's exactly that. Apparently they've been doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for some time, kind of in a stealth mode, like years. But here's the thing. If you've got,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if you've got a database that, that, that has been, um, entered into, uh, the input has been  handled by human beings, then there's going to be a bias. It's only a matter of, of how long it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  takes you to determine what the bias is. See now this would be a good time to have calcannus on  because you can talk about. Mahalo. Mahalo is human. Right. Yeah. But this isn't, this isn't human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What this is like, what this is, is the idea that they, they, they, they got the engineering on and  they broke down, like, you know, these are the types of factual questions there are. These are  different models that are, you know, computational models for answering these questions. What they,  what they manually entered or pulled automatically pulled in, and I'm quoting from the tech crunch  article here is masses of raw factual data about various fields of knowledge. But then they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to connect. The software has to connect it somehow. Right. And well, it has to be able to interpret

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the question and then natural language, English, and you can ask one question like about Apple stock  price on whatever day you can ask that question in many different ways. Maybe not, maybe not that  one specifically, but there are a lot of questions that it takes a lot of artificial intelligence to  be able to decrypt the English language to see what they're trying to ask. But can it answer how

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is Babi formed? No, but we can, we know the answer. Well, you can, you can kind of do that in Google.  I'm going to type what is the capital of California in Google. I remember this kind of coming out and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  being talked about a while ago. I think it was when a live search was just starting, they were  transitioning to the live brand. Microsoft was, or MSN was, and one of the awesome new features  that makes it so much cooler than Google was that, and they had this as an example, what does an  alligator eat? You could type that in and it would talk about the diet of an alligator, I think,  in, in live search. And that was two plus years ago. I don't know how they were entering the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  information. You remember PowerSet that did that using Wikipedia and was attempting to do the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thing. It didn't do it very well. But this is kind of the difference between- By the way, the American

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  alligator feeds on a variety of animals. They will eat almost any prey. So there you go. And that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google. Right. That's not answering the question. That is actually giving you a search result and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it happens to be answered in that snippet. Google does do direct answers to certain questions. If  you give it a mathematical question or a computation of some kind, it will give you that answer. If you  ask it at a capital, it will tell you- Today, because of daylight savings time, I typed in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  current time into Google and it told me different cities and what time it is there. That's very

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  neat and also knows where I am. So it gave me my time. It assumes. Yeah. But it also gives you a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of other cities. Wow. Once you start indexing all the world's information, you have some answers  for people. It's pretty, I would hope so. Well, not necessarily, because information is not knowledge

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and it's not necessarily an answer. It empowers them to create tools to give answers to. But  is Wolfram trying to do knowledge? Well, but Wolfram, yeah, actually in a way it is, right?  Because what Wolfram's trying to do is build a machine that can do like a fifth grader's essay.  Wow. And there's a difference between listing sources, right? And actually giving you a,  this is the answer. It's an interesting concept. But an essay implies a point of view.  That's why I said a fifth grader's essay. Remember, you have to start with the topic.  But it was like, what is your report as a fifth grader? You know, I'm writing about the zebra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The zebra has stripes. I wrote an excellent report on black bears one time. Really? Let's hear it.  Do you remember it? Oh, I just remember that the, if I remember correctly, the female black bear  weighs like 300 pounds and the male black bear weighs like 500 pounds. Nevermind. You'll never

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  forget those important things you learned in that report. I think I now understand why in the chat

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  earlier people were saying, Baronica. I'm an expert on bears. All right. All right. Little

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  known fact. We're going to come back. Melinda Gates, apparently living a life of horror. She  and the kids are not allowed to own iPhones or iPods.

I thought you were just going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  start a conversation about that article. I was like, oh, yay, more Apple fanboyism, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm eager to see this funnier die. It's not really Melinda. You understand that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't seen it. Well, yeah, I heard about the story. I didn't know that there was a funnier die

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  sketch based on that story. So the story, just to recap, is Melinda's talking, I think it's to Vogue,  and says, yeah, I mean, she's fine about it. She says, no, and Steve Ballmer, same thing. He says,  I wouldn't let my kids touch an iPod. I guess that's loyalty. I mean, I guess.  This is, I guess it seems like kind of a, it seems like a pretty tough stance. This is a Bill  Gates wife, Melinda. This is an actress portraying that. I just have to explain that for funny or die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If Bill finds out I'm using this iMac, he'll freak out. I told Vogue magazine that we don't  have any Mac products in the house, but you know what? I lied. Okay. I had to. A couple of months  back, Bill found out I had an iPhone and an iPod and seven iMacs and he lost his s***. Oh my God.  He freaked out. But you know what? Give me a break. Come on. We're bazillionaires here.  And Bill has me and the kids living like we're cave people. It's a nightmare. Like last Christmas,  okay, I tried to put together a family photo album using this crap program,  Dell mega picture video storage library or something like that. It was awful. It was hard.  It took forever. I hated it. I mean, it would have been faster and easier for me to drive out to  Venice and get some s*** boardwalk to draw pictures of us. You know what I mean?  Oh my God. That was close. I told him I was taking this to the garbage as if no iPhones in the house.  Huh? Yeah. Why Bill? Why? Why is that? Why no iPhones in the house? Oh, wait a minute.  I can tell you. I know why. Because you don't like anything that's awesome. You f***ing nerd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. I'll let you watch the rest. You don't like anything that's awesome.  That's taking the theme and running with it. That's all I can say. But you have to think  Melinda might be thinking that in her heart of hearts. That's pretty funny. I mean, if you work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for a company, would you be upset if your kids used a competing product? I let my kids watch  Tekzilla. I've never been in that situation, obviously. So, aw. That hurt me. If they wanted

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to watch Tekzilla, it'd be okay. I could live with that. I guess I understand. We're supplementary

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to each other, Leo. We're supplementary. We're not competing. No, I'm just kidding, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think that's going a little far saying you may not have an iPod in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's humor. I can't imagine Bill getting stupid. No, no, no. She said this in an

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  interview for real. Really? Yeah. Well, the real solution should be, tell me why you want the iPod

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so we can make a better product. Or you could just ban- Or be the first kid on your block to have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Zoom. Melinda, I'm sorry, Microsoft, I'm reading this from theage.com.au. Microsoft founder Bill  Gates has banned iPods and iPhones from his household. The software billionaire's wife,  Melinda, has revealed. This is not the joke. This is the story. The rivalry between Microsoft  and Apple and Gates and Apple founder Steve Jobs is legendary, but the pair have made valiant efforts  to conceal any animosity. But behind the scenes, Apple is the forbidden fruit in Microsoft quarters.  She's talking with Vogue. She says, there are very few things that are on the banned list in  our household, but iPods and iPhones are two things we don't get for our kids. Every now and then,  says Melinda, I look at my friends and say, oh, I wouldn't mind having that iPhone. Oh, snap. Snap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. I'm not saying that from an Apple fan person perspective. I'm just saying, man, if Bill Hearst

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  or say that, Hearst or say that, she can't be missed. I think this Funny or Die skit is not too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  far off. Maybe. And I think that's why it inspired it. They're like, wait a second, there's something

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  going on. Quiet as it's kept, I've banned at Wil Wheaton from my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I knew there was something there. Now, but there, no, well, didn't, didn't Shatner have a,  didn't Shatner have a rivalry with, was it Sulu? George Takei. They didn't get along very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was a big, big, big time, big time rivalry between the two of them. Yeah. So I mean, it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  happens. It happens. You got to work together. You're wearing the outfits and maybe, you know,  there you both wore red that day and it's embarrassing. And, you know, sometimes something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  can blow up and get bigger. I don't know. It's like, on one hand, it seems really petty. And on  the other hand, it's like, you know, if you enjoy the lifestyle we lead, you know what I mean? Like,  it would be like the kids of, of the chairman of GM having Toyotas. Well, maybe not Toyota,  since there's some stuff they've worked on together. Or maybe they're flying jets instead

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of driving their own cars. Yeah, there you go. There's a good analogy. Engines by Rolls Royce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. So yeah. Or do you think that Steve Jobs is not allowed, does not allow Windows machines in  the house? That'd be kind of weird. Oh, absolutely. Really? No. He probably doesn't allow like colors  in the house. It's all white. It's got to all be white. How about Zooms? If, if, if, if, if, if,  Steve Jobs kid came home and said, dad, I want a Zune. Steve Jobs is not going to say, you may not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  have a Zune. He's going to say, no, you know what Steve Jobs is going to do? Steve Jobs, from what  I've heard from people that have worked with him, is going to scream at the top of his heads about  if you want an inferior piece of whatever, if you want to use an inferior product, go ahead,  go ahead. The kid like walks around with a Zoom to be like, you know what? You can have an iPod,  which is the real device for listening to music. No, you want an inferior. That's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my goodness. Let's give him a headache just pretending.  Barney Frank wants to bring back online gambling. This is interesting. The Republicans banned  online gambling, making it illegal in the United States in 2006, barring businesses from knowingly  accepting payments in connection with internet gambling, which was already illegal. So basically  the credit card companies said, yes, we can't help you. This cost European companies where most of  the gambling sites were a lot of money. In fact, people were arrested the minute they stepped out  of a plane on US soil. Advocates of lifting the ban say it's an impingement of personal liberty.  And by the way, a couple of billion dollars in revenue that you're losing over the next decade  by not allowing internet gambling. Think of all the tax money you could make.  What do you guys say on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Has anyone ever internet gambled?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have not. I do not play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Be honest. It's cool. No one will judge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would go to partypoker.com. I'm afraid of being the fish at the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how to play any gambling games like that. So I wouldn't even know where to start.  LaVar, you must play. You must play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love poker. And part of the appeal is being eye to eye with the competitors and reading them.  That's so hard to do online. I don't see the appeal. For me, it's better engaged in a one-on-one  setting with other human beings. I can't imagine getting any joy out of playing online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In a way, it might appeal to people who really have a gambling problem because it means you can  gamble anytime, anywhere. It's dangerous. It's actually dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With all due respect, on one hand, you could blow the Brent money without leaving the house.  But on the other hand, there's an Indian casino in about every 500 yards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and that's why that law was passed, I'm sure. Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and the Indian  casino said, you better not allow internet gambling. That's not good for America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of people also said it simply takes a huge amount of, it's like a 52,  I don't know how many billions of dollars. But they're basically saying it was taking the money

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  offshore. Interesting. There's also the bigger issue of cheating. It's very hard to police this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  stuff. You would know if they were cheating you in a casino, Leo. That's why we have gambling

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  commissions to watch this stuff. I don't know how good a job they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I understand that. But there's a strong line between being cheated and having casinos  play the legitimate rules as hard as they can because they're looking to maximize returns.  They play, this goes back to our whole study of psychology thing that we were talking about  earlier. Casinos don't, they may be legal, but it's not fair. The house always wins.  They just need to maximize. But you know that when you go in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a big story on 60 Minutes, it was quite interesting, about online gambling. Apparently,  one of these online gambling sites, I think it was a poker site, a former employee had access.  See, if you could see the cards of everybody you're playing with, you'd pretty much win all  the time. And that's exactly what happened. The guy had access to the backend software,  was able to see all the cards that were dealt out. And actually players became suspicious because  these guys were betting when they shouldn't be betting, by traditional poker rules. They're  not playing poker properly and winning massive amounts because they knew the cards.  And by the way, there's very little recourse. There's not much you could do even if you discover

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this. It lacks that reality of seeing a real card in your hand and you almost, I wouldn't trust it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys are also assuming that poker would be the only thing people would be playing.  There's no reason there wouldn't be Blackjack and PyGow poker and slot machines. The whole reason  they have all these weird, well, the difference is that a lot of people, there's not a lot of  difference between playing slots in Atlantic City and playing slots at home, except you don't have  to deal with some angry bag lady slamming down nickels down the road. It's true. Slots is a  computer, even if you're playing in Atlantic City. And slots is a huge generator of revenue for casinos.  And if you notice the fact that there are more slot machines now than there are gambling tables  in terms of square footage, it means that they're generating more revenue. Were I a gambler, which

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not, because I'm just not good at that kind of thing, I would much rather play at a casino  because at least I would feel, even though the odds are probably stacked in their favor,  that if it ever came out that somehow they were cheating players or somehow stealing money,  that the reputation of that casino would be ruined and that's in their best interest to stay legitimate  and have people win on a fairly regular basis, as opposed to an online site, which I can't  check that at all. I have no idea what their reputation is really other than a cursory search  online. It just feels a little more legitimate in real life as opposed to online. And if you're  spending an awful lot of money to do this hobby, you may as well go to the most reputable place you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  can. If online gambling is legalized in the United States, the first people that are going to be there  are all of the familiar brands from Las Vegas and Atlantic City and the Indian casinos. And it will  be regulated, it will basically have some form of regulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So maybe it isn't the casinos that are fighting this. Who is fighting it? Is it a moral thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I still feel like unless they could really prove that they'd be making  a lot of money online, which they probably would, they still want people to come to their casinos  as opposed to playing online because they still make a lot of money on hotels and on food and all  the touristy stuff that goes down at the casino, right? Or do you think they would just be making

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  money on gambling? Gambling is the game, is the thing.  Actually, that's not true anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of leaders.  No, no, they're not.  Not anymore, they're not.  Not since they started $500 a room.  No, since the corporations came in and especially in the last five to 10 years with the mega casinos,  every branch of the casino actually has to generate profit. And the hotels and restaurants  have become actually generating more revenue off the hotels and restaurants now in Vegas  than they are off the gaming floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They probably realize that gamblers will come even if they don't get the $2 buffet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to start a card counting scheme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They still do free drinks.  They still do free drinks while you're gambling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Drunk people make stupid decisions.  What is your card counting scheme going to be? You know, there is a card counting application

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we'll go watch that movie.  Yes, there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, 21. Yeah. Wasn't that cool? 21.  Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But isn't that interesting that they have an application for counting cars?  And the casinos are doing what about this?  I mean, they're banning the phone.  They're banning iPhones.  Yeah.  So you can have your Blackberry at the table, but just not your iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I think cell phones in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't have a phone or an electronic device at the table the last...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want to take a call, step away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's appropriate. I don't want somebody taking calls at the table while I'm losing my shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, I'm kind of curious about instead of just thinking about gambling as what do you do at a  casino now and doing that online, but online gambling, you can gamble about anything.  Especially if you think about gambling and say sports, if you can do that on the internet,  what's going to keep referees and coaches and players, you know,  getting jumping online to gamble on those games?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you make it legitimate, it actually could be more strongly regulated on the internet,  because if you tie it into a credit card or something versus being able to walk in with a  pile of... You know what I mean? There's nothing to stop a zebra from walking into the sportsbook  at the insert name of casino here and laying down a bet on the game. You know?  Is the circus... Since I recently had the pleasure of staying at the circus, circus at CES.  No. Oh, that's sad.  Yeah. Well, it was inexpensive and I am at a startup, so...  So... But I mean, it's not hard to circumvent controls, such controls as they are. Gambling  is essentially an anonymous event. You walk in, you lay down cash, you get a receipt,  you turn the receipt back in based on whether or not you won. You know what I mean? You walk  into a gaming table or a slot machine with cash and you walk back out with cash unless you make  more than whatever the current cap is on gambling revenues, which is what makes it...  You know what I mean? There's nothing to... It's very easy. And on top of that, there's still  a huge amount of illegal sports gambling in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They still bolt the remote control for the TV to the table at the circus, circus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. Not the rooms I was staying in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was when I knew it. This is not a great hotel. They bolted the remote control to the table. The  lamp was bolted to the table. I'm going to take their remote control and their crappy clown lamp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a big difference between staying in the outdoor motel-y kind of area versus the towers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The towers are a lot better. Oh, okay. I must have stayed in the  cheap seats. That was, by the way, when Tech TV was paying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Tech TV also had the habit of deciding to go to the last minutes. So, I mean, having said that  I've stayed at the fabulous... I've stayed at this point over 34 hotels in Las Vegas.  Wow. Because I'm out there for trade shows so much.  At this point, I've got to say, the most depressing thing about the circus is walking by little  fleets of children waiting outside the gaming floor at 9.30 on a Saturday night for their parents.  It's much more depressing than staying at the Blair Witch House in and counting the hundreds  of cigarette burns on every horizontal surface in the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You feel like Nick Cage must have stayed here at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Nick Cage refused to stay there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. One last story. As long as we're in the land of vice, Craig's List is being sued.  A sheriff in Illinois accuses Craig's List of promoting prostitution. Cook County Sheriff.  No.  I have a feeling gambling has been going on in here, Rick. Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart says,  the site was failing to block offers to trade sex for money. He wants a federal judge to shut down  the erotic services section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked about this on Buzz Out Loud the other day. Also, I guessed it on there. And my kind of  stance on it is that Craig's List has been doing and working with law enforcement agencies for as  long as they've been around. They do have a pretty good way of making sure that prostitution  isn't happening. Even though it does, they do make sure they call people back. They make people  supply a phone number when they're leaving these postings. It's going to happen from time to time,  but I don't understand why the law enforcement agency in this case is suing them. In a way,  they're helping them find... Yeah, sure, they're making it easier, but at the same time, they're  helping law enforcement agencies find these illegal prostitution rings. Isn't that kind of  helping them in a way? I agree. Do you think it's really encouraging more people to take part in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  this or not? Not that I know anything about it, Veronica. Not that I know a thing about it,  but my understanding is that there's a lot of law enforcement on Craig's List looking for sex,  or for people having sex, illicitly. Right. With intent of arresting them.  Yes, not have sex. Or for fun. Or for fun. But law enforcement does use Craig's List as a sting tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does seem to me that if you wanted to stay undercover, advertising on Craig's List would

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  not be a good way of doing it. Well, if they advertise in the back of the Guardian and the  SF Weekly, every major town has ads for illicit, naughty services. I'm just looking here. Craig's  List men seeking women, you get the list. It's not men seeking women. There's an actual erotic

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  services category. How could that not be prostitution? Are they free?  I never really got into it. Oh yeah, there is. Look, erotic services warning and disclaimer,  unless all of the following points are true, please use your back button. That sounds dirty  right there. That's what she said. I'm at least 18 years old. I understand erotic services may  include adult content. I agree to flag as prohibited anything illegal or in violation of the terms of  use, including offers for or solicitation of prostitution. I agree to report suspected  exploitation of minors through appropriate authorities. And then big yellow letters,  human trafficking and exploitation of minors are not tolerated. Any suspected activity will be  reported to law enforcement. But this is prostitution. I mean, it's right, erotic services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems like prostitution would be a subset of that. I'm not sure exactly what other services

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they're providing that are legitimate. But well, I guess dancing is erotic, but not illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like do you want to hire a stripper for your bachelor party? Yeah, that would be okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be wrong. I haven't just skimmed this and I highly recommend anybody with children  not skim this. If the children are around, there's nobody offering anything  involving bachelor party services in here. Theoretically, however, they could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I guess my real question is, so clearly this whole thing is that. So  is it just that there's so many in there that law enforcement just is going to turn their  eye away? I mean, it's. You gotta remember something.  Suing doesn't seem like the right answer. Yeah. Why is he suing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're suing because they've put a lot of time and effort into hunting down these people that  are using it for illegal reasons. And so they say that's money that they've wasted. They want their  money back. But I think that's money that they've used to actually catch people doing things that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  are illegal. That's their job. I didn't realize that they want 100,000 for that.  It's they want the 100,000 back that they spent pursuing Craigslist investigations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I mean, what did they not find anything in these investigations? Like maybe then that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  would make sense. No, you know what he said? Here he is. He I could make arrests off Craigslist  24 hours a day, but to what end? By filing this, he said, I'm trying to go up the ladder.  He says he's been working with Craigslist representatives for months, sending letters,  requesting them to take down or provide greater self-policing of their erotic services section,  but his police have been met with no response. The sheriff said he believes the company has  been unresponsive because the erotic services section generates a large portion of the company's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  80 million dollars in annual revenue. I almost don't even believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How does the company make money? Do they charge people for the list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They charge. I know they charge for, uh,  For act. No, Craigslist charges.  For job listings. Job listings and apartment listings,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think in certain markets. But not anything else. But not anything else, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, not to my knowledge. The rest of it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, look at that. Hold on. There's a nice. Job and apartments, job and apartments only, I guess.  Huh? No, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They charge $50 for major companies. According to the Chronicle, as of November 7,  2008, Craigslist was to charge for erotic services ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh huh. There may be some merit to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know, I still don't really buy it because the company is so small and Craig is so integral  to the daily operations of the company that I just don't believe that if someone was trying  to work with them, maybe I'm naive, but if someone in law enforcement was trying to work with them  on, you know, making something bad like this stop that they wouldn't even respond.  Like it just doesn't make sense knowing what I know about that company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. Well, there's a, I guess there's a difference between the erotic services and  just the dating on Craigslist then, right? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. Not all dating is necessarily erotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Having met my wife on Craigslist, Levar, yes, I'd like to.  Did you meet your wife on Craigslist? Did you really?  Yes, I did. Thank you very much.  In the erotic services?  No. Were you buying a sofa?  No, I was not buying a sofa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. That's cool. So I didn't know.  That's a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And there was no law enforcement had any hand in that deal.  I can find you.  Well, she was a cop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Be gentle. This is the mother of my child you're talking about here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got my job at CNET on Craigslist that was not erotic.  Wow. Not erotic.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've never done anything on Craigslist at all, but maybe I will.  Maybe I'll start.  You've never used Craigslist, period?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've looked. I don't think I've ever actually converted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's actually a great article on this from SFGate, which is our local paper in San Francisco.  In November, the attorney general of Connecticut threatened legal action after receiving  complaints about photographs depicting nudity. Craigslist came to an agreement with 40 attorney  generals around the United States. Instituted policies aimed at reducing the amount of  prostitution, including requiring advertisers for erotic massage, strippers, escort services,  and the like to pay a fee with a credit card.  And what does that do, I guess?  And Dart said the agreement between Craigslist and the attorney general has resulted in no  appreciable reduction of ads of prostitution on the site.  It doesn't get around anything.  And he says Craigslist does not monitor it. And when his officers have attempted to contact  Craigslist, they have been ignored or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they have a pretty good case. If Craigslist, if the three things they charge for are  rooms, jobs, and erotic services, they make a pretty good case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So get Craig on here. Get Craig on here and ask him.  All right.  Absolutely.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Deal.  He's open to that kind of thing.  Yeah. Yeah. We'll do that. That's a great idea. Craig, what's the deal?  What's the deal?  And Craig's on Twitter.  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. He's a pretty active Twitterer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's really funny. In its statement Thursday, Craigslist warned that Craigslist is an extremely  unwise choice for those intent on committing crimes since criminals inevitably leave an  electronic trail to themselves that law enforcement officers will follow.  On a daily basis, we are being of direct assistance to police departments and federal  authorities nationwide. So could this be twisted as a violation of First Amendment rights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This kind of sounds like a honeypot. They're kind of luring people in, charging them money,  and then calling the cops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then responding to requests from the cops. But it's interesting that the sheriff, Dart,  is annoyed in Chicago that he has to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am shocked, shocked to learn that there are adult services going on in here.  Exactly.  All right. Colleen says she wants to kickbox you for charity, Veronica. Are you up for it?
