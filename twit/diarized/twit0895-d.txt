Transcript:  I think leave them there.  That's good.  Oh, Google, Google, Google.  They're at it again.  Stadia three years old.  Google has announced they're shutting it down.  They're streaming gaming service.  I guess really the only question is, uh, whoever thought Stadia would survive.  The good news is they are giving you your money back.  Why did Google Alex even think it could get into gaming?  What was the process there?

Start time: 399.94
End time: 429.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think that what we're seeing now is this demarcation between old Google and new  Google.  Yeah.  And old Google said, let's experiment with everything we can throw money behind it because  why not?  Right.  And that's how you end up having a thing like Stadia get funded in the way that it got funded  and become a big prog of a Google strategic vision is because they were going to make  experimental project part of that vision and eventually some of it would stick and that  would be the, uh, you know, potential next big reinvention for Google.

Start time: 429.62
End time: 436.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did Google get, uh, you know, financial, uh, responsibility?  I mean, did they start getting, did they grow up or?

Start time: 437.22
End time: 493.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what I think.  That's exactly what I think we're seeing right now.  And this, the canceling of Stadia is like maybe just the beginning, right?  We had Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and Alphabet at code a few weeks ago saying Google  needed to get 20% more efficient.  And I think that like, rather than look at this as like, you know, Google's bet on gaming,  I think we can really see this as a signal for where this company is going and maybe  where all of big tech is going, which is that those experimental projects that used to get  the money, because again, why not?  They're not going to get the money anymore.  And I think this is going to do two things.  One, it's going to add, bring needed focus to a lot of these companies, but two is going  to open the door for companies who would have otherwise been in these experimental areas  and gotten wiped out by big tech to start competing with big tech in a way that they  haven't been before.  So I think this is again, so just a very dynamic, interesting time for big tech.  And Stadia is one example of what we're seeing in terms of the change that's just going to  accelerate, I think over the next few months.

Start time: 493.56
End time: 500.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think, Corey, it's maybe also trepidation about government regulation that maybe Google's  saying we should pull some of the tentacles back in?

Start time: 502.10
End time: 574.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't think that, so I think that merger scrutiny is a lot easier to imagine  the state imposing than merger review and unwinding.  Unwinding mergers is really hard.  It's very expensive and it takes a long time.  I think it's probably a necessary corrective.  And I do have one weird trick that we can talk about later for how I think we could  do a lot of it very quickly.  Merger scrutiny is far more likely and since they didn't buy Stadia, I don't think they  would be worried about that.  But I do want to say that it's underappreciated the extent to which Google bought its way  to glory instead of inventing its way to glory.  This is a company that's had one and a half internal successes.  They made a great search engine and a pretty good hotmail clone.  All of the other things that they built internally crashed and burned.  And all of the successes that they have are things they bought from someone else.  This is just the latest example.  Google video stank.  YouTube succeeded.  Google couldn't build mobile OS but Android came along.  And people will say that Google Photos is an internal success.  And it's true but it's an internal success because it comes bundled on Android which  Google bought from someone else.

Start time: 574.48
End time: 593.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they bought Picasa which is a lot of the back end as well.  I'm looking at Google's purchase starting in 2001 when they bought Deja News.  I forgot about that.  Deja News.  Yeah, remember Deja and Blogger of course was their third big acquisition.  They bought AdSense.  They didn't make that up.  They applied for it.

Start time: 593.38
End time: 605.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Their whole ad tech stack, their server management, their mobile platform, their video platform,  customer service, HR software, like all of it.  Their docs platform all came from other companies.  What about Chrome?

Start time: 605.51
End time: 606.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean what about the browser?

Start time: 606.91
End time: 612.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chrome, you're right.  Chrome is a browser they did build internally.  You're right.  That's an omission.  Thank you.

Start time: 613.16
End time: 616.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you said that project is of course the CEO today.  Sundar was in charge.

Start time: 616.60
End time: 710.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Two and a half successful products.  You're absolutely right.  But still, I don't mean to be flip here, right?  But it's also true of lots of other companies that they're buying their way to glory.  And the reason I bring that up, because you asked me about antitrust, is that historically  companies were prohibited from both merging with major competitors and also buying nascent  competitors that they might neutralize on their way to becoming a threat.  And the modern antitrust that was practiced for the 40 years of kind of Reaganomics that  seems to be coming to a close was extraordinarily tolerant of acquisitions as a growth strategy.  But as I say, I think that's coming to a close.  In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority is challenging even small acquisitions like  Facebook buying Jiffy, which I refuse to call Giffy.  I think you're going to see more of this.  And I think it's a necessary corrective.  The extent to which VCs have become effectively like corporate recruiters who basically say,  all right, we're going to put a little money into a startup whose purpose is to basically  produce a postgraduate portfolio piece that we're going to pretend as a product just to  prove that they can work together as a team.  And then a tech company will buy them, throw away the product, and just put them to work.  And the VC's equity will just be like a finder's fee.  It's a grotesque and wasteful way to conduct business, to say nothing of to get innovative  products into the market.

Start time: 711.52
End time: 736.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just looking at the list of acquisitions Google has made.  The many great companies that I've loved when they were around that have basically disappeared.  Picasso is a good example.  Jaiku is a good example.  You can go on and on and on.  They've basically been a graveyard, FeedBurner, Grand Central, which became...

Start time: 736.54
End time: 737.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, FeedBurner is still in there.

Start time: 738.24
End time: 760.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and so is Google Voice as Grand Central.  Although part of the problem with Google killing stuff is it makes people nervous about adopting  Google services because there's always this risk that Google is going to lose interest.  So Alex, you're saying this is kind of a salubrious adjustment of their financial maturity, but  it's also risky, isn't it?

Start time: 761.44
End time: 790.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do think it's risky.  Yeah, I made this point in Big Technology a couple of weeks ago talking about how you  might end up seeing stuff that Wall Street likes a lot in the short term.  Things like greater profitability.  They might even make some offensive moves to try to take out some competitors.  But in the long term, I think focusing on profitability, especially when it comes to  big tech companies that are 10, 20, 30, 40 years old, leaves them vulnerable to outside  challenges in a way that they weren't before.

Start time: 792.02
End time: 839.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google is at least trying to make people whole who bought into Stadia.  They're going to refund your fancy controller and any games you bought, which is actually  a big deal because you had to buy the games to play them on Stadia, but they are not going  to refund your subscription fees.  There are some people who are a little miffed about Google pulling the plug, like a YouTuber  named It's Color TV who says he had devoted 5,907 hours to building up a character in  Red Dead Redemption 2, a character which will be lost, that's 246 days, lost in January  when Google pulls the plug because there's currently no way to transfer that character  to your own copy of Red Dead Redemption.

Start time: 840.00
End time: 863.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry about it.  For folks who think that it's a good idea to invest in products on other people's platforms  without thinking that there's a risk that the platform might pull the rug, it's absurd  at this point.  Every single thing that people build on one of these big tech platforms, you have to understand  that if for some reason they decide that they don't want to support it anymore, it's done.

Start time: 865.58
End time: 887.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have a choice is the problem.  Where do you go?  At this point you can't build on any, it's YouTube or TikTok.  My son has 2.1 million followers on TikTok, he's starting to build a career as a TikTok  creator, but it's not like you could do that on your own blog anymore.

Start time: 888.59
End time: 920.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, of course it's different.  By the way, congratulations to him.  You do it with the understanding that it might just be a moment in time.  I think we all have to be okay with that when we're on these other platforms because there's  no other way around it.  They are also, by the way, I would say TikTok is providing that opportunity for your son  to create that business.  It's a great opportunity.  Without it, it wouldn't be there.  It goes both ways, but all this stuff really needs to be viewed as potentially temporary  situations because that could always flip over time and often it does.

Start time: 922.30
End time: 1039.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with your cautionary note there.  I do think that when we say there's no other way, you're right that there is no other way  right now, but it's not like there's no conceivable other way.  When RSS was designed, at its core was this idea of blocking, lock-in and orphaning and  so on.  There's an XML directive you can put with RSS that says, this feed is permanently moved  to a different address.  If you and your hosting company part ways, you just send that directive out the next  time a podcatcher pulls down that XML file.  It goes, oh, I'm just going to relocate my bookmark for this to a different server and  you can just take your audience with you.  I understand why YouTube hasn't built that, but I don't understand why we shouldn't want  them to build it.  If we're going to get a better deal for creators from YouTube, one of the ways that we'll do  that is by YouTube having a legitimate fear that if they give creators a bad deal, that  those creators will go elsewhere.  It's a separate issue to the one about this Red Dead Redemption character, but again,  at least within a single game, it's easy to see how those stats could be moved over.  This is just a small database entry, but I think that firms don't like doing this because  they like their app store to be like a sole portal into payments and other sources of  value.  If they do create that interoperability, there is that possibility that customers will jump  ship.  If they're taking a 30% rake or a 15% rake or whatever it is Stadia was taking out of  Red Dead Redemption's publishers, the inability to port a character is a feature and not a  bug.  It's not a technical challenge.  YouTube could disclose to Red Dead Redemption all of that material and give the publishers  the technical means to move that character over.  It's a small file.  That's all.  Yeah, but they just choose not to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you think that if you spend the money creating this stuff, you should be able to  make the rules?  Let me give an example like Brick and Mortar Store.  If you have a restaurant and you shouldn't just be required to store all the person's  food preferences so that they can then go to another restaurant and basically mimic exactly  what you've been giving them without having that restaurant having to work for it.  That should be something that starts from the ground up.  But the user should be able to.

Start time: 1069.78
End time: 1079.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, honestly, I know what my preferences are so I can bring them with me.  But if somehow the restaurant was able to lock up my preferences, that wouldn't be a  good situation, would it?

Start time: 1079.98
End time: 1088.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Of course.  Yeah, listen, I think that if you spend the effort, you run the business, you're spending  the time.  Yeah, I'll never go to that restaurant then if they're going to steal my preferences and

Start time: 1089.02

Transcript:  Let's say you go to pizza restaurant number one, right?  And you have like a...

Start time: 1097.36
End time: 1108.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they name a pie for me, the Leo pie, which has got grapes, tomatoes, peep pepperoni.  And then I can't take that to another restaurant because it's now owned by Papa John's.

Start time: 1111.00
End time: 1122.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other restaurant should be able to make that, but there shouldn't be a requirement  to go to this restaurant and say, please send the recipe.  Download Leo's recipe.  And then give it to the competitor.  That competitor should have to figure out on their own.

Start time: 1123.14
End time: 1146.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But RSS is a good example because this whole network is dependent on RSS.  That's how podcasting works.  But didn't the platforms come along and say, yeah, we're going to kill RSS, creating some  sort of spurious allegation that RSS isn't working or it's not right or it's not good.  They did the same thing with XMPP.  They don't want interoperability.  So they actively kill it, don't they?

Start time: 1148.30
End time: 1246.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me be clear.  I'm not saying necessarily that I want YouTube to be forced to do this.  But in the absence of meaningful competition, YouTube is neither being disciplined by firms  nor by regulators.  And that means that their corporate preferences carry an enormous amount of weight.  And that furthermore, the lack of competition, which arises in part out of this anti-competitive  vertical integration that I was just talking about where Google just buys the companies  that might later compete with it, means that it has enormous power over policy.  So while I support absolutely YouTube's fair use claims, I was a staunch supporter of YouTube  when Viacom was suing them for a billion dollars.  I think that it's not YouTube's job to make sure Viacom's business model is intact or  to respect their business model.  I think what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  And if you were to try and make a tool that allowed a YouTube broadcaster to take their  audience with them to a rival platform, which I think analogizes to the kinds of things  that people did, that YouTube did when they made a tool that allowed people to take the  video they liked and put it on YouTube and only have to respond to takedown and so on,  YouTube would reduce you to radioactive rubble.  They'd say you violated their terms of service.  They'd say you violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.  They'd say you violated the DMCA and they would put you out of business for doing unto  them what they did unto others.  I'm just saying that they should face the same competitive pressure that gave rise to  something as innovative and great as YouTube so that the next innovative great thing can  come along.

Start time: 1248.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That seems fair.  You wouldn't be against that, right, Alex?  Isn't there a bill in the Senate to promote interoperability?

Start time: 1261.18
End time: 1408.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that sufficient?  Yeah, that's the Access Act.  It wouldn't touch this, but the Access Act is about exposing APIs for social media and  a few other kinds of platforms, app stores as well.  And then the EU, there's the Digital Markets Act.  They embody the punchline of that Irish joke, if you wanted to get there, I wouldn't start  from here.  You have this situation where these firms are very dominant and where they do act as  gatekeepers, right?  Matt Mullenweg's post about why Tumblr doesn't have porn anymore and why it never will was  pretty instructive here.  We submit updates to Apple three times a month and at any time they might just arbitrarily  decide that the filters we had last month are no longer good enough and then we just  go out of business.  He's like, I don't know how Twitter gets away with it.  I don't know how Reddit gets away with it, but we don't.  We couldn't.  Apple has chosen to make exceptions for some firms and not others.  We only have 100 million users instead of, you know, however, or we only have 10 million  users instead of 100 million users.  So maybe that's why.  But it just puts Apple in the position of picking winners and losers in the marketplace.  And I don't think the answer is to say, Apple, you must carry all apps no matter whether  you feel they're good or bad.  But I think that its customers should be allowed to choose a different app store, right?  It is after all their phone.  It belongs to them.  You know, as you as you say, if you add the value to it, e.g. by opening your wallet and  buying it, then it should be yours to use as you feel like.  And you know, the fact that Apple doesn't have to face meaningful competition from other  app stores for the hardware it's sold means that it can act in this very high handed and  opaque way.  And it does just, you know, it gets to structure the entire mobile market kind of or half of  the other half being structured by Google.  But no one elected them.  And you know, mostly what they use to attain that structuring is not technology, but the  law.  It's the fact that if you were to try to unlock an Apple phone and, you know, sell a dongle  that jail broke your phone and let you choose another app store, Apple would sue you.  So they're happy to have the state regulators step in and prevent people from offering,  you know, more choice to people who own devices who want to use their property in different  ways.  And in the horror regulation, when someone steps in and tells them how to use their property,  I would actually prefer to just withdraw the legal protections from Apple, not impose new  obligations on them.

This is just like, you know, there are some statutes that only a public prosecutor can  invoke and some that the public can invoke.  So imagine if you went to the muffler shop and they wrecked your car and the only way  you could sue them is if you could get your local attorney general to sue them.  That's what it's like when there's no private right of action.  So private right of action is if you individually were harmed by someone who violated a statute,  you can hire a lawyer to sue them.  Statutes that don't have a private right of action require a public prosecutor to bring  them to court.  And sometimes that's appropriate.  But I think like with both privacy and with the Access Act, a private right of action  makes sense.

If it's loser pays, people aren't going to bring spurious lawsuits because the other  side will be like, great, I'm just going to hire a lawyer on contingency to rack up giant  billings for your frivolous lawsuit.

Transcript:  Well, it's mostly a legal protection and not a technical one.  As a technical matter, jailbreaking has been of varying degrees of difficulty at different  times in Apple's devices history.  But as a legal matter, the difficulty has stayed constant.  You know, you have like Checkmate, which is a jailbreak against all of the secure enclaves  for eight years with iPhone models that cannot be remediated because the secure enclave is  not field-updatable.  Because that's the whole point.  If you can modify the secure enclave, then it's not secure.  And so, hypothetically, someone could develop a jailbreak-based third-party app store that  leveraged Checkmate for anyone who bought an iPhone over the first eight years of its  existence or year four through 12 of its existence.  But they can't because Apple would come after you under the DMCA.

Transcript:  So Matt Mullenweg, in fact, I wish I'd asked him this because he was on our show a couple  of weeks ago about the porn thing.  There was a kind of a movement on Tumblr people saying, oh, Tumblr is bringing porn  back.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Look at this.  It's never coming back.

Transcript:  Well, I think the one way that Apple could really do a better job is make sure that it  gets some of the scams out of the app store.  I don't know if Apple's making the best use of its time being the morality police on apps  like Tumblr, and if it's going to be, better be consistent.  But there's so many scam apps in the app store.  These are well documented.  They exist in the US and outside, largely outside.  And if the company is trying to make us think that that 30% fee is worth it, work on getting  those scams out of the app store first, and then we can go the level down and talk about  decency on the apps.

He's made it his life work to find scams on the app store.  Apparently he made a deal with Apple over his apps being blocked.  So he's had to stop talking about that.  Well, that's terrible.

Start time: 1706.32
End time: 1816.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, can I ask you a question?  So I think that there's been a very interesting arc to these conversations that we've had  about big tech.  The first one was a recognition of the fact that these apps and companies have just become  too big.  And it all happened so fast, right?  Facebook went from like 500 million users to a billion to a couple billion users, like  in a blink of an eye.  Amazon went from being a percentage of online retail to being online retail effectively  in a moment's notice.  Apple from a one trillion or a couple hundred billion dollar company to a three trillion  dollar company in a moment's notice.  So then everyone's like, okay, these companies are the biggest companies in the world and  they are squeezing out competition, which is definitely true.  We need to regulate them.  And then we had this flood of ideas and bills that have come and tried to rein them in.  I just wonder if they're going too far.  Some of them seem like they make a lot of sense to me, right?  The idea that a platform cannot privilege its own products by using the data that it  gets from companies that have to go through them.  That makes sense.  But the whole idea of cutting off acquisitions, okay, most M&A fails.  So the idea that M&A is the only thing that's made these companies successful doesn't really  make sense to me.  The idea of data portability.  I understand the tenets of data portability, but people are on Facebook, people are on  Twitter for the network.  It's not like you can just take your data and go somewhere else and be okay.  And all this is happening in the context of a market that's punishing these companies  ruthlessly.  I mean, Facebook's down 57% this year in the stock market and getting kneecapped by TikTok.  So I would just wonder if, you know, how much, how far, if we've gone too far on, you know,  let's regulate the fair competition back in the market without remembering that we have  a market economy and letting the market do its work as it seems to be doing this year.

Start time: 1817.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I agree.  I think that it's important to distinguish between the dynamics that drive growth and  the dynamics that maintain growth.  So growth, I think, is driven, it's well understood by network effects.  You know, you joined Facebook because you wanted to talk to people who were there.  They joined Facebook because they wanted to talk to you.  You made an app for the App Store because you wanted to sell it to Apple customers.  Bought iPhones because they wanted to use your app.  And so there's this virtuous cycle that drives growth.  But intrinsically, technology has really low switching costs because computers are universal.  The only computer we know how to make is the computer that can run all the software we  know how to write.  It's the Turing machine, the von Neumann machine.  And so historically, you know, when you had firms that had choke points in the market,  the way Microsoft did in the early 2000s, when it wouldn't maintain the Mac Office  product and it became harder and harder for CIOs to justify having Macs in the office.  I was a CIO back then.  We started putting Windows machines on designers' desks so that they could access Word files  and Excel files and PowerPoint files without corrupting them.  Eventually, we just put bigger graphics cards in them, threw away their Macs and bought  them Adobe Suite for Windows.  And the way Apple resolved that was not by asking the law to regulate Microsoft, nor  was it by telling people that they like Macs better and so they should just hang in there.  They reverse engineered Microsoft's products.  They made pages, keynote and numbers, which reverse engineered the file formats of Excel,  PowerPoint and Word.  And they made them feature compatible.  And they kept a team on that so that every time Microsoft updated their file formats,  Apple updated their file formats in parallel so that they could maintain compatibility.  That's the thing that has been ended.  The mechanisms under which we used to do that have now been made illegal under tortious  interference with contract, under non-disclosure and non-compete, under the Computer Fraud  and Abuse Act, Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and so on.  We've created this penumbra of laws that boil down to felony contempt of business model.  And what that's done is it's made it possible for firms that have attained dominance through  network effects, but would historically have faced the risk of losing that dominance also  through network effects because the corollary of a service that gets more valuable every  time someone joins is a service that gets less valuable every time someone leaves.  And so you're prone to these bank runs on your users, as we sort of see happening with  Facebook now, where people are leaving Facebook and advertisers are leaving and then people  leaving and advertisers leaving.  So restoring that interoperability, the right to interoperate, when Facebook extended membership  to non-EDU addresses, all of the users that had hoped to court were already on MySpace.  And rather than telling them you should pick a day when all of you quit MySpace and come  to Facebook or you should maintain two separate clients, it gave them a bot.  And you could load that bot with your login and password for MySpace and it would go and  scrape your waiting messages and put them in your Facebook inbox.  And then it would let you reply to them and push them into your MySpace outbox.  And if you tried to do that to Facebook today or if you tried to reverse engineer Apple's  App Store and produce a feature compatible App Store today the way Apple did to Microsoft,  they would destroy you.  And so you're right, there's a market dynamic that drove this growth, but it's not a market  dynamic that maintained the growth.  The thing that maintained the growth was the capture of regulation to prevent new firms  firms what they did when they were new firms.

Transcript:  If this is the case, then how do you explain, and by the way, just for the, I'm trying to  learn here.  So how do you explain the notion that Figma, which effectively does what Adobe does, but  does it on the browser, just sold to Adobe for $20 billion in what was absolutely a defensive  move because Adobe knew that Figma was going to kick its butt if it let it continue to  grow.  And another thing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Figma's ability to succeed is effectively also like pretty impressive, right?  And then there's the other, like with this acquisition, Adobe is going to become Figma  effectively.  The other thing that I wonder about is what happens when we, you know, we have these conversations  in the context that, you know, nothing's going to change.  What happens when we move platforms and we go to, you know, augmented reality, for instance,  like the people who are building the operating systems and the hardware for augmented reality  right now, you know, we don't know who is going to win that.  And that can, again, just like we move from desktop to mobile and, you know, even, you  know, downloaded to the cloud, you know, that could also throw things.

One will win because of network effects.  Don't forget Second Life's metaverse.  Second Life is still out there.

Transcript:  Exactly.  So, but let's throw another competitor in.  And again, this is where I'm hoping no one laughs, but Magic Leap, you know, their second  generation device is not bad.  Really?  And it's geared entirely towards enterprises.  So I think that...  They've got a big capital overhang though.  I mean, I think...  They have a lot of money they owe to VCs, but when you go to the shifts, always openings  for competitors.  Sorry, Court, go ahead.

Start time: 2194.42
End time: 2215.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I think that the...  Starting for the end of working backwards, I think there's a good case to be made that  the metaverse, if it ever succeeds, won't be for entertainment.  If for no other reason than walking around with a brick on your face is an invitation  for someone to come up and kick you in the ass.  So I could see why it would only be used by people who are like sitting comfortably in  an office.

Start time: 2215.68

Transcript:  But what about augmented reality where you're kind of...

Start time: 2217.55
End time: 2334.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe.  But I don't want to get too caught up in there.  I think that the Figma story is really interesting, that what you see is exactly what I'm describing  where there are elements of PSD that were not...  Which is the Photoshop document file format that were not within this containment vessel.  And so Figma was able to make feature compatible Photoshop replacement that could read and  write your Photoshop files.  That was key, right?  Because people have a lot invested in their existing Photoshop files.  They can't just abandon them.  They need to be able to open them and read them.  PSD was reverse engineered, and that's why you can read it in the GIMP, and it's why  you can read it in other programs and so on.  But their response was to use their access to the capital markets to snuff out a competitor  before it could grow to become a significant and meaningful business all on its own.  And so we're left with this kind of tautology, which is that if the capital markets will  give you enough money to buy a company, you must be the best person to run it.  And the way that we can tell you're the best person to run it is you have enough money  to buy it.  Going back to the Google Graveyard, it's pretty clear that there are lots of people who in  the capital markets will entrust with the money to buy a nascent competitor who either  treat that as a predatory acquisition and snuff it out or who are just not qualified  to run it.  We were making jokes about the Flickr URL at the beginning of the show before we went  on the air.  Flickr was the first service that had mobile photos, right?  Years before Instagram, Yahoo bought it and then it became a plaything that was dueled  over among the various, you know, venal princelings of the Yahoo empire.  And it suffered and fell into like, you know, neglect.  And now it belongs to smug mug who are gradually digging out more than, you know, decades of  technology debt.  But it was, you know, catastrophic to be acquired.

Start time: 2334.94
End time: 2355.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Don't you think that if a company gets acquired and then ruined, that opens up the door for  another company to come and compete?  So for instance, you know, Figma is not the Adobe isn't killing the cloud developer design,  you know, there's a lot of competition.  The idea of Penn Pot, which is an open source version, just raised like 20 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 2357.04
End time: 2379.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So exactly.  So this is my point.  So if Adobe kills Figma, can't Penn Pot come in and start to compete?  Of course, there is always the risk when you do M&A that you're going to end up killing  innovation, but it's not the end of the story.  The story continues.  If you mess something up, you can, oh, you are going to open it up to competition.  And if there is a need in the market for this thing to be built, it will be built.

Transcript:  Well, but you get things like these.  So there's a great efflorescence of RSS readers at one point and Google decided to launch  its own reader.  And that created what venture capitalists call the kill zone around RSS readers.  They wanted to back them because there was something that was priced at a cross subsidized  from another business at a price that was so low, free, that there was no way to compete  with it.  And as a consequence, we saw, you know, a decade of neglect, which would have been fine  if Google had not then killed Reader.  But Reader's never recovered, right?  That was the end of RSS effectively.  It's now this kind of rump.  I was actually just in New York doing a book event that Neil Patel, who's the editor in  chief of The Verge was hosting.  And The Verge's new redesign is amazing.  And one of the cool things about it is it has a feed of articles that people in The  Verge's newsroom think are cool.  That's there on the front door of The Verge's new redesign.  And I said, where can I get an RSS for that?  And he was like, we discussed it and thought nobody would want to see RSS.

Okay, maybe I'm wrong here.  But I do think that the tech world ended up building a replacement for RSS.  And that was Twitter.  And that the person who built Google Reader ended up going and working with Twitter for  a while.  And he ended up, unfortunately, building the retweet button, which I think is a source  of a lot of the negative effects of social media.  So it's a mixed bag.  But also the market did come in and say here is another way that you can get your stories  via a feed.  And that was Twitter.  Reddit also has some of that.

I remember, I'll be honest, I wasn't really into RSS readers.  And then Google killed Reader and I saw the outpouring of all this anguish and said, oh,  I got to try that.  And so I downloaded or set up an account on something called the old reader.  And that was...  I still use RSS.

We're going to take a little break.  I have to take a break.  Hold on, Alex.  Otherwise we'll be here a little eight or nine or ten.  On your time, that's like three in the morning.  So Alex Kantrowitz is here.  The Big Tech, Big Technology podcast, technology.substack.com.  I didn't think of it this way.  I didn't intend it this way.  But you're not here to defend Big Tech, so don't feel like you have to.  Especially when you've got Cory Doctorow on, the author of the latest Choke Point, Capitalism,  which is absolutely an indictment of not just Big Tech, but big business in general.  You point out in the book, and I think it's by the way, a great read, highly recommended  that it's not just tech.  It's publishing.  It's the record in business.  It's the live concert business.  Every business there is out there.  In fact, we've got a story we'll talk about in a little bit about the podcasting business  as well is becoming Big Tech.  I'm not a part of that, unfortunately.  We'll have more in just a bit.  Our show today brought to you by Nureva.  Nureva's great audio simplifies today's IT pros.  Yeah, kind of in a tough spot.  Now we're doing this hybrid thing, right?  Hybrid working and learning means you have to equip and support more spaces with audio  and video conferencing systems because you've got people in the office, you've got people  elsewhere, they are all working together.  Your IT department's still got to do network security, which is a big issue these days.  Of course, you're shifting to cloud-based solutions.  You've got infrastructure issues, product shortages and delays.  Add that on top.  So here's a product customers will love that requires minimal effort from IT to deploy  and manage at scale with a bonus of requiring zero end user training, but it solves a big  problem in hybrid work.  When it comes to audio conferencing in larger spaces, it's very common to be faced with  complex and expensive multi-component systems.  You've got to bring in people to design them and install them and then they've got to continue  to maintain them and update them and manage them.  Nureva is the opposite.  Great audio simplifies.  It's changed by offering solutions that deliver a high level of simplicity.  With Nureva, you put in what looks like a sound bar that gives you full room mic pickup.  If you've got a really big room, put in a couple.  If you've got a regular size room, put in one.  It's a sound bar.  It's got speakers, it's got microphones and it uses Nureva's patented microphone mist  technology to in effect fill the space with microphones.  And so easy to install.  You could do it.  You don't even have to call the IT department.  Install Nureva system in less than 30 minutes, maybe an hour if you've got a giant room.  It's simple.  You don't have to configure it.  You don't have to tweak it.  It's so much less expensive and so much easier than those traditional systems that could  take your room offline for days.  In fact, you could start right now, get a Nureva system, install it, be ready for your  very next meeting.  With Nureva, you can monitor, manage, update and adjust all the systems.  No matter how many rooms with a powerful cloud-based platform, Nureva console, IT doesn't even  have to walk down the hall.  Nureva is very scalable.  They can bring their simplicity to large organizations too.  Nureva systems, N-U-R-E-V-A, they cost a fraction of traditional systems, give you a better  result, solves this problem of people in the office and people elsewhere trying to meet  and work together.  Great audio is so important to that.  Check it out, nureva.com slash twit, N-U-R-E-V-A, nureva.com slash twit.  This is a solution.

UFC closed its fight card at the Apex, a facility it owns in Vegas to the press and the public.  They wouldn't say initially who did it, but an MMA insider, Ariel Hawani said a very good  close, close to the event had told him it had something to do with Mark Zuckerberg.  Speculation is Mark's written out the event maybe just so they could watch.  Maybe they could record it for the metaverse.  Maybe Mark's going to get into the octagon.  I don't know.  Wouldn't put it past him.

Transcript:  It was just Mark Zuckerberg and his cronies watching, smoking those meats.  There's this amazing reaction gif of his wife, Priscilla, just kind of losing her mind as  the fight goes on.  But I think the more telling thing is that there were all the UFC fighters who were talking  about how awful it was that the entire fight could be bought out by one person.  I think that that's spot on.  I don't know what Mark Zuckerberg is trying to do there.  You've got enough money.  What could you buy?  Yeah, of course.  But just the optics, be the act itself, I find fairly wrong.  Watch is a game for the people.  I can't really see any justification for wanting to buy the entire seating and then leave the  public out of it.  If you want to go watch a fight, go watch a fight, but don't buy it out.

It's not like Penn and Teller are really well known in the UK.  Nevertheless, he couldn't get through a 40-minute meal without being interrupted three times.

No, I responded and kind of struck up a friendship.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  He's the only person who's that famous that I've ever spent time with.  It really, he can eat.  I bet now he can't now that murders in the building is big.  I bet you it's actually gotten worse for him again.  But he very famously stopped doing stadium comedy because he said, it's not a show anymore.  It's like the zoo.  It's like, he talks about it in Born Standing Up in his book.  I think he really didn't like that level of fame, but once you get there, there's no turning  back.  Here's Mark, by the way, practicing.

Transcript:  You know what's fun?  We are now thanks to the ongoing action between Twitter and Elon Musk in the Delaware Court  of Chancery privy to the fascinating texts going back and forth between Elon and other  wealthy individuals during his attempt to purchase Twitter.  And I like the I think it was the Atlantic's take on it that it just shows you these guys  are as stupid as you might even imagine.  They Elon Musk's texts shatter the myth of the text tech genius.  This is Charlie Wartzel writing the world's richest man has some embarrassing friends,  a number of whom have been on this show, including Jason Calacanis, who volunteered to run Twitter  for Elon.  And then at one point said, I, you know, let me ask my, you know, I'll ask around.  I remember he did this.  He asked around and said, anybody want to invest, you know, put some money into Musk's  acquisition.  I can I can help.  Wartzel writes few and Musk's phone appeared as excitable as the angel investor, Jason  Calacanis, who peppered his friend with flattery and random ideas for the service.  In the span of 30 minutes, Calacanis suggested a five point plan for Twitter that would introduce  a membership tier creator revenue splits, algorithmic transparency and changes to the  company's operation.  After pledging his loyalty, you have my sword.  He texted Musk.  Calacanis pushed new ideas for weeks, for weeks.  Imagine we asked Justin Beaver, not Beaver, Beaver to come back and let him DM his fans.  He could sell a million in merchandise or tickets.  Install it would be insane.  Finally Musk says, sends a message back.  Morgan Stanley and Jared think you are using our friendship, not in a good way.  This makes it seem like I'm desperate.  Please stop.  Poor old Jason.  Only ever want to support you.  Elon, love you, man.

Transcript:  So I wrote about this today.  I just put the link in the IRC.  I wrote about this today for my column on medium.  And I think that the way to understand how this works is that it's, to be an innovator  is not to have a unique genius, it's to have good timing.  If you scroll down a little there, Leo, you'll see these two diagrams I have about what it  takes to invent the helicopter.  So for 500 years, people invented helicopters, right?  They were like, oh, I've seen a screw press and I've seen a maple key.  I've invented the helicopter.  But it wasn't until someone else had invented, you know, oil, internal combustion, that you  could, you could get a helicopter.  And you know, Kevin Kelly calls us the adjacent possible.  And this is why, like when it's railroading time, you get railroads and why like six people  invented the radio within, you know, a year or so on.

Transcript:  Yeah.  And so these guys, you know, they had a, they had a good idea.  They were not unique in having that good idea.  But what they did have was access to the capital markets after, after edging out other people,  after getting a little bit of advantage that they could use to, you know, buy other, other  people's good ideas, to suppress good ideas before they could take hold independently  by, by buying out rivals or by using predatory pricing, all of that other stuff.  And so what you end up with is people who are just sort of mediocre donkeys, no better  than you or me.  You know, I'm not claiming to be better than any of these people, but they're, you know,  they're not better than me either.  And no one should put me in charge of the lives of a hundred million Twitter users or  three billion Facebook users.  And you know, like the, I think we often focus too much on whether these people have the  right stuff for that job and not enough on whether that job should exist.

When in fact, maybe they didn't earn that sobriquet.  Maybe they, maybe they're just the right person at the right time.  That's what you're saying.

You must be a short seller, man.  They're in my mentions.  Yeah.  Who is paying you to write this?  And so on and so on.  Palantir should absolutely run the NHS.  I've actually, I did a thread.

And they're trying to leverage it to this big 360 odd million, but 20, 20 million pound  contract for the NHS.  And they're pretty clear that no one is going to, no one is going to green like that because  they're Palantir.  And so their new strategy is they're buying all the companies that have NHS contracts.

So for people who don't know, I'm sure most people know Palantir is, is basically a surveillance  system much like the Palantir in the Lord of the Rings, an eye of Sauron that collects  data and then sells it to who?  Governments, law enforcement.  Are they a data broker?  Is that, I mean, are they, I mean, is it that to down market?

Transcript:  I was just going to say there's a there's an amazing proposal in the offing.  Ben Goldacre, who's an evidence based medicine specialist and has done a bunch of important  interventions at the kind of national level in the British health care system, like the  register of all trials and stuff that have absolutely revolutionized evidence based  medicine in the UK, did this thing called the Goldacre report.  And it's how you would build a research platform that allow you to extract insights from  the collected health records of NHS service users without violating their privacy.  And he's like, first you build an open platform that anyone can audit, anyone can use and  anyone can implement.  And then you host that platform and close it off from everyone else with the NHS data  in it. And you tell researchers, send me a query and I will run it on the platform and  send you back the data.  But you can't ever see that data.  It's owned by the public, managed by the public.  No, no, no, it's really good.  No, no, no. This is a really good idea.  This is this is this is a good like an auditable evidence.  It's private public service.

Start time: 3838.38
End time: 3847.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This reminds me of IMDB, where you get everybody to create this great database.  But it's owned by the public.  So the NHS would own it.  All right. So the NHS doesn't own it.  The NHS owns it.

Start time: 3847.20
End time: 3920.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. Yeah. And they wouldn't they wouldn't get like if Arthur Anderson built it for them  or someone, you know, PricewaterhouseCoopers built it for them.  They would have to make it open.  They'd have to put the code on GitHub.  Right. Anyone can see this code.  Anyone can audit this code.  But the service itself, the only person people with a login for it  would be the people who ran research for the NHS.  This is the only way you can keep it anonymous.  Yeah. Well, and and and and and but also productive.  Right. So if you're a private researcher at a university or pharma company  anywhere else and you're like, I want to know what happens  when these two interventions are paired, what does the data tell us?  You got to give someone this drug when they're doing this, this PT physiotherapy.  There's huge value. Something else.  Huge value. So you can then get back useful data, right?  Useful conclusions. But you never handle the data.  So the Goldacre report's really good.  And it's such a it's the opposite of the Palantir approach,  which is like we will you give us your data.  We'll apply our magic proprietary stuff that no one is allowed to know about.  And then we'll tell you what's in your data.  We'll tell you what you know, we'll tell the LAPD  where to go and do stop and frisks, which is, you know,  like by an incredible coincidence that none of us could have predicted  neighborhoods where a lot of brown people live.

Transcript:  I think that we need to understand that this is a consulting company,  not a data company.  And, you know, they're they're more in line with Deloitte  than they are in line with any like cloud services provider.  It's the analytics that they sell.  Well, they sell the consulting.  You know, they talk about the analytics.  They're they're sort of a dressed up consulting company.  And my take is that we're going to end up seeing that, you know,  they might be a meme stock today, but we will see the company end up  in overtime, you know, being worth, you know, what they should be worth,  which is a lot less.  And I think their worth is largely inflated through to the government  connections that they have actually in the Elon text.  There was something really interesting about Joe Lonsdale, making  who is the Palantir co-founder, you know, hanging out with, you know,  100 Republican congressmen.  We all know about Peter Thiel.  So, you know, those political connections help a lot.  But over time, I think we're going to see them for what they are,  which is that we shouldn't dress them up in this like, you know,  putting their special sauce on the analytics like they are.  Interesting.  And the end of the day.  That's actually a good question.  I'm not saying it's good.

Transcript:  I would say that the what it does is it identifies.  The source of the pain that artists are feeling right.  So we spent 40 years giving artists longer duration of copyright,  easier enforced copyright, stiffer penalties for copyright  and an increased scope of copyright.  The entertainment industry has grown.  It's gotten bigger.  The share of income accruing to the workers who produce the materials  that produce those profits has shrunk over the same time.  And the reason is that these firms have  between them created choke points where if you want to reach your audience,  you have to negotiate with them.  And typically, if there's another firm you can negotiate,  it's another firm that has nearly identical or actually identical terms.  And they've all converged on a set of negotiating terms that say  whatever copyright you've been given, you have to hand over to us.  And so giving creators more copyright won't help in the same way  that giving your bullied kid more lunch money won't help.  Not even if the bullies are like running a national campaign saying,  won't someone think of America's hungry children, give them more lunch money.  Right. They're just going to take whatever lunch money you give them.  And that's the first half of the book is just showing how these  monopsony stick, it's when there's a small number of buyers  who can control their sellers with this monopsony dynamic works  and how it enables tactics that range from simply unethical to just illegal.  But no one can take them on, even though they are illegal.  We document multiple hundreds of millions of dollars in wage  theft from audible creators by Amazon.  But the second half of the book are interventions that aren't  just more copyright that actually do widen out these choke points.  And, you know, we talked about one on triangulation that I really like,  which is that if you audit your royalty statements, which generally  you're contractually allowed to do, if you audit your royalty statements  in order to get the money that you find is owed to you,  the firm will generally say either you have to sue us  or if you want a voluntary settlement, you have to submit to nondisclosure.  And so we cite research from a firm that specializes in auditing  recording industry contracts. They've done tens of thousands  in all but one instance over decades.  Every accounting error they located was in favor of the label, not the artist.  This is an amazing coincidence, as I always say, it's the most  incredible localized probability storm you can imagine.  There's no other possible explanation for why all this counting errors  would would just favor the company making the royalty statement.  But if you go and you find missing money and we have a source that found  a six figure error in their favor when they audited their royalty statement,  you have to agree not to tell anyone else who's being ripped off  in the same way where they should go and look for the money  that's being stolen from them.  And there's an actual fix for this, which is relatively straightforward  because the industry is so concentrated.  All of its contracts are consummated in New York, California,  and because of Amazon, Washington State.  Contract being a matter of state regulation, you could introduce laws  at the state level that say as a matter of public policy,  non-disclosure is not enforceable when it relates to material emissions  or errors in royalty statements that negatively affect people who are owed  royalties. And then at the stroke of a pen, every artist in the world,  because all of their contracts are governed by Washington, New York  or California law, every creator in the world would suddenly have money  falling on them, more money than all of the copyright extensions  the last 40 years have ever provided.  And we just fill the back half of the book with this.  We've got like, you know, 12 or 14 of these interventions that actually,  rather than giving artists the right to feel aggrieved  that their copyright is being violated, we'll let them like buy groceries  and put braces on their kids' teeth.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's nice because you focus on artists.  Obviously, it affects everybody from Amazon warehouse workers  to burger flippers.  But, you know, we artists and I put myself in this category,  we creators want to create and they take advantage of that fact, right?  I say, fine, go ahead.  You keep you keep creating. We'll take care of the rest. Thanks.  Let's take a little break. Want to talk more?  We've got this  new journalism competition and preservation act, which,  thanks to the Ted Cruz's moving forward,  lots, lots more to talk about, including Elon Musk's robot.  We didn't we didn't even get to that yet.  But first, a word from our sponsor, Corey Doctor is here,  Alex Cantrowitz from Big Tech, Big Tech Technology podcast.  Our show today brought to you by 8 Sleep.  If I am well rested tonight, you can thank my 8 Sleep Pod Pro Cover 2.  Now they've got an even better 8 Sleep Pod Cover.  If you've got an 8 Sleep mattress or a pod cover, you already know.  That's how I found out.  Kevin Rose said, oh, you got to do this.  Amy Webb got it. Then she said, oh, you got to do this.  So finally, about a year ago, we got it.  8 Sleep is the only sleep technology that dynamically cools and heats each side of your bed.  And the reason it's sides, so your spouse can have her temperature as well  to maintain the optimal sleeping temperature for what your body needs.  Thanks to 8 Sleep, I'm getting more than half an hour, more deep sleep  every night up over up to an hour now.  It combines dynamic cooling and heating with biometric tracking.  So it's watching you as you as you sleep.  So it turns out your body kind of wants it to get cool as you go into deeper sleep.  I have my 8 Sleep set to be warm when I get in bed because it's nice and cozy  and then cool off, go into deeper and deeper sleep from REM to deep sleep  and then back up and then it warms up again in the morning.  But it'll adjust automatically or you can adjust it manually.  As cool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit, which was awesome during the hot heat wave we had this summer.  And in the winter, as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit, it monitors not only your temperature,  your movements, but also the room temperature.  Clinical data shows 8 Sleep users experience up to 19% increase in recovery,  up to 32% improvement in sleep quality, up to 34% more deep sleep.  More deep sleep makes a huge difference.  I can, you know, I just feel it the next day.  I feel like I am, you know, alive and awake and everything feels better.  My mental clarity is better.  8 Sleep just launched.  In fact, we got to get one, this new next generation pod, the pod 3, which has more sensors,  double the amount of sensors so they've got more accurate sleep and health tracking,  giving you the absolute best sleep experience on earth.  I'm still loving our pod 2 pro cover.  I'm very happy with it.  It's not magic, but it definitely feels like it.  I love the night sleep I get.  And you might need this.  More than 30% of Americans struggle with sleep.  One of the primary causes of poor sleep, feeling hot at night.  Feeling hot at night.  You don't, you don't want to be hot at night.  Go to 8sleep.com slash twit.  I'm going to get you $150 off at checkout.  Sleep cozy this fall.  8 Sleep currently ships within the US, Canada, the UK and the EU and Australia.  Some countries in the EU.  8sleep.com slash twit.  And if you go there, you'll save $150 at checkout on your pod.  Get the pod.  Trust me.  Trust me.  You'll sleep better and everybody needs a better night's sleep.  Thank you 8 Sleep for your support.  Keep me up at night.  The idea of having a humanoid robot walking around through my house.  Fortunately, it probably isn't going to be Elon Musk's robot.  Elon and Tesla have an AI event every year.  Last year, you may remember, Musk talked about his humanoid robot and brought out  a dancer in a costume to show it off.  Let me see if I can find a video of, Optimus is what he's calling it.  I think because he's a fan of the Transformers.  I don't know.

Elon wants to put these in his factories, but I think he also feels, he says it  could be transformative for civilization.  He's still a little bit behind Boston Dynamics, not exactly doing backflips or  opening doors for people, but do you really, that's the dancer from last year.  It's not doing that.  It is not doing that.

Transcript:  Chelsea Steiner at the Mary Sue had a good summation here.  Like all Musk promises, this one is vague, unimpressive and riddled with issues.  It's also wildly unrealistic to imagine that the robot will be capable enough to  replace the labor force as we know it.  Call it when Optimus can do half the moves of this superstar.  Here's the Boston Dynamics robot doing backflips, dancing.

Elon's factory already is loaded with robots, but they're the traditional giant German and  Japanese robots that could pick up a car, turn it around and put it back on the line  and so forth.  But can they automate the racism of his factories?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we should be hesitant before we discount, you know, this type of thing.  And it might not be the Muskbot, OK, which by all accounts is not a very impressive  machine.  But we are seeing real interesting advances in robotics right now.  Humanoids are not the most popular thing.  And like we've seen with AI, these things, you know, we see these breakthroughs of  research, we get we get lots of duds and then all of a sudden we type in a sentence  and the robot is drawing a picture for us or we talk to it and we have a Google  engineered, engineer fooled that it sent it.  And I think that the interesting report that no one's paying attention to, everyone  pays attention to what Musk does.  But interesting report that no one's paying attention to along this line is that  Amazon has been doing a lot of research on this.  And the other important report that no one's paying attention to along this line is  that Amazon has been trained, has been training robots to pick items out of boxes  and then, you know, end up, you know, stowing them.  So most of Amazon's workforce in the in the warehouses are people that pick stuff  out of boxes and then put them into shelves, pick them into from the shelves and put  them into crates to be shipped off.  And they're making real progress there.  And so I think this idea of like, you know, Elon's robot is easy to laugh at, but the  things that are happening in this type of robotics are very, very real.  And the fact that Musk is talking about this appearing in the warehouse, that doesn't  come out of nowhere.  And there is definitely, you know, some progress here.  And I'm not laughing.  I think that this is some serious technology to be reckoned with, you know, maybe not  coming from Elon Musk, but here today, for sure.

Transcript:  There's a there's a term out of AI research, which is a centaur, which is when you have  human AI collaboration like a chess robot and a chess player playing together to do  things that neither of them could do on their own.  But there's also this this sort of that of labor economics is this term, the reverse  centaur, which is when the body is the inconvenient meat puppet for the AI.  And Amazon are kind of the masters of that.  I'm going to paste a link into the chat of a thing I wrote about reverse centaurs and  Amazon. So that would be things like their drivers being subjected to kind of  like superhuman conditions or superhuman constraints by the by the AIs that are  monitoring them in the cars or Packers being driven to do unrealistic working  tempos in their warehouses.  And and Amazon leads the country in warehouse injuries.  And the more automated an Amazon warehouse is, the more injuries people incur.  I'll stipulate that like automation is a thing and robots are are cool and that  Amazon has every motive in the world to try to make good robots.  But I also want to sound the note of caution that a lot of what Amazon has booked to  its shareholders as profits in automation have really been ways to get people to work  in at an unsafe tempo in ways that put themselves at risk.  And in the case of their drivers, put other people at risk, other users of the road at  risk.

And the the minute he's on the clock for Amazon, there are very clear, almost  unachievable metrics for his performance.  And they're made very clear.  And it is a very different experience.  It's kind of you nailed it.  It's you are you are at the mercy of the machine.

Start time: 4935.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. We've seen this with the explosion thanks to stable diffusion and Dolly 2 and  mid-journey. I mean, just explosion in AI art.  Do you think, though, you know, initially my initial reaction was this is like a  Cambrian explosion, like suddenly this is taken off and we've reached the hockey stick  with AI in some interesting way.  And now more and more I'm thinking it's a parlor trick that the the AI is just  it's not really AI almost.  It's just combining images together in an interesting way.  What's your take on it, Alex?  I have you tried Dolly before.  Yeah, no, it's very impressive and stable diffusion and mid-journey.  Yeah, they're very stable.  The fusion seems to be the fastest moving because it's open source.  People can run it on their own servers.  And there are a lot of people who've adopted it.  I follow the stable diffusion Reddit subreddit and it's pretty amazing what they're  doing. And yet I'm not I'm not convinced it's I don't know.  Is it AI? Is it true AI?

Start time: 5000.38
End time: 5056.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course. Yeah. And the images are going to be as creative as, you know, the prompts  that you're going to write them. I don't think we've had anything like this to, you  know, in our history before.  And, you know, there's there's so many interesting applications.  Here's one I think that anyone who's worked with a marketing department, you know, knows  that it's always a struggle to communicate to the creative department what you need them  to create or what you'd like them to create, because words are imprecise and art, you  know, pictures worth a thousand words.  So you can't just be like, I need a picture of this and they'll know exactly what you're  doing. Actually, that, you know, graphic designer to product manager or marketing manager  is one of the most difficult pieces of communication, I think, in the business world.  And I've been there and it's tough.  Yeah. And there are ways you get around to make this more prominent.  Or we're trying to get this message across.  We have a creative brief. Now, I think what this stuff is, the amateurs can make a version  of the image, you know, with something like Dolly and then pass it to the professionals  and then are, you know, be able to...

I mean, how serious of advance of advances we've made.  If you're if you're sitting there and typing in a sentence prompt, you know, on your  browser and the next thing you know, a machine will draw it for you.  And you're like, man, you know, like think about how far we've come.  You know, if that's your reaction, yeah, this stuff becomes unremarkable once it works  because we expect it.  And I think that's the place we are today with these programs.

Transcript:  Yeah. So it's it's I mean, I agree that that  this is a very powerful technology.  It's it's super interesting to work with.  You know, I've also been where you are trying to find art to use as reference to  give to an illustrator.  Being able to describe art is really great.  I mean, Google Image Search was was a huge phase change for that as well.  Yeah. And, you know, I I was an Imagineer for a while.  And in the Imagineering Archive, there's a room or I don't even know if it's still  there, but there's a room with bankers boxes filled with magazine clippings of  illustrations organized by theater.  And if you had to draw a water fountain, they just had a box of clipped out  illustrations of water fountains that you would ring down to archives and they would  send up a box of reference for you.  You know, so they're this this is definitely something that is making the lives of  illustrators easier, making it easier for people who aren't illustrators to talk to  people who are and say, that's what I mean when I say water fountain.  This picture here is the kind of water fountain.  I mean, not this picture over here.  And certainly like Dolly and all the other ones help there as well.  But I will say that I don't see a path from statistical inference and, you know,  deep learning networks to GAI.  I think that to say that if we do enough statistical inference, we get GAI is like  saying if we breed these horses carefully enough, we'll have a locomotive.  Right. Right.

I have looked at open AI and what it can do.  And now I'm afraid for the human race.  They're basically saying we are going to selectively breed this horse long enough  that eventually we're going to have a locomotive and then it's going to kill us all.  And it is like such obvious nonsense to me that I'm quite baffled by it.

Start time: 5277.30
End time: 5288.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what is the discontinuity?  So it's obviously horses and locomotives clear.  But this is about human cognition.  Is there something about human cognition that is unreachable?

Start time: 5289.61
End time: 5454.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  It's just not.  It's just not a human cognition is not statistical inference.  You know, we don't know exactly.  That's it entirely.  It's not. It's not.  I mean, statistical statistical inference might be a component of it.  It probably is.  But the idea that that increasing innovation in the realm of statistical inference  eventually produces human cognition is just it's it's wrong.  And, you know, there's this there's this corollary, which is the automation  unemployment corollary, right, that the looming automation unemployment crisis,  which again, I think is just like doesn't isn't right.  Like it's its foundations are wrong.  So like you look at the stories about automation unemployment, you see things  like, oh, the most popular job in America is truck driver.  And driving trucks is something that we can do with ML because we can give them a  dedicated lane on the highway and set them to following each other and basically  invent a shitty train.  But, you know, the thing is that the Bureau of Labor Statistics category for truck  driver incorporates anyone who operates a heavy goods vehicle.  So it's not the most like 16 wheeler driver is not the most popular job in America.  It is a relatively small and unimportant part of our overall economy.  Not that those people are unimportant, but like that, you know, if all of the truck  drivers were unemployed tomorrow, the change in the unemployment figures would  not be very large.  Meanwhile, we're just not getting anywhere with the self-driving cars, right?  Like that there's so much smoke and mirrors and self-driving cars.  The only ones that seem to perform at all are the ones that actually just have a  human remotely driving the car, overseeing the car.  And if those people's attention wanders, which it will inevitably, then those cars  become murder bots.  And, you know, it raises an important point, which is that we already have a lot of  human intelligence.  Like we have 8 billion humans.  We don't have enough non-human intelligence, right?  Like the capacity to be vigilant for things that happens very rarely is not a capacity  that humans mostly have.  A few people may have it, but it's not a widespread trait in our population, which is  why the TSA is really good at spotting water bottles and really bad at spotting guns  because they never see a gun, right?  But they see water bottles all day long.  Like you cannot leave neurons trained to do a pattern recognition for a pattern that  you never encounter because those neurons will be retrained to make you better at the  pattern recognition that you do all day.  Right.  And so they just forget, like you can train them to spot guns on an X-ray, but then  they'll forget not because they're lazy or whatever, but because they never see guns  on an X-ray, they see water bottles all day long.  That's interesting.

The text of the talk, they withdrew the invitation.  So I turned it into a column and it's just put it in the URL there.  But you weren't saying what they wanted you to say, Corey.  But basically I said, like, I don't think we're going to have AI driven unemployment  because even if we automate some stuff, like we're going to have to relocate every city,  20 kilometers inland over the next 300 years, that's full employment for everyone.  No matter how many robots we build, there's just like more work than we can imagine.  And they didn't like that at all.  Really?

He's not he doesn't work in machine learning.  And you speak with researchers, you speak with the tech companies, you know, they  might use marketing terms to talk about the power of their artificial intelligence.  Sundar Pichai calling it, you know, as powerful as fire.  You know, that sounds like marketing to me, but I never hear him or anybody at  Google talking about, you know, us reaching artificial general intelligence outside of  one guy, you know, who actually has an interesting story to tell.  And I did have him on my podcast.  We had an interesting conversation.  That being said, you know, he's the extreme exception and not the rule.

And, uh, he had some pretty neat interactions with Lambda.  He drew the conclusion and he was, I think, predisposed to believe that there was  going to be a, you know, general intelligence that is going to speak to him.  Um, you know, through a bot, he's like talked about it before he came out saying  he believes Lambda is, is this intelligent.

Transcript:  Look, I encourage people who are, who are on this, who want to hear.  So I had, um, Blake on this, on big technology podcast.  We'd spoke for an hour and a half about his interactions with Dolly.  I kind of thought it was pretty interesting, you know, to hear from his perspective.  Yeah.  Um, talking about how the bot, you know, hired a lawyer.  This again goes to like my, my comment before about how far we've come, that if  the technology can now fool Google and engineer into thinking it's sentient, then  it's probably like pretty interesting technology that we should be focusing on.  You know, what it can do, the dangers of it, et cetera, et cetera.  And I do think that often these, these conversations about is it sentient or not,  you know, kind of take our eye off the ball on, on that front.  And then I also had a Gary Marcus on, um, who also like, well, anyway, I had Gary  Marcus on who's, uh, he called it, um, something like, like foolishness on  stilts or something like that nonsense.  And we talked through all the other, you know, uh, counter arguments to Blake, but.  Yeah.  It's look, I think the one thing that we can say is we're in a very interesting  moment in technology where research is moving forward and the practical uses of  the stuff that is being developed and is being developed moving forward.  Is it pointless to speculate about general AI though?

You know, is Mark Zuckerberg going to be in the ring?  You know, but I don't think that is, you know, there's, there's practical and then  there's just enjoyable, like we all love to have our minds wander.  This is why this is such a big part of science fiction, you know, to think  about where it could go, but like this, um, you know, the idea that it's, it's,  you know, it's coming, it's here and we better get ready to make our robot  friends pretty quickly.

He's the guy who built a self-driving car and then surrounded it in a circle of  salt that it thought was a road, uh, marking that couldn't cross.  He's also the guy who did the research that, uh, found that, uh, YouTube kids  was full of all these weird semi-automated.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he wrote this book called ways of being that's about, um, extending, um, um,  a view of personhood to the inanimate, to, uh, regular software, to machine  learning and so on that makes quite an interesting case for it.  I just, uh, just pasted a link to my, um, review of the book into the chat there.  Uh, he is a fascinating guy and you know, he, he makes a great case for the idea  that the fact that something isn't on, isn't intelligent does not mean that we  shouldn't think of it as a person.

So whatever it is you respect least in the world, however much  respect you afford that.  That's how little respect you will treat anyone else with.  You'll never treat them with less respect than that.  And so if you raise the floor for how much respect you afford to the  thing you respect least, then you end up raising the amount of respect you  bring to everything else in the world.  I like that.

Transcript:  There you go.  I think how to get the dog here out of the disc, right?  Was a pretty good title, but that's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, show today brought to you by podium, you know, text messaging works.  Uh, if you want to reach Elon Musk.  Text, text him.  Well, it turns out businesses can use text messaging to stay in touch with their  customers.  And this is, this is came at a very welcome time.  It's been a tough couple of years for small businesses, you know, you know,  supply chain issues, COVID, uh, but one of the things I think we learned from  COVID, uh, is that staying in touch with customers via text is kind of the way  they prefer to communicate.  You know, your food is ready.  Come pick it up.  Your groceries are ready.  Come pick it up.  Uh, a lot of us don't want to use the phone to call a business, whether  plumber, landscaper, we don't want to play phone tag.  Maybe we'd prefer to leave a quick message, but if you're running a business,  you can take advantage of that.  If the only way to reach you is with a phone number, people are actually going  to turn their back.  You're going to walk away from you.  But if that phone number can be texted, or you could have on your website, a  widget that says, send me a text, or you can use text messaging to reach out to  customers.  For instance, when I, uh, every time I, uh, uh, leave my dentist now, I get a  text message saying rate, rate us on, uh, on Yelp or Google business.  Um, there's an ice cream shop in town that uses Podium every three or four  weeks, it says, oh, we haven't seen you in a while.  Here's a coupon for ice cream.  No, but it really works.  Gets me in the door.  Podium gives businesses the tools to compete with a convenience offered by  bigger businesses like Amazon.  So this is really a boon for the small business from healthcare providers like  my dentist to plumbers, over a hundred thousand businesses are texting with  customers using Podium.  Customers love the convenience, but business, you will love the results.  One car dealer sold a $50,000 truck and four text messages.  Uh, in fact, that's really, that's the only way I want to interact these days  with my, uh, my, my dealership, right?  In fact, I just got a text cause I'm bringing the car in tomorrow.  To confirm a jeweler sold a $5,000 rig, coordinated curbside pickups,  did it all in text.  A dentist who had gotten really behind on his collections, decided to use text  messages, 70% of the outstanding collections came in in two weeks.  It's just easier for people.  It's not that they didn't want to pay them.  It just, it was convenient.  It was easy.  It was fast with Podiums all in one inbox.  You can do more than just chat.  You can get online reviews, just send a link that works so much better.  Collect payments right through Podium from anywhere.  You could send marketing campaigns and actually get a response.  It's just a quick text and your staff will love it too, because all the  communications down from your customers come into one inbox, makes it easy for  you to keep track of what's going on with any given customer.  I want you to try Podium.  It's really cool.  See how Podium can grow your business.  There's a great demo video at podium.com slash twit and a pretty good deal too.  P O D I U M dot com slash twit.  Podium let's grow podium.com slash twit.  Let's grow.  Let's go.  Let's grow.  The ultimate text messaging platform.  Thank you.  Podium.  You actually, Alex had a, a good piece about the judge in the court of  chancery that Elon Musk is going to be facing.  Uh, this is coming up October 17th.  And, uh, you did a profile of Kathleen McCormick.  Who is she?  And, and, and is this good for Elon or bad?

Start time: 6451.50
End time: 6561.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's a fascinating character.  And I would say it's largely bad for Elon that she's going to be there.  So, um, just to give a little context as to who she is, she grew up in Delaware.  Um, she was the daughter of two public school teachers.  Her dad, uh, coached football.  You know, her mom eventually rose to become an administrator, both duties  they did in addition to the teaching.  Um, she is the first person from her town, uh, Smyrna, which is a middle  class town in Delaware, um, to go to Harvard.  Uh, and you know, I think she's going to go back into education, gets  involved in a legal nonprofit.  Starts to see how the law could be used for good.  It goes to Notre Dame.  Cause I think because her dad was a massive Notre Dame fan.  Um, and, uh, and gets a law degree there working on human civil rights.  Um, actually, uh, takes a job at a nonprofit and goes to argue in front  of the court and private practice and eventually becomes, uh, you know,  a vice chancellor and then from there, she becomes the first female  chancellor of the court in 229 years in its entire history.  Um, and she has this very interesting ruling as vice chancellor where, you  know, these, these, these two private equity companies, one sells this cake  decorating company to the other and then COVID hits, and then they're like, well,  listen, no one's going to want to decorate cakes anymore.  The buyer said that and they said, okay, we're not going to, um, buy this company  anymore and the seller sued them and it lands in front of vice chancellor McCormick.  And she basically says like, look, you signed a deal and I'm the judge.  And most important for me is deal certainty.  And, uh, that's what our job is here is to make sure that when you agree to a  deal, the deal goes through and she forced that cake deal, cake decorating  deal through.

Half a billion in a decade.  Wow.  Not, not bad.  So, you know, this one is much bigger, $44 billion.  Um, and I just don't think the size of the deal is going to come in.  Everything I know about her doesn't lead me to believe that the size of the deal  or the court's ability to enforce is going to come into the ruling that she's  going to give now.  Now the question is, you know, what happens with this whistleblower testimony  which I think can throw a wrench in Twitter's ability to force it to close.  But Elon did sign the deal saying that he was going to buy it.  And if you look at the past precedent of this judge, it will lead you to believe  that, you know, she'll make it go through all things being equal.  So very interesting person.

Start time: 6629.20
End time: 6658.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It might be a scary proposition.  I'm not sure I want Elon Musk to own Twitter to be honest.  Well, neither does Elon.  Yeah.  I feel like he should do something to make Twitter whole.  I mean, this whole drama has cost Twitter staff a lot of upset, probably a lot of  money.  Um, Elon, uh, you know, was pretty flippant in the whole thing.  So I feel like he dessert.  He needs to be somehow chastened, but boy, I'm not sure I want him to be forced to  buy Twitter.

Start time: 6659.64
End time: 6707.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that, that won't come into consideration.  No, that's not a consideration.  It's just a, it's a contractual matter.  That's interesting.  And then, okay, then you get into, okay.  So maybe they said, well, how much will Elon need to pay Twitter and make it whole?  Has to be, you know, $20 billion, something in that range.  Yeah.  Because you look at Facebook, right?  Which is maybe an analog, which is whose stock has gone down.  I don't know, 57, 60% this year.  And without, without Musk, you know, Twitter stock would probably fall, fall by  that same amount.  So, um, and now they're going to really struggle to operate.  Their CEO has like very little credibility inside the company and everyone's leaving.  Yeah.  So what's it going to take?  It might end up having to, it might end up being, and I've always thought, okay,  very little chance this deal actually goes through.  Now I'm like, well, maybe, maybe there is a chance.

Start time: 6707.74
End time: 6718.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the markets might agree with you because the stock price has been slowly  ratcheting up, not 50, 420 as Elon promised to pay, but it's been going up.  Uh, and I, it might be a bargain.

End time: 6786.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

If that takes a hit, that myth, um, look, he's a great businessman.  He's built some amazing companies, no doubt about that.  Um, but if he makes a very stupid mistake, uh, and this might end up proving to be one,  you know, that could really cause an impact to his other businesses.  Yeah.

Uh, what about, what do you think about the journalism competition and preservation  act, uh, Amy Klobuchar's, uh, bill, which was initially, uh, blocked by Ted Cruz.  Cruz, uh, last week changed his mind and allowed it through.  And it has advanced at a committee with a 15 to seven vote.  The seven were Republicans, uh, voting against it, but, uh, there were enough  Republicans voting for it that it went through.  Uh, Ted Cruz says, I think this amendment protects against this antitrust liability  being used as a shield for censorship.  Big tech hates this bill.  That to me is a strong positive for supporting it.  There are a number of problems with this bill, including this thing called the  first amendment to the constitution.  Um, I'm not sure if it'll ever get to a vote on the Senate floor,  but it is at a committee.  Should I be worried, uh, Alex?  Cause I could see a lot of problems with this thing.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Now here's my, I'm going to go out on a limb here also.  I don't know what's in the water this week, but Hey, let's go for it.  Do it, man.  Do I, I think that publishers trying to make their livelihood over negotiating  with Facebook and Google are playing losing game.  Yes.  Um, I don't think you can depend on a platform for your dis I mean, yeah, I  don't think you could depend on a platform with algorithms and a newsfeed  for your distribution.  I don't think you should wonder about a platform like Google that's sending  you traffic, um, you know, how much they should pay you for displaying the link.  I think that's a net benefit, you know, to publishers and my, I run a small  media company and we don't depend at all on, um, you know, Facebook  traffic or Google traffic.  And so, and I think it's better that way because we make the decisions, you  know, for the reader, not for the platform.  Um, and so ultimately like, I think that having this right to negotiate is good.  Um, but do I think that it's like an earth shattering, uh, thing?  No, especially given that Facebook has made a real effort to reduce news  links in the newsfeed, um, where they used to be a big portion of what  was going on on Facebook.  Now they're getting close to non-existent.  And I think that's largely good.  I don't think we should get our news through Facebook.  I think we should find other ways to do it.

And, uh, there's the argument that it's somewhat worked in, uh, in Australia,  uh, despite Facebook's retaliatory attempt for a while.  Facebook said, well, no more news links for you.  Uh, there's also the concern though, that, uh, it doesn't apply to anybody  who employs more than 1500 people.  And there's some concern that in order to, to make this work, uh, uh, private  equity will go around buying newsrooms and cut it down to 1499 people.

Transcript:  Corey, you've pointed out that, that, you know, journalism has definitely suffered.  And actually you have a whole chapter talking about, uh, Craigslist versus  Google links, uh, and which is the most damaging, uh, to, uh, to, uh, news.

Start time: 7204.73
End time: 7492.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I, I think that the problem with this solution is that it  misunderstands what it is technology did to news.  So it's definitely true that, um, Craigslist, uh, made a more efficient  way of doing classified advertising than the newspapers had, but there's a  reason that Craigslist was better for classified advertising.  It wasn't just a different cost basis.  It's that in the run up to the Craigslist era, the web, I don't know if he's 1.5,  web 1.5, something like that.  Uh, and the run up to that, there was a series of media rollups right after the  telecommunications act in the Clinton years, um, that allowed, uh, radio  stations and TV stations and newspapers in a single market to all come under  common ownership and also for there to be more cross market ownership.  And you saw lots and lots of regional local newspapers coming under a single  owner, uh, large corporate owners, as opposed to the historic basis for news,  which was, you know, outside of the big cities, the historic basis for news was  you had like a patrician family who owned the newspaper, who mostly ran it as a  business to allow, uh, appliance manufacturer or appliance retailers and  grocers to reach people who are interested in the sports scores and, uh,  you know, in between some of that money was peeled off to send a college kid to  the town meeting, uh, to write down what people were saying and whatever  controversy there was.  And those papers were, were mostly rolled up into these big corporate,  uh, national organizations.  And, um, one of the ways that the new owners tried to justify those  rollups was in part by trimming.  Um, they trimmed a lot of the regional sales force.  And so the local shoe leather sales force who knew how to sell classified ads to  local merchants were replaced by centralized call rooms, uh, where you  would just call Chicago or New York or whatever, when you, or, or somewhere in  the Midwest, when you wanted to place an ad in the newspaper down the road.  Um, another way that they realized, uh, new efficiencies was by selling off  buildings, physical plant, uh, and outsourcing core functions, which exposed  them to a bunch of shocks, like rent shocks and, uh, other shocks, interest  rate shocks and so on, where, where suddenly when things got bad, it got  worse, right?  Because when things got bad, suddenly their rent might go up or the cost of  leasing, their presses might go up and then they would be really exposed.  And so you had this industry that had already weathered so  many technological shocks, right?  The newspapers survived the telegraph, radio, the television, cable, satellite.  And suddenly they were uniquely vulnerable to Craig Newmark, who is a  lovely guy and very smart and who did something really cool, but was not, I  think, intrinsically more disruptive to their business than cable television.  And the reason was that they had made themselves vulnerable.  So that's one of the things that's, that's hurt the newspapers, right?  Is that, is this combination of consolidated ownership and changes in the  technology, but the other thing that's really hurt them and that is not addressed  in this bill at all is fraud in the ad markets.  So the ad duopoly Facebook and Google have now there's a pretty strong  evidentiary basis to say that they steal from publishers.  At the operation Jedi blue or project Jedi blue, which was disclosed in the  Texas AG case against Facebook shows that the senior management team of Facebook  and Google sat down and illegally colluded to rig the ad market so that  publishers would get less and advertisers would pay more you add to that other  forms of fraud, like the pivot to video, which was based on lies about how many  people were watching videos, which costs the newsrooms of the country and around  the world, you know, billions in aggregate and made them even more vulnerable.  And you have this thing where, where you have, um, tech platforms that are stealing  money from, uh, news organizations and we're acting like the problem is that  they're stealing content from news organizations and allowing your users to  talk about the news or providing links to the news so people can talk about it.  Is not stealing the news.  If it's a secret, it's not the news, right?  The thing that it makes it the news is that we talk about it, but  stealing your ad money is an actual problem that we can put our fingers on  and that we can actually put our hands around and we could say, all right, we're  going to have transparency rights.  We're going to follow the model of Sarbanes-Oxley and create individual  criminal liability for executives who knowingly sign or produce false, uh,  um, reports on financials, you know, like things that actually address themselves  to the problem instead of trying to take something off to one side, which is, you  know, creating a stream of payments based on the bizarre idea that you should pay  to link to the news or let your users talk about the news instead of unrolling  that the fraud, which, which is a thing that would benefit all kinds of creators,  including newsrooms, but also individuals and so on.

Transcript:  Here's another, uh, great story about fraud in the ad world.  And it has to do with podcasts.  And, uh, this is this story that's going to get me fired from my employer, uh,  the I heart, the fabulous I heart media corporation, according to Bloomberg  podcasters have been buying ads in mobile games, uh, that when you click on  the ad downloads, the podcast, every time a player taps on one of these  fleeting in-game ads and you get some virtual loot for doing it, a podcast  episode in the background begins downloading, which means the podcast  company can claim the gamer as a listener and add a download to its overall tally.  You, you might think, well, how, how big a deal can that be?  Uh, obviously those person people are not listening.  Uh, they don't even know in many, most cases that they downloaded the podcast.  Uh, it just, it goes out into the S K explained to me, it goes into the ether.  It doesn't, the, the bit bucket doesn't even get saved onto your, uh, under your  phone, uh, one game referenced in this paper, this, the study came from a  company called deep C S E E.  Uh, Bloomberg's writing about it.  Uh, one company, uh, a popular mobile app from a cyber was called subway surfers.  If you played it downloaded 3 billion times since it came out 10 years ago.  Over a period of two weeks in August, Bloomberg found multiple publishers using  the game to rack up podcast downloads.  Uh, including, I'm sad to say I heart, uh, media, which, uh, is, uh, is, is my  employer for the radio show.  Uh, I heart media.  Apparently it was one of the number one users of, uh, this, um, uh, and they  shelled out more than $10 million gained 6 million unique listeners a month.  And they've been doing it since 2018.  I always, you know, it's funny because we don't lie about our numbers.  Uh, in fact, if anything, we're conservative about our numbers.  Uh, and I always was puzzled when I see numbers from some of these big  podcast companies, like really you get 40 million downloads a month release.  Well, now we know, um, they don't, they don't.  This is a, and this is, this is just one more example of the, of the click  fraud that you were talking about, Corey.  Um, yeah, I mean, apps, because they're so opaque are a natural

Start time: 7676.90
End time: 7762.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  environment for this stuff.  Yeah.  You know, you do have to get through the app store heuristics and analytics, but  if you can smuggle something through the platforms by design, don't let users  closely monitor how the apps themselves are working.  Like, you know, you, it's Apple famously sued a company that made a VM that you  could run iOS apps in that would allow you to do like really deep, deep, deep  forensics on it.  Um, you know, because they, they, they don't want you to think of this as  software that you can like stick your own controls on.  I saw you had an hour rundown for today, something a little later on about the  OG app, which is, I understand it is a very similar kind of thing to, to, um,  in terms of allowing users to gain more control in that it kind of acts as an  overlay to your social media and then loads the feed that the social media  company wants to send you, but throws away the ads.  And, you know, this is, uh, Apple chucked it out of the app store and, and  this is the point, right?  It's to be able to exercise control so that when your interests diverge from  the app store's interest, their interest comes first and that produces this  space in which all this mischief can take place because as soon as you design  computers to treat their owners as adversaries, right?  Adversaries, the manufacturer, then you make design decisions that are  necessarily increase their opacity.  Well, there's a lot.  One of the reasons OG app exists is because there's a lot of dissatisfaction

Transcript:  with what Metta has decided to do with Instagram, which is essentially, uh,  take it from a very lovely site where you could share photos with your friends  and family and turn it into tick tock because that's the flavor of the month.  The OG app eliminated ads.  That was probably part of the problem from Metta's point of view, but all  the other things that you can do to make it work.  Part of the problem from Metta's point of view, but also eliminated everything,  all the algorithmic recommendations turn it.  Frankly, I loved it.  It turned my Instagram back into my Instagram like it used to be.  Uh, it immediately caused problems.  If one of the first things Instagram, uh, did, uh, after I installed the OG app,  I recommended on Macbreak weekly on Tuesday, it's gone today by the way.  One of the reasons I recommend, I, uh, recommended it and liked it was, uh,  because it gave me my traditional Instagram.  But as soon as I went back to Instagram, Instagram said, well,  there's been a security event in your Instagram app.  Please, uh, you have to reauthenticate.  We got to make sure you are you.  Okay, fine.  But that happened every time I use the OG app.  And then of course they somehow some, somebody got Apple to pull it from  the app store, so it's gone.  Uh, I don't know if it's, I think it's still on Android.

Start time: 7835.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, Apple is a good, um, proxy for defending your interest when they're  co-terminal with Apple's interests.  Yeah.  Uh, and they do have enormous resources and very skilled personnel who do that.  But when your interests diverge from theirs, uh, and this is not unique to Apple.  This is true of all the big firms.  Facebook has an incredible security team that defends you from all kinds of threat  actors, the one threat actor that they won't defend you from is Facebook.  And Apple is the same.  So if you're a Chinese iOS user and Apple has decided that access to  Chinese consumers and Chinese manufacturing is more important than the  integrity of Chinese users, you have no recourse when they remove all the working  VPNs from the app store and add a backdoor to their cloud servers, uh, for  the Chinese state to use, because by design you can't modify and intervene.  One of the things that I think we need to understand is that the outer periphery  of how badly a firm can treat you has historically, and I think is still  determined by what you can do if you're dissatisfied, yeah, you can just leave.  And there's someone in the chat saying, if you don't like Apple, you should just  leave, well, leaving Apple causes a switching cost, right?  There's the technological cost of adjusting to something new.  There's throwing away the media that is specific to your Apple device.  There's, um, other intangible problems like, uh, losing the ability to do rich,  um, I am sessions with your fellow Apple users.  You remember, um, Tim Cook recently said, you know, if you want to share  videos and pictures with your mom, uh, you should just buy her an iPhone.  So the corollary of that is if you, uh, switch away from iOS, then you can, then  you can say goodbye to doing that kind of messaging with your mom.  So all of those switching costs have to be weighed against the benefit that you  get from going somewhere else.  And the firms understand this very intimately.  Uh, again, in the Texas AG, uh, case against Facebook, one of the documents  that was released are very frank memos between product design teams who are  saying we are going to design, for example, Facebook photos such that, um,  it is very good to use, not because we think that is something people will  value, but because we think it will lure people into adding their family photos  to Facebook and once they do, they will endure the high switching cost of  leaving behind their cherished family photos.  If they quit Facebook and go to Google plus, which was the rival they were  worried about at the time.  And, and so firms very deliberately add very high switching costs to their  products.  And one of the things that these interoperable technologies do like OG  app and like, um, VMs and, and all these other things that people build that are  part of the long history of how technology companies, including Apple and  Facebook have confronted their own competitive challenges is they allow  users to have an intermediate state between leaving the firm altogether,  leaving the service altogether and enduring those high switching costs and  enduring whatever ration of crap the firm wants to shovel down their neck.  Right.  Ad blockers are a great example.  Pop-up blockers are really good example.  You know, pop-ups were once everywhere.  The browsers added them by default, right?  They were doing adversarial interoperability with the publishers whose  content was being loaded in the browser.  Publishers stop displaying pop-ups cause advertisers stopped asking for them  cause users block them.  That is one of the mechanisms by which we make technology better is by giving  users control over their technological destiny so that firms own behavior is  limited because when they act badly, the users just take a corrective.

The bad news is the bad news is obviously like when you try to build a podcast  in an authentic real way, like you and I are doing, uh, you know, you  got to build a brick by brick.  It's tough to build them.  And so, yeah, it does screw us.  Uh, the good news, if you want to look at a silver lining, it's that podcast  ads work, they are very valuable in this business rules.  Yes.  So that's the positive note I'll give us on.  I agree with you.  Uh, you are you ad supported?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Totally ad supported.  Yeah.

Uh, or they'll say to us, well, look, I heart CPMs, their cost for a thousand  listeners, so much lower yet, cause eight million of those are fake.  We can't, it becomes hard to compete with that kind of fraud or, and, or  co-opting of the, of the market.  And, uh, you know, I think honestly, independent podcasting like you and I do  is really going to be facing an uphill battle over the next few years.

Start time: 8171.88

Transcript:  But on the other hand, yeah, I think that we renew more easily because  people see the stuff works and you know, they know it's not fraud.  And, uh, they're more inclined to spend again.  Yeah, that's good.  So ultimately if you're running a business, what you want to do, you  want to deliver for customers, create loyalty and produce a good product.  And I think that you can, you can do that in an upstanding way in this industry.  And it's worth a heck of a lot to advertisers, which is why you  see people wanting to mimic it.  Yeah.  So they should stop.  But the, the headline for me is, you know, it's good.  It's great news about podcast ads.  Yeah.  I want to get the word out to advertisers because if, you know, they, they get,

Uh, I want to give it a little bit of a plug because it makes a big difference  to our bottom line.  In fact, right now it's about 25% of our total revenue.  And that helps a lot as ads start to get harder and harder to sell.  If I think if there is a long-term future for us, it's through  something like club twit.  Now here's what you get.  Seven bucks a month, which I think is a pretty affordable dollar, uh, figure.  You get all ad free versions of our shows, all the shows ad free.  You also get access to the club twit discord, which a lot of people are  saying that's really the benefit we like.  Uh, not everybody who joins a club ends up in the discord, but a lot of  us use it and love it.  Uh, it's a place to discuss not only the shows, but you know, everything  geeks like books and comics and ham radio and hardware and Linux and music.  Uh, that discord is a lot of fun.  Here's our tick tock corner.  I guess they're talking about tick tock in there.  And of course here's the twit discussion going on right now.  And we have animated gifts, which makes it very much more fun.  Also, it's a great place to put links into other shows.  This interview I did with you, Cory, uh, on, uh, triangulation was not ad  supported, it was club supported.  That's the only way we could do it because it's a ad hoc show that, you  know, we bring in people when we want to talk to them.  And so no advertisers can buy a show where they don't know when it's on, but  the club makes it possible.  They, that's why we also do hands on Mac in the club with Micah and a hands on  windows with Paul Thurotte and our untitled Linux shows in there.  Uh, the club has really given us a chance to do a lot more interesting stuff.  We launched our new space show in there this week in space, which has since gone  public, uh, also the twit plus feed.  That's where those other shows show up seven bucks a month.  If you're interested, it really helps us.  There's a yearly, uh, membership too.  If you don't want to be nickel and dimed every month, uh, you can even get  corporate memberships.  If you want to, uh, have everybody in your company, listen, that would be good.  You can also buy individual shows for $2 and 99 cents a month, all at  twit.tv slash club twits.  And we thank you for your support.  We do have great advertisers.  Thank goodness.  Uh, because you know, it's expensive to do what we do, including policy genius.  Policy genius is, well, genius.  We pay hundreds of dollars a year to, uh, for insurance for our fire  insurance for our house, or, you know, you have to, for your car, right?  Some of us even buy insurance for our phones, the fumble fingered among us.  But how many of you are taking steps to protect your family?  You know, think about your costs to your family, mortgage payments, student costs,  um, student loans and other loans that don't disappear.  If something happens to you, a life insurance policy, it was the, when we had  kids, the first thing I did is I want to make sure my family was taken care of.  If something bad happened to me, it can provide your loved ones with a financial  cushion they can use to cover those ongoing costs.  And it gives you peace of mind to know that they're going to be protected.  Uh, having life insurance through your job.  Yeah, that's nice.  It never was enough to really solve this problem.  Like most people, it turns out need about 10 times more coverage than their jobs  offer to provide for their families.  Inflation is driving up prices for everything these days.  Life insurance rates actually down from this time last year.  And since life insurance typically gets more expensive as you age, the best time  to buy that life insurance is today.  And the best way to do it policy genius.  It's not an insurer.  They're an insurance marketplace.  So you can get quotes from all the best companies, AIG, Prudential, all of the  biggest, best companies in one place and get the lowest price on your life  insurance, which means you could save as much as 50% or even more on life  insurance, just by comparing quotes on policy genius options started $17 a month  for half a million dollars of coverage.  Of course, it's going to depend on you, your age and so forth.  That's why, but it's not getting cheaper.  So do it right now.  Click the link on our show notes or head to policygenius.com.  And you can get personalized quotes in minutes.  Find the right policy for your needs.  Now I should tell you the people you're talking to a policy genius are licensed  agents, they have to be in order to advise you about insurance.  You're buying insurance from these big companies, but policy genius is  not working for those companies.  They work for you and they're on hand through the entire process to help  you understand your options, help you make decisions with confidence.  They do not add extra fees.  They do not.  You'll be glad to know, sell your info to third parties, check  the reviews on Google trust pilot and elsewhere, thousands of five-star reviews.  People really love this service.  They have options that offer coverage in as little as a week.  Some avoid unnecessary medical exams.  30 million people have shopped for insurance at policy genius.  They've placed more than $150 billion in coverage.  And again, people love it while you're there.  Of course they do offer quotes for home, auto, pet, renters and more.  So you should check that out as well.  But I thought it was appropriate to talk about life insurance.  Cause I think so many of us, especially you younger folks, you don't think about  that, but you've got kids, you got a spouse, you've got a family, you need  that life insurance policygenius.com slash twit, get those life insurance  quotes free, there's no cost and see how much you can save policy genius.  policygenius.com slash twit.  Oh gosh, there's so many stories and so little time.  Let me see.  Before we go to talk about that story, I wanted to ask you about the  Amazon hardware event, Alex, before we go to the a 17 chip price increase.  Before all of that, let's run a quick promo for some of the things  that happened this week on Twitter.  I think you might recognize some of the people in the C-suites and the  stockholders that are really getting rich on this and the people are waking  up and we got to get there get before the guillotines go up because.  I mean, I have one over here.  No, no, no, no, previously on twit triangulation.  Corey Doctorow just co-authored a book now out called choke point capitalism.

So, um, you know, I'm, I guess I'm out on those, but something like this is,  is interesting.  However, I just don't trust Amazon with this type of thing.  So, um, you know, maybe someone can take a, uh, do the reverse route and copy  this from big tech.  And so I could use it.

Transcript:  Amazon also announced, uh, that they are going to let your Amazon  Echo act as an Eero beacon.  Amazon owns the mesh networking company, Eero.  And, uh, in a very interesting synergy, when you buy one of the new fifth  generation Amazon Echos, it can be used to extend your wifi, uh, using Eero.  Um, I have to say all of these things look like Amazon, thinly veiled attempts  at Amazon to get more sensors into your home.  Corey, are they also, any thoughts on that?

Start time: 8919.94
End time: 9026.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I think that is exactly what this is as is the, the, um, the robot Astro.  And yeah, I mean, I, I, I think that for me, this drives home the problem or the  poverty of just don't do business with them because I own some Eero's.  In fact, I own many Eero's.  Uh, I bought them before they were an Amazon company.  Uh, so if the answer to, if you don't like Amazon, don't do business with them.  Uh, if that's the answer, then what do I do when Amazon buys the company?  Right?  What do you do when Google buys Fitbit?  Um, what do you do when Facebook buys your beloved daily visit Jiffy?  Uh, you, you are, you're stuck.  Right.  And so, um, you know, it's not like I can add my own firmware.  Uh, it's not like I can untether it.  In fact, the firmware updates for the Eero's that I own have become increasingly  Amazon linked every time I get one.  I get a bunch of notices about how this is becoming less and less functional  without Alexa, they build that as it becoming more and more functional with  Alexa, but obviously these are the opposite sides of the same coin.  Um, and, uh, you know, it's, it, it, it tells you the problem with acquisition  driven growth in a market where we choose winners based on what people buy  because companies who have access to the capital markets can just buy the  companies that are successful.  You know, if the everything in your grocery store is made by Procter &  Gamble or Unilever, and if there is a local, you know, artisanal oatmeal cookie  place that takes off, one of them will buy it.  And when they do their press release, they will say, we here at Procter & Gamble  understand that our customers value choice, and that's why we bought the  company you chose to buy things from instead of us.

Transcript:  Yeah.  This is pointing to an interesting, uh, battle, uh, slightly different lens, but  interesting battle between Amazon and Apple.  And I think that Apple has largely given up in the, um, in the battle  for, for ambient computing.  Remember it sort of rolled back home pod series still is garbage.  Um, meanwhile, Amazon's going to be everywhere in your home.  That's a whole new computing lab layer.  Uh, and I think there, you know, as this stuff gets, you know, more and more  embedded in our lives, the fact that we're walking around the sensors, the fact  that, you know, you have echoes in your house, they're also mesh networks.  You can speak to it.  It will enhance your wifi.  By the way, I would like to hear what Corey thinks about this, but now they're  going to acquire Roomba or try to at least write down that they're vacuum,  you hear their vacuum.  The latest news is that the FTC is...  Elizabeth Warren doesn't like that.  And neither does the FTC.  Yeah.  So, but yeah, but anyway, I think that, I think that it's interesting and I wonder  what will happen, you know, as Apple sees, um, you know, that, uh, Amazon run away  with this screenless computing in your home and whether it then pushes Apple to  try to, you know, basically do what it's done, you know, in every other level,  which is say, we're going to do this, but we're going to do a privacy, you know,  privacy focused and whether that will work.  Um, and it's interesting battle, uh, that I'm looking at with this.  I think Apple and Amazon just inch closer and closer together, the farther,  um, you know, we, we get towards, you know, them pushing beyond the markets that they  own. And I think that's going to be a really interesting battle.  But anyway, why don't we tee up Corey on the, uh, on the Roomba question?

Transcript:  That's what I, that's the iRobot acquisition.  I mean, I think it's the same thing.  Amazon would like to know about the inside of your home and its geometry.  Uh, and they'd like to know that so that they can leverage it for parochial  advantage, like to, to make you use that or, or to make it,  to make it so that the only company that you can use that geometry with is Amazon.  Um, it is to your benefit if you own a mobile robot,  and this is the kind of thing that you're interested in to get accurate maps of  your home from that robot.  But it's not to your benefit to have that robot only allow you to take the data  that was generated by the robot that you bought,  that you charged with your electricity, going around your home, that you own a rent,  but that data not being yours to use to your maximal advantage,  that data's use is being constrained to uses that are, um,  good for the shareholders of the company that made the robot. In fact,  not even the shareholders of the company that made the robot,  the shareholders of the company that bought the company that made the robot.  I don't understand why we as the owners of that robot should feel like,  like it's our duty to make sure that those shareholders are happy.

Transcript:  Surround your Roomba with a little bit of salt and see what happens.  Talking about browser extensions and browser ad blockers,  Google had announced the evil technology in Manifest V3,  which allowed for something called the web content API was going to  be eliminated from Chrome and hence Chromium. It's open source parent.  And hence probably from many open source projects based on Chromium,  which means that ad blockers like my favorite Gore Hills,  Ublock origin would no longer work.  They require this Manifest V2 and access to the web content via  the API. Google has some good reasons to dump it.  It can slow your, it can really hit performance. If all the,  if every single extension starts asking for the content,  it can also be a privacy problem. But I think people install the Honey,  Chrome extension, really want it.  Know that Honey's watching every move they make. A lot of criticism.  Google has said we're going to delay this till 2024. This has been, by the way,  kind of a standard for Google.  They'll announce some big change to something or other. Everybody will complain.  And then Google says, Oh, well, nevermind. We're going to do topics.  We're not going to do, we're not going to do that other thing.  So I hope that this is delayed forever,  but it's just one more reason you should not use Chrome or Chromium based  browsers. Vivaldi says our ad blocker will continue to work.  We'll continue to support V2. I think Brave has its own ad blocker in there,  but I use Firefox for that reason. I think it's good to have a,  competitor to Google. And finally,  as you know, McDonald's has left Russia,  which has given rise,  I think to a number of stores that look just like McDonald's called  Tasty and that's it.  And now Russia's former Lego stores,  Lego has also left the country, have been rebranded as World of Cubes.  But as Rob Ishista points out in Boing Boing,  the Lego patent has expired.  So making a Lego clone is not hard to do.  Unclear whether they'll stick with World of Cubes.  World of Cubes pretty good. Yeah. Yeah.  Although Rob says he should have called it Eastern block.
