Transcript:  I don't you know, I was saying before the show  I don't really care about any of the stories from this week  so I think we should just wrap it up and I don't know sometimes you get weeks just hang out for an hour, yeah  maybe we should just talk about things because  Maybe it's that it's also grim  That I don't really want to talk about it now Apple Apple really has walked. This is actually we probably should talk a little bit about this  Opinions vary dramatically on it  Apple and epic of course in a big battle and then Apple got another kind of black mark  when  WordPress the founder of WordPress a good friend Matt Mullenweg where we're big fans of WordPress and automatic his company  Matt Mullenweg tweeted heads up on why our iOS app WordPress iOS  Updates have been absent. We were locked by the app store to be able to ship updates and bug fixes again  We had to commit to support in-app purchases. So the app has always been free  It's an app you use to monitor your WordPress site to post on it to check comments and things like that  It's a really good app. I use it. You also use it to log in  WordPress has free sites, but they also offer paid sites  And apparently now there's more this is a this story is an evolving story  So but this is how it started with his tweet. He says I know why this is problematic  Open to suggestions should I allow others in-app purchases? Should we have a new name?  He believed that the issue from Apple was that he had in app per  He did not have in-app purchases for the paid accounts on WordPress  Apple then responded no no, no, it was a mistake on our part. It's because  in the app you  Advertise you mention the paid accounts on wordpress.com  But you don't give users the opportunity to buy those you either need to you have two ways to go on this  You either need to offer them a way to buy an app  And of course Apple takes us 30% or you need to take any mention of the fact that you have a paid service off of the app  at which at which point  WordPress did that and  The whole thing kind of went away  but  It does raise these issues in this case. I think Apple  You know they made a mistake. Maybe they should have been this has been a constant complaint about the app store  They're not very clear about why they do what they do  Apple apologized and said you know you don't have to add  Purchases we apologize. We believe the issue with the WordPress app has been resolved  This is the quote since the developer removed the display of their service payment options from the app  It's it's now a free standalone app and does not have to offer in-app purchases  We've informed the developer and apologize for any confusion  So let me make the case for Apple and I'll let you guys shoot at me  Since Tim's not sitting here. I might as well be the Tim Cook of the panel the case is and I understand this Apple says  Look a user is using this and sees in the app  There is a paid tier but has no way to do it  We think that's a bad experience for users you either should if you're gonna tell people about it offer it or not offer it  at all  What's wrong with that Larry I

Start time: 679.88
End time: 758.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, first of all, I  Mean this is this is a big issue for me because if you look at any other platform besides mobile  At least any popular platform ie windows and Mac pretty much anybody can develop an app and put it out there and there  They're on their own right Apple had the brilliant idea of the app store. They it was a great idea  It's still a great idea. It brings them a lot of money  but in the words of of Steve Jobs, it's an orifice it, you know jobs when he when he announced the iPhone talked about the  The the telephone companies being orifices. Well Apple is an orifice in that it is the blockage  It is the way in which the only effective way in which you can get an app to run on their platform  And so there's a lot of issues this is just one of them one of monetization is one of them the other is  Their decisions to vet apps, of course  I agree with the security aspect but you know, I remember Steve Jobs saying, you know  We have one too many fart apps and you know, he's right. You don't need a lot of fart apps  But who is it of Apple to tell people, you know, how much choice they should have on a particular kind of app  So it really brings up the broader question and a question that kind of came up  When Tim Cook along with the heads of Google and Amazon and Facebook were up before Congress  But they didn't give them nearly as much of a grilling on this as I think they should have

Transcript:  I think but but I totally agree. I think well, I think I agree. I mean, I think that the the issue here  You know is that?  Apple is trying to create a better experience for its users  That's the other side of this two-sided coin, right?  They're Apple is trying to make sure it just works like when you use their devices and you use their software  It just works and so like the WordPress issue  I think I think you're right Leo that it's sort of it, you know, you come down on the side of Apple there  They're trying to improve the user experience  But it's also interesting when that story came out, right which is after the epic story  So Apple's right so Apple's reaction  Has to be is like within this context of this conversation that's been happening for a long time about how  Little app makers and huge app makers get charged this big cut that goes to Apple and I think you know  it's tough you it's kind of like you fall on one side or the other right you're either in favor of a  great user experience  Or you're in favor of app companies not getting screwed or at least that's how it's kind of set up  It shouldn't be that way, but it's it's tough  I think in the case of WordPress it makes a lot of sense that Apple  You know wanted to not purchase stuff to be available  but at the same time you you look at it as part of the bigger picture and at least to me it seems like  In trying to create this kind of perfect ecosystem where or marketplace where people can purchase software  Apple has now become kind of the big bad guy

Start time: 875.62
End time: 978.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of funny there that Larry should invoke how it happens on desktops  Because Apple also invokes that  in their defense  Because they compare the marketplace for software and desktops  to the marketplace for software on iOS and they say see how chaotic it is and you have to have a  Distributor and the and distributors took more than 30%  We take a very small reasonable cut for our services including download bandwidth and and and and  Carefully vetting the apps and so forth. So that's why Apple's telling courts  We're better the the app store is better than the desktop marketplace not worse than the desktop marketplace  It's certainly more restrictive and I should also point out that there's some question about  whether Apple's response is disingenuous because  And this is a later story from Sean Hollister in The Verge. He says  Matt Mullenweg of  WordPress says that they'd already  Stripped out the plans section and it wasn't in the current version. There was no mention of paid plans  Mullenweg told The Verge that he'd previously offered to strip other mentions of the paid plans out of the app  even workarounds like when a user views a preview of their own WordPress web page and then  Navigates to wordpress.com and Apple rejected those suggestions  So it sounds like Apple realizing it probably wasn't the best optics  decided to back down even though  Maybe initially they hadn't. Do you have a sense of what happened?

Start time: 979.14
End time: 1034.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it is the uproar like if if Matt Mullenweg didn't tweet about the situation and tell us what was happening  I'm pretty sure Apple would have just stuck to its guns  But yeah  The situation is confusing because it's hard for developers to tell how Apple applies its rules sometimes  It seems very capricious  Yeah, it's very opaque and sometimes I've heard from developers like Apple will just say this is how it is deal with it  And you really can't fight back and this is the one situation where you know public sentiment and certainly  Reporting about this is maybe pushed Apple in one direction. It is weird that yeah  He didn't really have to change anything because he already took away the paid  Mentions in the app Apple still rejected it which is that that to me is the confusing part like when did why was that the case?  What is different now and Apple apologizing? That's certainly a new thing for them, especially to a developer Sean Hollister writes Apple  Hold on a second. Hold on

Start time: 1036.80
End time: 1054.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sean Harris Hollister and verge writes Apple simply seems to have decided that trying to extract its cut from a free app  By forcing in-app purchases isn't a hill worth dying on  Seriously today, you know, like all right. All right, go ahead Larry. Yeah. No, I just want to respond to what you had said

Start time: 1054.04
End time: 1095.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you're absolutely right that Apple what will say and does say that they're creating a less chaotic better experience and that's probably true  But it's what monopolists have always said if you go back to AT&T prior to 1982  One of their arguments is that we hit you know, if we break up the phone company  Everything's gonna you know gonna fall apart and when we need this, you know this  paternalistic company to make sure that everybody's got good phone service  so I'm not saying that that's completely untrue, but it's sort of what I would expect a company like Apple to say and  There really isn't a free marketplace when it comes to the ability to distribute and you know  Then the question becomes if there were a free marketplace, maybe there would be lower prices. Well, you know, we just don't know

Transcript:  Mm-hmm. Well, and that's a  court case going on  About that the class-action suit against Apple  There is investigation going on in the EU  About that certainly it looks like the FTC in the United States is at least considering action on the App Store  So Apple is definitely facing some heat and then there's this  suit between Apple and Epic  Unfortunately Epic and Tim Sweeney don't seem like the ideal poster boys for this freedom

End time: 1296.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, this is a very tough one I think it's pretty it seems to me  I'll posit I'll posit this and you guys can shoot at it  It seems to me that when Apple started the App Store way back  You know a year and a half after the iPhone was introduced remember the the App Store was not originally part of the iPhone in  fact  Steve Jobs said oh, you don't need apps. You just use web pages  It's all it just use web pages by the way that nowadays could be true with progressive web apps  Except that Apple won't support them on iOS very well  But he's after a year and a half. I think they said whether it was their plan all along or not  I don't know. Okay, we're gonna create these App Store and at the time it seemed like a pretty good deal for developers  You got on a very  Exciting platform you got a chance to ride the success of that platform  30% was a lot less than Ingram Micro or any of the distributors charged to carry your shrink wrapped software on store shelves  So you you get to keep 70% of the revenue you don't have to pay for downloads  You have it's a good experience for your end user  It's a it's a store that works and I think for a long time that was kind of a happy thing  Developers are making money Apple always points out the billions of dollars they pay out to developers  They don't mention the 30% they they keep but I think over time  It's gotten so much more complicated that the what what seemed like a benefit in 2010 is a little less  So today there you have  Problems like you have Netflix  Which charges a fee?  But Apple doesn't take a cut of the fee and doesn't require Netflix to sell but  But because it's a streaming thing and then you have xcloud Microsoft's gaming platform and Google's stadia, which are also  Streaming things they're streaming games, but Apple won't allow them on there because they say no that's not streaming all on Netflix  That's a game store and we can't vet the game so we don't want it on there  It's very easy to look at Apple and say well your motives are purely financial you want 30% of everything  That's rent seeking on the other hand. It's also easy to take the point of view  Well Apple's just trying to Apple's built something of value and they're just trying to protect customers  I just think that I think what made sense 10 years ago doesn't make as much sense today and Apple's in a difficult  I think what what did happen and we talked about this last week is Apple didn't think ahead to  What would what would happen down the road and now they've painted themselves into a little bit of a corner  Does that make sense to Vindra?  Yes, I think so like and I guess as these companies grow as any

Start time: 1297.48
End time: 1337.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Marketplace grows I feel like the rules may need to change or at least the way we look at things the same with Facebook too  What Facebook was, you know a very good me a small college-based social network  The rules were very different for them compared to now when they have what over 2 billion users  It seems like things have to evolve along with the size of the market  Apple can always say that they're not the biggest mobile platform out there, which is true  But they still have a very big platform of their own and they have a complete monopoly of it  And I don't know what we can do certainly the stadium the xCloud stuff to me seems like a big issue because  People want those things and they may go to Android to get them  Apple I'm old enough to remember when Apple was kind of an insignificant player

Start time: 1338.10
End time: 1365.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember when Apple was kind of an insignificant player  I mean it was not a huge part of the economy and you know now it's literally a two trillion dollar company  It is a huge huge company  So I think that the rules and the expectations will change and have to change as these companies become dominant  You know, these are the robber baron. Well, maybe that's a pejorative term  These are the oil companies of our modern era and when I was a kid  Everybody hated the oil companies whether whether we should have or not and I think that tech is in for the same ride

Start time: 1366.82
End time: 1441.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you when you say when you were a kid  That's another interesting aspect of this story to me because like I feel like that the fort the people were playing fortnight  They a bunch of them hate Apple now, right?  And like there's a really interesting like Apple was the cool company when I was a kid  That was like the coolest coolest company hands down the coolest company and I feel like  For decades and I feel like there are kids now where like just just talking about the the epic, you know  Effect so to speak like I feel like there are tons of kids now  Who are like thumbing their nose at Apple being like you guys suck man  You know what I mean, and I just think that's like an interesting  Aspects to this as well. And it's also someone tweeted  When the the fortnight thing was happening someone tweeted like no matter what you do fortnight will always be better at the internet than you  Good line  Even though they're not necessarily the right poster child for this they are super powerful, especially when it comes to like driving  Like young consumers to do things right potentially so I think that's like a problem for Apple they should be thinking about  I think the biggest problem for Apple are reputational

Start time: 1442.76
End time: 1626.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because they also it also doesn't look good because they have Apple arcade. They have their own game system  It feels like rent-seeking by which I mean Apple didn't create the value of these companies  But it wants a percentage of their income anyway  Just because they can and it certainly speaks to the fact that Apple may not have a monopoly of smartphones  But among iPhone users, they have an absolute monopoly of applications  There's no other way to put an application on the iPhone. So they certainly own that  Phil Schiller responds we were starting to see on Friday Apple's response to the  epic lawsuit and  the you know the  Smoking gun that Apple pulled out was the fact that Tim Sweeney has approached Apple at least three times  Via email looking for a better deal than others get a sweetheart deal  Schiller wrote on June 30th, 2020  Sweeney wrote my colleagues and me  In an email asking for a side letter from Apple that would create a special deal for only epic  That fundamentally would change the way in which epic offers apps on the iOS  Platform they were asking permission to bypass in-app purchases  Effectively what you know everybody would like as well as permission to launch a third-party store app store  For iPhones and this is I think one of the undercurrents here  Everybody thinks that epic wants its own steam like store and they want to put it on iOS  And that's a clear violation of what Apple will allow  Schiller said Sweeney  Said it will know you know said look we're not going to do it. We're not going to adhere to the payment processing  Sweeney wrote in the email because of restrictions imposed by Apple epic is unable to provide consumers with certain features in our iOS apps  So you need to give us a side letter or alter your contracts and standards documents to  Remove those restrictions that prevent us from having a competing app store and competing payment processing options  To iOS we hope that Apple will also make these options equally available to all iOS developers  And that's what Sweeney said is we're not fighting this fight for ourselves. We're not asking for damages  We're not asking for money from Apple. We're trying to get an open a more open  Ecosystem sure Tim which is kind of clearly sure  It'd be really interesting hearing coming Monday in the Northern District of California  Because epic has requested a restraining order that would put a fortnight back on the app store and we the hearing for that is Monday  So this may happen very quickly  What do you think you think the court will be receiving a restraining order?  What do you think you think the court will be receptive to the things remember the court  Doesn't have the same dog in this hunt that we do that gamers do that fortnight players do I  Don't know if that's an advantage or disadvantage for Apple at this point. I don't know exactly where the court will come down on this

It actually the s&p 500 is above its February benchmark  It's the highest it's ever been and you go  Oh my god, the stock market's going crazy until you realize that if you take out five companies  Facebook Amazon Apple  Google and  Microsoft if you take those out the s&p 500 lost 6% over the last six months  The all of the growth is happening with five the five biggest tech companies  That's Apple two trillion dollar company all of that  So I mean, I'm not saying that the stock market is by any means a bellwether of the American economy  But if there is a bright spot, it's there if there is if there are companies that are making money if they're companies that are hiring  people if they're

Their socks are going up. They're working from home  their issues certainly I  Just I feel like we can't just say tech is our savior. They're they're gaining from the weird situation  We're in right now, but at the end of the day, what are what are zoom calls except?  You know the Skype stuff and the Google Hangouts we've been doing forever  I don't think zoom is fundamentally better as a platform the difference

Transcript:  The difference is you and I we've been all been doing it forever  But you know now it's us and everybody's grandmother that's doing it forever. Every school kid is doing it  I mean the the cove it really has  Fundamentally changed our relationship to technology to the point where it is truly integrated into the lives of the average American including older Americans  Not just kids today, you know are on their phones  It's everybody is dependent on tech even to order your food or your groceries  I mean, I essentially don't go to a store so virtually everything that comes into my house  Comes via the internet and in a delivery truck from Amazon or somewhere else

What it the way Facebook handles misinformation  I think is something we've been focusing on they're finally starting to do something about it  But man, I sure would have liked to see this four or five years ago  Before potentially ruined an election in America and kind of let us down a very weird path

So I do think there's ways to there are things to criticize about technology right now  as much as I love it and  As much as none of us would have jobs if it weren't for technology  We don't want to bite the hand that feeds us well in Amazon is another good example  All of this is really done is just solidify Amazon's dominance of e-commerce, right?

Nobody else could say boo  I doubt Sheryl Sandberg and say mark. You got to knock it off  So with his 60% voting shares, he's completely dominant  And if he decided, you know, I don't like this candidate or I don't like this policy  It would not be hard for him  To modify to tweak the algorithm in such a way that he could get somebody elected. Do you not agree?  Do you not think that's possible? Is there any check on his power at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is none right?  No, that's that's the ultimate question. And what's funny is that I  Don't know you posit this question Leo, even though we keep learning things like Facebook's algorithm keeps biasing towards conservatives  Even though they're the ones complaining that tech is erasing them  So I don't know who Mark Zuckerberg is really answering to it seems like the people who shout loudest to me  It's the people he'll try to appease

Look what he's doing a tick-tock  So you might speculate that but we don't know and we literally the FTC  Congress no one can stop this guy at this point. Do you think?  And it is

Transcript:  Yeah, I will say I mean, I think our ideas that tech is is kind of liberal and very democratic  But honestly from my experience, it's more like more  Libertarian like more the people who are in the middle who are trying to say oh, we just want fairness  You know, we want the market to be fair. We want we want certain things to be fair  So they're not necessarily the ones fighting for things like human rights or diversity or equality or equal pay or gender

Transcript:  Stop him and I'll give you his own employees his own employees is basically the only thing I think and and he  Seems like some of the reporting at least from the Times has suggested that he's getting it from those employees quite a bit  But in the stand-ups or you know, whatever the full company meetings or whatever they're doing  But but even that I mean you got to have real guts to do that  Right to stand up to him and give him a hard time  So that's pretty unlikely that he'd be stopped by his own it is true though that every Silicon Valley

We certainly have heard about  People I'm and so I just want to be clear  I'm not saying marks liberal or conservative or marks leaning one way or the other  I'm just saying we don't know and there's no way of I don't know of a good way to stop him  Maybe it is just the employees.

They did a better job than anybody else Silicon Valley. Well done. This is the article. It was on 1-0  Which is a medium  Blog from Jumana Abu Gazela the unelected monarch an unelected monarch is shaping our public life  His name is Mark Zuckerberg. The most important election this year has only this is the other the subheads even more important  The most important election this year has only one voter  And then it's this guy. This is of course the bat the most unflattering picture I've ever seen  red-rimmed robotic eyes with  He's got the soulless gaze of a great white shark bearing down on you  Yeah, I know this is his test pretty good in a t-shirt  If if in Jumana starts she's the founder of pivot for humanity a nonprofit on a mission to professionalize Silicon Valley  I don't I don't know who he or she is but  Start but the elite is pretty if it's if it's not the single most powerful individual position in the world  It only has a few rivals think general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party or the Pope or chair of the US Federal Reserve  Maybe the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia  It's a position that's been embroiled in a contentious conversation for years now about the scope and possibly criminal  misuse of the current incumbents power  The ability to encourage wars between nuclear powers to rally or slow down global markets to end or initiate  horrifying human rights crises around the world  But I'm not talking about a presidency we get to elect the president  I'm talking about the CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg and I I have to say I agree a  Hundred percent and we don't really address this, you know  We're talking about Trump banning tick-tock and is the Chinese government a threat is tick-tock a tool of the Chinese government  Is it spying on us?

Transcript:  the only the only piece of optimism I've had about this the the Facebook influence on the election is the  It sounds like they're focusing I mean the war game stuff that they've reportedly been doing and in figuring out what like  They're actually thinking now the company is apparently thinking and now about what happens if Trump if if Biden gets elected and Trump  Refuses to leave. Yeah because of the results and Facebook is trying to solve for that now  Which I think is terrifying  But they're learning yeah in the right direction right like they're like starting to anticipate  Saying terrible things that might happen, right?

Transcript:  I guess this is a really a bad conversation because I don't normally like to pick up topics where there's no answer  But lately there been a lot of those and this is another one  I don't you know, I'm against for instance a federal ban on tik-tok  I think it's completely reasonable for the Department of Defense to say that can't be on your phone  I think it's completely reasonable for Wells Fargo say it can't be on your phone  And I think I took it off my phone after last week  I think any individual could quite reasonably say I'm not gonna have tik-tok on my phone. I'm not gonna have Facebook on my phone  I don't have either  But that I don't think the government should step in and ban it tik-tok or Facebook

Start time: 3323.36
End time: 3342.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't I think that that's not the right answer either or put it some on the scale of who acquires it or or get a  Getting some kind of a kickback from the acquisition. That's the other thing that makes no sense to me  Appalling the Treasury supposed to get a the highest bidder is gonna write a check to the Treasury to you know for the permission to acquire  tik-tok that's it's it's so

Transcript:  That whole situation kind of broke my heart too because I've been a fan of what Microsoft has been doing for the past couple years  Especially post-Nadela and the way he's reshaped me too. But yeah, though it I certainly  Don't think much of the fact that they were able to work with the Trump administration to do this to just basically take away  This company or steal this company away from its owner. I don't feel good about that

Transcript:  There's an old ad is if you sleep with dogs, you'll wake up with fleas  And this is what's really corrupting  About a corrupt government is that everybody who operates within that government becomes corrupted as well because it's the only way  You can survive and I it breaks my heart to see Tim Cook go to the White House and sit there grimacing  Next to Donald Trump, but it's his job  He has to do it and he's gonna wake up with fleas and Microsoft too and it does it it tars  Every single company in this country because they understand his power is so great and this is why you don't want an autocratic government  It's why authoritarian governments necessarily fail why innovation doesn't work why the American experiment is so important because we  Very intentionally from the very beginning of this country said we don't want an autocrat. We don't want a king  Because that corrupts the whole operation  The rule of law has to be paramount and  I've seen in every you know  one of the things I always gather from my travels as I wander around is when I remember going to Cairo and  you and I'm talking to people and you really get the sense that  there's a complete loss of faith in government because they know if you can if you're a  Family member of somebody of a  Minister or you can bribe them you're gonna get your way  Otherwise, you're not and that to completely demoralizes everybody everybody just goes well screw it throws up their hand  And it's it you get a failed country and that's exactly what happened in Egypt  you get a failed country and I don't want us to go down that path that is a very bad path and  So yeah, yeah, you're seeing that's what you said right there with Microsoft is exactly the consequence, right?

End time: 3543.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think and it's kind of this is the other problem is it muddies everything you I mean you could make it's it's reasonable  I think we'll have this policy debate over should a Chinese company be allowed to have a social network in the United States  Or is that risky? You know, I think if if Facebook were if Mark Zuckerberg were Chinese  There'd be a very different conversation. We would be probably actively everybody would say take down Facebook  We got I would understand that but I would I'm just making the point that I think he's as bad as anybody and he's American

Transcript:  You know, I wonder though the fact that tick-tock is a playground for millions and millions of young people and not just teenagers  20 something voting age young people whether or not that's gonna backfire on Trump if he actually does take it down or somehow  Muzzle it between now and the election. It seems to me people will be really angry if you took away their tick-tock

Transcript:  Well, and this is what breaks my heart because I see such good creativity and you see people like Sarah Cooper who is a comedian  Who couldn't work because of kovach there's no clubs she can perform in came up with a new way of performing  Yeah, she could have probably done it on Instagram or Twitter  in fact  you know she has a presence on both but tick-tock was just somehow magically suited to her and she became very famous because of  Tick-tock or little Naz X and Old Town Road, which became the number one hit of 2019  Thanks to tick-tock. There's a it's a place for creativity and I hate to I hate to lose that  I'm sure we find an alternative but I just that seems like a mean thing to do

Transcript:  Yeah, I  Can't imagine there would actually be a shutdown  It seems like the possibility is that either Microsoft or somebody will end up buying those assets  Which again is a wild thing and I'm sure the parent company  Was it by dance, I'm sure they're gonna be out for blood well, they're going to sue in fact Larry you had a piece in Forbes

Start time: 3635.86
End time: 3682.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They announced that next week. Of course, they've been saying this all along we're gonna sue  That means it now is no longer in the hands of the executive. It's in hands of the judicial branch. The courts will decide  Right, and I guess there is a question about the legality of the executive order can write can the chief executive  Unilaterally say yeah, we're gonna there's some evidence. There's some  Evidence that he can a Cepheus the Committee on foreign investment the United States seems to have that ability they can turn down mergers  They can say we and we kind of did it with Huawei, right? So there's precedent for this  so  Be very interesting what the court would say. What is tic-tacs?  Claim what are they? What's their defense?

Start time: 3684.34
End time: 3720.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the defense is that they've been trying to negotiate with the Trump administration for over a year and  They're not getting anywhere and that they don't feel that Trump is actually trying to resolve this problem  And the other defense is that Trump is interfering?  I mean even as they attempt to sell themselves to a US company  You know, they're basically doing what Trump asked him to do and he's still interfering  Apparently he wants to give it to Larry Ellison to give it to Oracle  That's the new one because Larry Ellison held a fundraiser for him  Exactly, I mean that's just that's insane that we would make much such important policy decisions based on who wants to you know  Grease the skids for Donald Trump

Start time: 3721.28
End time: 3748.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and I don't think they're not the ones who need to defend themselves really because  Nothing Trump has said has been proven like these them being a Chinese owned company. That's a security risk  They still need to prove that before they can start enacting this and the Trump administration has not  Do they need to prove it I mean it does yeah, I guess executive orders he doesn't have to but I'm sure bite-dance could  Come back and be like well, we didn't do anything like you're saying we're doing these things, but we're not

Transcript:  It's kind of the same with Huawei. It's it's yeah the presumption that if President Xi of China  Said to bite dance or Huawei  Said to bite dance. Hey, I want every bit of information  You know by bite dance says no no we keep all the tick-tock American tick-tock content in America  We back it up at Singapore never hits the Chinese shores  But we know that it's a Chinese company and the Chinese government can go to them  By the way same as American company can go to Facebook  American government go to Facebook and say we want to see all that data and by the way don't don't mention anything about this

Transcript:  This is between us two. So where do we draw the line? I mean iPhones are manufactured in China. Yeah, they're they're designed in Cupertino  But almost every piece of electronics that we have in our home comes from China  And so do we do we extend this to start existing this? Yeah, I'm trying to think about how what's the reasonable?

Transcript:  No, we can we can take take it apart look at everything. You can take it apart  Yeah, I can the problem with Huawei as I understand it is that it's software driven in many cases  And so you can't say with any predictiveness  What a piece of Huawei gear will always do because the software can be changed and we'll have some other behavior  So you can't vet a Huawei 5g switch  But you could look at a phone and vet it you could say no this phone does not have that as long as Apple controls the software  This phone will not have the ability to do anything right nefarious. I think that's the case

Start time: 3849.61
End time: 3872.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that there was some concern about Huawei's  You know the the I'm gonna sound very stupid now, which is probably accurate  But like what the way that Huawei was leveraging algorithms in its software for the 5g kits  Right like that. That's the idea right? They could basically change. Yeah  Yeah

Start time: 3875.88
End time: 3916.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a software-defined switch so the software that you load on that switch completely defines the behavior whether it routes through China for instance  So that's the problem  You can't vet a piece of Huawei gear and say that will never misbehave because the Chinese a Chinese company controls it  And so that's a reasonable thing to say yeah, we're not gonna use Huawei switches now Huawei also makes phones and  I don't I think you could probably say well, how is a Huawei phone worse than the Apple phone?  I guess cuz Huawei does the software  I don't know. I think I think that's the point is that in theory anyway hardware can be vetted  Software

There's a lot of data going through and a lot of personal data  That's different than just like a single phone tick-tock

Transcript:  Seeing my location which it can't by the way on the iPhone. Mm-hmm, but if it could is not nearly the  dangerous  Thing that a guy who controls the 5g switches in the major American city that guy controls  Infrastructure that is vital  Yeah. Yeah, that's very different. So I I don't have a problem with the Huawei ban. I know I think it was  capriciously  Implemented and hurts Huawei in ways probably shouldn't and it's gonna backfire but  I think it was a reasonable thing and most by the way most Western governments did decide not to use Huawei gear in their  5g switches  5g networks, but I don't know about the tick-tock ban  I think I don't think a government should ban a social network  Well, I don't know and really I see the government ban Facebook the Chinese do me and they can also they do but that's what?  The whole point we shouldn't be like the China Tim. Wu wrote a  Opinion piece in the and I normally respect the guy in the New York Times saying hey China does it to us  We should do it back. No, we should stand up for a free and open Internet because that's what we do  That's how you promote our values

Transcript:  You don't and the question is do you take that you take?  Tick-tock at its word that their servers are based in the US in Singapore and not in mainland China  That their policies are determined by their policy shops here in the United States and not in mainland China  I mean if you listen to them and I've I've spoken extensively with their executives  They will argue that they are operating  Not as a US company  But certainly not with Chinese domination in terms of how they make decisions about how they operate their US

Start time: 4040.86

Start time: 4055.68
End time: 4078.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They never really address that that was the most convincing sort of like theoretical example, right? Like you have a  You essentially have a government official either in the US or China and somehow  the Chinese government takes their tick-tock data and  Uses it against them to bend them to its will.

Transcript:  We know that the United States thanks to the Patriot Act and  FISA courts and national security letters we have similar  Rules if I were Chinese for instance of our the Chinese government, I would I could see why they would say well  We don't want any of our citizens using Facebook  That's not by the way the reason they they don't want the citizens using Facebook because the reason they don't want people using Facebook  In China's because they might learn about the Uighurs  internment camps  They might learn about Tiananmen Square or just hear about it  They might think President Xi looks like Winnie the Pooh and that would be the end of the world  So that's the real reason and actually it may be the the only real reason to ban tick-tock on my iPhone  Tick-tock doesn't get a lot of my personal information. I don't post pic videos. I just watch videos  The real threat of tick-tock might be the propaganda threat more than anything else

Start time: 4142.28

Yeah, we already know we already know that happened in Tulsa. It helped wreck his Tulsa rally  So maybe you know when you describe how China doesn't want Facebook, maybe that's why Donald Trump doesn't want tick-tock  Well, I'm sure it is

They they can weaponize information in ways that we have never seen before  You know somebody asked me well, isn't this how is this any different from William Randolph first?  creating the Spanish-American War  In what was it 19 eight 1915  And he did you know, he lobbied for war he actually made the war happen  And so in a way, this is like that except he's even more powerful

It wouldn't just be several articles or a big push  Leo when we started talking about this  He said you didn't you didn't want to leave this in a place where we didn't know we don't have any answers  We kind of don't know what to say. I do  I think we can start to think about what we want from our social networks moving forward Facebook did announce an oversight board which  Unfortunately will not actually be up and running until after the election. Thanks a lot guys  But there is certainly more we can start pushing for these companies  Like I wish Facebook was run more like maybe like an actual newspaper or even like, you know with people who are  Who are used to dealing with facts and information freaking librarians like Facebook needs to be someplace. It's actually  Managed by people who understand the importance of information the flow of accurate information

That's $30 a month for 24 months  $30 a month for one third what I'm paying T mobile. I got a phone and the service  Oh my god by going online eliminating the cost of a retail store mint mobile can save you a lot of money  And I think Ryan Reynolds is putting a little cash in there too. Every plan with mint mobile is is  Gives you unlimited nationwide talk and text and then you choose how much data you're gonna use  So I went all the way I got the 12 gigabyte plan  But there are plans for every use every budget if you're not 100% satisfied. They've got a seven-day money back guarantee  There's no risk they will send you the SIM for free if you're gonna use your existing phone  You could port your number over either with the existing phone or buying a new phone  So you save your number you save your contacts  There couldn't be a better way to switch to the Fox. The Fox looks surprisingly like Ryan Reynolds, by the way  I don't want to say anything. He's got it.

End time: 5220.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I've played around with some I haven't reviewed any of the folding phones  But I've definitely touched them and you know use them for a little bit and actually last year when Microsoft first announced the surface duo  And the neo which is gonna be the you know, the windows  Snapdragon, you know powered one  I was just more sold on this idea of two separate hinges two separate screens with a hinge  Yes a hinge because this is direct like that is far more durable than trying to fold a single screen  You know over and over and over you could flip it around use just one screen. You can use both screens  You'll have to deal with the hinge. You'll always have something down the middle of the screen. That's unfortunate  But I think in terms of mobile multi-message rather have that than a crease

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Says and you know what?  I think there's some merit in it even though it's a little self-serving that there's some sort of context switching  That the having the bezel and two separate screens instead of one unfolded big screen  Somehow is more productive and it is true that one screen can have one app another screen and another app  They've created software that watches for this and even if the apps are not dual screen aware  Even though that's built into Android now the the phone will be smart enough to say well, that's gonna be in that one  That's gonna be in that one. I think I can't wait to get my hands on one because I think it it's been since  2007 that we've seen a new phone for factor that worked

These things are getting more expensive  Okay, but yeah, I am excited about it and even despite the price sure it's 1400 bucks to start  But man are high-end phones have gotten to that point the iPhone 11 Pro the note like it's not over $2,000  It's not $2,500 which was what the galaxy fold launched at

You've heard of fishing with a pH. You heard a spear fishing  Now vishing with a V. It's voice  Fishing and we're seeing more and more of this in particular with work at home  As a way to get VPN credentials  Of course once you got the VPN and the credentials you can log into the company network and it's yours, baby. It's all yours  What they're doing is they're setting up  Fishing sites traditional fishing sites that have the target companies name dash  Service or support or dad ticket like twit-service.com  And then they do social engineering. They actually make voice calls  especially new hires at the targeted company and they say things like  Yeah, we're I know you're on our VPN platform right now. We're about to move platforms  We want to of course bring your account over so this is seamless for you  So I need your login and I need your password  so we can move you over and  Apparently, it's very effective  They're using unattributed voice over IP address phone numbers. They call employees on their personal cell phone  And then once they once they succeed they can expand the tech to incorporate spoofed numbers of other offices and employees  So it looks like it's coming from Dan and accounting  They they will pose as the IT help desk  They'll use what they already know about the employees personally identifiable information name position duration of company  Hey, this is a this is Joe right? You just joined you've been here at six weeks, right?  I think you're working from home is your are you living still living on Claxton Street? Yeah, so we've moved the VPN  We need your account login. Okay, and by the way, I'm getting the  The two-factor is it is the digit are you getting the six digits six four three nine one one you're not what are you getting?  Oh, I'm sorry. All right. I better reset that. Okay. Well, thanks Dan. We're got you set up. You'll be on the new VPN soon  Thank you. And of course you'd be very good at this. I'm good at it  That's believable right that's believable  They get through the two-factor they get through and I mean this is awesome  It's very effective and apparently it's becoming a big problem  And of course once they're in they can put ransomware on the network. They can they can put rats on the network  They can keep an eye on everything going on Brian Krebs has a good article on this  I mentioned it probably because it's a good idea for you who listen to our show  you're too smart to fall for this, but maybe it's time to mention this to your company or your  coworkers be suspicious of unsolicited phone calls or email messages or texts or even visits  Sometimes they come to your door  And and whatever you do

Transcript:  Shing I wish to suck your blood. I wish yeah is I come to this you  BD BD BG fishing bitch. Yeah, that's right. That's a Caesar. I think it was Caesar said that yeah, I came I saw  As long as I'm on Cribs on security, I'm a little miffed about this one  We talked a little bit about on security now as well Microsoft has known about a zero day  for two years  Poot-pooted for two years  Even though it was being exploited. They only fixed it on August 11th on their patch Tuesday  It was one of the record number  120 security holes fixed last Tuesday and  This is a bad vulnerability  Which was discovered a long time ago?  And I think I know why it happened. I think I finally figured out why it happened  So the way you would exploit this is you would take an MSI file  those are the installer files Microsoft uses on Windows and  Those are authenticated  They use authenticate it's on a code certificates to validate it  So it won't run if the certificate doesn't match but Microsoft left a little  Loophole in that and I think it's for  Localization so you've got the installer file  It's all written in English, but maybe you want to make it available in China as well or Japan  So you there's a capability to add at the end of a file  the localization strings for different languages and  That's always been part of MSI. Here's the problem  You're now modifying it. You'd have to get a new certificate. So Microsoft said no no  We'll do the authentic code on the main thing. We'll assume that the sidecar with localization strings. That's harmless  We'll just we won't bother including that in the certificate  well didn't take long before people realize two things first of all you could put anything at the end of one of these MSI files and  Microsoft would say yeah, it's fine. It's not modified in any way we think is significant  But then the second big realization was it turns out Java. I didn't know this but Java  Looks at jar files starts at the back because that's where the symbols are and then looks for the the code to jump to main  It looks at the back. It doesn't start at the front most programs run from the front to the back  It runs from the back to the front  So some wise guy a couple of years ago said oh look if we do a simple copy  Literally a copy you copy an MSI file to a jar file a malicious Java file  It'll join them two together the authentic code signature will still work somebody who runs that file  will think they're running a Microsoft installer file in fact, they're running a jar file and  Java will jump in and execute the end and  You're in  This literally was discovered two years ago  By Bernardo Quintero from virus total. He's the manager over there  It's a Google service that scans submitted files. He wrote a blog post January 15th, 2019  explaining how it works  According to Quintero  Microsoft security team said yeah, that's right  But that's intended behavior. So we're not gonna address it

Maybe the NSA said yeah be nice if you left that  Yeah, we really need it because you know, you couldn't you could easily fix this you just say no  No, you can't you can't just add anything arbitrarily to the back of an MSI file  And they have fixed it  Apparently they fixed it because it was being used  Regularly by bad guys

I have never I hadn't really thought about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But of course if the NSA is using that to actively exploit somebody and Microsoft says we'll be better fix this  They might say it would be nice if you left lying around a little bit longer. Yeah  Nevertheless, I think that's not a good policy because of course a lot of people are gonna get bit by that  It's not a surprise. We have a massive ransomware problem right now. Mm-hmm Garmin and the latest cannon  Lost photos lots of people's photos because they got bit by ransomware. Oh speaking of losing photos. Here's another one  This is so annoying  Didn't bite me but just by the luck and the grace of God it didn't bite me if if you use Lightroom on iOS  An update wiped out all your photos and presets and Adobe said yeah, and they're not you can't recover that  Yeah, oops, we're sorry, what was that Bob  I  Don't know how many people were bit by this but if a lot of people I think use Lightroom now on iOS  It's a nice it's a really good way to do your photos  Mm-hmm, if you did what Adobe wants you to do which is use Adobe Cloud and sync your photos and presets  You're okay. It would have been saved but if you didn't because you didn't want to spend the money  Then this photo this update just clobbered it all

Transcript:  So the secret iPod is an interesting story that kind of came out  From a former iPod engineer  David Shayer, he was the second software engineer hired in 2001 and  He no longer works for Apple, but he  He posted on tidbits a post saying, you know funny a funny thing happened to me back in 2005  The director of iPod software my boss's boss  Without knocking walked in closed the door behind me. He said I have a special assignment for you  Your boss doesn't know about it  You're gonna help to engineers from the Department of Energy  Build a special iPod  Report only to me  The next day these two guys Paul and Matthew show up  He said I would like to say they wore dark glasses and trench coats, but they were perfectly normal  30-something engineers  They went to the conference room. They actually didn't work for DOE. They worked for a contractor Bechtel  They wanted to add some custom hardware to an iPod  To record data from this custom high hardware to the iPod's disk in a way that would be invisible  So the iPad had to look and work like a normal iPod. You wouldn't be able to see the data if you mounted the iPod  They would do all the work. I was just there to help to consult so he never did learn what it was for  But what could it be for and you can think of actually the spy uses for this right  No, you know you're going into a top-secret nuclear installation you're gonna get a tour or no, maybe it's not a nuclear installation  Maybe it's just a medical facility or something innocuous  You're gonna get a tour and they're gonna look at you. They're gonna search you can say what is this? Oh, it's iPod  I love iPod but it needs peers America great country and you put it back in your pocket say yeah  Maybe they're really careful and they plug it in and play something. Let me listen. I love Britney Spears  No problem, put it back in and it turns out it's he suspected maybe a Geiger counter.
