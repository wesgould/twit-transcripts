I thought they should have sold the DVD they should have broken new ground and sold the DVD at the theater  If you bought a paying ticket to see the movie, I totally they would have sold a ton of DVDs  It would have changed the dynamics of the movie industry right on the spot. People are playing around with the idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which studio is actually gonna do it first, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you go to the movie and if you really like the movie you buy the DVD as you leave for you know  29 bucks or whatever it is. I think they would have sold millions and millions of them. It's a 29 bucks a pop

Transcript:  Holy, I think that's only three movie tickets. Well, you know two and a half

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jackson being a Jedi that didn't work for you. I think it's it at the end. All right, let's get back to high-tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Women in technology international amber you're down at the conference today. What is women in technology international all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is an organization that helps women network in the tech industry  So really it's a group of women who have all decided that they want to kind of branch out and network with other women  And the conference was the 10th anniversary conference  I'm actually not a member of witty which is ironic because I am seed their event  Should join  I yeah, I should probably join now, but it was a great event  There were probably about 800 women there, you know senior level level executives  Marissa Meyer from Google who's one of the user experience leads she was on the cover of fast company recently  She was the keynote speaker today. There was gene bardic who is I don't know how old she is  But she was one of the first  programmers on ENIAC one of the first computers  So they honored a lot of women who have made a lot of advancements in technology  So it's fantastic just a bunch of geeky women in a room together  And I've never really I've never experienced that before so it's kind of it was nice  It was a really really good event  But you know again just an opportunity to honor women who have you know done really really well in their careers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that run all weekend or is that was that like a Friday thing it would it started on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Wednesday evening and it ran Wednesday evening Thursday and Friday during the day  So it was a bunch of sessions. I sat in the panel as well. There was a lot of talk about podcasting  They had different pen you know there's a lot of women who knew a lot about podcasting and that was foreign  You know usually I feel kind of special and I didn't feel like that at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that brings us to our podcasting a segue when you  Mention it when you say they talked about  Or knew about podcasting in what sense were they podcasters or were they podcasting this event or were they all?  Subscribers to podcast and what sort of podcast did they subscribe to if that's the case for the most part they are podcasting the event

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're podcasting all the sessions from the event which is interesting. Oh really yeah, it's really cool  There were some great sessions some great panelists also some of their website

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can go to to get the podcast if somebody out there wants to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They'll podcast I'm not sure when they'll be up in the website, but it's witty comm w i t i comm and  Also a lot of the women there are in the marketing field so they tend to be interested in podcasting more from a marketing standpoint  So they're interested in you know getting podcasts going for their company to promote their services  But then there's some you know independent  You know consulting people who are who want to create their own podcasts and are just interested in what's happening  So there's a lot of a lot of sort of hype around the whole podcasting world about blogging and but you know  They most of the women knew what they're talking about and you know they're right in there  They understand the iTunes music store, and you know it was good to see that because I think we don't see a lot of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's always funny when you see like the email

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like the president of our company has developed a blog and we'll be doing a podcast so we can directly get the word out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I felt a little indie being there to be tell you the truth because I was sitting on a panel with a bunch  Of marketers and they're talking about oh, hey buy our software to you know do you advertising and do marketing email campaigns?  And then I would say well you can actually get that for free if you go to the site  so I think I was kind of one of the black sheep of  Realize you know I'm promoting so many free services on call for help and other shows that  I'm not really the best friend for some of the bigger companies, but  Companies appreciated it right because you know there's some people that is still five person company can't afford to buy software  So they were coming to me on the side and getting tips. I was getting lectured about that recently

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like this you have to quit promoting free software people don't need free software somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tell us who I can't tell you names. I couldn't get a business. I couldn't get a business card out of them  Oh, it's just somebody some they say anonymous person. It wasn't like one of your bosses. No no not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Jim's gonna come to me and say stop promoting free software like why'd you hire me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't understand that because it seems to me that you know there's a place for every kind of software  There's a place for free software  There's a place for paid software, and it's like if you can get something that's free  That's better than paid or at least is good  Why would you pay for it and what's wrong with promoting it?  Maybe these people that are having to pay for software should either make their software better or find some other way of making money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a pretty bizarre concept, but some people get upset about it  You know it's like the whole Microsoft Linux battle. I mean you know you look at people  It's like you know I was reading you know the press release battles are going back and forth  And it's like you know American IT managers do not trust open source or Linux  And it's like well yeah actually a lot of them do but they're terrified terrified of they're terrified of it in the flip side

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you can't get it past the people that sign the checks  Yeah, that's what happens a lot and unless something internal happens like I worked for a company that basically got  One of the disgruntled employees left the company mm-hmm ratted them out saying oh  They've got illegal copies of Microsoft software on their computers everybody came in found less than  2% of the systems that had you know they had moved one copy of software to another without proper licensing  The boss just said you know what forget this and went ahead and switched out dumped all the systems kept the same hardware older computers  upgraded everything to Linux only the application applications that people needed and  Saved a bunch of money in the time  And he'll never go and never look back at this point and his cost dropped dramatically and the face of for

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't have to be hassled by these guys the BSA and these guys have been making people's lives miserable  They're gonna change anytime soon. No it doesn't look like it in fact  It's getting worse you start reading their you know their press releases are actually upping the ante now  They have bounties which is the reason that you know that guy probably did that  But you get a piece you get a good piece of the action you can make 10 or 20 thousand for anybody out there interested  Screwing your old company you can make 10 20 even this a percentage deal  And it's negotiable so you can get a lot of money out of it  By turning in your you know your old put I'll put them my yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Run away to Tahiti

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can't catch me yeah, I did a piece on that. I think it was a maroon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So some of you sexly this is a good one for you Roger  What do you do after you've quit your relatively high-ranking?

No why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because I I  honestly feel that blogging was almost kind of a form of exhibitionism and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well except when you're a guy goes on television I was a guy who did go until  You probably go on television again, and you're doing a podcast here, and you're now you're I just pointing out  All right discrepancy, and you're thinking my hip my hypocrisy. I wouldn't use that word. That's cool  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know it's interesting that's interesting you know a lot of people talk about it um I  Mean it depends on the experience. It was good or bad. You know either extreme. I guess people blogging for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of in the middle. It's like hey, I think you know I'm not a big fan of the blogging your personal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know experience today. I had a lunch  sandwich like their life journal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dvorak's personal army of angry survivalists Dvorak's shack

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had someone recently because my website's amber Mac calm and someone bite me bought me  Yeah, but yeah, of course I just said that in front of all you guys  It's not us. It's the camera  I'm worried now. It's just a series of things. I've said this week that are inappropriate  But funny, but funny they can be cut and pasted. It's perfect  Someone bought me the URL amber win calm in case I wanted to write more about windows  The Microsoft who bought you this I don't know some random person emailed me and said I should start  promoting free software  It's like well amber Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the segue we missed is that the podcast word has become the I didn't miss it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just let it cruise right on by because there was so much there's so much  Yeah, very interesting stuff about nothing the new Oxford. Oh, yeah  Don't even go there. That's cruel go all right the new Oxford American dictionary  Your go they wouldn't let podcast in there because they didn't feel it was being well used enough and it  Podcasting is the word of the year now for 2005 that means is doomed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you think I mean it's a terrible word it came on it came up too quick  Don't you think for it to become the word of the year? I mean last I mean two years ago  There was podcasting didn't even exist. I don't know they mean you're saying basically saying it's flaring out  This is all over with I mean it just seems to me. No, I don't know media is done. You know I didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know that web thing trend it web is slammed to the floor

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, actually, I don't think so. I think it's a legitimate thing  But when you get these kind of a burst like that it causes all kinds  I think it will create a disruption of some sort of backlash well not necessary  But there'd be like a you know it'll be either like co-opted by big media, or you know I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you seen the top 20 on iTunes lately for big media? It's getting there  Well, it's a lot of NPR and then some big NPR rocks man and you know what if you're in a car

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can turn it on the radio and they actually listen to it, but you can hear it all the time anytime  How could he but you need the morning edition not cutting edge at all that's the point in fact  That's what I think the morning edition so the  These  Podcasts are narrow casting in the in the purest sense of the word and I think yeah some people will appreciate them eventually

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What words lost out I don't know  There was have a like a what 50 or 60 word Oxford dictionary picks podcasting is the word of the year

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but only the United States apparently they stay they  It's not an international my English teachers

Transcript:  But why is that kind of pathetic I don't know just seems like a really trendy word  I don't know how long the word

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd like logging. I don't think we can get rid of that word

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know I just don't like I don't like it because I think I mean I think we might be stuck with it  But I don't think it accurately defines what we're trying to do and people get confused by it  That's why it's not necessarily

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen, I don't mind blog. I mind the word blog sphere though for some reason bloggers blogosphere blogosphere

Transcript:  It's kind of like for some lunch table a lunch table and a junior high school cafeteria  I think it's like my space is that way too and they're really self-referential

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, what so is a live journal very just like its own world. Oh man

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the losing words actually turns out were one was life hack. Well, the other was rootkit root  Those are the words didn't make life hack life hack  This must have been the this must have been like the the obscure technical month of November  I'm picking words. Well, I've got a pretty good website, right? But it's you know, good look at rootkit

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Video iPod anyway, I mean they've also got law and order  They've sold me  Apple says I take hit three million video downloads. So it's a gimmick

Transcript:  There's moments where it's really cool and there's moments where it's really awkward it's quite buggy really it really it's buggy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they admit that it's buggy because they're developing it kind of as they go on and so they're they're waiting for a lot of feedback  From the community to help them, you know add features and functionality

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what does it do is that another one of these pages?

It can be used if I'm a really what video dub is designed for is to do a lot of converting for you that you know  format frame size and  It saves my keyster because we get oftentimes when I have to convert from QuickTime in an avi it never  Redos the aspect ratio the correct way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but you with mpeg-4 you wanted another announcement that came out this week and angry we're gonna harp on it on Tuesday  I'm on our TV because like the there's a there's a consortium of FM radio programmers  I figured it was just be hardware people that are trying to pull they they want FM radio replaced with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With digital FM with the HD radio 20 years ago. I was listening to digital AM in Chicago

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, just you look at it. Remember the other one that was a big bust was was stereo AM  Still floating around. Yeah, I know  Lights up on the thing. Yeah, it's like whoa. It's a M and well, it's and it sounds terrible  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But like the that's like clear channel a bunch of other companies that have invested all this money in HD broadcasting equipment and nobody's buying  HD tuners because for a while it was like a $400 add-on on a $600 Kenwood head unit if you wanted in your car  Sounds great if you can get it to run it doesn't drop out which will be fun in San Francisco with the hills

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't work in these areas with lots of buildings open. They give you more channels per bandwidth  That's yeah, they can also crush micro. I think I was talking about more channels, but it's like there's a lot of missing channels  I mean, it's not like the thing is full of channel channel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the current FM most of the major FM radio radio companies basically quash the efforts for community radio by saying there was  crosstalk and bleed over in between the because it  Basically everybody could demonstrate that they have no problem in the field making stuff where with that and cross chat  But they always seem to demonstrate in the lab for the FCC why they can't split the existing channel base

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I never get that  I mean  FM in particular locks onto a channel and pretty much keeps the crosstalk down to zero even when there's channel by next to a channel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except when it's like an FM transmitter for an iPod

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Part of San Francisco though, I mean I used to live out in the sunset area and there are zones out there where signals just  Do the weirdest radio goes to die?  Four square block area where every channel becomes K fog or whatever that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Swear to God I thought was this car stereo busted and I kept flipped with all the chance like why is it the same one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Over and over and it's weird because all the frequencies are still there but it's all one channel

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know here I still have I have a CB radio receiver still I good a decent one  And I ever once in a while I turn it on, you know  Just to see what's what and there's always some bonehead out there who thinks he's like, you know  Rush Limbaugh and he's got our linear ramp  So he's cranking that you can't talk back to him because you can't get your signal that far best stuff about guys like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're really easy to triangulate. They can go to their house. You could but who's hi

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they sound like they're clinically insane  So I'm not sure you want to go to their house  But they get on one of the channels and they just basically go on and on and it's like what is this guy's completely nuts  And he's going on, you know, it's kind of a art Bell kind of a show that he's putting no sermon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Show satellite radio, we just got that in Canada recently the past week  Just XM and serious but they've banned Howard Stern  They would really defeats the purpose of having satellite radio  We have really strict laws in Canada about content  So we have an organization called the CRTC which really regulates content in Canada  They won't allow Howard Stern to be aired in Canada. Sure. Is that cuz he's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Canadian is illegal

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean because I mean there's a Canadian cut there's Canadian content rules  That's part of it  but also some of the things he says are obviously seen and  They they don't really like that. Well, he said negative things about the French Canadians and that's really a touch

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a great day of radio  He's made disparaging remarks against many ethnic and I think is ridiculous personally

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But well, Amy, that's a kind of it. Is it gonna be I think I think it was scary  I think it was I think it's Howard Stern  Yeah, so what was the I mean are they are they doing because given the Canadian broadcasting laws?  Are they doing completely like separate or completely new? Are they basically rebranding the DJs?  Are they slotting in new GJs? I mean basically they doing all new content

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know it's not gonna be all new content, but a percentage of it will be new content  So you can expect a lot of hockey programming and other types of programming  They are gonna have to do you know an X amount of new content to adhere to Canadian content rules  So I don't know if it's 40% or something like that, but they I mean XM has a huge  Headquarters in Toronto as well as serious. So in serious is I think affiliated with so it's gonna be and did they put up another satellite?  I'm not sure if they put up another satellite. I don't know all the details  their spot transmitters

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're hoping that a lot of people will buy  You know the receivers and then they will be really excited about it because they can get you know better

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think quality radio. I think hopefully all these things will drop dead in the long term  I think podcasting is the only way that people should be getting their content

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think very difficult to receive a podcast currently while you're in a moving vehicle or on dial-up or on dial-up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, you can just you know, you I think maybe perhaps on DVDs or some you drop  You're driving down to middle of nowhere, Canada out there in the middle of Saskatchewan and you pull over to gas station  They have podcast vending machine.
