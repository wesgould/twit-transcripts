Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is TWiT This Week in Tech, episode 65 for August 6th, 2006, The 60 Million Dollar  Alright, let's get started then. We've got a great panel and I'd like to introduce everybody via  cell phone because he can't get grounded from Los Angeles. He's back in the States, ladies and  gentlemen, Cory Doctorow. Howdy. It's great to have you back on TWiT. And we'll talk a little  bit about what you're up to because you're no longer the European Affairs Coordinator for EFF.  You're in LA now. What could that mean? We also have Will Harris from Britain who very kindly  stepped out of the way for Jerry Pornell last week. So we owe him one. Hey Will. Hello, how's it going?  Bit-Tech.net and you were up late last time. I think it was what, two in the morning when we bumped  you. Yeah, something like that. I apologize. Also with us, the poster boy for Web 2.0, ladies and  gentlemen. Oh no. We're just proud of you, Kevin, although the picture on the front of Business Week

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wasn't exactly the best picture of yours. I have a story about that. We can talk about that. Alright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then of course to anchor this whole mess, John C. Dvorak, who only got one plug in last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All I need one plug, Dvorak.org slash blog, I'm in business. Is it that good? Does it work that well,  really? Well, you know, it's actually diminishing returns. If I probably, you know, at some point I  noticed that, you know, I got a bunch of, I got a run up and then it's pretty much nothing now. I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing. You get nothing, huh? You get nothing. So you just appear out of the goodness of your  own heart. Well, I thank you very much. You did blog this week about Kevin's cover. And let's,  we might as well just start off with that. First of all, Kevin, embarrassed or not, I think it's  wonderful. I mean, you're getting a lot of recognition from Business Week. It was kind of the  accounting in the article is a little strange. As they pointed out in the article, your dig is  breaking even. But on the front page, they say this kid made $60 million in 18 months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, a dig isn't even breaking even. So they got that wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Kevin, you're taking us out to dinner tonight with all that money?  60 million!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have no, there's no, I'm not a multimillionaire. I'm not even a millionaire or a thousandaire. I  don't know how they came up with that cover. But I guess it was just based on, they put a value to  the company and then they estimated how much, yeah, it's all estimates. And obviously it's just  paper fake money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Leo, you kind of like that piece. I thought the article read like a, like a, a slip shot hit  piece. Really? You think it was a hit piece?  I would seem like it to me. It was snide. He called him a kid. I mean, the guy, you know,  Kevin's 30 or close to it. And I mean, if you look on the pictures, you got a six o'clock shadow,  for God's sake. I mean, it doesn't even look like he's young in that thing, except for the crazy  outfit. And then they had all these Tom Cruise's doughier little brother and yeah, they were some

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  snotty stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then about the tech TV loser, you know, kind of a loser on tech TV, you know, unknown. I mean,  the whole thing just rang. It was, I was 30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? You're right. I'm mad as hell now. I'm mad. Dang it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it was pretty crazy how they came up with that cover shot. So the whole deal was going into  this. Honestly, it was just an interview for, we were going to be one of the companies featured in  the article. We had no idea it was going to be a cover or anything like that until the actual day  that it went out to press. So they didn't even warn you before that. No, they said there's a  possibility. It might be, but they go, we want to take a photo of you, you know, come out and,  you know, it's for the inside of the magazine. Just, you know, there's a guy's walking their  dogs. There's guys with hockey gear on, you know, do something fun. So like they're all throwing  some headphones and, you know, just give us a couple of different poses. So did they give you  the backwards cap or was that your idea? No, they basically, I mean, they had me like drinking a  beer. They had me doing all different kinds of things and they're just like, you know, we'll see

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  which one everyone makes it. If they get you to try one of those crazy tennis shoe lacings that all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the kids are into these days. No, I didn't have to do that. You got to get a handler. I have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  draw the line somewhere. You need a man. You need somebody to protect you from this stuff.  It is a mixed blessing though, to be on the cover of Business Week. Of course. I mean, I'm honored

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to be on the cover, but I mean, I was, I, with the whole 60 million, this kid made $60 million,  I didn't make anything, you know, the company, while we have a path to becoming a profitable  company, we are not a profitable company. You know, we're continuing to work on that with  Federated Media and some other companies that we're signed up with to serve ads on the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go Federated Media. What's that? This is John Battelle's company. It's a,  they sell banner ads, right? Yeah, exactly. Go Federated Media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And why do you say that, Corey? Well, because that's what Boing Boing gets its money to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, all right. Good. Is Boing Boing all Federated Media? You don't have anybody else on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, no. So it's a little complex because John's also personally our business manager. So  I think he occasionally does deals on our behalf with entities other than Federated Media, but it's  pretty much all Federated Media. Battelle was a journalist.  Yeah. Yeah. Well, and an entrepreneur, he founded the industry standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of an interesting thing though. Now he's selling. Kevin, did you prefer the alternate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  cover that got posted? What was the alternate? Ah, yes. The, you mean the 40 year old virgin one?  Yeah. Yeah. The comparison, striped shirt, striped shirt. That was awesome.  Where is that? I didn't see that. Was that on dig?  Yeah. There's, yeah, there's like a bunch of different alternatives out there, which are  just amazing. They're really cool. Bunch of people with Photoshop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my goodness. Well, I, you know, I think in some ways this kind of attention is a,  is a bad thing for a company because it puts pressure on you. It, it, of course, a lot of,  a lot of weasels come out of the woodwork saying, Hey kid, I can help you with that 60 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was really, actually the day it was posted, I had someone from Goldman Sachs email me like,  Hey, if you need money management, I'm like, I can't even afford a couch. I just moved into  my new apartment. Leave me alone. Like this is, I don't have $60 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure it's going to be an avalanche at some point of stuff. Yeah. That's pretty funny.  So tell me about John Battelle's strategies with Federated Media Corp. It seems it's,  is it more than just banner ads? What's the idea behind that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think the idea is that there are sites out there, there are rather there are advertisers  out there that want to advertise to fairly large, high quality audiences. So sort of an order of  magnitude larger than the average blog might have. And the transaction cost of going out and doing  say a hundred deals with a hundred blogs is pretty high. And so I think John's basic premise is he  goes out, he finds a bunch of really kick ass blogs, kick ass websites that have inventory to  sell and that have a unique and distinctive voice, figures out which advertisers might be a good fit  for them and then go to the advertiser and says, I can sell you advertising in front of, I can tell  you 30 million impressions on the following sites. And then he can go to the creators and he can talk  to them about whether or not those advertisers are appropriate. So he sells it. He's an aggregator  then of the eyeballs on both sides. Yeah. He's aggregating, he's aggregating blogs,  he's aggregating advertisers. And unlike something like say Google ads where you've got to,  you got to feed them some editorial control and the relevance isn't so high and you don't really  have any exacting fine grained control over who gets advertised with you. And Patel gives you a  lot of control over who gets advertised with you. And he doesn't try to have any editorial  control over what you post. Basically once you and he have a deal, you write your site and he  helps you find the right advertisers based on what you're posting. It doesn't try to tell you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to post something different. Sometimes you get comical results from Google ads. They really don't  seem to do a very good job. In fact, I'm looking at your blog now, John, and the very first Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ad on your blog says, meet species testing. The Google ad thing is only there. And then scrapple  genotyping. I don't even understand. Google ads, I'm telling you, I don't think they do a very good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  job. Yeah, I think they do. The more I experience them, the worse it seems to be. It doesn't seem

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to be a very good job. But isn't the issue with federated media that there's a point at which it  becomes uneconomic because for a really big site, for example, like DIG, surely giving away say 50%  of the revenue to federated media is a lot less efficient than hiring somebody to do your own sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, honestly, for us, it's just, you know, we're a small team that are just world developers and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ops people. So absolutely. Because right now down the line, doesn't it become more efficient?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  BitTech does its own ad sales, right? Yeah, absolutely. You have a salesperson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we have a couple of guys because there comes a point where, you know, if you're in a specialist  field, you know who all the advertisers are and who better to sell your advertising than the guy  that sits in the office with you every day and understands what you're doing. And of course,  they're only selling for us as opposed to trying to sell for, you know, to me it looks sometimes  like a bit of a conflict of interest because if you're selling for say 40 different sites  and your company has budget to go on say one or two sites, well, how do you decide,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, where they go necessarily? And it's one of those things where we've actually had a couple  advertisers approach us directly and say, hey, we want to advertise on DIG and FM doesn't lock you  into any type of exclusive relationship with them. So we can use their ad engine to basically  push any campaign that we direct sell and then they don't take a cut out of that. So yeah,  at some point, you know, as more and more people learn about DIG and want to advertise directly on  DIG, they can contact us and we can do that. But right now they just have a huge sales force that  go out and, you know, bring in the IBMs and Lenovo's and Hitachi's of the world. And it's so easy for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The reason this is a relevant discussion is really Web 2.0 seems to be fueled by  or it needs to be fueled by on-site advertising. So if it doesn't, you know, it's got to work if

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Web 2.0 is going to work. I don't know how relevant is this? I think people out there are going to  fall asleep. That's why I was trying to make it relevant. All right, fine. All right, enough of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that. You didn't go to DEF CON, Kevin. Is this the first time you didn't go this year? I know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I missed it. Well, you know, growing up in Vegas, I went quite a bit, but it is one of those things  where I just have time to break away this year. I think that's probably why Patrick is not with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I forgot that he probably is at DEF CON. Yeah, he told me he was going. Yeah. So and he's smart  enough not to try to use the internet while at DEF CON. Do you see the Mac OS X hack? 30 second  hack. Is that scary? That's scary. That's really scary. Would somebody clarify for me? Because I  can't tell from the coverage and I have been too lazy to watch the video. Did they use a third  party Wi-Fi card or the built in Wi-Fi card? Nobody knows. It was the built in one. See,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's scary. Explain to people out there what happened because I don't think anybody's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  everybody's... It was a demo I think originally done at Black Hat and then I think they might have  done it again at DEF CON, but a couple of hackers. Now this is where it gets a little dicey. They  didn't do the demo live because they didn't want people to know how to do it. They also were pains  to point out it's not a specific Mac issue. It's a problem with many Wi-Fi drivers, including many  Wi-Fi drivers on Windows, but they were able to own a Macbook getting in through the Wi-Fi drivers  because basically Wi-Fi is promiscuous in 30 seconds in this video. And you know, Intel shortly  after this came out updated their drivers. I don't know if they fixed that flaw in their own drivers,  but apparently it's still an issue. I did get a Mac update a couple of days ago. I don't know if

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they fixed that or not. I don't believe so. A friend of mine from Apple said that they're working

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on it right now. So I don't know. Does it mean that if you walk out into the wild world with

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  your Wi-Fi on you're vulnerable? Well, I don't think the exploit has been released to the public,  so only a small group of people will have this. Well, or rather we don't know how many people have

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it because the whole point of not releasing an exploit like this to the public is it presumes  that they're the first people who ever discovered it. I'm a full disclosure guy. I think it's pretty  silly to say, you know, trust us. We're the only ones who figured it out. No one else will figure  it out, especially now that we've told everyone that it can be done and given them hints of which  direction to try. I'd actually be pretty concerned. What do we do? Which sucks for me because I have a  Mac book. Yeah, me too. The good thing about Wi-Fi hacks, I think from a security perspective,  is that you're only vulnerable to people within a couple hundred feet of you most of the time,  as opposed to, you know, OS level vulnerabilities where you're potentially vulnerable to much  larger pools of potential attackers. So if there are only 10 people in the world who care enough  about you or are malicious enough and indiscriminate enough to attack you, the chances of them being  within 300 yards of you are a lot less than the chances of them being connected to the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  somewhere in the world. Any other interesting hacks at DEFCON? Well, I think they pointed out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that the RFID chips that are being used, I think maybe from next year in US passports,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  were easily cloned. Yeah, they cloned the passports. Actually, they cloned European passports,  yes? Yeah, also because they're using the RFID as well. They read them with, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they were partially open as well as I understand it, which is of course one of the big concerns is  that you, speaking of discriminant and indiscriminate, if there's an attacker out there who doesn't care  which American they attack, provided that they're attacking Americans, then if these passports are  even partially open, it appears that they can be read potentially at a great distance.  If they're closed, they're somehow shielded? Yeah, I think that the actual passport  material it's covered has some sort of shielding property. I don't know if they've embedded some

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  kind of Faraday mesh in it or something. Seems pretty weird. It's like the old tin foil argument,  isn't it? Well, cover your passport in tin foil and you won't get, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  people be huddled over their passports when they open them. Well, you know, for at least a year now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there have been a couple of border crossings, one in Canada and one in Mexico, land crossings  into the U.S. where foreigners who come in have been issued RFID readable cards that they're  intended to carry at all times that are potentially readable at great distances. Like a visa?  Yeah, well, no, more like a prisoner ankle brace for that matter. Geez, Louise. They give it to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  every foreigner in the United States. They go through every, everyone who goes through has to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  wear one. These two crossings, it's a pilot program, not wear them, but carry them. It's a  pilot program. Oh my goodness. One is in, as I recall, upstate New York into Ontario and then  the other one was somewhere in Mexico. I forget what state it came out of. And as a Canadian,  you have to do that. Well, if I cross at that crossing. Oh, just take and throw it out.  Well, yeah, that sounds like a good theory, John, until like you run afoul of the Department of  Homeland Security who discovered that you've committed some technical violation and used it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  at the base of the program. Now you're in Gitmo, baby. How many times have you been stopped, Corey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lots. I've been in and out of the United States on different visas for seven years now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He carries that metallic bill of rights in his wallet. I know. And I carry the metallic bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've had a lot of problems at the American border at various times for various reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what is a lot of problems to you? Because I have problems myself when I come in from Canada.  But you're a US citizen, there's a difference. I know they still give you a bad time, especially  if you just come in from Canada. Last time I came back, they're grilling me why I went to Canada in  the first place as if it was like some horrible place I shouldn't be going. Yeah. And it's really

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  tough when you're trying to explain what you do for a living when what you do for a living is  something that's not readily explicable. And then there are all these trick questions like, well,  you write novels. Will you be working on these novels while you're in America? Do you have a visa  to write novels while you're in America? Oh my, is that a trick question? If you say yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't even know what the answer to that is. You need a work permit to write a novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And will you be blogging while you're in America? Is the blogging for an American firm,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with the servers in Toronto, I'm not really sure. So one of the things they have, my people as it  were, the border guys in Port Angeles, Washington, where I cross a lot, they tell us sometimes some  of the things you have to look out for in the next upcoming cycle. And the last one we were told is  that when you come, because we always bring a lot of Roger's chocolates. Oh, I can't wait. Yeah,  from Victoria. Oh, I'm excited. I'm going there in a couple of weeks. There's a trick question  coming up, which is that will these, if you're bringing food, will this be a gift? And you have  to answer no. I'm eating it myself. It's all for personal consumption because apparently if it's  a gift, there's some new rule about that. They're going to just confiscate the chocolate and eat it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  themselves. I go into Canada monthly and actually it's a very smooth process. I have a work permit.  So the Canadian crossing is pretty straightforward. I do notice the customs guards sometimes are in a  bad mood. But I mean, everybody gets in a bad mood, but I haven't yet been harassed. So you're paying taxes up there Leo?  Yeah, absolutely. I get paid in Canadian dollars too. I found US and Canadian customs guards often

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to be very surly compared particularly to British ones. I lived in the UK for three years and they  were pretty good about it. My passport went through the laundry and the British Home Office  charges 500 pounds to glue your visa into a new passport. And so I'm just still using it.  And I've got a lot of other visas glued in there too that I just don't want to. So is it soft and  fuzzy now? A little furry? It's a little, yeah, it looks like a little water damaged. And generally  speaking, they've been cool about it. Most border crossings are cool, but the British ones always say  it went through the laundry, didn't it? And I say, why yes it did. And they say, welcome back to Britain, sir.  And they give it a little stamp. I like that. The crazy ones were the Russians who went berserk over this.  Yeah. I've got a theory that the more border hassle there is, the less likely it is that you  ever want to sneak into that country in the first place. The two biggest ones I've had in the last  year were Uganda and Russia. I don't know who's going there to steal jobs from, you know, lucrative  jobs from Russians, man. My family just wants to get out. I'm smuggling rubles. Yeah, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They gave me when I went in, of course it was in a cruise ship, but they gave me a red thing. It's  like a red bookmark in my passport. It's like a day pass, but it didn't say anything. It was just a  piece of plastic. And then as you're going out, they collect it back. I mean, it was the most primitive  means I could think of to kind of, I guess, count people coming and going. I don't know what it was  all about. It seems to me there's a, exactly, there's a country where they do it just at a habit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's no rationale. I met someone who works for the State Department when the  Soviet Union was falling apart who worked on advising former Soviet republics on border  formalities. And one thing that she discovered is that because everyone who was in a position of  power in those countries had the experience of going to the U.S. and getting the full visit to  Dr. Jellyfinger, you know, full at-reco-pro, background check, everything, that they decided  that was the mark of a civilized country. Oh dear. And they wanted to show that they were as grown up  as America was. And so as a consequence, everyone who came in and out of their country was going to  have to spend a day lining up at their embassy in some country somewhere else to get a full-page

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  visa glued into their passport. Isn't that adult. You come into the States frequently,  Will. Do they give you the eye scan and the thumbprint? Oh yeah, you've got the full bonanza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they're generally, they're pretty professional about it. Apart from I saw one guy,  one customs official pulled a gun on somebody for chatting on their cell phone in the queue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, that's the funny thing, he pulled his gun. I saw the same thing happen. He didn't pull  his gun, but he was infuriated as if that somehow he'd violated some, you know, terrorist ban. He

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was talking on the cell phone. It wasn't even as he approached, it was in the line. You're not supposed to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  everybody, you know, texts their girlfriends or whatever. Actually it rang. He didn't even

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to pick it up. It just rang and the guy flew off the campus. There are signs all over the place,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, in San Francisco, that you're not supposed to have your cell phone on. Because it's impolite?  No, because they don't want people saying, okay, there's only so-and-so's not working,  aisle three, go there because you can smuggle the goods in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, we can play movie plot threats all we want. But like if the test for whether or not  we're going to implement some security measure is whether we can imagine some new quantum of  security arising from it and not whether it's worth the trade-off that you pay. Like, you know,  one of the things I've noticed is that when you land in America, they give you a very long form  to fill out that has a lot of questions that you might need to phone someone to get the answer to.  Hey, what's your zip code person I'm staying with? And so, you know, it can't just be well. We can  imagine some sequence in which doing this might make us secure from some attack and that's it.  That's something that we need to secure ourselves. I mean, that way, if we're going to keep doing  that, we might as well tranquilize or dart everyone on the airplane. We'd be more secure,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  technically. Yeah, blindfold and hood them before they come into the country. If I pulled out my  blackberry and started typing, would they pull a gun on me? I think they should shoot you just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for having a blackberry. Just for doing that. So what we're talking about, San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Worldwide Developers Conference, baby. Yeah. Kevin, do you have the scoop?  Oh, I don't this year. It sucks. You, you, you were the guy who predicted the nano. That's right.  I have my insider, but they're gone now. Oh, yeah. You know why they're gone.  Yes, I do. Well, the rumors are an Apple phone. I don't see that happening. Anybody,  anybody believe there'll be an Apple cell phone? No. That's the last business they'd want to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  into. Yeah. I think that being beholden to the music industry is enough. They also want to be  beholden to the, to the carriers. Those, those, those tarragons of forward thinking. AT&T take

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  me away. How about, I think it's pretty clear they'll do a Conroe desktop. Yes. They have to.  Yep. Everybody else has done one. They're going to have the chips,  not in great supply, but they'll have them. Will they do a, here's the question. Will they do a  four way? What do you think, Will? You were the one singing the praises of a four way Conroe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only if they decide to introduce the Mac Pro. I mean, Mac Pro, I guess could hit. I'd love to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  see a four chip. Oh, four chip. I thought you meant four way. I was sure they were going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'll definitely do four way though, but it would be effectively. Yeah, but it's not,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's not going to involve a computer. What will it involve? Oh, bro. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't been reading the Dvorak blog lately. I'm sorry. I have to catch up. So, hey, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just to change the subject. No, not yet. We haven't defeated all the rumors. Oh, please. Come on.  There's gotta be something good in there. This is like the non news section of the show. No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you see the picture that was taken through the window of the conference? Yes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all the new icons. Is that what you're talking about? And then there's another one that says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  introducing. Oh, stop the presses. Stop the presses. New icons. No, no, no, no. That's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. What is this one though? It says Mac OS X Leopard introducing.  Vista 2.0. Vista 2.0. Is that their selling point? Oh, I guess it is. I get it. Yeah. All right.  It's a little bit better than Vista. Oh boy, that's something to brag about.  Better take trade, yeah. All right. There's nothing to say in other words,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  nothing to see here. Move on. Hey, I got this story that's been overlooked by everybody. Good.  This is the 15th last Tuesday and nobody covered it. The World Wide Web.  Yeah. What happened? How come it didn't get it? We've got very little play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It turns 15 on August 6th. That's the day that the links to the computer code for the World Wide Web  were put on alt.hypertext so that others could download it and play with it. So in a way,  this is the day the World Wide Web was born. Today. I'm sorry. Today, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was on a Tuesday on August 6th in 1991. The original memo is floating around the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of, yeah, that's the nice thing about the news groups. You can see Linus Torvalds' first  Linux posting. You can see the first posting of the World Wide Web. I think that's kind of cool.  So, what? What do you want to have? A cake?  What should we do? Yeah, and Kevin's buy-in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's dance. Yeah. A $60 million cake. Albertans. Luckies. I'll make it happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I think it's worth certainly nodding a hat. 15 years. It's not very long, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems bizarre to have existed in an age without the internet now, doesn't it? Because it's just so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  opivational. Well, you're 23, right? You're the youngest on the page. So you were eight years old  when this happened. I, on the other hand, was 35. So, I mean. I just remember getting to 13 and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  suddenly desperately clamoring my parents to try and get me a 28K modem. I was like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  please get me on the internet, please. Kevin, you were 15. Do you remember the first time you saw,  it was probably Lynx or something. I remember seeing the web on Lynx was the first time I saw

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it, I think. Yes. Mine was all through kind of bulletin boards. I started off with an email that  was tossers through BBSs. So I really didn't have access to the true worldwide web at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember being on the well, which was essentially a BBS, but you could drop into Shell,  a Shell account on the well, and then you could run Lynx. And this must have been right,  you know, 1990, 1991. Must have been fairly early. And I just, I remember kind of the  overwhelming feeling that there's a lot of, that the world is a big place. There's a lot of people  out there on the internet. It was kind of an interesting experience. And of course,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there weren't very many relatively at the time. I had just dropped out of university to be a CD-ROM  programmer for Bob Stein in New York, just around, you know, three months before that all melted down.  And so I found myself without anything to do. And so I decided that I would see if any ad agency  wanted to pay me to develop a gopher site for them. And I actually talked an ad agency into it.  And halfway through the project, I walked in and said, you've got to see Mosaic. It kicks ass.  There's going to be hundreds of websites someday. Hundreds. Why don't we do that instead? And we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. That's cool. And there were hundreds. And you were right. Two minutes. Yeah. It is, it is pretty,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do remember the first time I saw Mosaic because that, I mean, going from links to Mosaic was  probably an equal jump where you have a graphical browser all of a sudden. Then it made sense.  Then it really made sense. And I remember the first time I saw an animated GIF,  but that's another, that's a story for another day.  What was the first thing you had to find out about whether it was GIF or GIF?  Yeah. Oh, it's GIF. I think it's GIF. I think I should say GIF. Somebody sent me the link to  the page where the guy who invented it is a little bit testy about the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like, it's like the famous, my name is Linus Torvalds and I pronounce Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they still, do you still, I don't think, I think probably people who install SUSE these days  don't hear that anymore. And that's a shame. That used to be the sound test when you got  your sound card working. You'd hear Linus say that. I love that. Actually, people are getting  at Linux pre-installed for the first time ever. Lenovo is putting SUSE

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on ThinkPads. I think that's pretty exciting. Even as we speak, I'm installing Ubuntu on a  ThinkPad that finally arrived from Lenovo after several, well, more than, more than two months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it had, it had windows on it though, when you got it, no doubt. Yeah, I don't know. I pulled

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the hard drive out. I bought the cheapest smallest hard drive they have and then bought a third  party drive. You didn't even look. I didn't even look. No, it's, I mean, it's on a shelf here. I'm  probably going to use it to put MP3s on or something. Isn't that funny? So are you, you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you've gone to Linux now. You've kind of abandoned Mac for Linux? Well, no, like I said, I'm, I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  presently, while we're on the phone, just, just clicking a bunch of okays as I'm installing,  like, like it was yesterday that the last part of this machine arrived from Lenovo. I went through,  through Lenovo hell getting this machine. So, so far Advantage Apple in terms of, in terms of the  experience of actually getting the hardware shipped to you, Lenovo is pathetic. But I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  remember reading about you and others saying, maybe it's time to abandon this closed source,  you know, proprietary thing called OS 10 and move to Linux. How are you feeling about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so for me, there were a bunch of things that drove that. I mean, the mailer switching  to individual files that were no longer inbox files that I couldn't extract. I mean, the number  of successful migrations I've had of my mail over the years is very large, but it, it, it,  when it goes into those proprietary chunks, then you lose stuff. I mean, I lost a hundred thousand  mails moving away from, um, entourage at one point and swore never again, inbox files for me forever.  Yep. And you know, I now I've got a couple million pieces of archive email and I'm just scared that  I'm never going to get it out. And I'm, you know, I've got aperture in my arm, like a, like a junkie  and I want to get out of there. I want to get my photo, metadata out before my photo collection gets  so big that I'll be stuck there forever. But the big one for me, and it's kind of a theoretical risk,  but it was getting time for me to buy a new computer. And I was looking at the new Macbooks,  which looked pretty fast, but they're the only implementers of trusted computing in the world  who aren't members, as far as I know, who aren't members of the trusted computing group.  And members of the trusted computing group actually have to tell you what they're doing  with the trusted computing chip. It's part of their agreement. This is the TPM chip that Intel,  everyone assumes. And I think they're right that all Apple is going to do with this is try to lock  the OS to the hardware, but that doesn't, but if you don't know what they've done with it,  then you don't know what a bad guy might potentially do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is interesting. I didn't know they're going to implement TPM, but they're not members of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  group. And they're not members of the group and they haven't told anyone what they've done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's no oversight at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And there's no disclosure. And I just feel like, you know, that's a,  you know, the old, like if there's a gun on the mantelpiece and act one, it's going to go off by  act three. I think once you start designing computers so that they take orders from people  other than their owners, you know, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a gun on the  mantle that's just waiting to take off. I mean, you know, people talk about, oh, we'll make the  computer more secure. We'll make, we'll, we'll enhance your privacy. And then they design it  in such a way so that a remote party can control it even against your wishes. That's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there is TPM on your Lenovo, but of course Ubuntu doesn't pay attention to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not in drivers. So I could have bought a new MacBook and paid the thousand dollar Steve Jobs  tax and installed Ubuntu on it. I'm going to do that with my old, I got a couple of,  one, six, seven G four power books here. I buy machines in pairs because I can't really  have any downtime and I just keep them in things. And when one goes into the shop,  I just switch to the other one. So I've got a couple of these here and I'm going to keep  one running Mac OS just for whatever it is. I can't get out of it. And then the other one  I'm going to, I'm going to get it running Ubuntu. You know, you know, I find there's something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  interesting about this conversation. One, somehow Leo switched back to talking about the Macintosh  again, but secondly, secondly is the comment that Corey just made that when one's in the shop,  I have never had a computer go in the shop and you're talking to Macintosh going into the shop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't know Corey. I've seen his power books with the curved like a U.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I had a machine with an 18 degree bend in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't understand John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're wearing the lead gloves when you type. I mean, or this thing just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am a clutz. You know, I, I, I'm not as bad like Charlie Strauss is pretty hard on his hardware.  The other science fiction writer in Scotland, I've actually seen him take a new machine and  strip all the paint off the keys that, that label the keys in three months of typing,  but I'm still pretty hard on my machines and I'm a big clutz and I drop them and I carry them  everywhere. He must write really thick books. He does. And he writes them fast too. He wants  for a hundred thousand word book in 10 days. Pounding them. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, 10,000 words a day for 10 days in a row. That's pretty good. That's, that's the match you  can do. I talked to a lot of writers about their speeds and what they can do.  You can't think faster than that. The damn good novel too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it? Man, I can't imagine that. What is it? How many words, how many words a day do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think you do John? About 700. How about you, Corey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, it depends on whether you count blogging, but, um, on novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not counting blogging. I mean, I'm not counting blogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just wrote, I just wrote a hundred thousand word novel eight weeks from the day I thought  of it to the day I finished it. Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, novel writers have to crank out a lot more than essay writers and it's a different

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  kind of business. It's different kind of writing, but still that's a, that's a lot of words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. That's amazing. It was a, that was a death march.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Corey, can you do 10,000 words a day? Yeah. There were a couple of 10,000 word days

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  in there. It was a real death march. There were, there were a couple of,  on my anniversary in Rome, I was getting up at five in the morning to work on this book.  It took hold of me and I just couldn't stop working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, that's the thing. You enjoyed it. It was a death march, but you were, you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  expressing, you were enjoying it, right? I don't know if I enjoyed it as the word.  I couldn't stop writing it. Ah, that's an interesting experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I've tried to do 10,000 words. The most I've ever done was about six and it's like  very difficult to go on beyond that. It's very, it's just hard to do. I mean, it's just like why?  But people crank out 10 and I've known, I know a lot of writers who could do 10. It's like,  it's like a Holy grail of high production writing. High speed writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin, how many words a day do you write? None.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  None. Emails.  Yeah. I get through, I get through a couple hundred emails a day.  If you count email, that could actually add up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely. None of that counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think with blogging, I'm writing like 700,000 words a year.  Geez. Which is pretty wild. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's like Elrond Hubbard great. Is that mostly boing boing or is it a Crap Hound 2?  It's mostly boing boing. Mostly boing boing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You can start a religion next.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not that hard.  I'm a whoopie-tologist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You may not get Tom Cruise, but you could have Tom Cruise's doughy or younger brother.  That's right. I'll do it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We need a disciple to throw to the feds when they get onto us. Blame it all on him.  It's his fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I think the first convert would have to be Kevin Rose because he's the one with all the  money.  That's right. Who's going to buy your gold Rolls-Royces?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do you feel about being chained to a volcano by a galactic tyrant named Zinoo  and then turned into an energy being by nuclear bomb?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll make a special place for you.  So is it a big deal that I'm sorry, not IBM, Lenovo is shipping. I think this is the first  time anybody like Lenovo has actually shipped think pads or laptops with SUSE pre-installed,  right? I mean, that's unusual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Not a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not like they're pushing that on the consumer.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And the people buying Lenovo are like businesses and businesses just want  Windows to integrate with their Windows networks. And anybody that really wants SUSE will just put  it on whatever they own themselves.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I literally have installed the Buntu while on this phone call. And I tell you, it was  slipper than something through a goose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Buntu's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, there's like a huge mental leap to get over to like, I'm going to buy a machine and I'm  going to install this weird hacker OS on it that was developed by a large community and not by a  company. But the actual experience of sticking a CD in the drive, turning it on and clicking install  is so easy. I mean, so easy. And everything just worked. I mean, I'm like running like nobody's  business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No driver issues with Wi-Fi or anything like that?  Nothing.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, there's a company that will sell you, I forget what they're called, but they'll sell you  machines with Linux installed. And I almost bought from them. They charge like an extra 800 bucks.  And I spoke to a couple of friends, actually, Chris DeBona, who convinced me that I didn't need to do  it, but it would just be dead easy. All I need to do is basically turn it on, stick the CD in, and  everything else is gravy. Probably harder when you've got a machine that you want to actually keep  some other OS on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? You put it running on a Mac, right?  No, no, no.  No, no.  No, no.  Oh, it was a no-buoy thing.  Hey, by the way, just to make so people don't think I'm just a Mac basher, but there is one Mac  story I guess we should bring up. The MacBook explodes story. I think that's priceless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's only fair because we talked about the Dell exploding, and now it's actually an old  PowerBook, not the newer ones. But there was a recall, battery recall. I sent in my PowerBook  battery and got a new one. In fact, I think there's a recall now on the MacBook Pro batteries as well.  These lithium ion batteries, they can be scary. Did you see the picture with a hole  burning the aluminum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think the manufacturers, this is what happens when we get all these machines coming in  from some of these. There may be some sketchy battery makers in China, I'm convinced of it.  And I think we're just getting some, because it never happened before China took over manufacturing  all these machines.  It's the Chinese.  It is.  They're ruining it for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, did you see the Apple knowledge base article about my laptop produces too much heat?  No, what does it say?  Because there's been all sorts of complaints that the MacBooks are too hot, and you know,  the worries that they might explode. And Apple's got an article up on the knowledge base that says,  my laptop's too hot, what should I do? And they basically say, the problem of having too much heat  from laptops is not exclusive to Apple, we recommend you use your laptop on a desk.  It's a desktop.  And it's like, yeah, yeah, thanks for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the scary thing about these explosions though, is that when they're happening,  I mean, they're in sleep mode.  Yeah.  And it's just overnight, these people are at least this guy here, he fell asleep,  and all of a sudden the apartments filled with smoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It scares me because it wasn't even plugged in, as I remember.  So I mean, there's no predicting it.  I mean, I'm hesitant now to leave laptops lying around in my office or at home.  I put them all out in the front step if anybody wants to come by and  pick them up.  I have stone front steps.  The United States has ratified the cyber crime treaty.  It's actually, Corey, we should get you to comment on it because it's a European thing.  It's the international treaty seeking to address internet crimes by harmonizing national laws.  Originally a convention signed by 38 European nations, now the US is  a signatory as well as Canada, Japan and South Africa.  Treaty approved, actually US has been a signatory treaty has been ratified now by the Senate.  I don't know anything about the treaty, Corey, is it anything to be concerned about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I don't know much about it either because I've been in the middle of moving  to Los Angeles, but I got an email from Danny O'Brien who's kind of got some of my duties  at EFF right now and he was not happy about this.  He was pretty worried, but I don't know much about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is what they say, and when I hear this sentence I always get scared.  This treaty provides important tools in the battle against terrorism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In other words, they're going to put some spyware in so they can stop people from  pirating songs so the RIA gets out of the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's usually WIPO, that's not usually the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This also is protecting against attacks on computer networks and  the sexual exploitation of children over the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, go ahead, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just going to say then you're right, it's probably not about stealing music,  it's just about spying on people so they can make sure that they vote Republican  when the next election comes around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the problem that there was with it was that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did I say that? I'm sorry, I was just joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  According to the EFF, this is a quote I think, the treaty requires that the US government  help enforce other countries' cybercrime laws even if the act being prosecuted is not illegal  in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The countries that have laws limited to free speech on the internet could oblige the FBI  to uncover the identities of anonymous critics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think John was actually right. This is targeted against all of MP3  because of course they get away with it because it's legal in Russian law.  Now if Russia becomes a signatory, they're required to enforce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If Russia became a signatory and they ratified it and you could get their police to enforce it,  this is actually I think more in the other direction.  You posted something that was critical to Singaporean government and that's illegal  in Singapore and they want to prosecute you in the United States for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll give you a good example. There's a big brouhaha in Canada over hate sites, anti-Semitic  sites, which of course are protected in the US under free speech. In fact, the Simon Wiesenthal  Center in Los Angeles has said it's a problem because these guys, this is kind of the opposite  what you usually hear, they just offshore into the United States where it's legal and we can't go  after them. That's a good example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's plenty of examples of people who've tried to pull that stunt and if they  ever try traveling, like if you go to the EU and you broke some law, like the Nazi stuff that goes  on because you posted it here, there's guys have been arrested like in the Netherlands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We arrested the British betting baron, bet on sports. He's set foot, bad travel agent by the  way. He was on his way to Costa Rica and they booked him through Texas. Big mistake.  I wonder whose idea that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bad travel agent. Oh, don't worry. We've got a great flight for you. You just have to stop in  Dallas for a little bit and then it's on to Costa Rica and all the fun and games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's an outrageous British accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's terrible. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that. That was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wasn't that the Australian guy who wrestled the Alligators?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was crying. He was doing my crocodile dandy. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.  Technica said that this is the worst internet law ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what Danny called it on the FF website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. In fact, EFF sent out that message about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guarantee there's going to be worse. This is the way things are going. There's one thing that  concerns me when you talk about this kind of thing. In Canada, because I used to write for  a number of Canadian publications and I've got the lecture about this. I'm always worried about  if I go to Canada after having called somebody at Intel a monopolist because it's against the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  law to call somebody a monopolist in Canada. I have to be very careful now. I spend a lot  of time in Canada. I should probably study up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As a Canadian, I should point out that it's not against the law to call someone a monopolist.  It's against the law to libel someone. If they're not a monopolist and you call them monopolists,  then they might be able to get a judgment against you. The problem is that where you have  classes of speech that are unlawful like that isn't necessarily that you will get found guilty.  It's that you might find yourself at the other end of a frivolous lawsuit. You get litigious  people who use the threat of the law. In the U.S. where it's relatively hard to actually get  a judgment against someone for libel because of the First Amendment. I mean, libel is illegal  here too, but the First Amendment can be held up as a defense against it. It's way less chilling  for someone to write to you and say, ah, you libeled me and I'll see you in court because  you know that it's unlikely, for example, that an attorney is going to take it on a contingency basis.  And we have slap laws and so forth that will protect you.  There's some shield laws in the United States as well, or in Canada as well, but it's more like  attorneys won't do it on a contingency basis because it's way less of a slam dunk. So you're  not as likely to find someone who'll just go out and do the suing for free. So unless you piss off  a really rich Yahoo, they're not going to find an attorney who's going to hound you until you  pay them enough money to make them go away. I do think that the key to this and the reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the EFF calls it such a bad law is that we're required now to enforce bad net laws in the U.S.  and vice versa. Who has the worst net laws though? Is it us or some other guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it'd be China or another country like China, but China's got some pretty bad internet laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't know if they're, are they a signatory? I don't know. I don't think they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's mostly European countries. I mean, for example, one might be, you know, Germany,  where it's where it's completely legal to sell or talk about anything relating to Nazis basically.  And because in the, in the U.S. you could say that fairly, fairly freely, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the Germans have prosecuted Yahoo in Germany, forcing them not to sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But now they can prosecute Yahoo in the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems contrary to the whole notion of a global internet, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ultimately, that's, I think the biggest problem with this is that it encourages people to  Balkanize the internet even further and, and for there to be a German internet and a British  internet and an American internet and an American government internet and American  public school internet and an American library, federally funded library internet.  And for all these internet to be different and for them not to be writeable to one another.  And, you know, it's part of a trend that includes things like the network neutrality fight and,  and also fights over liabilities for ISPs where you've got ISPs who are being encouraged to block  certain ports or protocols where, you know, we started talking about the 15th anniversary of the  web. That depended on it being possible for a guy to just in his office invent a protocol and  a client and a server for it and send it around to people all over the world. And for that to  just work without needing permission from anyone in the middle of the network. No one had to go  to a system and say, open port 80 for me, please, or a government and say, you know, the web is  good and will never be used for evil. I promise. Therefore you should allow us to have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree 100%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's depressing us. Let's go on to another topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, if you're going to get depressed a little bit more, it was the feds threatening to  sue the county of Maine, if it probes Verizon and the NSA.  Oh, really? The state of Maine?  Which is along the same lines, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  RIAA in court suing Limewire saying they want damages of $150,000 per illegally traded file,  which I think is more money than there is in the actual world. I don't know if they'll get that.  Maybe they'll get a small percentage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The intention there is, I think, just to scare the hell out of anyone who ever thinks about  investing in a technology that might upset someone's apple cart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, Kazaa settled just last week or a couple of weeks ago for $115 million and seems to have  gotten off the hook with a lot cheaper than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Kazaa is over with though. They said that they're introducing new filtering technology and  they're basically going completely legit now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what killed Napster, right? They couldn't do that. They couldn't figure out how to do that.  So that's interesting. What will happen to Kazaa if they filter out all copyright violations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, just they'll have 30,000 users that buy songs and that'll be the end of it.  It's just because people don't know how to install any other software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they can do that because they have Skype. They don't really need Kazaa anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think one of the big worries about the Kazaa settlement is that no one really knows whether or  not their settlement includes indemnity for their users. So it may in fact be that while Kazaa has  gotten itself off the hook, its customers are still potentially on the hook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think they turned over their logs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, even if they haven't turned over their logs, you'd think that in a settlement like that,  where they're settling for all the bad deeds that they're stipulating to and settling for all the  bad deeds that they would say, and we want you to shield our customers too, the people who we

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  advise to download and use this software. Interesting. So what do you think will happen  with LimeWire? Will they settle? They don't have the deep pockets, certainly, that Kazaa has.  They'll just fold. Sounds like they'll fold. How do you fight something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just fold. Walk.  Walk away. Judgment proof, it's called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, please. You guys see that Segway? FCC approved a Bluetooth transmitter for Segway.  Yeah, what do you think they're up to? I don't know. People are thinking that it  might have something to do with allowing Segways to communicate with each other so they can travel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in formation. That's a scary thought. I think it's so they can have them recall.  They're just sending out a big signal. Make them all drive back to New Hampshire, wherever they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  belong. I could see swarming Segways in beautiful formations, all coordinated by Bluetooth.  Just get them out of here. It's art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What could they be? Yeah, I saw that. Attack of the Segways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What could they be doing? Because Bluetooth only goes 30 feet. I mean, it's not a long range.  And so does the Segway. In between charges? All right.  I thought that was interesting. No, that's okay. You don't like Segways. You don't have to like them.  Kevin, when you get your 60 million, will you buy a Segway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the Segway, the problem with them, besides the price being so expensive,  I think Steve Jobs hit it right in the head. If you ever saw his kind of notes from the meeting  that he had when he went to see the Segways pitch, he said, they just, you look dorky  riding around on it. You know, it's you kind of just standing up and it's just, it's not as cool  as it. I don't know. I can't see a whole lot of people just really going out and buying these,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  even if they're cheap. You see somebody on one, they're tough. First of all, they're tall.  And they're just kind of ungainly. They look like giraffes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I had, you know, I, I, that's a comment I always made too. And I, but I'm going to defend  the other side for just a quick second, where I, where I think it actually works to be in that,  that kind of tall dorky look I've noticed this in the, in Chicago at the one.  Nobody mugs you.  In Chicago, one of the main parks that the security all around that, that thing, there's a big  kind of a grandstand kind of thing there. And all the security guys are on Segways and they got the,  and they, they're kind of formidable, you know, and they come driving up to you and they stop  right in front of you.  Helps to have a gun in a uniform.  That might help.  That makes it a little less dorky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  That's why they use mounted cops in protests. They're very effective on a big horse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The worst is tourists in old European cities like Florence on Segway.  Do they do that?  They just look so dorky. Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have Segway tourists up here in San Francisco and they're very, they're expensive,  but they're very popular. But I would, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're dangerous though. I've had a couple of friends that seriously just, you know,  you get on there and they give you like a 10 minute instruction.  They don't give you enough training.  And then you kill yourself pretty much. I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe the Bluetooth will help.  AOL, this is an interesting business strategy.  Stop charging for broadband customers, give away five gigabytes of storage,  and then fire one quarter of your workforce.  All in the same few days, 5,000 people will be laid off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, at least they got rid of their retention department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They really? After that famous call?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Consumerist had a good editorial about this. They actually did.  They got rid of the whole thing.  And actually, consumerists have had some good posts this week  as people who are now no longer feared, fearful of getting fired  are posting some good dish about how that department is running.  Guys who used to walk in and say, you know, if you don't retain 10 people today,  you're fired. You ever been on a bread line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my God. Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You get me a picture of Spider-Man by seven o'clock and you're fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why they had to do this though. I mean, they dropped, they dropped 30% of their  business of their membership in the last couple of years.  They want to go advertising based, absolutely free.  Will it save AOL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  AOL doesn't need saving.  I think it does. You don't think it needs saving?  I remember years and years ago, remember when we both did the site,  we got into a debate about AOL back then and you were an AOL basher.  And that was before the stock ran up.  You would have been a multimillionaire if you put your money in it.  I never claimed to be smart.  Historically, you have just been an AOL basher.  I've noticed this. I can document it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are they doing with the garden? Is the garden going away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the idea. The walled garden is gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no more AOL software. You install this, you have AOL 12.0 or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's their plan. But it's hard to say.  They obviously will have to maintain that for their dial-up customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I heard that they were just going to turn it into a bunch of news stories  that AOL users could vote on by AOLing them up or AOLing them down.  And then they're going to hire all the best people from that Netscape page.  They're going to pay them money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be fair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's awesome.  Kevin likes that idea.  There's only one idea and everybody just keeps reusing it over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Monetizing the strategic inflection points on the global data network, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Let me write that down.  Hold on. Let me put blog that way.  That's brilliant. Brilliant.  I have a website I'd like to recommend people check out.  What would that be, John?  Have you seen Goggles?  The Google Map flight simulator?  Oh yeah, I did see that.  Yeah, you fly around a little biplane in New York or Tokyo or Washington.  And you get to strafe the place.  I love it.  So you get to blow and get to bomb London.  So anyway, if anyone out there wants to check it out, it's isoma.net slash games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm starting to think the single most brilliant thing Google did is ever,  is this giving out this API for the Google Maps.  Yeah, it's genius.  They've got more mileage out of that than practically anything else they've done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, I'll have a link to it on the blog for anyone looking for it.  You probably will too.  Goggles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So did you guys see Worksafe?  If we're talking about interesting links this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, tell us about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Worksafe is a proxy that...  So it disguises whatever website you're looking at because it's a proxy  and gets around your network's stupid firewall.  And then the other thing that it does is it reformats everything.  It scrapes it and reformats it so it looks like you're working on a Word file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the...  Brilliant!  Leo, what's the URL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's called, I think, Worksafe.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's unbelievable.  It's how cool it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Workfriendly.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're all going there right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a tool bar is replaced and it actually has the Word tool bar.  So like the bold and the italicized.  It's amazing.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this done through Ajax?  Is that how they're doing?  Oh, look at that.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a great thing.  I think they just pull the page and then rewrite it.  And then the other thing that I thought was cool this week was Dan Kaminsky's  network neutrality test that came out of Black Hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he's got this thing he calls TCP-based active probing for faults.  Dan's got a lot of signal virtues, but coming up with catchy names for his discoveries.  He's not one of them.  Yeah.  No, but basically he's got a thing that he says if a lot of people ran it and  pointed a lot of different hosts, we would get a pretty good picture of which ISPs were  throttling which hosts.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  And that's great.  I mean, we need that whether or not you think network neutrality should or shouldn't happen  or regulation should or shouldn't be there.  We, I think people do have the right to know how the internet's performing and how their  ISP performs with the internet and whether there's any jiggery-pokery going on there.  And this is a great idea.  I think this is awesome.  Has he put that client?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the name of it again?  Yeah.  URIL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It may not have put the client up yet.  I mean, it just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On Slash.org.  Or no, it was on Computer World.  They did something similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did something similar with testing to see if ISPs would allow address spoofing and  were collecting data.  Who was it?  It was NYU or somebody were collecting data.  Cornell.  I think it's a good way to do it.  Have the internet test it.  You get enough members, enough people out there testing.  You have a very good map of what's going on on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, that tells you a lot of stuff.  Will, back on the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Will, I don't know if you know about this.  If you have a BTDSL line, there's some Chinese host that you can't reach  from, or even a BT Resolve one.  We had like a Blue Yonder one when we were living in London.  There are a bunch of Chinese hosts you can't reach from the UK because Sprint is their  default route and Sprint had a fiber break in the UK like a year ago and they haven't  updated their routing cables and no one's fixing this, right?  So this doesn't just catch network neutrality problems.  It catches the fact that, you know, your ISP is just like lazy and badly managed too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We assume that it's just all there and it's all available and it's not always obvious  if it's not.  I mean, how would you even discover such a thing?  You wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You wouldn't without something like this.  Yeah.  I'd love to get bundled into like Google toolbar.  Those guys are like hardcore about fighting for network neutrality.  Having millions of hosts or in Alexa too, that's another business whose fortunes rise  and fall on this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the name again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dan Kaminsky's site is Docs Para, like ParaDocs, docpara.com.  And then this was, I put it on Boeing One this week, but it was originally a Computer  World.  If you go to Computer World and you search for Kaminsky, K-A-M-I-N-S-K-Y, you know,  turn right up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's great.  And I hope that he releases this client to people so that we can all use it.  And I think you're right.  It's a great idea.  Google, let's call Chris DeBona and get him to work on that.  Google should absolutely put this in the toolbar or Alexa or somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Alexa still doesn't work with Firefox.  It seems unlikely they're going to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't quite get it.  George Lucas says the Star Wars parodies can stay on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, and there's been some awesome ones this week.  Very funny ones.  Sarcastic Vader was so mind-blowingly good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The one where he's like talking to the Admiral and his cube just keeps going up and down  all the time.  Opening and shutting his clamshell.  Well, it was...  Yeah.  I literally rolled on the floor laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but Chad Vader was great too.  Isn't that Chad Vader?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I think he's actually got someone working for him.  There's someone who works for him who actually sends us emails whenever something really  good happens in the fan-made media stuff.  Hoping that Boing Boing will...  Yeah, you can look at this.  I think that, you know, say what you will about those first three movies.  And there's a lot to say about them.  But they're doing some really smart stuff with their fans.  And then the other thing I'd hope to mention was this Cinema Now Burn to DVD DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, let's talk about that.  Absolutely.  Because that seems...  People are very critical of this.  Tell us a little bit about what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so they've got this Burn to DVD program where this is Cinema Now that download a virtual  DVD and then you can burn it to a DVD that supposedly you can't copy.  And it's using Windows DRM.  And no one really knew how their DRM worked because they hadn't disclosed anything about  their Burn to DVD specification.  But an engineer, a very senior optical engineer emailed me on the condition of anonymity and  gave me a pretty thorough breakdown of how this stuff worked having seen the specification.  And basically it looks like they introduced these errors that are caused by accumulation  of something called digital sum value.  And that this brings the DVD right to the edge of its error correction.  And that's something that apparently many PCs can't handle.  The thing is that some PCs can and a lot of players can, a lot of standalone set top players  can.  And that because these discs are right at the edge of their error correction limit,  if they get even the smallest damage, you know, small scratch or dust, they stop playing  altogether.  And because it's so impossible to precision introduce these errors given the wide variety  of chip sets and equipment and blanks, many of the tests that he did, he tested on like  five machines and four of them didn't even produce a viable disc.  So it's pretty crummy.  He said, I'm against people being fleeced by this kind of crap.  How can you sell some content on media that is so heavily compromised, especially in a  format that relies upon its error correction system to maintain playability?  He's a very straight-laced engineer.  And he just said like they've designed something that is literally defective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the funny thing about this is this is a throwback idea.  Leo would remember this probably more than the other guys, which is the back in the early  eighties and probably maybe it started in the late seventies, but probably at least  in the early eighties, there was all these copy protection mechanisms designed to keep,  you know, people from copying floppy discs.  And one of them was to burn a hole in the disc, map it, see where the hole is.  And then when you put the code on there, if there wasn't a big defect in this thing, then  you couldn't, you know, you couldn't use it.  It was unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they still do that.  But what is the issue?  So you're making a disc that's kind of not working so well.  It's so what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you pay for it, right?  They sold you something that was supposed to produce a disc you could play and it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you can't get a refund if it doesn't play?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not.  It's just it's defective, right?  You produce media.  It says you make a DVD that's just like the DVD that you play that you buy at the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except it's not, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not right.  Except it's way less robust.  It falls apart.  And most of the time you're going to waste your blank media and you just expensive blank  media is going to fall apart.  That introducing error strategy.  It's funny.  I think the first app that did that was was the Dan Bricklin spreadsheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  You're right.  VisiCalc had a defective floppy.  You're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I saw a presentation by Franklin and Bricklin, that's the two inventors and  founders of VisiCalc, about how they couldn't get their own data off of their VisiCalc  programs because they couldn't run VisiCalc in an emulator because they couldn't mount  the floppy in an emulator because they stuck the stuff on it, you know, really hoaxed by  their own batard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course, now you can download VisiCalc for its 13 K and run it on in an emulator  and it runs great.  So much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're talking about about DVDs and movies.  I don't know if anybody's aware of this, but you know, the the archive.org operation has a  lot of new feature films now that they've put on there.  How do they do that?  Well, they got a lot, but they're all public domain supposedly.  But we're talking Reefer Madness and Plan 9 from Outer Space and all the Flash Gordon  stuff.  There's a whole bunch of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there was a post on Boing Boing like a week ago was all the films that fell out of  copyright, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Until 1976, you had to register copyright and then periodically renew a copyright and  then in the U.S.  And then in the U.S.  And then the U.S.  ratified something called the Berne Convention or partially ratified it that requires that you  no longer have any formalities in order to do this kind of thing.  And the downside of that has been that stuff that people literally just don't care about  is still in copyright and in copyright for their life plus 70 years and where you don't  even know who those people are, figuring out whether they've been dead for 70 years is  really hard.  You know, it's basically now even napkin doodles go into copyright automatically and the  copyright office doesn't know what's in copyright, doesn't know who it belongs to, doesn't know  who you should contact if you want to arrange to pay for it.  This is locked up.  It's pretty crazy.  Nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  iCreativeCommons, all my napkin doodles.  I just want to make the point.  Yeah, good man.  Yeah, good man.  Absolutely.  Hey Corey, you have a podcast.  Tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's your basic vanilla science fiction writers podcast.  I read some of my stories in bits and pieces as I go in lots of places around the world.  So the audio quality isn't so great, but it's just wherever I happen to be with 20  spare minutes, I'll record a podcast and put it up.  And I guess the neatest thing about it is I'll do stories in progress while I'm working  on them.  I think that's great.  While I'm working on short stories, I'll be reading them aloud.  And it also keeps me working on them because I know that I've got to have 20 minutes worth  of new material in a couple of days.  And so that'll keep my head down at the keyboard.  And so I've read a whole bunch of stories and they've had a pretty good reaction.  One of the stories I read is something called I, Robot that was also published on a website  called the Infinite Matrix, a science fiction magazine online called the Infinite Matrix.  And it's even, it's gotten a lot of critical acclaim and now it's up for the Hugo Award.  So the world-  Congratulations.  That's been a couple of weeks here in LA.  That's exciting.  I might be a Hugo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, that would be fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am to Hugo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And well, well worth it.  Well, well deserved.  That's great, Corey.  That's really, what brings you, so you moved from Britain  are you still involved in any way in the EFF or just kind of unofficially or-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Technically, I'm a fellow of the organization.  So I'm planning on going up to the staff retreat in September.  And I occasionally consult on active cases.  I'm still within the non-disclosure agreement.  So the attorneys can talk to me about confidential client stuff without worrying about  that material getting subpoenaed.  And so, and I obviously remain very friendly with them.  They're good pals of mine and I support what they do.  And I do a fair bit of work on some of their campaigns,  particularly the stuff I was directly working on,  which is stuff related to digital television, DRM standards,  and international treaties, particularly something called the Broadcasting Treaty,  which has really bad implications for podcasters depending on which version they pass.  But the one the US has been pushing for at the behest of Yahoo and Microsoft  would basically let Yahoo or AOL provide your bandwidth.  AOL would essentially have the rights to tweet.  Even though tweet might be licensed under a Creative Commons license,  if you got it from AOL, you'd also have to go to AOL and get their permission to redistribute it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it would behoove us to make sure that versions are available from other sources at all times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it would make it really complicated because then you'd have to prove which version  you were redistributing and so on.  And basically, it's a set of new rights for people who aren't creators, you know,  who's...  Right. They're distributors.  Contribution to the work is really just, you know, electromagnetically modulating it.  These aren't the people who usually give copyright to, you know, the rhetoric anyway around copyright  is to help creators, not to help, you know, casters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have a contract with AOL that specifically says that they don't assert any right to it.  Does that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does it say they don't assert a copyright or a broadcaster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's good. I'll have to check the contract, I guess.  Yeah.  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe you can manage that with contracts, but it's just another gotcha, you know,  and they already completely overwhelming, difficult to follow morass that is copyright.  And copyright, my friend Jamie Boyle says copyright used to be like a tank mine.  Like if you were civilian, you just couldn't detonate it.  And, you know, like in 1955, if I gave you a novel and I said,  go violate copyright with a novel, it would have been pretty much impossible.  And these days we keep devising these traps that are supposed to be for tanks.  Right.  And they catch, you know, kids.  They catch kids who are like lip syncing on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Too bad. What are you doing in LA now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I got a Fulbright chair at the University of Southern California  at their public diplomacy center to write a book called  Set Top Cop Hollywood's Secret War on Your Living Room.  And to teach a class of the same name.  So I'm going to teach a grad seminar in the first semester and an undergrad class in the second.  Fantastic.  Just for the hang around, see what those guys are up to.  Do a little work with the Annenberg Communication School too.  I keep writing Boing Boing.  I've got these new novels I'm working on.  I'm working on these young adult novels about kids who declare war  in the Department of Homeland Security, hacker kids called Little Brothers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's good. Start propagandizing them young, I think.  We really got to work on them young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like Encyclopedia Brown meets the Anarchist Cookbook.  I love it.  Wikipedia Brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wikipedia Brown. I like it.  Hey, where can people get the podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Crafthound.com slash podcast.php.  Or just you can get it in iTunes or all the other podcast aggregators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wonderful.  Will Harris, it's great to have you too from bit-tech.net.  We're out in the States taking meetings just a short while ago.  I hope all went well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was excellent.  I thoroughly enjoyed the trip out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, thanks for coming out to San Francisco too.  That was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hear you.  You tipped a beaker with Prager and Rose, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had a few beers. It was pretty cool.  Can I throw one more in there quick?  I thought this was just too brilliant to leave out.  Norton Antivirus mistakenly advises vickers in the UK to delete visual liturgy,  which is their, I don't know, sermonizing program of choice.  But it's a virus.  And they said, and the quote was great from the Church of England saying that  millions of churchgoers have been affected by this bug in Norton Antivirus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you think people actually took it seriously and deleted the software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  Loads of preachers apparently went through and deleted loads of stuff.  And one guy was so paranoid that he thought he'd been hacked.  He canceled all his credit cards and his online bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you, Norton.  Thank you, Norton.  Wow.  A classically British story.  Anything with the word vickers in it, I like.  Just any excuse to say vickers.  It rhymes with knickers.  That's all I can say.  Kevin Rose is now worth $60 million and yet he deigns to join us.  It's fabulous.  You're very kind.  Not true.  Congratulations at 3.0.  I gather it's a great success.  Thanks so much.  Yeah.  And I have to say, if you haven't played with the Flash stuff,  the dig spy and the stacking thing and the swarm, I love dig swarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's pretty crazy.  With a W and a four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A must, a must to play with it.  It's just so fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's just we have some more Flash visualization stuff that we'll have coming out here in the  near future.  But yeah, this has been a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's some really cool stuff.  Amber and I did an interview with a company called Etsy that sells crafts.  And they have a brilliant Flash programmer who's doing amazing ways to look at the catalog.  And I think that there's some really interesting UI stuff being done with Flash right now.  It's very exciting.  And swarm is one of them.  I love swarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, without a doubt.  It's one of those things where as we go forward, we really want to create tools that allow you to  see where groups of users are moving and what they're swarming around and what they're into.  And you can actually watch in real time as that shifts from story to story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
