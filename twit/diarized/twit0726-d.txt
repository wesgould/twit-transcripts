Start time: 196.50
End time: 204.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been a long time.  And I want to introduce  the newest member of the Twitch family.  Now you're all in the family  but some closer than others.  This guy was a distant cousin  and is now my son.  Micah Sergeant.  I've adopted Micah Sergeant.  He is joining us at twit.tv.  We're very excited.  We asked him last week I think.  He said unaccountably  without even coming to Petaluma to visit  you've never been here, right?

Start time: 235.58
End time: 254.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you really called me out there, Leo.  He said, okay.  I said, okay, I'll do it.  It was really kind of  a no-brainer situation in the end  is how I felt about it.  Did Lisa tell you how much we're going to pay you?  She said $2.  So I knew that I'd be able to make it here.  So we're good.

End time: 269.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 270.00
End time: 279.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to bring them in the studio, right?  Yes. I think that it's required  in my contract that I bring them into the studio.  Yeah, Lisa says so.  We miss our dogs.

Start time: 280.00
End time: 301.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to adopt your Chihuahuas as well as you.  Anyway, welcome.  Micah will be hosting iOS today  kind of coincidentally  because we wanted to hire you anyway.  But right about that same time,  Megan said, I've decided I don't want to do this anymore.  I don't want to be on camera anymore.  I want to do more writing.  So she's left. So you're going to take over from her?  Are you going to do Tech News Weekly as well?

Start time: 302.58
End time: 305.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Tech News Weekly as well.  But the main reason we wanted to bring you in

Start time: 306.50
End time: 310.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is we have lots of new shows we want you to do.  So you're going to be very, very busy.

Start time: 310.60
End time: 311.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Yes, indeed.

Start time: 312.58
End time: 373.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm excited about it.  Thanks to all three of you for joining us.  So we thought since we have a lot of gamers,  we should probably talk about gaming.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Well, I mean,  games are fun to talk about.  Actually, this is a gaming story that is more than gaming.  Remember HQ?  Yeah.  That fun game?  With that guy?  Who everybody's forgotten?  Scott. His name was Scott.  Scott Bakula.  And he was a big star, and then he left,  and then the CEO  got rid of the other founder,  then the CEO died, and the other founder came back.  It's been kind of crazy.  According to TechCrunch,  they're pivoting.  HQ trivia  is laid off about 20% of its staff.  That's only six or seven people,  but still.  And they're going to go to a subscription model.  $10 a month  for a program called  HQ Words.

Start time: 374.66
End time: 376.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So instead of them paying you,  you pay them.

Start time: 378.50
End time: 383.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I wonder if they're going to still do HQ trivia.  It's not clear  from this article.

Start time: 384.76
End time: 395.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This kind of seems like too little,  too late. You know, HQ  fell out of the public eye  so spectacularly, what feels like  years ago.  It wasn't that long ago, actually.

Start time: 396.68
End time: 410.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, but it feels so long.  It does feel like a long time ago.  March 2018,  about a year ago,  I know, who's going to pay that, right?  To play a game?  Apple Arcade is going to be that.  That's crazy.

Start time: 412.68
End time: 430.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Apple Arcade is going to be  cheaper.  $10 a month, you can get  Xbox Game Pass.  Obviously, it's not  aimed at the same kind of  players, I suppose, but  it better be a really  damn entertaining experience.

Start time: 430.74
End time: 436.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was only a year ago that HQ  trivia was giving out a  quarter million dollar prize

Start time: 437.83
End time: 439.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of money  they didn't have.

Start time: 440.50
End time: 443.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It turns out there wasn't a sustainable  we shouldn't laugh.

Start time: 444.98
End time: 458.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know, it's very sad.  Did HQ words,  whatever the hell that is, heck that is,  sorry, did it have a  subscription before though,  and now they're  making a subscription service?

Start time: 458.66
End time: 459.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because that sounds like a recipe

Start time: 460.88
End time: 468.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for very angry customers,  if so, MoviePass showed us that people  do not like it when they have to start  paying for something they got for free.

Start time: 468.62
End time: 473.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You still win money with it,  but you pay money to win money seems like  gambling.

Start time: 475.53
End time: 481.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The best poll  always say it takes money to make money,  so that sounds like a completely legitimate business.  Must be legit.

Start time: 482.60
End time: 510.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it is kind of like trivia,  but it's words instead of trivia.  I  feel bad,  but you remember  what was the name of that  pop game? Remember that pop game?  What was it?  I've forgotten. This was another flash  in the pan.  They sold the Zynga at the peak,  and then the whole thing went  down the tubes, and then Zynga went down the tubes.  Actually Zynga

Start time: 510.50
End time: 511.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Zynga's sort of still around,

Start time: 512.52
End time: 529.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but they're selling all their property  in San Francisco in order to stay afloat.  So that gives you  kind of some idea.  Zynga took over our building,  right, Carson?  The old tech TV building?  And I thought the last  thing I heard about

Start time: 530.92
End time: 538.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  was Draw Something.  Draw Something.  Wasn't that huge? Super popular,  and then Zynga bought it, and then nobody played it.

Start time: 539.95
End time: 544.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For a lot of money.  Oh, and the other one was OMG Pop.  Remember that? OMG Pop.

Start time: 544.52
End time: 548.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That one doesn't sound familiar to me.  That sounds like something BuzzFeed does.

Start time: 548.50
End time: 549.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not a gamer, you admit it.

Start time: 551.15
End time: 553.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm Googling that. I'm a gamer,  and I don't know what that is.

Start time: 554.52
End time: 555.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Simone.

Start time: 556.50
End time: 584.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe you remember I'm in Like With You  or ILWY.  Does that ring a bell?  That sounds horrifying.  In 2012,  OMG Pop  was the hottest thing happening.  As you can see here,  Zynga bought it for $200 million.  Shut it down in one year.  What did it do?  How old was I?  It was a really fun game, but much like HQ,  it was briefly fun.

Start time: 584.52
End time: 586.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it had several different games.  Yeah.

Start time: 588.62
End time: 590.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, there's nothing more.

Start time: 590.56
End time: 592.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Draw My Thing was the big OMG Pop game.

Start time: 592.74
End time: 601.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Draw My Thing, most popular one.  You know the name.  I feel too comfortable about saying that.  Is this recorded?  What it was was

Start time: 602.82
End time: 620.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pictionary, basically.  So, Pictionary.  So, it wouldn't always be your thing.  It could be  somebody else's thing.  These are, I'm looking,  it looks like, rip-offs.  This is how you get viruses, Leo.  Don't go clicking around, draw my thing online.net.  Oh, boy.

Start time: 623.11
End time: 654.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With  mobile games, is that  they rely as much on marketing as they do  on game design expertise.  And so, it's  very, very difficult to replicate  a success.  And that's why all of these companies  are having so much trouble.  They have one game that works really well,  but usually that's it.  The only one that managed to do more than one  is Supercell.  And they make games  that are very cleverly designed.  They're actual good games.

Start time: 654.50
End time: 667.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because HQ  is a trivia contest.  There's nothing special.  I think you could argue that  Scott Rogowsky was the reason for his success.  He was kind of fun to watch.  It changed when he left.

Start time: 668.50
End time: 680.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if you didn't like listening to those hosts,  which I frankly did not with the couple of times  I played it, it becomes this  intolerable trivia experience where  instead of answering questions, you're sitting there  listening to someone banter. Stop talking, stop bantering.

Start time: 680.52
End time: 682.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the damn question I want to get this over with.

Start time: 682.64
End time: 700.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was kind of the best part. You always  knew that people were playing the game because  you would hear these little mumbles like,  can we get past this please? I never really  played it myself, but I can remember  even colleagues  being like, yeah, I'm just going to time  my lunch break with  the time the game came on. We would end the show at 6pm

Start time: 700.94
End time: 721.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so I could play HQ.  Oh, those are the days  when the show was less than four hours long.  Remember that? Yeah, those are the days.  Anyway, this is  kind of a long-running story  in Silicon Valley, these flash in the pan  games.  Everybody thought HQ was going to be hot. There were a lot of  copycats. There were a ton of copycats,  none of which took off.

Start time: 722.58
End time: 777.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if everybody thought it was going to be  hot.  It feels like there's a  subsection of the  tech community  that thinks games work  like tech, and since they know  tech, they know games.  And the two are very different markets  and industries. I think that's why  we thought, well, you know, some of  the tech industry thought  gaming was going to be  smartphones only  forever, and there was no room for  a portable  console. But the gaming  industry  and public  is different enough  from tech that these  analyses usually, I think,  don't pan out. So if you want to hear  what's happening in gaming,  you should ask someone who knows  gaming.  Of course, that doesn't mean mobile games isn't a  thing, obviously, but

Start time: 778.82
End time: 802.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't even think asking somebody  in gaming because  I mean, you and Simone  and people who cover the whole  gaming sphere maybe, but  gaming is so fragmented nowadays  that if you ask  somebody who's a, you know, call of duty  point and shoot, first person shooter  player, they're not going to know  what's going on even in the battle royale  sphere. They're not playing that daddy games.

Start time: 802.74
End time: 803.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let alone, what is that one?

Start time: 804.68
End time: 808.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't call them daddy. Oh, wait. Oh, you mean the  specific daddy games. Yeah, daddy games.

Start time: 808.78
End time: 810.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a daddy. What's daddy games?

Start time: 810.52
End time: 813.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Leo. I can't believe you just said that.  Oh, it's so good.

Start time: 814.88
End time: 829.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is a dating simulator  where you play as a dad.  Oh, a sugar daddy.  Something like that. Oh, you could be a sugar daddy.  But you move into a new neighborhood  and there's a bunch of other single  or not single dads and  you date them.

Start time: 830.54
End time: 832.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You date the dads? I made Ernest Hemingway

Start time: 836.80
End time: 843.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that was an experience. I don't want to be  sexist here, but are you a woman in this game  or does it matter? Nope, you're a dad.  You're a god. It's a gay

Start time: 848.92
End time: 854.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was pretty popular.  One of the most popular games of  was it last year? Oh, and you could design

Start time: 854.68
End time: 856.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  your dad bod. That's nice.

Start time: 858.62
End time: 864.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's me right there. I think you can be a woman actually.  I think you can play a woman.  Oh, but you wouldn't do well in this game.

Start time: 865.01
End time: 870.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can play as a transgender  man, but you can't play as a woman.  Is that a vampire? So this is

Start time: 870.50
End time: 876.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a category of games? This is so popular.  Datings and Relators? Oh, hell  yeah. They're very popular

Start time: 876.64
End time: 879.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  with women and I think  queer audiences as well.

Start time: 880.50
End time: 890.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, oh, I just  see again, that's a perfect example. See, I feel  like I'm a gamer. I like to play games,  but I never even heard of this. Yeah, it's a perfect  example. I mean, that's the thing about like you said, games

Start time: 890.52
End time: 921.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  are very fragmented now and you're right in  that one thing that  we try to keep in mind at Polygon all the time  is everyone  is a gamer in some sense of  the word and that there is a game that  they probably play, whether that is  The Jeweled or whether it's Call of Duty  or Fortnite and  Fortnite especially is very  interesting because the people  play it obsessively, but they don't necessarily  read coverage of it  because they're just in a completely  different sphere of gaming.  They don't need coverage

Start time: 922.68
End time: 952.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because Fortnite is one of those categories  where you go to Twitch and  you just watch it and there's  I would bet even  within Fortnite, there are different  communities based on which Twitch  streamer, you know, are you a Ninjas  community or you're  and it's all based on that.  Fortnite is a phenomenon. I'm fascinated  by it. It's for  for Nortonite  the HQ of 20  whatever year we're in. Oh wow.

Start time: 953.03
End time: 954.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How could you ask such a thing?

Start time: 955.41
End time: 958.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm very upset.  My mind is exploding.

Start time: 958.88
End time: 960.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe you're right. Are you a

Start time: 960.50
End time: 961.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fortnite-er? Are you a Fortnite-er?

Start time: 962.50
End time: 966.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm not. And that's what makes me  inaccessible to the youth. The youths

Start time: 966.50
End time: 1031.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  love Fortnite. But  I actually love Fortnite.  I think Fortnite is... Do you play?  Well, let me explain. Okay.  It's a really incredibly  designed game. I really think the  design and the ingenuity and the cleverness  that goes into it is fantastic. Brilliant  brilliant model  financial model on the part of  Epic because they've made billions  and billions out of it by giving away a free  game. So that's  well done. I see teenagers. It's in  many cases if you're 14, that's  your community is  Fortnite. That's where you live. That's  where everything that happens to you  revolves around that.  It's incredibly addictive and compelling.  The only reason I'm not a Fortnite-er  is because I get waxed. A minute I  parachute in. Does that mean dead? I'm dead.  Now what they did nicely with  Fortnite is you don't leave the game. You just watch  the guy who killed you get killed and then you watch him  and then they keep watching until you get to the end of the game.  So you can watch the whole game.  Very watchable game. Very watchable.  That's the other thing they did well. It's a perfect e-sport  game. But I can't  claim to be a Fortnite-er only because  I can't survive.

Start time: 1032.50
End time: 1056.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's too hard. I don't know that it's necessarily  a perfect e-sport  because I think the reason people like  watching it is because they find  personalities that they enjoy  watching. Like Marshmallow or Ninja.  The most highly skilled. Yeah, exactly.  The time that Ninja streamed with  Drake was huge  and it was because it's like, oh my god, Drake  is playing Fortnite. This is wild.  By the way, there are people listening to this show

Start time: 1057.31
End time: 1064.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  Corel, anything like that. You can talk about anything  like that. So no, I agree with you. It's a  social-societal phenomenon,  but is it a flash in the pan?  I'm kind of more curious. I don't think it's already

Start time: 1080.50
End time: 1109.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  outlived, the flash  in the pan timing.  I guess so. Yeah. It seems like it.  Maybe it's not a flash in the pan,  but it's one of those very unique  phenomenons that is as a center of  many different things  that make it as successful  as it is. And I don't know that  there will be a lot of games like this.  To the level where you actually  have cultural  products that advertise  in Fortnite. Look at this.  They just added

Transcript:  Exactly. It's become  so widespread across a certain  cross-section of the population  that  the things like  what, well, Avengers  was in the game, but that was  more of a collaboration thing. But then John Wick  had a cross-promotion thing.  And now  Stranger  Things season 3.  It is very unique. I don't think any other  game has, well,  had quite that impact. And really it was

I mean, I've heard a lot of stories about people  linking up with another person  and having a really good experience.  I especially love stories of  people my age linking up  with a kid who's like, I don't know how to play,  but I'm having a good time and being able  to be a good role model for them, which I love.  But then there are jerks as well.  So, you know, it's a crapshoot.

Yeah, and that was going to be my next question.  What do you think is the thing that gets the personalities  into this game? Is there something about this game  in particular, or is it just because there are enough people  interested in this game  that they're choosing to sort of

Transcript:  Games and mobile.  I was hating on mobile.  Maybe people could understand me hating  on mobile when I was saying things earlier.  That's not the case. Certainly mobile  has expanded the  meaning of what  a game is and what a gamer is.  There are many, many different kinds of  gamers nowadays.  Much more than a few years ago.  Everyone's a gamer.  That's completely true.  What the  quote unquote real gamers will say,  I think it's fair to say  it's not the same kind of game.  Just like maybe  if you like  action movies, you're not necessarily  going to like the  Oter Sundance kind of thing.  But you might.  And in our culture,

Start time: 1411.41
End time: 1451.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  where certain  things have become taboo because  it's too risky,  for instance, to say something about gamers  is too risky.  People just don't even talk about this.  After Gamergate, it's like, oh, that's a third  rail. It's like talking about  the president. It's a third rail.  So everybody avoids it.  As a result,  we're not  talking about some of the most important issues  in society. So I'll stay away from the president.  But let's talk about gaming  for a minute. The technical definition  is somebody who plays a game. That's not what  so-called gamers think of as  gamers. It's whoever plays  the games I like  is a gamer.

Start time: 1452.52

Transcript:  It's a weird thing because  a lot of people have pointed out, you know, we don't  call people who enjoy TV  TVers.  There's so many different kinds of TV.  But we have.  I think just because of what a  niche hobby playing video games  was in the past, kind  of made it into a category that  may not necessarily make sense.  Well, you said something interesting.  In the past, it's changed now,

Start time: 1478.96
End time: 1494.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hasn't it? So for instance,  I spent 20 hours,  minimum 20 hours this week playing Harry Potter  Wizards Unite.  Now, the reactions  to that are going to range from your  horror, Simone, or was it joy?

Start time: 1494.52
End time: 1496.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I couldn't tell. It was kind of

Start time: 1496.58
End time: 1526.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  both. We're going to range  from horror to joy,  to joy, to joy  horror to people saying, well, that's  not a game and  everything in between, right?  So that's why  probably the other reason Fortnite's I want  to stay with this. Why is Fortnite so successful?  Because it's interesting is partly because  once you're us, one of  us, part of  being one of us is the other  is all bad. You have to have  us versus them. Wait, who's the us?

Start time: 1526.58
End time: 1530.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 1530.56

Transcript:  they are the only true gamers.  I don't think that's

Start time: 1534.66
End time: 1551.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  necessarily true because I don't think that  kids are thinking of it  in that way. I think that they think of it more  as a place to hang out with  their friends or a common  activity. Although  there is the element of  skins and bullying over skins that we can get into.  I can see, you know,

Start time: 1552.50
End time: 1594.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there are some games that are  super intense and you like set up  a LAN party and you play these games  and you try to rank like, I don't know,  ones that have lots of guns and  are militaristic and  ones where you have to have very  expensive computer systems to run them  and that kind of thing. And though  I feel like these are, you talked earlier  about the fragmentation sort of  what the sort of gaming industry  is and what gaming involves.  And I think that that also plays  into which groups  are being those sort of  you or they and we or us.  Because I think that  Georgia Dow is an example  of someone who knows how to play some more  complicated games. She has her own virtual

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how they make money because the game is free  to play, remember.  But I mean, that article was amazing.  And it certainly opened my eyes, and I'm sure  many other people's eyes, to  what's happening there.  But I think also, you know,  it's not a,  it's not like bullying started  with Fortnite. And again, Fortnite  is such a unique  phenomenon in the gaming world.  I would be very hesitant  to draw any  conclusions from what's happening there  and apply them to  a large section of the gaming industry.  I would also  venture that  I think the  fragmented and hateful  nature of game  communities is,  I don't want to say a thing of the past  and maybe Simone, you have a different  look on that.  But I think  after Gamergate, which certainly  hurt us a lot, there  was a reaction to  it that was slow but deeper  that kind of  forced us  to look at how we were  behaving in  that sense and break the barriers  down a little bit. And certainly there are still, you know,  the idiots are still going to  be idiots. But I think everyone else,  not everyone, a good  portion of other people, started  understanding what was happening there and paying  a little bit more attention. That's the way  I think it's at least starting. Simone, maybe  you have a, yeah, maybe you would disagree  with me.

Start time: 1746.82
End time: 1794.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't disagree. I think  that there are still  problems in gaming.  I think it's kind of, as it always  has been, that there is  a small group of people who are very, very  loud and very, very angry and  very, very mean. But I do  think that in the  larger sense, companies  are being conscious  of  being more inclusive  in their video games and also  certainly, I mean, the world's eyes are opened  to what happens when  you let a hateful  group of people kind of  run rampant over  a hobby, you know, without  anyone stepping in and saying, hey, cut  it out.  I think that there are still scars definitely on  the gaming community from that.

Start time: 1796.12
End time: 1804.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's also  the case that the gaming community  is very diverse. So there's kids  playing Fortnite, there's dads playing Call of Duty.  And dads playing

Start time: 1806.72
End time: 1821.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dream Daddy. And there's moms  playing Words with Friends or Bejeweled.  I mean, there's a very, I mean, that's a  little stereotypical all the way around.  But I think that it does very much, it's a variety  of communities. So you can't really  talk about a gamer community  as one time.

Start time: 1822.52
End time: 1878.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's how I'm feeling about it.  And I think that that kind of, that sort of  situation applies itself to a lot of things  because, you know, we all have  these little groups and we like  to see these little groups as  bigger groups because that  means that more people agree with what I  agree with. And so whereas,  you know, I think that  if I'm not taking  the time to be empathetic and understanding that  others have different opinions and thoughts  than I do and experiences, then  I start to think that everybody  who  wears an Apple Watch is going to get  as many notifications as I do. So the notifications  on the Apple Watch are annoying. Whereas for  the regular consumer, that might not be the  case. And so what I'm saying here is  I think that those things can apply  to all sorts of  industries and all sorts of  subjects where we can  sort of over  engulf what is a larger  group than we realize. It's a human trait.

Start time: 1878.54
End time: 1895.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And frankly,  everything we do as a human  is playing a game of some kind.  Whether it's a game to make more money,  the game to have a nicer house.  There are many, many games in the  world. And it is unfortunate that one of  the human, one human trait is this us  versus them. Tribalism.

End time: 1944.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, I can't  speak for everyone who's gone  to PAX and had an experience there.  That company has  had their  kerfuffles and run ins  in the past. But I've always found  PAX specifically as a convention to be  really nice and a really good time.  And I mean, you can see the whole  community on display at PAX.  There's all kinds of people there. So I really like it.

Start time: 1944.92
End time: 2011.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I think one of the  differences, or I hope at least,  one of the reasons why  we're seeing slow  progress, but progress being made in  the good direction,  is that in the  gaming industry,  we have  kind of adults in charge,  I'd like to think. The companies  are  not necessarily  listening to the  noise. The Gamergate  did not have an effect on what kind of  games, or the opposite effect  on what kind of games are being made.  The  people in charge saw that  there was a representation problem  and that it needed fixing. And slowly  we're starting to see these things happen.  So  I hope that this is showing  that we're, you know,  the industry is, because we have  adults in there,  doing things  differently than what you might think when you're seeing  what the community is doing.  So, yeah,  I think that's  not inaccurate.

Start time: 2012.78
End time: 2072.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I think for bigger companies  certainly, they are very  aware of that.  There are still issues  with, for example,  just this week, the developers of Mordow  are having a communication  issue where someone on  the Steam forums, who's involved in the game,  said that there would be  a patch that would allow people to  toggle off the presence of women and people  of color in that game, because just  to basically satisfy  people who enjoy a vision of  white Europe.  And the PR company that manages  that game is like, no, we're not doing that,  we're not doing that, that's a, no, nobody's  talking about doing that. So  I think that there are still  instances, unfortunately, where  companies want  to appease their perceived  audience and will,  I don't want to use the word pander,  but it's the ones coming to mind,  just lean in that direction, and  it might be a direction that's  not as inclusive as we want

Transcript:  games to be. The thing that, to me,  is the most interesting about this, and we'll move on,  but is that this is the  first time that an  entertainment medium has had such  its fingers so deep into our  culture. Movies, TV,  all have had, you know,  deep impacts on our culture,  but they were always kind of, that's the movie  industry, that's the TV industry.  Gaming seems to be a more  intimate way of consuming  media or entertainment,  and is much more a part of our lives,  and I think that's why there's so much  emotional drama going  on around it, much more so, just as you  pointed out, Simone, nobody says I'm a TVer.  I mean, you can say I love movies,  I do love movies, but I'm not going to fight you  over Justice League versus, you know,  Batman. Well, there's some other movies.  I wish you would. That's

Transcript:  There's more engagement involved,  which you're kind of talking about there, with  a movie, with television. It's part of your life.  There's sort of these things that you can passively  enjoy, but with a game,  I've got to be focused, I've got to be  playing and  engaged, and so by default,  we give more of our attention to those  things, which then lets  those ads and what have  you, the people that are  teaming up with these companies,  get deeper access to our attention.  So yeah, I agree with you there, that  level of engagement that's  required gives more focus.

But no, I think that  returning, kind of looping this back, closing  the circle, going back to mobile games like  HQ that are kind of flash in the pants,  or like Candy Crush,  for example, those ones that  exist kind of just to hook you in  and burn through you.  What does distinguish those  mobile games from other games, I think,  and what makes them flash in the pan is that  they compel you to play a lot  in a very short amount of time.  And I think then the wider audience  burns out on that experience.  And you're left with those core whales that are spending  the money on those games.

We're going to do one more gaming  segment. I should mention this.  Because you said an interesting thing, Patrick  Bajaj. You said you thought  Microsoft's streaming platform,  which is coming out next year, will be  also not just on the Xbox, but on the PlayStation.  Why would they  do that? Why would Sony do that?

Transcript:  I think there's a possibility it  will happen down the line once we have  a solid  infrastructure  of the trends  that are happening now, which are streaming  and subscription.  And every single device  in your home has a good controller  so anything  can become a  game, a traditional console  game machine.  That's the promise of Google Stadia, right?  Google Stadia  and others that  are also  being worked on by Microsoft  and Sony and possibly others.  I think Stadia is actually going  to become the streaming  service for everyone, meaning  for every company.  Microsoft is going to have their own, Sony is going to  have their own. And the reason they don't have  a subscription service at Google for  Stadia is that they  want to be the one for  Ubisoft, Bethesda,  every other gaming company.  So those companies would have  a subscription service where you install  the games on PC, but if you want  to use their services on another device,  you can use Google Stadia  to stream them to any device.  So that's one thing,  but the PlayStation  aspect of it is, in that  world, imagine that world where any device  is your, can be  used to stream  traditional console games,  you as a  PlayStation owner, hardware  device owner,  have the option to go and  try a Microsoft game  anyway, whether or not there's not  the barrier to entry  which is going out to buy  an Xbox anymore. You can  just press a button and play on your  Apple TV or your Android  box or anything. And in that  world, what does  Sony do?  Is it more clever for them to  not have the competing  service on their device  and not get any  money from it, or  have it because their customers will  use it anyway if they want to  and take a cut.  And I think if  you want to see  the world as it will be, if everything  works out like that,  it's more clever to  just put it on your service and at least  since everyone's going to be able to try  those games anyway, at least you get  a little bit of money from it.  So I'm not 100% sure  it's going to happen because Microsoft and Sony  are competitors,  but Apple  has Google Maps  on its device.  So I think it might  happen. There's definitely a possibility  which today, when you look at the  way the market is structured today,  it's heresy to think of something

Start time: 2638.80
End time: 2719.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like that. It actually matches what's  been happening in the rest of technology.  Microsoft's a really good example  of this, where  historically these companies  wanted to put up, and I think this is  a good trend, I'm hoping it will happen more,  put up barriers, silos,  competitive barriers. So you either  buy an Xbox or you buy a PlayStation  and you either play Xbox games or PlayStation  games, but never both.  Microsoft has finally  decided, for years it said  it's Windows, it's Office,  we're going to make our money selling boxes  full of empty air and a lot of bits.  And they did very well in the  90s, they did okay in the 2000s,  but a big shift five years ago  when Satya Nadella said, you know, that's not  the way the future's going to be, it's going to be much more  platform agnostic operating systems  that make a lot of sense.  We're going to be in the cloud, and he said  tellingly, we will be wherever our customers  want us to be,  even if it's on Apple. And in fact,  Microsoft Office, the jewel  in the crown, the touch first  version of Office, arguably the future of Office,  came out on the iPad before it came out on  any Windows platform.  So I think that's a  trend, I hope that's a trend,  and if that's the case, then it would make sense that Microsoft  and Sony might bury the hatchet  across platforms. Certainly Microsoft's  there already. Microsoft would be  anywhere they want. Microsoft is all for this.  Yeah, they like it.

Transcript:  And Sony, when  Fortnite went cross-platform  play on Xbox and Switch,  and Sony did not allow cross-play  with other platforms, everyone  just rubbed their noses in it  for a good while,  and then they changed their policy. So I  think eventually,  and I don't have any insight to this, but I think  eventually they would have to see that  their policy is  just not helpful. It's not what consumers

Do you think you could  divide up the technology industry into  the people with the future on their side,  like Microsoft,  and then the people who are living  still in the past, like Sony, trying to  protect their  rent-seeking, trying to protect their  little corner. Yeah, their little sandbox. Yeah.  And you know who I think of in that category is  Apple. Now nobody, traditionally, nobody  says, oh, Apple's the past.  But I think increasingly Apple  does look like, this is an old-fashioned  way to view your business. Like, you better  use all Apple if you want

Transcript:  I feel that we might be  seeing that changing  very soon. For Apple?  For Apple. Because every single financial  call in the last, I don't know  how many that I have transcribed,  services, services, services.  And right after we see services... Services are  a crass platform. Yes. And what was it?  The Samsung Smart TVs have  an Apple TV app. Come to think of it, that's  right. We've got all of these  little changes that are taking place that I  think are sort of  the writing being on the wall here. I find that really encouraging

Start time: 2851.75
End time: 2911.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a  different case though because in  Apple's business model,  a lot of their money comes from  selling the devices, which  is not the same,  you know, as an example in the  gaming industry. The hardware  makes little to no money.  Nintendo is a little bit of a  holdout there. But for  Sony, the consoles  is the way to get you in the door. The reason  Apple is making services  and trying to improve those  is to sell you more  of their expensive  hardware. Now,  down the line, sure, it could happen if  services become a significant part  of their  revenue. I think it's not  at all unrealistic to think they would  transition. But at  this point, I think it's not...  You know, the strategy is to support  hardware with things that are  exclusive. So if those exclusive things  are everywhere,  then it loses...  The whole thing loses

Start time: 2912.78
End time: 2930.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  value. I might disagree with you because really  the reason they started focusing on services, in  my opinion, is iPhone sales were tailing off.  They couldn't... They weren't making  as much money in hardware. And they were saying,  crap, what are we going to do?  Well, we're going to replace that  revenue by  making more money per existing  customer.

Start time: 2932.62
End time: 2959.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because at some point, we've talked about this before,  the saturation.  Once everybody who wants one of these stupid things  has one, then what do you do?  And that's where, not only  within your existing customer base, which is where  they started, do you get those  Apple Music subscriptions. But then you have  to start to look outward. And that's  when you start to look at the fact that  not all... Like that you can  have customers that don't use an  iPhone if you decide to  go cross platform.

Transcript:  Certainly with Apple TV, they're going to do that, right?  Yeah.  You don't get Jennifer Aniston  doing a TV show for you if you say it, but Jennifer,  only people who own Apple  TVs will be able to see it.  That's not going to work, right?  Unless you throw a  lot of money at it.  Maybe Jennifer you will get, I don't know.

Start time: 2981.01
End time: 2989.33

Transcript:  It's a fraction.  Interestingly, in fact, I think it was  Eddie Kue that was  talking about this, did an interview,  he said, we are not going to  spend the kind of money that Netflix  is spending. Netflix last year spent  $8 billion, Apple spent $1 billion.  And Kue said, and that's our  plan going forward, we're not  going to try to make as many shows as Netflix  does. We're going to focus on a few  good shows. They don't want  to take on that juggernaut.  They don't want to be the next HBO.

Start time: 3020.62

So Micah  as he joined the company got his own computer and  weirdly enough he chose a MacBook Pro with  that horrible butterfly keyboard. Do you like  that butterfly keyboard? No.  Does anybody like the butterfly keyboard?  Lisa does. My wife does.  It's  dysfunctional. Besides having no travel  and stubbing your fingers.  It hurts. It actually just hurt my finger.  It gets crumbs in it and it breaks  and it's an $800 repair.  For the longest time Apple said  a small  number of people have trouble  with this keyboard.  Then Johnny Ive leaves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is the key word. The key cheat.  Oh it's a small percentage.  1% is  1.7 million people or something.  So according to Ming-Chi Kuo  and admittedly this is a rumor  but I think it's a great rumor.  Ming-Chi Kuo is an analyst  in Taiwan who has great  access into the supply chain.  He has heard that Apple is going  to source its keyboard from a new company  and it will be a  scissor switch. The same style switch  everybody else in the industry uses  abandoning its  butterfly design.  Kuo said Apple's butterfly design was expensive  to manufacture due to low  yields.  That's kind of a shock  that Apple would stick with an expensive to  manufacture and expensive to repair  keyboard that everybody hates.  Seems like it seems kind of contrarian.  I don't understand why  maybe this Johnny says no it's got  to be thinner. It's got  to be thinner. And now  that Johnny's gone I just can see  Tim Cook going is he is he gone  is he gone? Bring out the scissor  keys!  Anyway I hope it's not just a  wrong rumor. I hope it's true.  I hope so too. It would be nice and I'm sorry  you got that laptop. Look we're gonna

I think it's  probably not. And the big question is  is the new keyboard  going to be as  thin or thinner  as the current one?  It might be that it has just as bad  travel size possibly.

They're going to  make it look like you're looking at the camera.  They're going to literally move your  eyes.  So that Apple  that you'll look like you're looking at.  In fact, here's  a good video from Dave  Shukin who posted this on Twitter.  Watch the line as  it distorts. It's  distorting because AR is moving  his eyes. He's not actually,  if you look in the upper right hand corner, looking at  the camera. He's looking down. It looks  like he's looking straight at you.

Because they're not moving. They look  dead, they looked weird. It looked like I hadn't had  sleep in like nine days. My mom  was driving and I said,  can you look at my eyes? Am I okay? Like is  everything okay? I had just gotten over Belle's  palsy so I was genuinely concerned.  Your eyes weren't really moving in the past. Yeah.  And so I was like, is everything okay? One eye moves and the other one doesn't?  One eye moves and the other one didn't. It was my right side that was frozen.  Wow. So anyway, it kind of gave me  a little freak out. And this was before  they added the switch to turn on and  off correction, or the  eye correction thing. And so  when that came and people started talking about it, I was like,  oh thank God, I'm glad I don't look like  that because my eyes look  so strange and dead  and weird. And so I think they're still  ironing it out and figuring out how to  AR move your eyes so that they don't  seem dead like you're talking about.

Start time: 3878.60
End time: 4136.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You do the opposite.  But your strategy might be smarter  because your listeners aren't falling  asleep when they hear the ads.  When you do that calm ad,  I'm like, oh man. Oh, I always do the calm ad  really calm.  Let's see if I can make you  relaxed. No, actually this one I should  make you jittery because it's an ad for Last Pass.  Last Pass is  the number one most preferred password  manager, a one you must use.  We use it all the time.  I've been using Last Pass since they came out.  So it's been almost a decade. And the nice  thing is, look, I think everybody  understands that passwords are  the spawn of Satan.  They're the terriblest thing.  But you have to somehow authenticate yourself,  right? You have to prove to that website  or that app, this is your account.  It's okay if you take money out  or whatever. So you got to have these passwords.  This is not anything the human  brain was designed to do.  When I was a kid, you didn't have to remember  a thousand different passwords.  The most you'd have to remember is your  locker combination, right?  That's about it. Your phone number,  your home address. That's it.  I could hold that in my mind.  Which is, by the way, why all my passwords are a combination  of my locker combination, my home  address, and my phone number.  And what were they again?  Well, it was 293642.  Never mind.  I don't use  those anymore. But for a long, I think a lot of  people do that, right? They use,  I actually do use my childhood phone number  in conjunction with other things in my  master password. Everybody take a note.  Yeah. You'll never guess my childhood phone number.  Yeah, 555. That's it.  But that's the problem  is we have to come up with these strategies. So LastPass  is brilliant because you remember one password,  your master password, and then all  the rest are long, completely  non-memorable passwords generated  by LastPass, stored by  LastPass, encrypted. So  no one, not even LastPass has access to them.  They're only decrypted on device.  Make sure you have a good strong  master password. And I always use  two-factor authentication. LastPass supports  every kind of second-factor  authentication. I use a YubiKey. So  unless you have my keys,  you're not going to be able to get my password  vault. I think that's a really great way to secure it.  We also use it in business  because, you know, I have  good password hygiene thanks to  LastPass, but we want to make sure every one of our employees  does because there are passwords.  They know the logins to the website, to the database,  to everything. We've got to lock those down.  LastPass Enterprise  keeps our passwords safe.  And LastPass has just introduced a new business  lineup that I think is fantastic.  And you'll like this. If you've been following  security now or you understand the issues,  you will really appreciate this.  First of all, LastPass Enterprise, the one we use,  has just introduced a  single sign-on technology,  SSO, and  already supported by 1200 plus  apps. So you can have  a password, but you can also have single sign-on.  I love this, which manages  every entry point  with one solution. Your employees will  love it because they don't have to remember  anything. It's very straightforward, but  it's more secure than a password, so you'll love it too.  They also have  LastPass MFA. That goes beyond  two-factor authentication, multi-factor.  It uses biometrics,  geolocation,  additional factors  to make sure that those  passwords are super safe.  Only the right users are getting the right data at the  right time. That's important in a business  because we might have the  QuickBooks password in our vault,  but we want to make sure only people who  should have access to that are using it.  That is an additional factor.  I love it. LastPass Identity combines  Enterprise and MFA to  give you a holistic view of end-user  activity from one dashboard  that covers passwords, authentication,  every app that's in use.  You see that. Your IT department,  your security people see that.  From a single sign-on and password management  to adaptive authentication, LastPass  Identity shows you this is why we love  LastPass. They are on the front line  of authentication and gives you  granular control to IT,  but also gives your users frictionless  access. So they're more likely to want  to use it. And I should tell you, Micah,  that everybody who works at Twit gets a  free LastPass account. That's part of your

Start time: 4264.50
End time: 4346.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wall Street Journal article  about it that Tim Cook was  affronted by. And I can't think of very  many times that Tim Cook, A, has been affronted  and B, has said anything  public about this.  The article implied  that  Johnny left  Apple because he was frustrated  that Tim wasn't the visionary, Steve was  that they laughed  interest in design, that they didn't support his work.  This is the title  of the article in the journal. Johnny Ive  is leaving Apple. His departure started long  ago and has a big picture of Johnny showing  Tim something that Tim's been looking  at on his desk for about eight months,  which is the brand new Mac Pro.  And Tim feigning interest in it.  But I think he's feigning it quite well.  Tim was hurt. Tim was hurt.  He wrote to a journalist  at NBC  how he was feeling.  Hi, NBC.  Hi, Dylan. Hope you're well.  I guess Dylan Byers had asked  Tim Cook about this article. The story  is absurd. A lot of the reporting,  certainly the conclusions, just don't match with  reality. At a base level,  it shows a lack of understanding about how  the design team works and how Apple  works. It distorts relationships, decisions,  and events to the point we just don't  recognize the company it claims  to describe.  I can't think of  a single time Tim Cook has been so pissed off.

Start time: 4347.79
End time: 4394.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is  a PR move. He's  not necessarily angry, or maybe  he is. But the importance here is  with Johnny I being the  second of the greats  of Apple that defined Apple  to not  be at Apple anymore. I think it was  very important to not let that idea  that it was a confrontation between  the two that led  to his departure. Because if it is, if  everyone starts saying, oh, you know, he left  because Cook doesn't  care about design, it means  Apple today doesn't care about design.  And that's very, very  bad news for Apple. If that  perception becomes  common. So my suspicion  would be that that was  damage control before the story  or the narrative could take hold.

Start time: 4394.80
End time: 4413.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it wasn't just Johnny Ive  who was kind  of being criticized  or talked about in this piece, rather,  that he was going away and being  disillusioned. But also the fact that  the team that worked under Johnny Ive  felt like Johnny was always  gone and not there to make decisions.  So it wasn't just...

Start time: 4414.50
End time: 4432.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was demonstrably true, though. Everybody has  heard that story. Johnny  set up, instead of even going down to the  campus, he had a place in San Francisco  the team had to travel up to. And  twice a month they'd get to show him what they were  working on. And that's all.  That is not just the Wall Street Journal  in that article. That's being reported for years.

Start time: 4432.80
End time: 4470.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think that that's important to  sort of talk about the fact that it's not  just a war  between Cook and Ive, but there's  a bigger story here about  Ive also wanting to kind of  step away and not do the same role  that he had. And those both kind of add  up. The thing that really bums  me out about all of this coverage  is that by  focusing so much  attention and  like importance on this  person we've put up on a  perfect aluminium  totem that he stands  atop of.

But I think there is some  substance to the fact that  some people are in  design.  Some people are better  than others. And it's  just like an artist. You can't  say that  any artist can do the same as everyone else.  The concern with Johnnie Ive  leaving and  Steve Jobs dying  is warranted.

Transcript:  Simone. I was just going to  say, I think that part of why  Tim Cook is so peeved  and also something that rings true to  me is that the article, both this one  and Bloomberg's piece, talk  about the design team kind  of seeking out Johnnie Ive's approval  even as Alan Dye and Richard Howarth  were essentially running the day  to day of the design team.  And it does ring true  to me that because he is such a figurehead,  it could derail  production if people are constantly  being like, well, we have to get Johnnie's  approval on this. I don't  consider these people our leaders. I want his  opinion, his sort of  blessing on this decision.  I think that that could cause  dissension in a team. I can  see that happening if he is, as you say,  a Lenin-like figure.

On the other hand, I think there are a lot of people  who see Johnnie Ive's, and I don't mean  this facetiously, but departure as  potentially good news. Apple has been so  design focused for so long  that I think they've kind of lagged behind  maybe in technology.  And I think maybe  a renewed focus. Johnnie  was not a form  follows function guy.  He was all about form,

I think the other reason  that Tim might have been peeved is  that the design team now reports to the  chief operating officer, a man  handpicked by Tim Cook to replace  Tim Cook. This was Tim Cook's old job  COO. He brought in Jeff Williams  to replace himself. Jeff is  an operations guy.  And I think one of the reasons Cook might have been  annoyed is that a lot of these stories said,  well how can an operations guy oversee design?

But I think  they haven't...  In order to make them  the Apple of the Steve Jobs era,  they need to be producing  impactful products.  And while I love them,  the most impactful thing they've done  in the past few years is the  AirPods. I really love them.  I think they're a brilliantly designed  piece of hardware, but  they're not impacting society,  except you see them everywhere.  But the last one was the iPad.  I don't think the Apple Watch  rises to that level. It captured  the market, but it didn't grow it.  So maybe it will change,  and maybe they will have a product  that will show us they are still  that significant. But to this  day, I think evidence shows that  they're still a very cool company and different  from Amazon and Google  and Microsoft and all of them.  But I don't think they can be called  the same Apple that they were  under Steve Jobs.

Pop  culturally, Apple has  had a huge impact with AirPods  because I can't scroll on Tumblr  without some joke being made about AirPods.  You see them everywhere, and everybody's always  talking about everybody having them.  We've gotten used to them though, haven't we?  I don't think you laugh at people anymore  wearing AirPods. Certainly not. No, in fact, it's kind of  the opposite. And that's  fine. And so there are different  forms of impact that can take place.  And that form of just  sort of being in the fabric of  pop culture is an interesting thing.  See, I don't care about that. I'm not

Are they going to find a new way to express  technology that you cannot  argue that when the iPhone came out in 2007,  that was a  complete paradigm shift in the world.  We didn't know it at the time, but now  everybody's carrying something very  much like an iPhone, if it's not an iPhone,  and staring at it all the time.  And there's so many technologies  that came out of it. This was transformative.  Their next chance is AR, I think.

You made an excellent point, Shimon, because I could see Apple  designing beautiful spectacles  that have all the works in it  and give you a heads up display. But  unlike Google, they won't have any information  about the things you're looking at. Google has  all that. That's true. So, can  Apple even make something without the  data? The on device.  Yeah, that's a very, that's a really interesting  point I hadn't thought about.

I don't know  how well it's going to turn out, because  they did start  their AR content  farming with iOS  devices. And sure, it's not  good now,  because again, they need an actual  device, but they have more  knowledge on  the developer community  and an ecosystem than  I think it's fair to say than any other  AR platform.  Now, whether or not, you know, it  amounts to something when they actually come out with it,  it depends if AR is  good for anything or not, and that, I think,  the jury is still out on.

Transcript:  Here's the...  despite Apple's  history of innovation after  innovation after innovation, it's  usually the case, it seems to me, in technology  that if there's a real innovation going to happen,  it's going to happen from a  startup, it's going to happen from  not an incumbent, because  of the innovator's dilemma. Incumbents are  invested in preserving their existing market.  Only Apple,  historically, really, has been able to do this kind of  crazy thing where they go  yeah, we're going to destroy the iPod market because  we're going to make the iPhone.  And that's a hard thing for normal businesses  to do. I don't think Apple does  that anymore. I think Apple is preserving its  incumbency and saying, no, no, we're going to  make more money per customer.  That's how we're going to stay in business.  It's not an unsuccessful strategy, but it's not a...  it doesn't lead to innovation.

And those things don't necessarily...  they're not necessarily  signals of something dire happening, but  it is just kind of following  trends that have been established already  for a while with Amazon  Echo and Netflix  and Amazon Prime existing.  We have too much TV already. Why are they getting

Start time: 5202.52
End time: 5244.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  into that now? Yeah, and I don't mean to say  Apple's not successful. They are.  And I don't mean to say Apple's a bad company.  They're no different than Google or Microsoft  or any existing company, because  once you're an incumbent, once you're that big,  it's hard to do anything innovative.  I wonder, though, if the big tech companies  are so dominant at this  point that it's going to be hard for some little  guy to come along and say, I'm going to create  ADAR. You just look at people...  Yeah, there's so many  Magic Leap and  companies like that where they say, well, we've got this  great technology, but they don't...  maybe they get acquired? I don't know.  It feels like it's a different world than it was  when Apple invented the iPhone. And I don't  know who's going to invent the next big  thing or where it's going to come from.

Transcript:  Yeah, and that's where  it's kind of a positive  and a negative, because sometimes when those  big companies do gobble up these small companies,  the companies are good stewards,  but that's a more rare thing  to happen. And they kill the innovation.  Exactly. It becomes part of it.  But that's... Earlier I had mentioned  that when I see  Apple's next chance in  innovating as in AR,  I see that as still down the  line. If we look at what  Apple's doing right now, which we've got TV,  we've got this... Those are not places where they have  an opportunity to innovate, but  augmented reality is not here  yet, I feel. We were talking...  Patrick, you had mentioned it's not here  until we have the  hardware and that kind of thing.  And so if I see Apple figuring  out another place to innovate, that's  where I see it happening. And again,  I know I talk about those earnings  calls a lot, but I do think that there are  threads of  a narrative that come to exist  in those earnings reports. And  Tim Cook, before they were  talking services, services, services, every single earnings  call, he loved to talk  about AR. And  right now, yeah, it's not great.  It is buggy. It's all these issues.

Transcript:  Did he stop in the last call? He has in the last call  because services, services, services.  But... That's a good point. We...  I think that we have to look at that and see  that maybe this is where they're pushing  their next big bet, but they're also  making sure that they're covering  their assets with these  other things as well, where they can  be in the smart speaker market  and you can palm a home pod and they can be  in these music and stuff.  But the next time they make  a change that actually impacts,  I wonder if they're looking  to AR for that. You know who

And they're  just going to... They created  the electric car category.  They made it acceptable. They made it positive.  But it's going to be all these other companies  that are going to make all the money off of it.  It's kind of... I wonder if the world  has changed a little bit. There is, and we're going to take  a break, but there is a company  that on last...  this past Friday celebrated 25 years  that may be  the one big incumbent that could change  the world. But we're not going to tell you who that is. Think about it.  25 years old. Think about it. Who could that  be? But before... While you're thinking  let's show you a little movie we made.

Yeah, I did. It makes you look younger.  Makes you look, you get that dewy  fresh expression. I'm actually 94.  I'm 108 years  old. But thanks to Casper,  I only look like I'm 70. It's an amazing  thing. Our Casper mattress,  we love it. Casper is  an incredible online retailer  of premium mattresses. They really invented  this for a fraction of the cost. The folks  at Casper realized there is a  big inefficiency in the  mattress market and that's the mattress showroom.  They take  half the profit, half the price  of the mattress. They literally double  the price so that you can go and live  on a mattress for 10 minutes in the bright daylight  in the showroom to choose it. No!  That's nuts! So Casper said, could we  sell mattresses directly  to customers,  cutting a lot of the cost of  the middleman out?  And yes, they can because they give you  100 nights to try  it. You don't have to try in a showroom. You have 100  nights to lie on your Casper mattress.  And if for any reason you want to send it back,  they'll come and get it.  By the way, look at that box. It comes in  the most compact box. Now, you're  going to say, but how do I get it back in that box? No, you  don't have to save the box. They'll come and  get it and they'll give you every penny back.  Here's, we just got the new Casper.  The hybrid mattress collection.  Here I am in my jammies  opening it up because as soon as the Casper  is out of the box, I want to lie on  it. I love these Casper  mattresses. They have created  so many new technologies. Bedding, bed  frames, there's that glow light I showed you.  This is the hybrid mattress collection  and I like it because it combines the pressure relief  of their award-winning foam mattresses  but it has springs. I know  you're going to say, wait a minute, springs? Yeah, watch.  Boing.  Springs. I'll tell you why you want springs.  First of all, it still fits in that compact box  but the springs give you  elevated lift, active support  and durability for all body  types, increased airflow  within the spring network so that they sleep  cool. Caspers have always slept sub-cool  and that's important. Sleeping cool is really  important to having a good night's sleep.  Does that not look comfortable?  And then, you see, I'm not a small man.  I'm not a little man.  And when I get out of some  beds, the mattress compresses  to the degree that I kind of fall out, right?  The enhanced edge  support in these new Casper mattresses  give you a firmer perimeter and  it makes a huge difference. I love  our new Casper mattress. You will too.  Comfortable, soft,  free delivery,  painless returns in the US and Canada,  a hundred night, risk-free,  sleep on it trial  and still, it comes in that small  box which is great because you can get it up the  stairs into your little apartment  in Manhattan simply  and easily.

And that movie is like, it's not about  ads being shown to us because it can go  through our email and stuff. And so, for  us, I do like that future,  and I like the idea of being able to have those  different aspects.  But you can't have that. Right.  Unless you have the data collection.

Transcript:  I think, frankly, Patrick, we're already there.  That's your point.  We get such value out of it that  people are just, whether  willfully, blindly, or  ignorantly, I don't know, but  pretending it's not happening.  I just, Sam, I will submit, who's our car  guy, was just on the radio show showing  me the interface  that GM and others  are going to put on your car soon  that will have, and  hugely valuable, for instance, the data of  parking spots nearby, and you could say,  where's a parking space? And then  it'll say, okay, turn left here.

Transcript:  the fact that probably  some parking people will pay  money to be the first on that list.  It'll also have a, there's a  Starbucks button, and you  can, you can press, you could say,  where's the nearest Starbucks?  I'll make sure my drink is ready. It knows you're  drinking. It'll be ready there.  All of that sounds like a convenience.  All of it is advertising driven, and  revenue for the car company,  right?  It's in, and it's inextricable,  and it's coming.  Because your  car, you know, with GM OnStar,  or with my Tesla, these are always  on connections to the internet, knows where you  are at all times. You know, when I first  got the Tesla, I thought it was going forward  when it should be going backwards. I called them up, and they said,  well, when did that happen?  Let's look at the log. No, no, you were in reverse.  Like, they know  everything that happened, moment  by moment,  and you know what? I don't mind!  Oh man, when I, I think it's

Start time: 6385.79
End time: 6413.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's so  fascinating, returning to the  parking space  example, is that  the fact that technology  and how much money  a company puts into that technology  can change how we perceive  reality? Because if the app is telling  me, yeah, here's this parking space, it's free,  maybe it's the only one,  you don't necessarily question  that in the moment that you're looking for a parking  space. You accept what the app is telling you.  That's nuts!

Transcript:  Well, and let me point out, as Sam did,  that huge amounts of gasoline are wasted  every year. People circle, you live in  Manhattan, if you had a car, which I'm sure you don't,  you'd be nuts to.  But if you live in San Francisco  with a car, you spend more  time driving around looking for parking  than you do going somewhere.  And so this will be a benefit for the  environment. It will save  everybody huge amounts of time.  We're all going to be happier. And you know,  the other thing this comes out of is  the information sharing that  you didn't like so much, Patrick, because  we've seen how poorly it works.  For instance, many municipalities that know  when the subway is coming or they know when the bus  is coming, they know they have all this  data, and they should because  it's their government's, we pay  for them, the taxpayers, they  should share that data, but they have notoriously  turned that data off to things like Google  Maps and Citymapper because they want  to make money on their own  New York City subway system  application.  We want them to share data. Sharing  data makes this stuff more useful.  So this is the problem. There's this  massive conflict between  what you want as a private person  and what you want  as a consumer of technology.

I think  and a lot of the  the feelings of  ambivalence that ordinary people  have when it comes to security, I think  comes from the fact that  it's too late for us to be secure  in any real sense because when  we all first got online, we were like,  whatever, set up accounts.  I don't know what a password is.  So I think for many of us,  especially young people like me,  it's too late for me to  ever have true control  over my identity online.

It didn't.  But, the funny thing  is, and then I stopped using it and nothing happened.  The other day, I'm talking to somebody, she says  congratulations on your weight loss. I said, how do you know  about that? She said, you just tweeted it.  I had set this up  five years ago,  stopped using it, bought another  WhyThings scale a couple of months ago.  It was a new one?

What did you say? I'm sorry, what? Sorry.  Did you say you needed tech support in Congress  again? What?  But somebody pointed out that  this coin is not aimed at  the US. This coin is aimed  at countries where they don't have  robust banking systems. People can't afford  banking  and where  the opinion we have in the US about Facebook  is not necessarily held worldwide.  It will also be popular in countries where  Facebook is the internet, much as  AOL was the internet.  I don't know that.

You have someone to talk to. If it's  completely decentralized and  the way that cryptocurrencies have been  going for the most part,  and one actually takes off,  you have no one to talk to, no one  to actually ask  what the hell is going on.

If you were on Facebook,  you didn't see the image, but what you  would see is the alt tag associated  with the image, which would tell you  what Facebook's AI had tagged  your photos with.  You would think this would be a big  eye-opener for people.  One guy tweeted,  I forgot Facebook uses  machine learning to tag our photos with what it  sees in the picture. To be fair, one person  beard is pretty much a spot on  description of me.  Your profile photo  may contain  one person beard.  But for some people,  the AI just tagged  my profile picture as basic.

Transcript:  I kind of love that. I'm glad to know  such a thing exists. I could use an affordable  velvet shirt.  Let's take a break.  I got an ad for you that I bet you've never  done on Rocket.  Tell me.  But I bet you, you support it.  You know that guys are  terrible at taking care of their health, right?  Because when we're kids,  we're taught  when you're playing baseball, the coach  says, you get hit by the ball, they say,  just rub some dirt on it, right?  But coach, I think I have a concussion,  just rub some dirt on it.  We're taught from a youth  to ignore injury, that it's  manly to go to the doctors  like nobody wants to go to the doctor.  In fact, that's why men with spouses live  longer. Literally, I'm convinced  because the wife says  or the spouse says,  would you please go to the doctor?  You've been coughing for six months.  Please go to the doctor. Right?  Well, same is true for ED.  Erectile dysfunction.  70% of guys who experience ED,  they just kind of live with it.  Trust me, this is not something  that's worth living because  there is a very simple cure.  Roman  is a wonderful organization.  It was started by a young guy  whose father is a doctor.  He had a heart condition, didn't know about it  until his father, fortunately,  his father is a doctor, said, we're going to take care of it.  Cold sores,  genital herpes, premature ejaculation,  hair loss, erectile dysfunction.  These are things we as guys  just go, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.  I'm fine. Don't worry. I don't want to go to the doctor.  I'm fine.  With Roman, you can get medical care for ED.  If it's appropriate from the comfort and privacy  of your own home, you do it online.  It's really easy.  You visit GetRoman.com slash  twit. You'll do an online visit  with an actual board certified doctor.  And this is key. They're not going to prescribe  it if it's inappropriate. But if they decide  treatment's appropriate based on your medical  history, what you tell the doctor, they can  prescribe the medicine. Like any  doctor, genuine medication delivered  in discrete packaging right to your door.  And you even get free two day shipping.  In fact, I'm going to make it even  better because we're going to waive  the doctor's visit fee as well for you.  So there's no reason  to suffer in silence. Visit GetRoman.com  slash twit. Connect with the doctor.  Get your free online visit  and free two day shipping.  But you got to go to GetRoman.com slash  twit. I think this  is so important that I really want to get  behind it and really encourage it.  Guys, if you're watching and you're saying, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Honestly, GetRoman.com  slash twit.  GetRoman.com slash twit.  I'm really glad that  they decided to trust us with  this because this is a hot button  subject and I think  they trusted that we would treat it with the dignity  that it deserves.  Now I am really curious  what you guys think of this.  Superhuman.  You familiar with this? It was a  email company  that raised a lot  of money.  And all of a sudden, this  guy Mike at Mike Industries  wrote  a piece about it that caused  a furor. Superhuman  has a receipt system  built into it. It's used by  a lot of people  to send out sales pitches and stuff.  And what  Superhuman does is they embed a hidden  invisible pixel in the  email.  That's an image. So when  your email program opens the  email, it tags  the image server and the image server  was read. It was here. It also will say  where it was read because  it knows from IP address roughly where.  Mike Industries' Mike Davidson says Superhuman  is a surveillance tool that intentionally  violates privacy by notifying  senders every time their emails have been viewed by  recipients.  Huge, huge  kerfuffle.  In fact Superhuman, the CEO  posted and backed down.  He said, okay, we're going to  change our policies. I agree.  I think this is really interesting because  you're getting tracking pixels in  every single email  that you get. Look in your spam folder. Look for  tracking pixels and you  will find an immense number of these.  Every marketing message  does it.  It is hugely common  practice and people act like  oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is different when it's  you know you expect that kind of  thing from a company but when  you're someone that you know  or you know you're corresponding  with. I couldn't  explain exactly why but it definitely  feels different to me and it feels  a little bit more icky.

Start time: 7537.39
End time: 7544.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Superhuman clearly took this seriously.  Go ahead, Simone. I think for me

Start time: 7544.94
End time: 7595.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  what bugs me  about this and it's something  he points out in the piece. He calls  it a dark pattern of  ethical decisions to say  well we do, we have this tracking  pixel. Why not do this  other thing? If people are okay with this  then they must be okay with this as well.  And I think what bothers me  about this and it's not something that we can  solve is that  once everybody is  doing it, it's again the frog in the  pot of boiling water,  we can't really avoid  or opt out of having  our location tracked.  Seeing whether we've read  emails or not.  And it's just kind of exhausting  I think. I don't have a  solution to it. I think you're right that a lot  of people are doing it.  Does that mean that superhuman made an unethical decision?  Still yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, because that's abuse.  That's psychological torture.

Start time: 7602.50
End time: 7613.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's a feature you could turn on.  Yes it is. And there are those who point out  well this is a problem with business emails. I don't know if you saw  my email. I want to know if you saw my email.  It's not unreasonable to say did you see my email.  I just

Start time: 7614.70
End time: 7618.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  automatically assume that every email  has a read receipt tracker in it.

Start time: 7618.52
End time: 7679.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I only use email programs that don't  load images. And I would strongly suggest  that anybody who's worried about privacy, just  it's very simple. Look in your email settings.  Can you turn off load images?  And in most email programs you can.  The ones I use you can. And so  those single pixel images  are never loaded. So they don't  get a read receipt from me. Superhuman  responded. Their CEO  says  we understand. We hear you loud and clear. We've  stopped logging information for new email.  We're releasing new app versions that no  longer show location information. I think that's one  thing that freaked people out is that location information.  He said we never showed the city.  We showed a generic kind  of location. We're deleting all  historical location data from our apps.  We're keeping the read status  feature but turning it off by default.  Like Apple does. Users who want it will have to  explicitly turn it on. And we're prioritizing  building an option to disable  remote image loading. So Superhuman  actually I think responded pretty well. They were shocked  shocked that they got hit  with this because they said well but everybody does  this. What is

Start time: 7680.76
End time: 7686.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  generic location information  if not city? Is that  like country? State?

Start time: 7687.71
End time: 7700.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I think so.  Yeah. You can see. Okay.  He says sometimes the product shows  approximate location data such as the state  or country in which the email was read. We  deliberately do not show city level  data. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're looking at that Mike's blog post.  I can't blame Mike for writing  it. It certainly  got people to start thinking.  I would just say I would  go a little farther and say not only is Superhuman spying  on you but almost all the Spam  marketing and all the marketing email you get. Every  newsletter you subscribe to. Sites have tracking  pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it's from  I mean I guess if my grandma sent me  an email which she wouldn't. Yeah.  Exactly. And she had a tracking pixel  then I would know that she did it by mistake.  So I wouldn't be bothered by that either.  Why does that bother you if she did that?

Start time: 7746.52
End time: 7747.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She wants to know if you saw it.

Start time: 7748.80
End time: 7752.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that's what I mean.  If it's on then she did it by mistake anyway.

Start time: 7752.50
End time: 7753.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what if she did it on purpose?

Start time: 7754.50
End time: 7760.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I'm trying to think. Maybe I would be.  Let's discuss it with me first I think.  Simone go ahead please. It does bug me.

Start time: 7760.50
End time: 7791.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry because I think a lot of times  I'll see a text message  and I know I can't reply right in that  instant and it would really  bother me as it does when I'm  texting my dad on WhatsApp.  Yeah. Yeah it's like I swear  I'm not ignoring you and to have  to like go through that process of  being like I'm going to reply to this later  but I'm going to do this thing first. I just feel  like we shouldn't have to do that  with remote communication. We should be allowed to take  moments to ourselves and say  no I will get to it  when I get to it.

Start time: 7793.21
End time: 7820.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's fair to call it a dark  pattern.  I don't think that's unfair. Also that's a cool phrase.  It is a cool phrase. If you go to darkpatterns.org  if you're wondering what that means  there's a really great site  that explains essentially dark  patterns are tricks.  They could be used by apps, websites, email  programs that make you  do things you didn't intend.  Whether it's  those checked boxes when you  download something. Was it Facebook that did that

Start time: 7820.58
End time: 7835.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  where you authorized  to have your  email contacts  and I think it was on one of the shows  I think we were doing a show together. Yeah. And they ended up  having you log into your email  through their service. Yeah and then uploaded it.  Yeah and uploaded it.

Start time: 7836.72
End time: 7920.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they have this site is great  darkpatterns.org. They have different names  for kinds. There's one. There's sneak  into basket where  you're purchasing something and then they put  an additional thing in your shopping basket  figuring you won't notice and  you just buy it. There's the Roach  Motel which is obviously  a site you check into but can't get  out of. There's privacy  zuckering. You're tricked into  publicly sharing more information than you really  intended to. Like your location automatically  being added to a photo and then afterward you're like  yeah. I think that what Superhuman was doing was privacy  zuckering. Yeah.  Yeah. I love that phrase.  You know I watched this whole thing play  out and I  understood the upset  but I think the upset  depends on you not realizing how often  this happens. You should maybe be upset about  it but you've got to be upset with more than just  Superhuman. Now here's  something I definitely  don't think is a good idea. China  is installing forcing  visitors who are coming in  through the Xinjiang region.  That's where they're having all the trouble  with the Ouija uprising and they're  putting Muslims in concentration camps.  If you come in through that  border checkpoint they're going to make you  install malware on your phone  that downloads  text messages, calendar  entries, phone logs and scans the device  for over 70,000 different files.  No big deal.

Start time: 7920.56

Start time: 7925.13
End time: 7935.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we can all agree that as soon as this  article came out the US  Customs and Border Patrol wrote to China  saying, hey where can we get that?  Let us check out the app we have there.  I'd like to download that.

Transcript:  This article is about Android devices but I  looked it up to see what they were doing  with iPhones and the New York Times reported  that they  would unlock iPhones or get iPhones unlocked  and then connect them via USB to a  handheld device. What that device  did could not be determined.  So they've got their work around for  iPhone too. Don't worry.
