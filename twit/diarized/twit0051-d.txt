Transcript:  Bandwidth for twit.tv podcasts is provided by AOL radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is twit, this week in tech, episode 51 for April 23rd, 2006.  Our first episode of our second year actually because I missed I miscounted  and I didn't realize that April 18th was the or 17th is the anniversary of twit  episode 1 and on the episode 1 of twit I'm going to go back and look at twit.tv  I will tell you who was on episode 1 of twit it was Patrick, Kevin, Robert Herron and me  and guess who's on episode 51 of twit Kevin, Robert and me and Patrick is being played by  David Prager. Hey I was on episode 0 man. You were on 0 and Alex Lindsay is really the newbie  here. Hey Alex welcome. Hey. I think that Patrick may join us he's actually on his way to Vegas for  the NAB conference, the National Association of Broadcasters, which now that we're all internet  casters has suddenly become much more important to us than it used to be. The first thing I want  to talk about we'll get to NAB in a little bit and Patrick will join us and talk about it because  he's there at the Flamingo but I think we should start off with Kevin Rose because you were in  the news this week. I was all over the place. You all about dig. That's right. So lots of digs  being taken a dig people complaining about lack of transparency and how pro how stories make it to  the front page. People are alleging that you know you're doing stuff. Where did it start with CNET?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who was it the first? Well it started with a blog that posted an entry about a spammer that had  been posting stories to dig. This is forever forever geek? Right forever geek and there was  two stories that made it on the home page from a website called the list apart which is an amazing  website. Both of those stories I dug and I was the 17th digger on both stories. So they thought  because of the order in which all the digs were happening that I was a part of this like ring or  bot that was actually digging these stories. People are so conspiracy oriented. Well it's well it kind  of I can see where they're coming from though because if you look at the actual history because  if you go into dig and you go into any story and then you go down to the very bottom is it lists  all the diggers and what order that they were dug in. You can see that this person was clearly  using a bot to dig all the stories because it would rapid dig 16 different accounts. So this is  the spammer that you're talking about. This is a very very common way that we see happen all the  time on dig. They're trying to game dig by using a bot. What like the biggest the number one thing  that we have to do at dig right now is fight spam on a daily basis. We are constantly constantly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  fighting spam. The reason is if you get dig on dig if you rise up on dig people you get a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of clicks. Yeah it's a ton of traffic. So it's like instant traffic to your website. But what the  person really didn't point out is that this person was also listed as one of my friends. Actually  three of their accounts were listed as my friends because I track a bunch of different people on  dig. I have about 40 different people that I track through the friends feature that's built

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  into the site. And you're tracking him though not because he's a friend may not be the best name  because you're tracking him. Right. It's someone that you like their stories and they submit good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stuff. So these accounts so spamming has kind of evolved on this site. So basically there's  there's several different ways that people can spam the site. There's the people that will sign  up for a mass account. So they'll come in they'll create 50 different accounts and their main goal  is to all dig the same story and get their blog or their website or their story on the front page.  So that doesn't work because we've we've kind of put in a karma system behind the scenes. This was  a long time ago like a year and a half ago right about a year ago. We added a karma system behind  the scenes that kind of takes a look kind of creates a baseline of all the different digging  activity that's done on the site. And then we can very easily tell when someone is a spammer or just  creating fake accounts or is all behind the same IP is using is behind one of the many many anonymous  proxies that are out there or you know we'll see the same URL that's getting reported by users  submitted over and over again. So that's that's the old way of spamming the site. Now the new way  that we've seen in the last probably I don't know 60 90 days is when you have people that are  submitting quality content to create these like fake accounts that appear to be real. So you'll  see sites that will are spammers that will create and submit you know a couple dozen stories that  are actually quality stories. Some will make the home page some won't and then they'll somehow get  in there with their own unique URL and try and promote it that way. Well that's not make sense so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  then it doesn't look like it's the same guy over and over. Right and it's very hard for our systems

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to detect that kind of stuff because obviously if they're using unique IPs if they're not behind  proxies that we can detect it's hard to really kind of put it's it's hard to detect when users  are kind of digging together. Is it have to look for patterns? Is it the same people who are doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the Fenteremine blog spam or who is who are these spammers? Just people that want to I mean it's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  different kinds of sites. We ban dozens of URLs per day, dozens of accounts and these just happen  to be a couple really good submitters I had added to my friends list here probably several weeks ago  and I was digging their stories because they were submitting stories from Wired, they were  submitting stories from just a variety of different really good high quality sites. I was digging  their stories and listed as number 19 on that day. So and then they spam you? Right well after  they kind of create so it's really strange some spammers will try and attack right away,  others will wait and kind of sit on these accounts for you know even months to kind of create a some

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  type of get a following on the site. Is this a structural flaw with the way Dig works or can you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  fix it? Well it's one of those things that we're just now it's funny that this should happen when  it did because we've known about this problem for a while and that people are creating like bots  and bots don't necessarily all have to dig at the same time. Sometimes they will dig with different  accounts that are out of order, sometimes they will dig you know 45 minutes apart, sometimes they'll  rapid dig. So we've known for quite some time that we had to start looking into this information and  we had to start tracking like different users and groups that are digging together like these hordes  that are getting together and digging different stories to look for potential fraud and potential  spam. It's just it's the nature of the beast like anytime you have a website that has that much  traffic and people these spammers know that if they can get their story they will try so many  different ways to get it on the home page. So this guy at ForeverGeek says he's been banned from Dig,  is that true? So what happened here is that this is actually kind of funny because he submitted  this story, it was reported by a bunch of users and removed from the site. So how Dig works is  that once you submit a story, if people go in and bury the story, so just like you can dig a story,  you can also go in and bury a story to say this is lame or this is a duplicate or this is spam and  once it hits a certain threshold of reports it'll be removed from the site altogether. Right and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's good, you need that because there's a lot of you know people put stuff up that's either

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stolen or crappy or duplicate or old. To be honest that's about 90% of our spam detection  right there is done by the users themselves. They actually will find the stories, they'll flag them  and when enough people flag them the system automatically performs its actions on those  stories whether it be removing them, whether it be we have all kinds of crazy things that kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  go behind the scenes. Well that's the spirit of something like Dig or Wikipedia or anything else  is that it's a it's community driven so the community polices it. Right exactly so the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  majority of the community is doing the policing there and what happens is if enough users report  a single URL it will get removed or placed on hold so that it can't be submitted over and over  again. So what happened is this user was getting reported, their stories were yanked from the site  and then they did a no-no. They went and they created multiple accounts under the same IP  address and tried to promote their own stories. Ah they spammed you. So this Forever Geek started  spamming the same story saying hey this is censorship how can you do this? Created multiple  accounts, actually exchanged emails with our admins or moderators saying why was this you know blocked  why was this put on hold and our moderators were very upfront with them and said hey listen you can  submit as many stories as you want to Dig about how Dig is you know somehow censoring your document  but you can't create multiple accounts to try and spam the site. You can't do that it's against our  terms of service. You know if you agree that you're not going to continue to do this we'll unban  your URL and so they sent an email back saying okay we agree and we unblock the URL. So they're  unblocked right now. Right so how many moderators how many paid moderators do you have? Well there's  three right now and there's people that are watching at 24-7 so it's always it's always  under watch and but the confusion really comes in actually how stories are promoted to the home  page because one of the things well one of the problems here and something that we're going to  change in the near future is that there really is partial transparency into actually what is  happening on the site. So you can't see when a story is starting to lose momentum or being that  is being buried unless you go into Dig Spy. So what we're going to be doing is in the near future  we're actually going to be adding the ability so that users can see when stories have been removed  from the system by the users why they were moved by the users and then you also have the ability to  vote to have something reinstated if it's been falsely removed much like the way that Wikipedia  does articles when they've been when they're up for deletion. Same principle we're going to apply  that to dig but as far as the promotion is concerned you know for when we first launched  actually when I first came up with digging we launched the concept it was based on a hard number  of digs so something you know at that time we had no traffic at all so something had 15 digs the  story would make it on the home page. Now it's based on so many different factors because there's  actually a promotion algorithm that goes into place that actually looks and picks out these  stories and promotes them to the home page. See I've always wondered that because it's not you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  would think oh if you go to dig.com you'll get the top stories that's a separate page that's the top

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stories page. Right so what you're seeing right there is like the most recently promoted story

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  by the algorithm. So can you roughly describe the algorithm or is it really too complicated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can give you a good idea of basically how it works. Promotion works on several different things  one we know the difference between real accounts and fake accounts so if you create 50 different  accounts right now and you all dug the same story nothing's going to happen to that story. So as in  how the spammer got around that though is they were creating accounts that were actually doing  real quality activity we're gaining quality karma and then when they all dug that they actually had  a legitimate account that could act towards promotion of the story. Fortunately most people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  aren't going to spend that much energy. Right exactly so that's but that's something we have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to deal with but basically it's based on the time of day it was submitted, the category that it was  being submitted to so some categories received more traffic than others, the total number of  digs, the karma behind the scenes that is applied to the story. We also look at things like user  reports so if something has a high number of reports it's going to require more digs to get  promoted. We look at things like are the diggers behind proxies, are there like IP addresses,  I mean there's a whole slew of things it's kind of like Google's page rank technology where you  know there's just dozens and dozens of different factors that go into the algorithm that actually  determine what and when something should get promoted. And you've added this over time I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this wasn't the way it was when you first started. Oh exactly I mean well we realized very quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  after we first started that you know people will try and spam the system so this has been one of  those things that we constantly tweak. The algorithm is still undergoing changes and will  continue to get tweaked going forward and it's all the research that we have to do and have to  continue to do to kind of safeguard that. So if I see something on the front page it's there  because it's recently promoted? Right so what happens is right around there there's no editors  on the site so every single story that you see is actually submitted by an individual that has an  account on dig. We get about 1300 new stories submitted per day they all live in this like bin  separated by categories for 24 hours so they have 24 hours to get enough votes before they're  actually promoted to the home page or enough digs. Okay. And so if they don't make it in 24 hours they  can still get promoted but they just fall out of that bin out of that queue so that people won't  be able to find them any longer they can still find them through searching and through other  people's profiles. They don't go away but they're not as visible. Right exactly so you know it's  important that you know people just have to realize that dig really wasn't designed it's it's not like  we didn't design it to where it's like a one-to-one vote and it's not designed to you know elect a  president or something it was really designed just to kind of keep the mass give the masses a way to  find and share quality stories and news. That's the main the main thing behind dig is every time  you dig something it's syndicated to your profile it's written to RSS it's shared with your friends  and that's how you find stories. In fact the way that I found those those stories that I dug I mean  I dug dozens of stories from these spammers you can go through my account in all different positions  not just not 17 every time. It was like I was number four sometimes I was number 300 sometimes  but I found that all through my friends profile because every time a friend digs on the site it's  presented to you in your own unique RSS feed and I get updates every you know five minutes showing  what my friends have been digging that pop up in my RSS reader. So it's just chance that you got

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  17 and that you were in the middle of a bunch of automated stuff. I mean you can I welcome anyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to look through my profile you can see I've been all over the place on these they've submitted a lot  of really quality stories which was interesting but I guess whatever whatever it was they were  trying to promote or whatever site just never got around to it there was a lot of wired articles I  mean a list of parts a great site and they have just a lot of other really good quality content  but it's one of these things that people do to kind of build up their accounts before they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  actually spam the site. I don't envy you having to fight this I mean it's a pain in the butt. It's  just the nature of the business. Yes but it's a shame because I mean well first of all I should  say you're succeeding and the front page of dig consistently comes up with interesting stuff that  you don't see anywhere else which is really probably the goal right you don't want all the  same stories you see on slash. you want unique interesting new stuff and that works I don't see  a lot of spam so your anti-spam is working so I think that's the bottom line. It's much like I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  think of like Gmail or any of these other services every once in a while something's gonna slip  through but for the most part if we can just stay on top of it and crack down on the spammers

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  everything's gonna be okay so. Thank you Kevin for I appreciate that I'm glad you could come on in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah well one other thing I want to say real quick so I'm actually going to we're gonna be  launching some stuff on the blog here the near future of some research that we've been doing  about these bots and watching the dig activity and we've actually been working with this company  it's visualizing the digs and can detect patterns and it's one of the most amazing things to watch  to watch the actual activity in like a visual medium where you can see all the digs happening  in real time as represented with small little dots on a map and so this is actually something  that we've been wanting to incorporate in the site for quite some time but haven't gotten around  to doing it yet but I'll be putting up and showing examples of these bots and spammers and you can  actually watch videos of all these real-time digs happening so that'll be something fun for  people to check out in the next few days. When you watch a visualization like that is it easier to  see? Oh without a doubt because it's very hard to detect when spammers are when you play it back  though and watch the activity of spammers you'll see these little zips these little lines occur  because you'll watch these bots and you'll see these mass digs just a little line will like  appear and then disappear across the screen and that is a spammer that's actually trying to gain  the system so it's a lot of fun to kind of create these tools and be able to analyze that stuff but  you'll see what I'm talking about it's pretty unique stuff. Do you ever think you'd go from

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  being the the bad boy hacker to the guy who's fighting the bad boy hacker? Well it's it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  challenging but you know no system's perfect it's just like Wikipedia or any of these other sites  that are user-driven and user-powered it's like we're constantly fighting the fight and that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just the way it's going to continue to be. But I think it's worth it because I mean I really  think you get something when you get the wisdom of crowds together and really makes a difference.  Yeah definitely. Yeah even if the crowds can be unruly at times. Alright story number two I  thought this was really challenging I'd love to get everybody to weigh in on this one because I  don't know what how I feel about it. It's Yahoo once again in the news for the third time being  accused by a Paris based human rights group it's called Reporters Without Borders say that Yahoo  turned over a draft email on its email system to Chinese authorities who use the information to  jail a dissident on subversion charges. The dissident was creating a document in his he hadn't mailed  it he was creating it in his Yahoo email account. It doesn't say whether the Chinese authorities  went to Yahoo and said who is this or whether Yahoo did it on their own I would hope they didn't do  it on their own nevertheless for the third time they've been accused now of doing this in fact in  2003 one dissident was given a four-year sentence based on information provided by Yahoo to the  Chinese government. What do you do with this? Robert how do you feel about it? It just shows  that you probably shouldn't be using public or web-based email. Blame the dissident? No I'm not  blaming the dissident at all it's just that you have to be aware because of unless you carefully  read the terms and conditions of using Yahoo's mail service or any any any free web service like  that you run into those risks where you could end up having that data either handed over or  forcibly turned over to people who don't have your best interests in mind and short of short  of just adopting strong encryption policies on your own end and encrypting everything you put  into that system which is a pain for the most part with any web-based service you're leaving  you're leaving that info out there to be used against you. I think it's unfortunate that Yahoo

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was pressured into a situation like that I don't know why they did it maybe it's because  they're worried about doing continued business with China say. Well but here's the thing if

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if if the same thing happened in the States if a terrorist and and and the federal Homeland  Department of Homeland Security says terrorists do this they use a mail accounts as drop boxes so  instead of sending the mail which would of course expose them to discovery they save a draft and  they give somebody the password to log into the account. That's pretty crafty. So and if the DOJ  came to a you know subpoenaed Yahoo and said hey we've got a terrorist in there Yahoo turn it over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure they would. Here's an example of something Yahoo wouldn't turn over maybe the story changed  I remember way back during 9-11 when 9-11 happened there was some family member whose daughter died  in one of the buildings and he wanted to have access to her email account just because he wanted  to see maybe just lost communications from his daughter some of the stuff that was going on with  her and Yahoo wouldn't wouldn't surrender that info. Oh yeah I remember that although they did

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  eventually settle in court but but but that person had died. That's interesting there are privacy rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was probably in the privacy policy and they didn't have anything about dead people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I think it was also it was a matter of an individual instead of the government you know when  the government wants that's right and government gets anything it wants. Well our government is the same thing as China's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so that I guess is the point is if you're in China and was made this point on the infamous  yellow lasers episode and got a lot of heat for it but I think it's he maybe didn't state it exactly  properly or but if you're in doing business in a government you have to obey that government's laws.  The real question is should Yahoo be doing business in a totalitarian state right because as soon as  you do business in China well if China Chinese government comes to you you got to do what they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well Google's doing censored Google searches in China because China is a massive freaking economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hard to tell. It's not just it's not just Google it's everyone. Google was just one of the last ones to step in the line the story I've been told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Everybody who's involved in search. Well I think there's always there's always this conversation about whether it should be whether you should embrace China or ostracize them.  And I think a lot of the argument is is that it by having some impact there I think this is how they I think.  It's rationalization. The rationalization is that it begins to open that up and eventually people work around the system anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah yeah but what they really are saying is one billion Chinese times ten dollars a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the thing is we can talk about China but I mean the United States wants that they're they're now looking to pass laws that say that all ISPs have to keep their data up to a year.  You know all of our all of everything that we're transferring back and forth and you see that I mean  now they're subpoenaing people's Google mail accounts. They're they're well I guess that was that was Robert and David's point which is just forget any privacy on these accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only issue is well you know here in this here in the US we hope the government will only do it for reasons we care about in China.  Subversive you know what's a subversive is it a terrorist. Well the Chinese government says subversives are terrorists. They're planning you know death and destruction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're planning to oust us out of our high and lordly position. Well they're planning to bring information to the people we don't want them to bring information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No they say this is now this sound this quote if you if you change it just slightly could be the same thing that the US government would said.  They they arrested these activists for making preparations for organizing a party and to use violence to overthrow the communist party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you could say to China it's a national security issue. Exactly. And if the United States says that they have a national security issue you better believe they'd do everything to try and get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean if the US government says this is a group that's forming to overthrow the US government by violence that's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you guys hear that worrying noise. Can you hear it. The worrying. What's that. Is the sound of George Orwell spinning in his grave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey another voices join us. We said goodbye to Kevin Rose. Patrick Norton is now on the line from Las Vegas. Hey Patrick. How's it going.  And so I'm glad we got you. You got your diet coke. I'm excited. I got a 12 pack of diet coke.  Geez stand back. So I mean I think this is a really interesting story. I think Yahoo really is doing what any company would do in another country. They have to obey the laws of that country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the biggest I think the biggest thing for people to realize I think a lot of us as we get used to email will we get very lax about it. We're willing to say just about anything on email.  People can get very disconnected and people just have to remember beyond all what the rights issues are here between the United States of China is that if you're sending an email it is like sending a legal letter to somebody.  But he never said he never said it. It was a draft. But if you're if you're doing anything online you're just you're leaving you're leaving a record there. That's why you need to be really clear. Yeah. That's why I use PGP. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's interesting because we're now blaming the victim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well it's just the people need to be aware of what their risks are. We're not whether it's right or wrong. We can't our chances of changing what the government's going to do is less likely than our ability to be be conscious of what we're doing when we do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know as we as we go down that process. I think the victim is aware too of that. He's living in a place where that information could be used against him. And you think if anybody would be on top of knowing how to protect their own personal information it would be a Chinese citizen with a government.  You know you can possibly use anything and everything that's written down against them. Hey I use PGP in the US. Yep. And that's a smart smart for everyone. And you're not even a you're not even a revolutionary are you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What they say you use PGP are you a revolution. So let's talk about the next story. Air Force One. Did you see this. This was awesome. I don't know if it was worth the money and time. Can you imagine how awesome. Why don't you tell us what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I you know what I saw the video because it was on the on the the Twitter list on delicious. But I guess some people rented a Boeing 747 somewhere. You're telling me that you're giving away where they did it. You're giving away the secret. So here's what happened. A video was distributed like my version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah because you're telling that the punchline and giving the pair. You tell you how. Yeah. First first you say this this video circulated of these guys and they're in they're wearing hoods. They're sneaking through the Air Force base. You see the guards. They sneak by. They spray paint Air Force One with with graffiti saying still free. Right.  And and and now the Air Force saw this. In fact Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Alexander a spokesman for the Air Mobility Command's 89th Airlift Wing which operates Air Force One said we're looking at it too. They were worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said that it looked very real and they had to actually check the aircraft for.  To see if it had been vandalized. And so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you can tell your part David. Well my parts the bone. Well my parts like the hell. It's great. They did it. They admitted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So this this organization they rent it. I think it was in San Bernardino. They rented a 747 which they did admit cost quite a good amount of money. They painted a good portion of it like one side of the majority of it to the exact or almost the exact color scheme and logo scheme.  The United States and has the seal of the president on it. I mean everything there. And then they I don't know how they what kind of people they used for guards and to make it look like it was at a location. But it really looked like it was in some Air Force base over a big you know some chain link fences and stuff.  And they made it look like they were running with. They had a couple of guys with the video cameras and some of them were the ones that ran up there and one of them wasn't. And they jumped the fence ran over there with their graffiti painted this stuff and took off.  Isn't it great. But the fact that it was 100 percent you know as far as I know is 100 percent no special effects no nothing. So it was 100 percent legitimate video. It just wasn't legitimate video of Air Force one. This is the way this is the way special effects used to be done Prager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For real. Do you think how much less money. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you don't have to actually buy get a jet and paint it. Right. But it's Mark Echols crew that did it. Well see that's the second. That's the second bottom line. So you still free. What is still free. You go to still free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dot com. And now you know what the story is. Mark Echols. Who's Mark Echols Patrick. Mark Echols is mostly known for designing clothing and recently got involved in video game designs. And he's also he's got a strong tie to the graffiti community.  I think you had worn Echols clothes on the screen. I have worn Echols clothes. Front of my almost actually did some designs for them. It's kind of funny. It's like you look at the bottom of still free dot com the web page.  Mark Echo Enterprises does not condone illegal activity acts of vandalism or the destruction of other people's property. We do however advocate freedom of expression graffiti as a recognized art form and the protection of consumer rights regardless of age race religion or political.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's walking a fine line. Don't do it in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well there's I'm trying to get neighbors is unbelievably talented guy down in San Jose.  And he went to Japan I guess the second or third time maybe he went to Japan. He would just go on these absolute berserk bonsai runs with his spray cans and leaving tags everywhere.  And I guess this you know the last time he did there he got you know nabbed like within 24 hours like off the plane within 24 hours was arrested and in jail because he was caught.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's just cool. So Echo has a lot of money though. I mean that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you've ever seen sort of a you know big old hip hoppy kind of skate clothes with a rhinoceros on it that's Mark Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One thing is that it's not it's not just something that was fun to do it's an excellent marketing campaign.  Brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did it get enough attention. The only reason I ask is because I didn't see it until just recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it went out Tuesday. You know it did not get it's not it's no lazy Sunday right which is now the benchmark for viral video.  I think Mark made a mistake by tipping his hand too soon. I don't think he should I think he should have waited a few weeks before he said how he did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah maybe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's a great idea. I think you're gonna see a lot more of this. I think it's you're right. I think it's marketing Alex. It's not it's not altruistic hey isn't this fun.  It's it's a very clever way to advertise Echo clothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or Echo's video games or you know graffiti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It positions them it positions the brand where exactly where they want to echo lifestyle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  But you know maybe he's maybe he chickened out maybe he was afraid that it was too realistic. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he didn't violate any laws at all by doing none none none.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah but you know who knows quite legal.  It could be illegal to pretend you're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it's it's pushing people towards the over violent overthrow of the United States government.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well according to the next version of the DMCA he might have violated the copyright of the design of the paint logo.  Hey let's talk about that.  Oh my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CNET broke this story this week and it is just pissing me off.  According to CNET they've seen the law nobody has yet because it's not been introduced.  It is backed by Alberto Gonzalez Bush's attorney general and representative Lamar Smith.  It is called the intellectual property protection act of 2006.  And I bet you if you looked at who designed you know if you looked in the Microsoft Word document  you would find the Recording Industry Association of America all over this sucker.  Upholding and I hope it doesn't go very far although Gonzales I mean the way the administration is  being thrown behind it.  Let me give you the quote from Alberto Gonzales.  He says let's see if I can find it here.  Such changes are necessary.  This is basically criminalizing not only creating copy you know circumventing copy protection but  even owning a device or a program that could circumvent copy protection would be a federal  offense punishable by 10 years in prison.  Such changes are necessary says Gonzales because quote the new technology is encouraging large  scale criminal enterprises to get involved in intellectual property theft and quite frankly  to fund terrorism activities.  Of course it's to fight terrorism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure how they tie terrorism into that it's just a you know it's all those 17 year  old kids you know that handbrake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Osama Bin Laden has alcohol under 20 percent and he's not afraid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah it's true I think that it's just it's truly an amazing thing to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what makes me mad is that the that it's not just the recording industry and the motion  picture association.  Symantec Sun Microsystems Oracle Intuit Red Hat other companies in the software industry are  throwing their weight behind this too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah I want to say something I'm just speechless it's like you can't it's so far reaching and  the DMCA first act was outrageous and this just takes it a whole you know whole step further and  I think that the other thing though is I think it really is going to open up a conversation  that Lawrence Lessig is having which is you know do we with the whole Creative Commons which of  course I'm a big fan of and it opens it actually opens a market for the for people who are willing  to produce inside of that you know we're committed the pixel core is very committed to producing all  of our stuff inside of Creative Commons specifically because I think that there's an opportunity to  say they're going to lock down that copyright they're going to push all that stuff into a  whole and we're going to we're going to exploit the rest of the market.  That's interesting.  People are going to be upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to have two tiers of content we're going to have copyrighted content and Creative  Commons content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's I think there's a possibility of that and the thing is is that the RIA and the MPAA and  whoever else is playing this should be careful because one of the things that I saw you know in  high-end computer graphics you know everyone's trying to protect their content because it's  sixty thousand dollars for a piece for some code you know that they're charging per seat you know  alias studio or whatever was sixty thousand dollars when I was working on it and so everyone  wants to keep track of all of that and what was interesting was is the ones that were the most  pirated were often the ones that were also the most financially successful because everyone got  to play with it everyone got to use it and the one and the companies that were the most successful  at protecting their software are no longer in business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's one of the one of the features of this new law which again has not been yet put in  to committee or anything it's it's not been proposed yet.  They're going to follow the criminal forfeiture techniques pioneered by federal drug laws the  RICO Act which means that they could there'll be civil asset forfeiture penalties for anything  used in copyright piracy so if you have a copy of a CDX copy DVDX copy they could they could take  your computer computers or other equipment seized must be destroyed or otherwise disposed of at  government auction.  Furthermore that gives them the right to impound server records which is exactly what the RIA has  wanted for a long time one of the things that's been in their way in these lawsuits is they  they can't they have to file John Doe lawsuits they can't go without court order they can't get the  name that goes with the IP address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which of course ties you back to the whole homeland security we want the ISP's to hang  on to their server data for a year and maybe it's not as much for terrorism as it is for the RIA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they make these laws too broad I mean there's a lot of companies that everyone's  surprised they're backing this and that's because you know companies like Microsoft and Sun make  certain pieces of software that they don't want to be pirated because it it hits up a little bit on  their potential revenue and selling things and include it up to and including as well what the  recording industry wants to be able to sell records from and they want to be that you could  even say that the the indie artists theoretically could want to make sure that they sell their stuff  rather than having it copywritten but when they write the law so damn broad  there was one person in this CNET news article from Wayne State University who said  under this new law if Sony decided to stand on its rights with that rootkit thing if McAfee or  Norton antivirus had tried to remove the rootkit it would be violating this new DMCA and that's  why there's a problem with it being too broad and it's just easier I think for these people to  support it because it makes it easier to just you know prosecute the crap out of anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there's of course the broad from a lawyer's point of view the broadness is actually its weak point  so while we can see this very very wide law be written it can go into and under exactly that  issue under the Sony issue the whole law can be struck down so there's also a chilling

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  poor law there's a chilling effect Ed Felton who was really a great security researcher at Princeton  said he knew about the rootkit the Sony rootkit but didn't publish because he was afraid  of being prosecuted under the DMCA this would make it you know he'd be facing 10 years in a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  federal penitentiary very it's a very scary law I particularly like the one that's like it would  be a federal crime just trying to commit copyright infringement willful attempts at piracy even if  they fail could be punished by up to 10 years in prison so I had this like magic vision of a google  search for something to back up and then since I love exploiting the children I'll say you know to  create a archival copy of a Disney DVD so that little Patrick Jr. who doesn't exist yet you know  that's exactly right and then scrub the thing into oblivion and and you can be arrested for that it's  very it's it's I mean it's it's a strong sign that the companies it's a lot of companies with a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  of power the pendulum has really swung I think it just gets you know continually more absurd  I think that it's either people are either going to completely ignore it it'll be completely  unenforceable or there's going to have to be a major revision how we look at copyright law  because right now it's mostly based on I mean most of our copyright law is based on Mickey Mouse as  it is right you talk about Mickey Mouse laws that copyright is a Mickey Mouse law literally it's  just you know everything every all there's all this great open source content that's available  up until right before Mickey Mouse was created and then everything you know everything we can't  touch anything after that and when you look at what how the how that affects us I mean because  it's hard to think about that for instance it's a wonderful life we would never know about it's a  wonderful life the movie if it hadn't expired you know if it hadn't been put out into a more open  source you know if it hadn't opened up because as soon as it opened up in the public domain that  that's what made that's why we suddenly started seeing it all the time you know and so it does  affect us it does affect how we the you know our experience of a lot of things is all of this stuff  is being closed down and there's this whole thing about google putting up a an impressionistic did

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you see this this uh oh the john miro family getting pissed off because google was honoring  miro i mean give me a break i mean but this is this is where it's going they weren't honoring miro

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  leo they were exploiting his works for their own profit they were violating the copyright

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they were i mean there's no doubt about it and and and google pulled it down

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right so they but google of course claimed that it wasn't violating the copyright and i'm not  i don't know it's just this is the absurdity that it's getting to though and i think that what's  going to happen is is that once again what what a lot of these copyright holders have to watch out  for is that this creates an environment where it actually opens a new market and this is exactly  where creative commons starts to open up where if they make it so hard for us to get any of this  content they may find that people start artists and other people and content creators start  choosing another path because they they realize how absurd it is well and it's just sad because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  here's google trying to honor and point out you know miro's birthday and and tell people  about this artist and and instead they've got to shut it down and now of course there's that  chilling effect again  think about the all the history that's available and the the archived content that's out there and  the fact that you know it can almost in forever now remain under you know copyrighted be considered  copyrighted material it just seems like that in and of itself it just limits what people  will be able to find or access easily i mean you think about all the stuff that libraries have and  are able to give out on a free or limited basis and it i was you would think that the internet  would be at least as easy to use and it's just turning into this this stifled environment or  everything is owned forever and that nothing will ever be you know as easy as just making a  trip down to my local library and hopefully if it's there and being able to check it out for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  little or no cost well there's i mean there's always been there's there's there's always some  crank that doesn't want the library to be able to to you know lend out books right or you know if  if you got right down to it if the riaa could outlaw you know i think what is it right of first  sale which basically i purchase a cd and i have the rights to it therefore i can sell the cd to  somebody they don't like that either they don't like that you know i mean if if if it was a perfect  world everything would be set up like one of those classic world-class ultra restrictive you know  dongle controlled license to use software licenses well but i mean that's what and in one hand it's  like you know if if i'm representing company x in my job as the president of company x is to  maximize shareholder value you know i'm not really thinking about that's the problem it doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  maximize shareholder value even and that's the real problem i think it's a fundamental misunderstanding  did the the the family of john miro do a favor to miro's estate no a lot a lot of times is holding on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is is greedy and bad business well it's kind of funny it's like is it's like you know it's not  even it wasn't even republishing a miro work it was using miro's style right i mean they google  it and it was an artist rights society which represents the miro family it was like you know  they're underlying copyrights and and you know you should have talked to us first and it's like  you know you know i seem to remember you know art feeding upon itself and moving forward in that way  right you know and copying works and mocking it has always been you know part of it you know i mean  it's not like they a piece of a miro painting and plopped it up there in fact you want to think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that miro would probably have loved it well and i think that i think a lot of people forget how  many i do of course because i go to africa a lot i get sensitive how many times a lot of these artists  who are who have been very popular in the not too distant future made made little trips to africa

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and came back and were suddenly very creative yeah yeah look at all the good ideas i go hey  wal-dizz-n-e got mickey mouse from a movie that came out a year before in 1923 i mean  we all artists build on the shoulders of other artists and that's where that's what the society

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  loses hello uh is your report is your pizza here this is uh disney legal sharks sharks  legal sharks could you substantiate that statement that's uh yeah i read it in wikipedia

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  i just made that up no i had heard that i i probably can't substantiate it i'll see if i  can find the reference but there was a very similar character apparently to steamboat willy  which is the first mickey mouse movie that was quite popular the year before stone is such a  harsh word in fact i i don't think there's anything wrong with it okay let's do it this way i think it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was steamboat willy came out and then evolved into mickey mouse well but mickey mouse is clearly in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  steamboat willy and that was a disney production you know the cinderella uh sleeping beauty snow  white uh where do those ideas come from the public domain i mean you don't have to use mickey mouse

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  i can think of a lot of places and we'd like to thank the public domain for allowing us to build  up the industry and now that we've built the industry up it's control most of mass communications  let's just lock down this to make sure nobody doesn't profit from anything ever again but i

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  think that i think that what what we look at is they're doing it to us and they're actually doing  something to themselves by they are going to continually sequester themselves outside of the  market you know and so in the short term this might make sense to them in the long term  i mean i i personally intend to take advantage of what they're doing right i mean i'm not saying  this in kind of a theoretical i think they're going to open up a window and and you know i

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  personally plan to exploit it well look there's a ton of creative common stuff i mean i think that  there are a lot of people doing this i think you're right i think it's actually interesting i hadn't  really thought of it but i think there might be this kind of two-tier content system that we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  creating here and the tier that they're in is going to be a tier that no one's using because  it's too much of a pain in the neck to do yeah who you know i don't want the feds to come get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  me because i'm right because i'm somehow breaking a law that i don't understand right right so that's  on for it's unfortunate that it's all moving in that direction i mean it is stifling access to the  the library and the the creative works of humanity in a sense i'm not saying it should all be out  there for free you know but at some point that information if it's been recorded and it's been  indexed and cataloged you should be able to search that easily with no problems at all i mean  i just keep thinking that look at the instance of the wayback machine the internet wayback machine  that was that was one of the neatest tools i mean they basically scoured and preserved the entire

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  first decade of internet use he's still doing it there's terabytes a day there they're archiving

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but you can no longer search through it really like you used to you used to be able to type in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it was taken down for the url and there's a search for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're the way back i've wondered i've wondered yeah this is a we we should talk  to bruce to cale about it because i've wondered myself how he gets away with this it's archive.org  and it's really cool but you're right i mean there's a lot of copyright violation going on  in there i don't know because for a long time oh that's cool looks like it might actually be back  but for a couple of years at least or at least a year ago it was it was taken offline with no sense  if it was going to just be preserved or torched or it's not exactly complete we should point out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no which is one of the yeah and not to take anything away from bruce to cale's efforts but  it's kind of like i'm looking at this and it's like okay so www.zdtv.com we've been three pages

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for 98 seven pages for 99 but they may have more uh i asked jd lasik about this he's with our media  dot org and part of this uh archive and um they archive more stuff than they put up and i think  that's what robert was saying they are archiving unbelievably huge amounts of data literally  terabytes a day okay things have changed though because at least now it is accessible again but  before i mean literally i think i think it was last year i was trying to pull up files for it and  they're saying oh we currently have to take everything offline due to the  the current state of legislation and whatnot you know what's cool is there is they're also getting  the help of uh libraries around the world to do this um they're they're essentially trying to build  a library of alexandria and the alexandria library is helping them with it which i love  so i think there is hope for this but there there are huge copyright issues  involved i don't know exactly how they solve those and i think one of the things they're doing is  just archiving it and hoping that it gets resolved down the road but uh could you know props to bruce  probably violates the dmca somehow yeah i'm sure it does oh all right moving on uh apple uh made a  of course it's a usual quarterly announcement of earnings and some very good earnings in the  earnings call on april 19th uh sales up a billion dollars profit up 41 10 billion in revenue but this  is the most interesting statistic uh 50 according to cfo peter oppenheimer 50 of people buying max  in the apple stores half of them are buying their first max apple not coming out on the bright side  here though in this uh in this case against the rumor sites the hearing on thursday in the sixth  district court of appeals on their lawsuit uh apple's trying to uh get these the information  about who gave these rumor sites the secrets but it looks like i have to say i'm reading the  transcript the judge uh the judges are not such big fans of what apple's up to and i don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they should be i think that even if you're an online journalist you should receive the same  protection as the first one provides to real journalists and i think the judges agree uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  franklin alia asks quote all you want here is the name of a snitch so you're saying you have the  right to invade the privacy of the email system and to trump the first amendment just to find out  who in your organization is giving out inappropriate information that's gotta hurt that's a good judge

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i think so if apple really wants to figure this out what they ought to do is just prove that  they're losing money and it's going to fund terrorism that's true that's a good idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  terrorism gets a lot of funding they've got to see the article a couple weeks ago from apple  insider about apple computer making a little girl cry oh no what happened they uh so it's up on  apple insider.com and some nine-year-old is doing their you know learn how to write a business lever  so she wrote to the chief executive of the company that made her ipod nano and uh three months later  she gets a letter back from cupratino and isn't from mr jobs it's from the senior council of the  law department oh god telling the third grader that apple doesn't accept and i quote unsolicited  ideas so she should send them her suggestions and if she wants to know why she could read their  she should not send them her suggestions she wants to know why she could read their legal policy  posted on the internet and apparently the little girl like wigs throws a letter up in the air ran  into a room slams the door and it's like i didn't say the legal reasoning behind that but they killed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  bambi's mother now see that's a that's a modern lesson that kid's learning that that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  general council called the girl back to apologize after cbs5 did a story on it slamming them you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  know in apple's defense we would do the same thing at tech tv people would send us story ideas what  you don't want is somebody to send us a show idea we don't read it but then we do a similar show and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they sue us it's tough nowadays and legally you have to send them an email saying that you're  or i mean a letter that says that we're not gonna we can't read this unless you agree never to sue

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  us yeah exactly but nine years so you need to tweak the lawyer bot a little bit so that it makes  slightly friendlier yeah friendlier in response to emails like that i think if you get down to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the issue here though it's it's whether or not an employee at apple was was being was exhibiting  criminal activity by by leaking trade secrets right and then and then it's the it's well and  this is what the clash between the yeah it's the clash between the criminal activity and the  protection that the first amendment provides i think and the judge said well couldn't you just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  do a lie detector test i mean what's the deal here i don't think i don't think apple's above that  oh no i'm sure they're not you told me it sounds like apple was just getting lazy it's like oh we  won't do an internal audit to figure out how this information is being leaked but we'll take it into  a court system and see if we can have the legal you know i think it also has it has a social effect

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  within the company as well i mean if you see that apple is really serious and really upset about  leaks coming out of the company people at apple are generally fairly paranoid about saying anything  related to anything and this and this only increases that paranoia so that i think that  even if they lose in a lot of ways they they made their message that they're that they're serious  about this stuff and if you're going to start leaking it you better be ready to you know deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with apple somebody once told me that steve told three executives some secret about an upcoming  product or a code name and told them he said only only you guys know this word if it leaks out you  will all be fired it leaked out they were all fired no way that works too hey there's an

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's an interesting parallel of this story to the dmca one we were we were talking about how  we're a little bit surprised about certain high tech companies that came out in support of a new  this new dmca and with this story there's a couple of high tech companies including intel  that are coming out and writing a writing little file little briefs called friend of the court  in support of apple because they're also worried about say some of their trade secrets and they  want to know if they could use any legislation that comes out of this to protect their own

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  intellectual properties if they have it leaked i just got to get rid of the courts get rid of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  all the courts we don't need i think the other the other big question is is that there's a distinct  there's this distinction that they want to make between uh you know these blogs and a full-fledged  newspaper which admittedly a full-fledged newspaper has all kinds of rules about what  you can put up and they are and the newspaper is well kind of and whether they actually follow them  or not or whether they you know all of that stuff but you think a blog is less accountable than a  newspaper if if a newspaper shows that it didn't do that didn't do uh do pro you know there's a  due process of research and so on and so forth it can find itself in a lot of legal problems whereas  if a if a blogger who has none of that over their head and just simply puts up whatever they  you know whatever they want to put up i think the concern is is that you know and dig is a perfect  example of the blogosphere going crazy over data that wouldn't show up i mean did show up in a  couple places uh that are in major media but you're right no print paper picked that up but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if a print if a print paper does it this this is also a certain it's not like the conversations  everybody's having around the time when the drudge report was first writing notoriety and a lot of  times the drudge report would come out with something um and they would be unfettered i mean  you could say like yeah they would say things a newspaper wouldn't say but a lot of times the  newspapers would report them five weeks later on page 12 monica lawinsky i mean drudge was the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  first person to just talk about that and you know and i'm not saying there's not a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  blogging activity that's incredibly irresponsible but there's also people can be you know can hold

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  themselves to fairly high standards they can some do and i think that the question is is whether  they are not i mean for instance dan rather arguably lost his job over posting information  that wasn't totally accurate right and and so that's the that's because of the blogosphere  that wasn't the blog i mean but that's what what's happening is is that there's a lot of  he wouldn't have been fired without the blogosphere exactly no other oh right right exactly  but the i think that that's the his uh but in the in a press environment you know you can't if he  had been a blogger if dan rather been a blogger i mean he wouldn't have been as big but nobody

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  trusts i mean everybody reads blogs knows there's it's all bs right i don't know i've had a bunch of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people like create blogs tell us that everything we write it you know ziff davis or cnet or ipg is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  all you know bs that's but readers know different i think readers know different i like you think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you can say anything in your blog as far you can say anything you want as long as it's not slander

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  or libel right or an apple trade secret or apple trade secrets here's a here's a great stupid law  westchester county has passed a law requiring shopkeepers to have wi-fi security not on the  surface of it not a bad idea but what wi-fi security do they require a firewall not encryption

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  not anything useful just a firewall the law i think this is this is indicative of just the  all these politicians who have no idea what they're dealing with and no idea what they're  doing and they don't ask enough people or one person comes up with this really really good  idea because someone hacked their computer you know that's what it is some council member probably  who you know someone hacked their computer they got a virus and their chief information officer

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  westchester county uh said that firewalls easily available firewalls will protect credit card  transactions from being detected by a hacker being posted outside the dry cleaner that uses  a wireless network so this law is bad in so many ways first of all it shouldn't there should not  i don't think there should ever be regulation forcing people to have secure wi-fi i mean if  it's if you have if you have insecure wi-fi it's your problem but second of all if you're  going to have legislation make it be something halfway intelligent they also have uh now this  may not be such a bad thing like that new copyright law yeah there you go they also do force the uh the  uh the uh public hot spots to post post a message saying you are accessing a network which has been  secured with a firewall however now then this is good they go on and say since such protection  does not guarantee the security of your personal information use your own discretion so who knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so why is that why is the what is it is the the sorry i'm trying to person hysterically  no is it has there been a problem in the township with apparently unsecured wi-fi so is it is it you  know i mean if if we're losing the confidence of the people to use wi-fi in the streets then you  know and i love public wi-fi this isn't even about public wi-fi this is bizarre it's bizarre i think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they should meet the state trooper in sacramento who arrested the guy for using a pringles can antenna

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they they all belong together somehow actually you know i if it was the right pringles canna held  by the right person in the wrong place i can see where that might happen maybe especially if they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a bit of a smart ass yeah maybe oh i just i love these wi-fi laws it's funny there's just something  that the local government has just kind of jumped on wi-fi as being okay with dmca part two you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  accessible it's actually that stuff is really fascinating when you get someone who can describe  it i worked on a case a legal case that was related to rna and dna replication and stuff and  i used to do visual visualization right for a court and uh and it was fascinating that was one  of my favorite things was you'd you'd have someone who would then bring it down to layman's terms  right to talk to the jury about it well that's gonna be the challenge you bet and if you find  someone who can bring that down to layman's terms i mean a lot of how all this stuff works and how  they uh you know figure how they figure it out and how they slice up the dna and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  oh i only do all this stuff is really really cool well one of the reasons i want to do it is i really  think that's where the future is i mean the infotech revolution has been important but  wait till we get to biotech uh and and then combine the two and it's just going to be incredible so  oh the crossover though right now i mean there's that one company in in the silicon valley that  makes those actual chips that they've uh run fluid across and they're able to do dna or uh  protein analysis and oh what's the other genetic analysis bay but basically at speeds never before  i thought possible and i guess they could look at something like a hundred thousand base pairs of  proteins per sample with the first generation of the tool and now that's being quadrupled  so that it's just for me it's impressive it's it's going far beyond i mean just just the speed at  which they're able to look at the you know what makes things tick on a biological level is just  it goes hand in hand with the silicon valley's computer industry as well now  right i think it's very significant i think it's very significant i wish i could think of the name  of the company that's doing it has some oh crazy techno sounding name but it's just uh  tune into the only tune into our show fib it's going to be called futures in biotech futures in  biotech yeah very cool and uh it's a pilot so i'm not you know i just want to see what we can do and  see if there's an interest in it so if people like it that'll be uh not next week i'm in canada this  week but it'll be a may week of may 1st so i'm i'm gonna race with you david to see you can come  up with more programs faster i have an advantage though because i do audio it's a little easier to
