Transcript:  Absolutely. I'm back in nicely air-conditioned Montreal and away from your heat wave.

Start time: 163.95

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then from all the way from Taiwan,  Ben Thompson of Strutechery. Great to have you, Ben.  Great to be here. Early morning. Good to get up early.

Start time: 173.26
End time: 184.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm this weird, weird middle thing. I mean, I was in San Francisco last week,  but while there, I tried to stay on Taiwan time and I'm halfway succeeded.  So I've been kind of in the halfway time. Oh, you must be. You're just messed up.

Start time: 184.82
End time: 193.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it. You're just shocked. Ben and I were at a Japanese whiskey bar until very late at night.  Oh, what fun. I don't know how he's doing this today. Oh, what fun. That's awesome.

Start time: 194.32
End time: 214.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think anybody who's tuned in today knows that probably most of the conversation will be about Apple's event.  Although John McAfee is running for president and I think that there is something to be said there,  but we'll talk about that a little bit later.  You were at the Apple event, Ben, I take it. That's why you were in the Bay Area.

Start time: 215.88
End time: 223.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it turned out I actually had had something else going on.  It's hard to justify flying over just for just for the Apple event, but it turned out I had two events in one week.

Start time: 223.08
End time: 328.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it worked out perfectly. So yes, I was there. It's true. You can watch now the stream. Thank you, Apple for streaming.  Right. No, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. And I know, Rene, you were there.  And of course, the real advantage of going is the hands on because that's the only way you can touch this.  Exactly. Yep. So before the event, we talked a little bit about this on Mac Break Weekly.  There was some there was some discord in the Apple press community.  There were those like John Petchkowski of BuzzFeed and Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac who said, no, they're going to announce an iPad.  And then those like John Gruber said they can't possibly announce an iPad. The event would be too long.  Well, they were both right. The event was too long and they announced the iPad to almost two and a half hours if you include one direction.  Sagan? Zing. Zing. They were both right.  I was shocked because normally Apple begins these events with a discussion of sales, how well the stores are doing, how many people use iPhones.  And we knew it had to be an iPhone event. They've got to announce a new iPhone that they buried that right at the back.  They opened with WatchOS 2.0 and weirdly these Hermes.  I don't know. It looks like a B&D band. It was a double wrap kind of like leather.  I think it's called the double tour. Double tour. Pardon moi. A double tour. Pardonez moi. Yes, to use it, to say it correctly.  That wasn't One Direction. It was One Republic. I'm so sorry. We keep making that. Yeah, everyone's making that.  Is there a distinction? One's a boy band and one's a boy band. OK, that's the problem I'm having.  But Harry is in One Direction, not One Republic.

Start time: 330.04
End time: 350.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. If it had been One Direction, that would have been more humorous because one of the rumors is that Taylor Swift was going to perform.  And so had Harry Styles showed up. Yeah, her ex. I'm showing way too much familiarity.  I can't believe you know this. In fact, I can't believe I know this. This is why Sir Techery is so on point.  You've got to stay in touch with what's going on. So they talked about the watch.

Start time: 350.70
End time: 357.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then they went right to the iPad Pro. Long rumored. In fact, there was nothing really in these announcements that we didn't already know from the rumors.

Start time: 357.80
End time: 377.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the thing with this is that what to me is always not the interesting thing. It's how and why that's the interesting thing.  Like you iPad. iPad Pro has been in the works for years.  And Apple TV has been in the works for years. And all the stuff here, they've been working on it for years.  But what they choose to ship and what the reason, the rationale they give behind it is what makes the events interesting to me.

Start time: 377.74
End time: 451.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good. I think that's the challenge. I think that's something that why Gruber was suspicious of the time.  I actually tweeted because Tim Cook said the biggest news in iPad. I said the biggest news in iPad is that Gruber was wrong.  But I think what I actually thought the event was as a production was quite good.  One of the better ones. Apple's done in quite a while. And despite the fact there was so much in there, it was relatively long.  It was it was quite tight. But what was missing was one of my favorite post jobs.  One of the most popular post jobs is the iPhone 5S keynote and 5C.  And this is when there's all apples have a low cost phone and they have to go because one of those is kind of the big thing going on.  And Apple came out starting to talk about the iTunes Music Festival.  That is this highly produced video that was really compelling.  And basically, if you step back and look at the presentation as a whole, the presentation as a whole was making the case that Apple's saying, no, we're not going to compete on price.  We're going to compete on delivering an entire experience that covers all these sorts of things.  And in that context, it made the phone delivery much more compelling.  And that's what gets lost when you have these events with all these things in it.  There was no real context around a lot of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what you're saying is subtext is what's important in these events?

Start time: 455.86
End time: 456.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some sort of text.

Start time: 456.84
End time: 459.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is the subtext? What is the subtext of Wednesday's announcement?

Start time: 461.60
End time: 484.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, if anything, it was, you know, we're firing at all cylinders from a new product perspective.  I mean, the sheer amount of stuff that was introduced was, you know, pretty overwhelming in some respects.  But the sort of big picture, where does this fit in what we're doing, what we care about that was by necessity absent.

Start time: 485.96
End time: 524.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's funny because there really a couple of different audiences for any Apple event.  There's there's us, the over over involved Apple press.  There is the person who buys Apple stuff and wants to know what the next thing is, so they can decide whether to buy it.  And then there's the rest of the world. I was in New York City.  I felt terrible. Like this first Apple event I've missed in a long time.  And I'm looking around and I'm in a cab.  Nobody's listening to the Apple event on the radio.  Nobody's even taken any notice of it at all.  They're just they're living their life.  They don't understand it's the most important day of the year, and they don't seem to know.

Start time: 525.24
End time: 566.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's why the context is important, though, because, yes, the biggest audience is well, first off, journalists.  And now that it's streaming, that's expanded.  And maybe that's changed or thinking about it.  But this is their real chance to kind of shape the messaging around their products and what they do.  And that's that's something they didn't take advantage of there without there being that sort of context and how you should think about this sort of stuff.  That's that's exactly what I mean by by what is gone now.  And maybe part of it is because it's streamed now.  And I think with that 40 million or something like that, I mean, yeah, maybe it wasn't your cab driver.  But, you know, it's kind of like the whole we don't need to do macro because we have stores sort of argument whether you buy it or not.

Start time: 567.34
End time: 597.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there was another issue here, too.  And that's sort of what I think through John and not to defend him, because he doesn't need it.  But most years they have two events.  They have the iPhone plus something event and then the iPad and Mac event.  And once it was decided they weren't going to have the October event, that this was going to be the only event in the fall, then everything that's ready has to fire and anything that's not stage where they just gets dropped in a press release.  So the context for this is not one overarching thing like music.  And here's all the stuff you can do with music.  But it's these are the products we're announcing this year.  And how are we going to sort of put those into chapters in this event?

Start time: 598.34
End time: 658.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And but, of course, mostly you cover windows and ZD net blog.  And I'm thinking I'm looking at this and I almost can wear two hats.  If I'm if I'm the shoe for the record.  Yeah, for this, if I'm the cynic, I look at this and I say in every respect, this is Apple playing catch up.  They're making a surface pro analog.  They're finally, you know, they're making an Apple TV, which is basically a Nintendo Wii combined with maybe a fire TV.  They're making phones that, you know, finally have 12 megapixel camera.  They're kind of the last one still making an eight megapixel camera.  If there's there's one context, you can look at this and where you just say, well, is Apple playing catch up?  There's nothing innovative here.  Of course, there's a second context which we Apple enthusiasts embrace where we're trying to really understand something that there's more important.  What's your take on on it?  And what did you think overall?

Start time: 659.56
End time: 756.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this looks to me like the the coming out of a company that is in full maturity.  Everything that they showed at the event was incremental and yet a positive improvement there.  They don't have to convince their market to go and buy stuff.  They don't have to come out with magical and revolutionary things to try to expand the market right now.  They already have a very loyal following.  They already have product cycles that they've settled into very nicely.  And so these are all the the logical progressions of every single product that they have in their in their in their product line.  So it's and even the the Hermes stuff is an extension of their desire to become identified as a luxury brand.  And so that was they started that with the watch edition.  And now they're starting to put other other brands on top of it.  This to me is not just a company that is sort of secure in its products, but that is and not just firing on all cylinders, but that has this steady, almost monotonous pipeline of products that it doesn't really have to sell very hard anymore because it's audience.  Understands what they're going to do.

Start time: 757.14
End time: 765.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But if you look at the rhetoric, they're trying to convince people that look at the tagline for the iPhone 6S.  The only thing that's changed is everything.

Start time: 766.62
End time: 776.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's sort of a joke, though, really true.  All the S phones are always said to be like, you know, they're boring.  They're just an incremental upgrade.  So Apple sort of playing on that to make fun of themselves before anybody else.

Start time: 776.18
End time: 777.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so they're making fun of themselves.

Start time: 778.44
End time: 791.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yes. So it's like the idea was the iPhone 4S came out.  Oh, it's boring. It's the same as the iPhone 5S came out.  Oh, it's boring. It's the same.  So Apple saying up front, the only thing we know it's the same, but everything else has changed.  So I think it's an attempt to own that.  But that's the only thing that's changed.

Start time: 791.52
End time: 796.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Everything is actually a lie.  It is not it's it looks exactly the same.

Start time: 798.08
End time: 800.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure, but I mean, it's got different aluminum, different glass, different.

Start time: 801.14
End time: 823.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. When I were using aluminum, seven thousand instead of six thousand.  Well, it makes sense in context, Leo.  OK. Well, then OK, then as long as we're talking.  No, no, I'm going to give you a chance to make them to be fair because I'm being unfair.  I know. Then on the Apple TV, the future of television,  I think it can make a strong case.  This is actually the past of television finally catching up to the present of television.

Start time: 823.48
End time: 855.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's it's entirely perspective based.  If you look at Apple, they weren't the first to the phone.  They weren't the first to the iPad.  They played catch up in both those areas.  That's sort of their game.  Very rarely are they first to market.  Usually they wait. They try to see what's in the market, what pain people are expressing.  Then they very carefully pick their shots.  And they waited a long time for the Apple TV because they were already in that market.  But doing things like the iPad Pro with the keyboard for a lot of people, this is fairly or unfairly.  There's an old joke like Nokia invented everything in 1812, but nobody saw it.  And it's a similar thing.  All these products have been introduced.  But Apple is trying to make the mainstream.

Start time: 856.14
End time: 871.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I, by the way, I'm putting on a very contrarian hat here.  That's your job, Leo.  Well, because I am actually very I think there's one product that Apple announced  that I think is actually a world changer.  But I want to let you guys tease that out first.  So what you were Ben, you were going to say something.

Start time: 872.84
End time: 885.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I was just I was just going to I was just going to make the point that if your if your reason to say that the success is the same is because it looks the same as to kind of fall into the stereotype of design is just how it works.

Start time: 885.76
End time: 889.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but to say that everything has changed is clearly not true.

Start time: 890.46
End time: 893.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, since when has Apple's marketing been clearly 100% true?

Start time: 893.76
End time: 912.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And and just to be just to be clear, I think Apple is is having a hard time in recent years coming up with good marketing tag.  They use all the good stuff.  Last year. Well, last year, wasn't it bigger than bigger?

Start time: 912.60
End time: 914.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not so good either.

Start time: 914.28
End time: 978.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bigger than big.  Which was I mean, I think so there's two there's two things that are going on here.  Number one is I can imagine the marketing meeting where somebody just throws up their hands and says, oh, screw it.  You know, we got to come up with is this the best we got?  Fine. It's the best one on the whiteboard.  Let's use it. And the other thing is they're doing a sort of time tested technique, which is to it's an almost jujitsu marketing.  Right. Take your weakness.  Right. And make it a strength.  So last year, their their weakness was that they were was that they were finally years after the rest of the market had started delivering phones that were the size that people wanted.  They finally delivered a phone that was the two phones that were big enough for people.  So so they come up with a slogan bigger than bigger.  So it's not just bigger.  Well, yes, it was. The major point was that it was bigger.  And this year, the only thing that's changed is everything.  Well, actually, no, everything has changed a little bit.  But everything's a little bit better.  And if you're in the market for a phone right now, this is your good choice from Apple.

Start time: 980.44
End time: 982.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you're on fire. It's two for two. Great.  Thanks.

Start time: 984.82
End time: 993.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's kind of what Renee was saying, what there's a certain sense of irony when you say the only thing that's changed is everything.  There's a there's an Iran. It's jujitsu.  I think that's a well, I took it actually.

Start time: 994.68
End time: 1018.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I maybe just because I think in the financial world and business world, but I I took it as a direct kind of statement to Wall Street.  I mean, the the big kind of concern around Apple and their stock right now is is the comp, the comp problem, which is the year over year comparisons to last year, which were you know, which was insane and clearly possible to sustain that kind of growth.

Start time: 1018.24
End time: 1020.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The world eventually ran out of humans.

Start time: 1021.10
End time: 1069.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, no, Apple doesn't have I mean, that's the advantage of being being an extensive device is Apple's has Apple.  Apple doesn't have the human problem.  It has the price problem.  Right. The affluent problem.  Right. Which is in some respects, there's something to be said for that.  The but when you say that nothing has changed except everything, I think that's speaking to the there's going to be a reason to buy.  There's going to be a reason to upgrade.  And what's interesting is actually I thought the event was very compelling from reason upgrade, not just but only partially because the feature perspective, but also some of the financing stuff they talked about.  I think actually the changes in carrier plans in the US is going to work hugely to Apple's benefit.  I think the kind of the conventional wisdom that Apple wins because of subsidies is pretty sorely mistaken.

Start time: 1069.76
End time: 1082.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Even on stage, Apple's still quoting prices that are subsidized prices.  I think they were loathe to say starts at 650 bucks.  I bought the 6S plus, you know, loaded.  It was over a thousand dollars.

Start time: 1083.36
End time: 1108.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, well, when they first saw the slide and only showed the kind of going everyone in the journal section was kind of like snickers.  Shaking their. Yeah, exactly.  But they followed it right up with the then they listed all the carriers like per month.  Oh, good. OK.  And then they did their their own upgrade plan, which is very interesting.  So actually, I thought they were relatively transparent about it, even though, yes, of course, they didn't show the they don't want to tell you how much it is because it is it's a really outrageously expensive.

Start time: 1109.46
End time: 1150.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although, on the other hand, I went to I went to Apple site to before the show today because I wanted to.  They're sold out.  Well, I want to check out some of the details of their financing, because I wasn't exactly clear on how that was going to work.  And I was pleased to see that they're not quoting contract prices.  They are quoting full retail prices and then the monthly contract prices on the 24 month installment with there was an asterisk on those.  But it's still, you know, one ninety nine, two ninety nine, three ninety nine is not honest.  And I didn't see that when I went to the website.  So that was, you know, to be fair, a little bit.

Start time: 1151.60
End time: 1221.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A big problem that I have with this whole like Apple is going to lose once or once it's no longer subsidized thing is there's kind of this implicit like consumers are stupid argument here.  And I do think consumers are lazy, but they're not stupid.  Right. No, exactly. I mean, I don't think anyone is is.  You know, we'll see.  I will see how it plays out as new contracts thing, but I don't think that it's necessarily going to hurt Apple.  And if if anything, the the additional flexibility and freedom to upgrade sooner and more quickly is going to help them.  And all there's lots of forces in the market that are in the iPhone's favor right now, first and foremost of which is people are now buying their second or third smartphone.  And the big thing is when you're buying your first smartphone, you didn't understand how important the smartphone was to you.  Right. So now you're willing to pay more.  I agree. Exactly.  Because you realize that this is now the most important device in your life.  And if there's one thing you're going to pay a premium for, make sense as that thing.  And yes, you say, Leo, a thousand is a lot.  Well, one, you're buying the total top of the line.  But two, in the grand scheme of things, a thousand dollars is a lot less than, say, buying a BMW.

Start time: 1221.20
End time: 1228.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Or that's not what you should compare it to you because you're compared to, for instance, a Windows PC for four hundred dollars.

Start time: 1228.98
End time: 1256.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but the point is, is that absolute numbers matter just as much as relative numbers.  Yes, relatively speaking, a phone is much more important, is much more an iPhone is more expensive than a perfectly valid computer.  No, exactly. But but but the absolute premium of four hundred dollars is a lot less than the absolute premium.  If you want to buy the single best car, the absolute premium is massive.  You want to buy the single best stove.

Start time: 1256.52
End time: 1287.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can talk about Apple's advantage here is that they're the only ones to make the iPhone.  They're the only ones who have a price for the iPhone.  If you can. But so you can't.  It's Apple's not cheap, though.  No, but look, here's the Moto X, which is a fabulous phone for four hundred fifty bucks.  So I think this is on the one hand, this is a difficult thing for Apple because there are phones of equal quality that are half as much.  But they're not iPhones because only Apple can make an iPhone.  So they have an advantage.

Start time: 1287.16
End time: 1354.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With respect to the equal quality, I mean, I like the Moto phones.  I think they're quite good.  I would be I would be happy to use one.  But it is inferior from a build quality perspective.  It's inferior from industrial design perspective, and it's inferior if you prefer iOS, which a lot of people, including myself, do.  So I think people are a little too casual to throw out.  It's equal. It's good enough.  And I get the good enough argument.  You can certainly have a very fine and productive life with a with a with a Moto phone or a whole host of Android phones.  But that doesn't mean that they're equal.  And the fact of the matter is, in the consumer market, we see this in industry after industry after industry.  People are willing to pay a premium for a superior product.  And I think where tech kind of got its head wrapped around an axle is because tech grew up in the in the enterprise market.  And enterprise market is very much a cost versus features very kind of like which one matters.  And the user experience isn't really a factor in enterprise buying.  It just isn't. And so I think a lot of people in tech learn their long lessons from that.  And now we're in a consumer market.  And actually, we should be looking at other consumer markets to understand consumer behavior, not look at tech's history.

Start time: 1354.80
End time: 1400.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think it's no accident that Apple's focused on fashion because fashion is the number one consumer market where  features are not this are not the deciding factor.  You price it based on some imaginary fashion.  It makes you feel it makes you feel.  Thank you. Hey, one thing I do want to bring about about the low monthly payment plan that Apple's offering.  If you compare it to other plans from other from the carriers, because all of them in the U.S.  do that now, they're fair. It's fairly comparable, right?  If you're buying Apple care is fairly comparable.  But there is one little you see this little one here.  There's one little note that somebody brought up on the radio show that I didn't I was not aware of.  You are required to activate this quote unlocked phone with one of the four major carriers before you take it home.

Start time: 1443.92
End time: 1473.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think so. You're right. So I understand the motivation now.  It's not that the carriers are saying, hey, Apple, we want that fifty dollars.  It's that they're worried about smuggling or global market cross, cross US border sales.  All right. Yeah, well, I mean, yeah, for the consumer, it's something to pay attention to.  This guy said, hey, I use straight talk.  I want to buy an unlocked iPhone.  I want to use their financing plan, but I have to activate it.  When I asked Apple, they said, oh, yeah, you just activate it and then you deactivate.  You cancel the account. Well, you can use other you can use other.

And with, you know, it's basically a royalty,  an intellectual royalty almost to the carriers.  That's basically saying we're going to maintain our our our relationships with you,  you know, by insisting on this activation clause.

Start time: 1519.12
End time: 1528.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I wonder about.  I mean, traditionally, Apple's had the carriers by the short hairs.  But for some reason, they're really making you activate with one of the four national carriers on this.

End time: 1543.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't buy any argument that things that the carriers make Apple do anything.  Apple says jump and the carriers are like, we're already up in the air.  Do you want us to go higher?  The I think it's I really think it's it's this sort of smuggling sort of thing.  Like, it's interesting. They want to limit to the US market.

Start time: 1572.20
End time: 1617.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I'm going to say is like the the the pricing is pretty aggressive, I think, for the upgrade offer.  Like Apple, if you add up the costs, it's basically the equivalent of buying it up front.  And what I mean by that is Apple is not.  It's like a zero percent loan, basically.  Exactly, exactly.  And and which which is interesting in its own right.  I mean, because if you if you technically calculate the time cost of money, like you're actually getting a better deal by doing the upgrade plan.  But given that, I think that there's no premium in there to justify taking on any additional risk than that's necessary.  And I think to it, I think to Rene's point, it's the first year.  I think it'll be interesting to see one is an issue to see how it actually plays out in the stores.  The last thing the stores need is is people having 30 minute appointments to do stuff.  I mean, they're already a mess as it is.

End time: 1661.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think so, too.  And then and then, too, I'm very interested to see how it goes next year.  You know, is it are people on the upgrade plan going to be able to get one first day still?  And how is that going to go down?  How's it going to be organized?  I think there's a lot of unknowns about this.  But that said, I don't know, doesn't change the fact that it's a very interesting development.  And it's really moving Apple into being two things.  One, there's always more money to be made in finance than anywhere else.  And two, although, like I said, they're not really making much interest here.  But two, it's almost like you're subscribing to the iPhone.  And once you are on this upgrade plan, it's very difficult to see you ever not buying an iPhone.

Transcript:  They'll probably recover a lot of that money.  Absolutely. So the carriers are doing it.  Two hours in the the ordering started 1201 a.m.  Pacific time on September 12th by 2 a.m.  I'm looking at a website called iPhone dash inventory dot blogspot dot com.  They went out and they looked at the store by by two hours in.  The iPhone six plus pretty much out of stock three to four weeks delivery time.  You can get it, get the little one, but everybody's getting the big one.  And and on the few that have delays on the little one, it's the it's the rose.

Start time: 1706.14

Start time: 1710.50
End time: 1719.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I mean, I mentioned it was if the proportion is going to shift much to the plus.  I mean, because people don't look at this.  This was the six was still a much bigger start on the plus by a significant margin.

Start time: 1720.36
End time: 1724.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

End time: 1744.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a popular misconception that big phones were actually popular before the big iPhone.  They weren't especially not North America.  The note had a trivial market share and more people were still buying iPhones  and buying a lot of the bigger phones combined.  And I think with the iPhone six since iPhone six and six plus, that began to shift.  Again, Apple didn't invent the big phone, but they mainstreamed it.  And now people are seeing the big phones aren't a concern.

Start time: 1750.00
End time: 1771.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. But I think that that was I mean, people made this argument a lot that,  you know, oh, Apple should make a big iPhone, blah, blah, blah.  People wanted big iPhones.  It just happened to be in some markets.  People wanted an iPhone more than they wanted a big phone.  And yeah, like I said, like you said, in Asia, it was it was not even not even close.

Transcript:  Look at iPhone sales in China, two hours in on the preorder,  two to three week delay for the iPhone six, eight, three to four week delay for the six plus  sold out in two hours.  That is probably very good news for Apple, which had to, of course, reassure Tim Cook  had to reassure the markets that despite economic woes in China,  there was still a strong market. Right, Ben?  I mean, this is good news for Apple.

Start time: 1794.70
End time: 1862.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, for sure. I mean, I think the certainly the China question is interesting  because Apple is more exposed to China than any other company by, you know,  the tech company by one.  It's where their growth is happening, right?  Right. They're exposed on both sides, on both the upside and the downside.  That said, the the headroom for China, for Apple in China is absolutely massive.  And there's there's just even with these current slowdown, the  the number of people moving into a middle class level of income, which, you know,  and the iPhone is basically the thing to get once you once you can,  is basically more than the population of the United States.  And and the even if there is a slowdown,  there's so much slack in the system to to to take that up  that I think Apple will probably be fine.  It's a certainly it's a valid reason to be concerned.  Absolutely. Because it is Apple's biggest growth market or the growth market.  But that said, I'm I think that Cook's statement,  which was odd for lots of reasons, but I think it was.  He called it Jim McCramer. Yeah.

Their product was and going into a house, giant screen TV.  And the our guide explained to me that each year there is a new consumer product  that is the thing for the kind of aspirational middle class to have.  It was air conditioners one year was big screen TVs.  I think this is culturally really important to understand.  So it's I take it.  It's the iPhone that is the kind of the status symbol  for the upwardly mobile in China.  This year for the last couple of years.

Start time: 1908.62
End time: 2010.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, this gets the absolute price point is making earlier.  Like this is like an iPhone.  You can get an iPhone for six hundred fifty dollars.  You can get the iPhone five and five S now for four hundred fifty dollars.  In China is a little more because there's there's import taxes and things like that.  But the point is you can have the best possible phone,  particularly from a status perspective, for not that much money.  I mean, a Louis Vuitton bag starts at what?  Fifteen hundred dollars more than that.  A Chanel bag is five thousand dollars.  I mean, so the and those are from a status perspective,  those are in the same class.  And so you think about it, the fact that even yes,  an iPhone is much more expensive than the Android phone,  but from an absolute cost basis, it's not that much.  So in a country like China, like of all the things you're going to get first  when you arrive, like the thing to get when you first arrive is a Louis Vuitton wallet.  Like it was a very small little thing.  It'd be like it'd be like one hundred fifty, two hundred bucks or something.  And it is kind of a especially back ten, twelve years ago.  It's kind of a running joke.  Because that was always the first luxury item that anyone ever got.  And and now that's really the iPhone.  And and the thing is, it's not like someone's coming in with an iPhone above it  and the iPhone is going to get tired as a as a brand.  I mean, the thing with like Louis Vuitton kind of got oversold, right?  And like people almost got sick, got sick of it because it was such a big thing to get.  Like and so now moved up.  Oh, you got to get a like Hermes or Chanel or whatever,  even though they're they're significantly more expensive.  What's coming in above the iPhone?  You're not going to replace the iPhone with a cheaper product.  That doesn't that doesn't make any sense.  And so it's kind of had this exclusive hold on the status part of the phone market.  And that's not going anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's also very clearly aiming at a segment of the market  that is the top.  So it's not the one percent, it's the 10 percent.  And Apple doesn't want right.  Apple doesn't want buyers who are price sensitive.  They don't want buyers who are going to.  That's a that's an overgeneralization.  But they they're basically they're offering for the price sensitive buyer  is you can have our phone from two years ago at a discount.  But the one that's the one that's being offered today, the new one  comes at a premium.  And yes, that four hundred dollar absolute  premium might not seem like a lot.  Once you're if you're in the top 10 percent of the Chinese economy,  but for or of the United States economy, for that matter.  But if you are in the remaining 90 percent of the economy,  particularly if you're in the bottom 50 percent of the economy,  then you're going to be thinking very long and hard about those absolute amounts  because those do matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, go ahead.  Well, I just say actually one of the pieces of news I found most interesting  I've never heard yet. I think I'm going to try to cover this week.  But is the the discontinuation of the five see?  Yeah. And I think, you know, much as people want to protest,  I think the five see was a failure.  And the reason it was a failure, though, is very interesting.  And the reason it was a failure is because it looked at first sight  like it was a cheaper iPhone. Right.  And and the difference is when you go buy a five s today,  it looks like a real phone that out upon the table.  You don't know if you just happen to be your two year old phone  or your one year old phone or the one you just when you just bought it.  It's still yes, certainly it's ideal from a status perspective  to have the most current model.  And, you know, I'll get a glorify in the I order one the US  and get shipped over and I'll have it a few weeks for when Taiwan does.  And I can flaunt it on the on the on the subway and go on a stash.  But but you either have an iPhone like I think I just use an Apple tagline,  but either have an iPhone or you don't.  And the thing with the five see is the five see was never really an iPhone  for this specific angle of things, because it was from day one.  Not the flagship iPhone.  And and so I think it's interesting that it was discontinued.  I thought I thought they might keep it and try to really drive down prices  with that model specifically.  But I think they've decided and probably rightly so that this value  of of status is worth more than whatever incremental  new customers we get by having, say, a three hundred dollar phone,  which is interesting.  You can certainly see both arguments for it. It's amazing.

You're right. You either have an iPhone or you don't. Period.  Let's take a break. I do want to talk about what I think was a revolutionary  new product.  And we could talk about this 3D touch, rebranded force touch,  whether it works or not. You guys have played with it.  You can tell me.  And Apple TV, a lot of stuff still to come.  Maybe even we'll squeeze in a Google story or a Twitter story,  if I could find one. I don't know.  Android Pay launched. I don't know. What does it mean?  And why was Microsoft on the stage at the Apple event?  Shades of Bill Gates towering over Steve Jobs.  But first, let's talk about wealth and wealth front.  Many of you, of course, I hope, are saving for your future,  whether it's to buy a house, to retire.  How are you investing your money for the long term?  I'm not talking about your short term trades.  I'm talking about the money you're putting aside.  You don't want to put in a savings account.  You want it to grow.  But do you have the time to manage it?  Are you going to pay an advisor to management?  Traditional advisors charge huge fees.  We're talking one to three percent of the money you have under management,  not to mention additional fees for transactions.  And, you know, it just it starts to add up.  And every one of those things is just eaten away at your savings.  Wealth front is so cool.  It's a new way to do it.  You don't have to worry about it.  Put your investments on autopilot.  It's done programmatically.  It makes wealth front makes it easy and affordable for anyone  to access world class long term investment management using solid principles.  You could start with as little as five hundred dollars right now.  And here's the best part.  One quarter of one percent a year.  That's 25 basis points.  And there are never any commissions.  There are no hidden fees.  We're we're no additional charges for any wealth front services.  It's really an amazing system.  The wealth front team includes some of the smartest thinkers about Wall Street,  including the authors of two seminal books.  I remember reading as a younger man,  Burton Malkiel's amazing random walk down Wall Street.  Charles Ellis is winning the loser games, the losers game.  These are guys who have understand how Wall Street works,  understand the mistakes that normal people make.  And they've built this into the sophisticated software that runs wealth front.  Wealth front is completely transparent.  You will view your accounts, all of them in one place,  whether it's personal, joint or retirement.  And yes, you can have all three.  You'll see every trade they make on your behalf right there in the dashboard.  Or you can use their mobile app.  And they're using sophisticated strategies that are very difficult  for others to do things like tax loss harvesting and direct in this thing  that maximize after tax returns.  They lower your tax bill, increase your returns.  No wonder wealth front has grown 20 times in the past two years or 20 times bigger.  Now, two point six billion dollars in client assets.  That number was two point four in the in the copy I'm reading here.  And now I see on the website is two point six billion.  They're growing fast.  It's incredible. I want you to try it.  Go to wealthfront.com slash twit.  Get your free personalized investment portfolio.  You'll answer some questions about your time frame, your risk tolerance, things like that.

I didn't get to talk during the event, so I have all these ideas  churning in my mind and I thought, who better than Ed Bott from ZDNet,  Renee Ritchie from Iamore.com as Stratecary's brilliant analyst, Ben Thompson,  all talking about what's going on.  And I think whether you're an iPhone, whether you're an iOS,  iPhone, Android user, doesn't it's not the point.  This is the technology industry, one of the real movers in the industry.  And this isn't, you know, I look at these events and I think,  God, I wish they wouldn't say all these superlatives, the best ever.  It sounds too much like a marketing event.  And so I think it's really important for us as analysts to kind of burn off  the marketing hype, because that's just bogus and really try to understand  what Apple's doing. And I think we've got we couldn't have a better team  for doing that. I thought we'd have a little battle between Ed Bott  and Ben Thompson right now.  And Renee, you you know Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, so if you want to just  throw in, you can tag and get in there.

Transcript:  probably speaking as they thought that the original iPad  was going to be kind of a netbook killer.  Interesting. And and it turned out to be more of a and, you know,  and the joke at the time was that people said the iPad is just going to be a big  iPhone that doesn't make phone calls.  And it turned out that was completely true.  And it was a good thing for Apple.  And it was a good thing for people who bought the original iPads  because that's exactly what they wanted.  So now they're sort of, you know, with the volume of iPad shipments going down,  I think they're sort of looking at the at the the overall brand  and the overall value proposition of iPad and saying there are a lot of people  who use this as a laptop replacement.  I spend a lot of time, Ben, you spend a lot of time in airports.  I spend a lot of time in airports.  Renee, you do, too.  We see a lot of people with iPads.  Yes. Talk to these weird, ugly keyboard cases.  They're and they're trying to they're trying to do things with them.  And so I think Apple is just responding to the market here.  And now to me, the disconnect with the iPad Pro is not that it's a surface clone,  but that they're trying to appeal in terms of size and screen  quality to creative professionals.  But creative professionals want full Photoshop.  They want full Final Cut Pro.  They want full Premiere.  They and and the the limited capabilities of the apps in the iPad Pro  are going to be the limiting factor for it in terms of acceptance,  at least in the first year, I think.

Transcript:  My background is in design.  I worked for 10 years in design using Wacom tablets almost every day.  And I I grew up in Photoshop.  Photoshop is still muscle memory for me.  And I actually like the way that the iPad Pro worked with the pencil a lot.  It is absolutely the best stylus I have ever used,  way better than any Wacom tablet I've ever used, because the response rate is great.  They're actually doing predictive algorithms that you can watch sometimes self correct.  They stay up with you. You can scribble. You can crosshatch.  The tilting is fantastic.  I tried procreate, which Photoshop is never really known who it's for.  Like previously it was for photographers.  Now they're trying to make it for UI designers.  And I've always used things like Factual Design Painter and Illustrator  and just different tools for the right job.  And that's what the iPad kind of felt like when I looked at the different 3D apps  and the different drawing apps.  It really looked like you could purpose build something that was really good.  Now, I am a Final Cut Pro user.  And I don't know how it's going to translate to iMovie,  even with three simultaneous 4K streams or whatever,  because I don't know how I'll be able to cut and do things as precisely as I want.  But when I when I get one, I'll give it a try.  But I think for a lot of people, I've I've wanted to buy a surface just to sit there  and draw with it because Apple didn't offer that functionality.  But there was nothing else about it that I was really going to use.  Now I have that built into an iPad.  And conversely, there are exactly those people that Ed's been talking about  who are using keyboards.  And Apple, because of the MacBook, has gotten really good at making super low  profile keyboards.  And I tried it out for a while and it feels like using a MacBook keyboard.  So if that's who you want, if you are that productivity person or the creative person,  they've sort of got the tool that fits whatever you want to do.

Transcript:  Well, I just you got the keyboard.  I thought the keyboard was terrible.  Do you like the MacBook keyboard?  I thought it was much worse than the MacBook keyboard, which was I only used it in briefly.  But I definitely think the Surface keyboard is better.  And for the record, the way it it plugs into the side of the iPad and does power  back forth, I mean, that's that's what the Surface did.  Absolutely. That's Pogo pins Apple style.  Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, so that said, I do have a few points I always make.  First of all, I do reject that it's a it's a surface ripoff because the Surface is a  PC with a touch layer that you can use.  And the iPad is a touch OS from the ground up that you can put a keyboard on and type on.  And if that sounds trivial, I think that.  It's trivial in a very fundamental way in that we talked before about the consumer  market being different than the business market.  The consumer market is driven much more by the user experience and and the user  experience has to be optimal, I think, for you to be successful.  And by extension, I think this sort of hybrid mashup approach is is not the optimal one.  I know some people like the Surface.  I'm not a fan. The reason I'm not a fan is because I think Windows is is a PC  operating system. And I think a PC mouse and keyboard operating system, the form  factor of a laptop is just better. It's more flexible.  You can do more with it.  How many people do you see using a Surface without the keyboard?  Not barely anyone.  And I think that's that's a shortcoming.  On the other hand, Leo, I think you're exactly right.  I think there's these two accessories signify two different potential futures and  markets for the iPad.  The keyboard is the iPad as a PC replacement.  And yet, in some respects, it's better, it's simpler, it's easier, the App Store and  the reticent sort of stuff.  In other respects, it's worse.  I think the form factor is worse.  And I think that the power and capability is worse.  On the other hand, this pencil thing, you nail you nailed on the head.  It's it's really good.  It's as opposed to the Surface or a Wacom tablet or any other thing that uses a  digitizer. You don't have that that big gap between where you're drawing and the  actual screen where you get this weird parallax effect when actually using it.  And the responsive rate is incredible.  Like it's by far the best that I've ever seen.  It looks incredible in the video.  I mean, oh, I mean, it's by far the killer feature, the killer feature of the thing.  And to me, what's so exciting about this is I I don't use my iPad for anything but  for one app. And that's paper by 53, which I create illustrations for my blog.

Transcript:  Yeah, no, exactly. Exactly.  And I and basically I buy an iPad because there's one thing I can do in the iPad  353 that I can't do on a PC.  I can't do on a phone like and that is what the pencil, I hope, leads to is is  it is more of these sorts of applications that can only be done on an iPad or  alternatively, maybe on a walk on a two thousand dollar Wacom tablet connected to  a PC, which is arguably going to be an inferior experience anyway.  And I'm much more excited about the pencil future than I am about the keyboard future.

Transcript:  My initial reaction, I'm watching this  announcement, first of all, shocked that Apple led with it.  I mean, there was the watch stuff, but then really the big first piece of hardware.  And it shocked me when Tim Cook said, all right, let's talk iPad.  It was like, really?  But looking at it, I felt like we were seeing a paradigm shift in computing.  I think this is really important.  This is the move from desktop keyboard and mouse computing to touch first  computing. And I think it and you make an excellent point in your article, by the way.  In fact, the title tells us, says it all from products to platforms.  The iPad is no longer a product.  This is if Apple does this right, a new platform.  But you say, and I think you're exactly  right, that Apple's got to adjust its app store policies if it's going to make this  work, it's going to come down to software.  Now, I didn't get to play with it, but I'm  really gathering from those who did from you guys and others that you look at  something like iMovie or GarageBand, Apple apps.  And it is not just any more than the iPad was a blown up iPhone.  It's not just a bigger iPad.  Something happens when you get to that size,  that it is a natural UI for certain categories of applications.  It's a much more natural way to work.  And if those if appropriate applications are developed for this platform,  it will really have us rethinking the way we use computers before the show.  And we probably should make a special out of it.  We had Eddie on who who is the heavy, right?  The developer of something called You Make Phil Schiller showed it on the screen  during the keynote at You Make dot X, Y, Z.  This app isn't out yet.  He won't say, but apparently they've been  working with Apple because this is very much what Apple wants for the iPad Pro.  They're going to release it. It's terrific.  Yeah, they're going to release. I was playing with it.  They're going to it's a 3D design program  that you use the pencil and your fingers to design stuff.  They actually actually showed me a car  that's already been designed with this as beta testers.  So.  To me, I feel like the iPad Pro is a is a new is is is nothing less than a new form

Transcript:  of computing is that going to be the interface is the interface is different, too.  It's not just a blown up iPad Air either because of size classes.  Now you can actually expose more interface  on the iPad Pro than you can even on the iPad Air.  So you can have extra palettes. It's almost like the 5K iMac.  You can have extra stuff there so you don't lose the usable area.  You just gain utility. And that was super impressive.

Transcript:  It underscores to me the mistake that was  Windows 8 and is continuing with Windows 10.  Microsoft misunderstood what people wanted to use Windows for.  That's a desktop OS.  Trying to shoehorn touch into that is not the solution.  And it's the same reason why OS 10 shouldn't have touch stuck in there.  Apple now has two separate platforms.  And I think this is the this is a maturation  of iOS that was to me, anyway, somewhat unexpected and very exciting.

Start time: 3265.22
End time: 3306.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The super interesting thing here, Leo, is the way that Apple is doing this,  they have essentially like you can you can quibble about how much OS 10 is like  iOS, but on the other products you have backboard and frontboard.  And then you have that on the iPhone with springboard.  You have that on the watch with carousel.  You have on the Apple TV with pineboard and headboard.  And now they're starting to differentiate the iPad.  I still want them to go full out and make a completely unique version of springboard  just for the iPad.  But they're doing things like like split screen and slide over.  And they're letting it be its own thing.  And if you logically extend that towards the future, I think you're absolutely right.  As much as the MacBook is sort of closer to an iPad than a Mac,  this is sort of closer to what you traditionally use as a computer than an iPad before.  And I think there is a very interesting space for them to explore there.

You use the pencil.  You're intimately connected with the stuff that you're doing.  But then you you make an interesting point.  I mean, really, whether this happens or not depends a lot on what Apple does,  especially with the App Store.

But I think your point is well made that especially for these these creative sort  of applications and the whole thing that is frustrating with the whole creation  versus consumption debate is that creation was so often like presumed to be  just text input, whereas the iPad, what's exciting about the iPad is  arguably it's a superior input device for everything.  But text input, right, because of its adaptability to any sort of, you know,  it's not just the touch aspect, but also it becomes the appropriate interface,  you know, to whatever it should be.

Transcript:  It's also I mean, we we we must not forget, first of all, the size and weight  of this device is intimidating for a lot of people.  You're not going to put this in your purse.  And the cost is intimidating for a lot of people.  And yes, it's less than a BMW.  Well, it's less than a workstation, too.  I mean, you're selling people who use workstations.  This is not. Yeah, but it's not a workstation.  It has very it has some very nice graphics in it,  but it only has four gigabytes of RAM in it.  And as my colleague Jason Perlow at ZDNet wrote a very interesting article  published, I think today or last night,  you know, saying basically laying out the case for this.  And it really requires a lot of cloud power on the back end for a device like this to do its work.  I think there was a there was a demo that they showed.  Well, because there's because a lot of the things that they're showing off  demand a whole bunch of data to be processed.  And there are four gigabytes of RAM is not is not a lot of workspace.  Most creative professionals are working on machines that have 32 gigabytes of RAM on it, not four.  Yeah, because they're they're using heavyweight operating systems that do.  It's not just the operating system.  It's the size of the file.  It's the size of the it's the it's the size of the the transforms that you're doing.  It you know, this is this is a very interesting device, but it's very early.  And in some ways, it's a piece of glass  with with very nice responsive capabilities that needs some serious processing power  on the back end to to really do to do its magic.

And he said, I wasn't sure I was going to be able to make it because I've got  eight patients that I'm monitoring right now.  He had what was he using?  Was he using an iPad or was he using a laptop?  He was using a laptop, but I could see him doing this on an iPad Pro.  He's monitoring eight different patients at different hospitals.  I guess this stuff, radiology, this has happened, has been outsourced now to groups  that drinking while he's monitoring eight patients, I said, aren't you worried?  He said, no, it's only one guy now and I think he's going to be OK.  I don't know exactly how this works or what he's doing, but he's got these graphs  and these things and he's looking at them while he's having a beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think there's there's lots of good and  points that are kind of not necessarily so one.  Fix this up.  Fix this up and rewrite us, edit us here.  And it is exactly right that it is expensive.  And the iPad is is at a very kind of fundamental perspective, more expensive  than the phone, the five put this way, the five hundred dollar iPad is more expensive  than the six hundred fifty dollar iPhone.  And the reason it's more expensive is because the the iPad is an and purchase.  You're going to buy a phone regardless.  Right. So you had that moto in your hand.  Right. It was four hundred dollars.  So in that world, the iPhone is not a six hundred fifty dollar phone.  It's a two hundred and fifty dollar phone.  I mean, because you're paying a two hundred  dollars premium to have an iPhone in the case of an iPad, you don't necessarily  need to have a tablet.  So every dollar that the iPad costs is a dollar that you're electing to pay.  And in that respect, the the iPad is always a harder sale than than the iPhone is.  That said, I would disagree with you,  that the cloud capability is an issue.  I think that's the way computing is going.  And quite frankly, Microsoft is a big leader in this respect where  that makes sense, where you have the local processing handles, the local UI,  and you have that sort of interface.  That was kind of what the old net, not netbooks, the real netbooks,  the net gear like that they were doing, where you would have the pure terminal  on everything. Yeah.  Thin clients. Yeah. That's what they got wrong.  They didn't have enough.  The user experience wasn't good enough because they they they put too much  in the cloud.  But I think a hybrid approach, I don't I'm not I'm not objecting to that.  What I think the the key thing, though,  that did hit on with this being expensive is that the iPad is and even more so today  than it ever was, especially with iPhones getting bigger and more capable.  It is a niche device and it will always be a niche device.  And given that, I don't object to Apple releasing a more expensive,  more souped up, more powerful version, because that's exactly how you should  respond to being in a niche market.  There's there's two kind of big strategies.  One is a general purpose market.  Why is better? You want to reach as many people as possible, make it up in volume.  The other one is the niche market where your goal is not volume.  Your goal is maximizing revenue per consumer or per buyer.  And the iPad Pro does that if you're someone who actually uses an iPad for  things that can only be done on an iPad and iPad Pro is better.  It's more expensive, all of which is a good thing for everyone involved.  And the the the issue, the worry, the concern for the iPad,  from my perspective, is that the app makers for iPad are also going to be niche  providers and a niche provider, like I said, needs to maximize the revenue  per consumer. And that's the exact thing that the app store does not currently allow.  The app store is all about being a volume play.  It's not about maximizing revenue per your consumer over time.  And that's the big concern is Apple doesn't have the business model, I think,  to support the sort of apps that will make the iPad Pro a super powerful and  compelling device and to reach the potential that you wait out.

Transcript:  Right. I mean, and the technology is pushing them in the wrong direction.  Like Apple really wants universal apps because that's it looks like an iPhone app.  That's also what's filling up the slide over and what's filling up the very slim  version of Sideview.  And when you make that you make a universal app charge 50 bucks on the iPad Pro.  But like, do you artificially restrict it against the iPhone because people aren't  going to pay fifty dollars for an iPhone app?  They set up an incredible not just Apple.  We've decided we want to pay for things.  Apple's decided they don't want to they don't want to increase the value of the  platform. And developers have often raced to the bottom.  And we've got the sum of all these compromises right now.  And I agree 100 percent with Ben.

Start time: 3891.82
End time: 4197.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the thing is, is this I I don't think any of you made that.  But I'm going to pretend like you did so I can push back against it.  I pushed back against the contention that that a lot of people a lot of people do  state and particularly in the Apple developer community that this is is  inevitable because we're in a world and I've contributed this.  I I wrote an article a couple of years ago explaining how software by definition has  zero marginal value, which means undifferentiated software will eventually  cost zero dollars because especially in a very competitive environment like like  the like the iPhone.  And that's true.  But the key word there is undifferentiated.  Like if the case if it was always the case that highly reputable content with zero  marginal cost could not be charged for that, I'd be screwed.  Like I sell text on the Internet.  It's like the most competitive environment in the history of humanity.  But it works because some number of people find it to be worth worth paying for.  And the challenge for an app maker is that there is no way to to articulate your value.  And because if you go in the app store and there's an app that costs one hundred  dollars or five hundred dollars or five thousand dollars, by the way, the apps are  women, it's nine ninety nine.  You can't demonstrate your value to consumers absent them buying it and like  contacting you separately for a refund and then doing this weird.  It's a total mess.  And this is why I think things like trials are actually super important because  they're a way for differentiated apps to demonstrate their differentiation and to  drive purchase.  And so that fixes the revenue per consumer angle, because now you can get more per  customer. And this is way more important than Apple taking 30 percent or things  like that that people focus on the 30 percent of a dollar isn't very important.  Like the big issue is that top line number.  How much can you drive?  And that's why and and this is something that Microsoft understands.  And this is I made the joke that the iPad would arguably be better if Microsoft  owned it because Microsoft is a platform company.  They get that. They understand what developers need.  They understand how to create the environment for developers to make money.  And Microsoft, one of the key things every time you go to a Microsoft developer  conference, like they have a huge one every year, the sales conference or  whatever, they always show the slide that shows the value of the total Windows  ecosystem and how much Microsoft harvests.  And they brag about the fact that, oh, of the total value of the Windows ecosystem,  we keep 24 percent or 27 percent of it.  And their point there is that we're invested in making a big pie for everyone.  We're not out to get all the money for ourselves.  And Apple does the exact opposite.  Apple is this pure, like hardcore, like we're going to commoditize our  compliments and means all the parts that we don't make money on.  We're going to make them as cheap as possible.  And in the short run, that works and it works on the iPhone and it works on the  iPhone because the iPhone, the most important apps are social networks or  communication networks or things that where we keep in touch and those games  have to be free.  Well, this is the games.  The games point is interesting because games started out as it was an OK market.  What what set fire to the games market was was Apple one enabling in-app purchases  and then two enabling in-app purchase for consumables, which is where you can buy  the same thing over and over again.  And and that where you can buy, you know, 10 points or whatever.  And that is that is what made to the games explosion on the iPhone, because it's  not enough to just have all this amazing graphics capability.  You also have to have a reason to invest the money to take advantage of that  capability, which means you have to have a business model that supports it.  The iPhone and iOS does have that business model for games, and it has a thriving  games ecosystem as a result.  The concern here is for other apps, for productivity type apps, especially ones  that don't have a service component.  If you if you have a service component, you can charge a subscription.  That kind of makes sense.  But if you have a self-contained app, there's no way one to demonstrate your  values to get more money.  And two, because there's no upgrade pricing and no way to communicate with  your current customers, you can't extract more money or your same customers over  time. It's always easier to get money from the same customers than it is to find  new ones. And that capability is just not simple at all on on on iOS.  And Apple could unlock this, but I just feel there's such a product focused  company and that's to their benefit.  That's why they have a platform in the first place.  Again, in the consumer market, you win with a great product.  You get a great product and then you have the right to be a platform.  That's Microsoft problem.  They don't they don't have the product to become a platform in the consumer  market. They don't have the enterprise leverage anymore that they used to have.  And so Microsoft sitting on the side, this great platform company that doesn't  have a platform. And Apple's on this side, this great product company that has  a platform they don't seem to know what to do with.  And it's frustrating because it's not like these developers would go to another  tablet. There is no other tablet with with customers with a demonstrated  willingness to pay. Apple owns all those customers and there's all this class of  absolutely. You're so excited about the future of computing.  So am I. But I'm also worried it's going to never happen because the business  conditions were never in place.

Transcript:  So I really like to see is from what I'd like to see from Apple as a vice  president of App Store, that sort of analogous to what Angela Aaron's is for  retail and someone whose only job it is to wake up in the morning and decide how  to make the App Store a tremendous product, as good a product as an iPhone or  an iPad. Because right now App Store is bifurcated or even trifurcated.  You have Craig Federighi's org who makes all the frameworks.  You have Phil Schiller's org, which does app review and evangelism.  You have Eddie Q's org, which does store management and editorial and runs the  actual store. And without one person sort of making that a fantastic problem,  sorry, a fantastic product, you just have again the same thing where where  people aren't always on the same page and it shows like Ben's favorite app  paper. They stop charging money to make money off the pencil.  Now Apple is making a pencil. And what are they going to make money on?  I love that app, too. And I want that app to be here.  I want to give developers money. I just want better ways of doing it.

Transcript:  I think in a way, both Apple and Microsoft are converging on the same point from  different directions. Microsoft's historical strength has been  understanding price sensitive, efficiency sensitive business customers.  Apple's historical strength has been understanding non price sensitive, very  quality sensitive consumers.  So they're both trying to to aim towards a point.  Microsoft trying to get some traction in the consumer space, which they're  getting maybe a little better at, but not not to.  And Apple trying, but only halfheartedly, I think, to get into the business and  enterprise space because they realize that the margins there and the the cell  cycles are so long and so difficult that they almost they almost, I think, want to  concede that market and say, you know, we're going to be happy playing in the  high end here where the margins are high and we'll leave the enterprise to  Microsoft. It's almost like it creates a world where sometime in the future,  Microsoft and Apple merge just to, you know, to sort of create the Venn diagram  that has those customers working properly.

Transcript:  I feel like Microsoft solved this, though, somewhat with Office 365.  This is a really good example of a way they've monetized what was a huge cash cow,  their number two product, by charging a subscription fee and you get it free if  you've paid that subscription free on the iPad.  And then, in fact, they have a very nice touch first version of the Office apps  works quite well on the iPad.  I think will probably work even better on the iPad Pro.  But they get their money from that monthly subscription fee.  But it's almost unique.

Ten bucks a month. I get a Photoshop and Lightroom.  That's a great deal for me.  And I imagine I will get a free Lightroom app, maybe even a free touch first  Photoshop app on the iPad Pro as a result.

End time: 4561.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The difference, though, and I think as driving at that is a big reason why Adobe  and Microsoft are able to pull this off is because they already have the  established mind share.  And like exactly Adobe, Adobe said you're switching to Creative Cloud, whether you  like it or not. And basically everyone is so locked into Photoshop that they had no  choice but to go against it.  And there was a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth and things like that.  And if you're a new developer, particularly on the iPad, the whole the whole lure of  the iPad, Leo, is that you can make an app on the iPad that you can't make  anywhere else. That's the potential.  Right. And why like it's harder to to explain to consumers why you should pay a  subscription fee for for an app that's limited to one device like the whole.  So there's no desktop market for that kind of thing.  You just use it on the web, use it on your thing, all that sort of stuff.  And about cloud services, can you charge for that?  Well, I mean, yes, you can.  So two things. One, yes, you can.  And but two, a lot of apps don't necessarily have a natural service component like  paper, for example, they are building a cloud service and they're building a cloud  service as far as I can tell, primarily to monetize, not because the app actually  needs a cloud service.  But but but the thing that frustrates me about this argument is that it's not that  you guys are wrong. There are ways to monetize.  The issue is, I would like to stop with the let's figure out how to overcome Apple's  limitations and let's just let's dwell on Apple's limitations and stop making  excuses for them and finding ways around them.  The fact of the matter is there's no reason for Apple to not support stuff like  this beyond as far as I can tell.  And this is what was so ironic about Microsoft and Adobe being on stage.  The fact that Apple never again wants to be held captive to an app developer.  You go back to 1997 Macworld, Boston and and Steve Jobs and to stand on stage and  talk about Microsoft investing in the company and that they'll keep office on  there. The fact of the matter is, is at that point in time, office mattered more  to Mac users than the Mac did.  And so did Photoshop.  And and Jobs never forgot that.  I mean, you the job is right about the flash stuff.  Everything that happened since then was was Apple's attempt.

And I'm convinced I wrote this several years ago, you know, that Apple, so much of  Apple's behavior on developers is driven by this, you know, never again.  And you think about it like with paper, they've done it without actually having a  business model. But I I care more about paper than I do the iPad.  And that's why I buy an iPad.  And so Apple's hesitancy is is like you can you can at least theoretically  understand it. But the problem is there, you know, what's this going to spite their  nose to cut off their nose to spite their face?

And you can look back at the original app store and you see code.  They had accidental pop ups that came up that showed you that upgrading and other  things had been built into or at least tested as part of the system.  And they've tested a whole bunch of stuff over the years.  They just haven't flipped. I don't want to say it's not as easy as flipping a switch,  but they haven't gone in that direction.

There are people at Apple who believe for right or wrong that there is absolute user  experience advantages to keeping things incredibly simple.  So you never have to worry about upgrading.  Never have to worry about trials.  What if you just buy the app and you and all you need is for is a minute and then  you've taken all the value out of it?  Or what if you buy it and you create data in that app and then that app goes away  and your data is still in it?  How does the person you know, because you didn't want to decide to buy it.  So what happens to your day?  They're all like there are a little bit of questions that go around this and their  answer them so far has been to keep it dead, stupid, simple.  And that might not scale going forward.  And they need to have someone who, again, whose job it is to fight for that  discussion.

But first, a word from Braintree.  Are you a mobile developer?  You know that if you're taking payments, payments is one of the most important things  to do.  One of the easiest things to do wrong.  I mean, we're not just talking about security.  We're talking about your user experience.  70 percent of mobile carts are abandoned before the buy button.  And that's a lot of money you're leaving on the table.  So check out what companies like Uber do.  I mean, don't they have it down?  Don't they make it easy to take that Uber?  You don't even have to think about it.  You get out of the car, you're done.  There's no button to push.  Uber uses Braintree.  So does Lyft.  So does Airbnb.  So does Hotel Tonight.  So does GitHub.  So does StubHub.  I love Braintree.  Braintree is making it easier and easier for mobile app developers to do one of the most  important things.  Get paid without having to suffer through the coding of this.  Ten lines of code.  They make the payment experience seamless.  And something like Uber is literally, it feels magical.  And now you can add that experience to your app too.  And by the way, take every kind of payment.  I mean, not just Apple Pay, but PayPal credit cards, Bitcoin, Venmo, and Braintree has great  support. In fact, if you don't have the time to do the integration, they can do it for you.  They've payouts are fast.  It's a secure, I mean, really secure platform.  That's important to your customers.  They're ready to grow your company from your first dollar to your billionth dollar.  They've done it before they could do it for you.  Many a unicorn uses Braintree.  Braintree, a full stack payment solution, waiting for you right now at BraintreePayments.com  slash Twitch. Show the boss.  Show the product manager.  If you're the product manager, show your engineers.  I think you'll reach agreement very quickly.  This is the way to do it.  I used to I just did a rental with Silvercar.  Braintree made it so easy.  It's a I mean, it just changes your life.  It's so great.  BraintreePayments.com slash twit.  And by the way, if you sign up and you use that URL, BraintreePayments.com slash twit,  we're going to get you your first fifty thousand dollars in transactions.  One hundred percent fee free.

I was just I'm really excited by the iPad Pro, but you've now kind of depressed me.  It sounds like this is going to be kind of an intractable problem.  Here you have a platform that could revolutionize computing and you have a company  that has kind of a built in business model that's antithetical to it.  Is there a solution, Ben?

Transcript:  I mean, the thing to remember is when Apple showed iOS 8 last year, like everyone was  like overjoyed because finally they're opening up, right?  They're allowing more internet communication, like all sorts of new capabilities,  more access to the system.  How did that work out?  Well, the problem is they didn't have the business model to match.  They haven't opened up the business model.  The good news is that one, it shows that it shows that Apple can fundamentally change  their their approach because they did from an API and engineering perspective.  Two, we've seen, at least in the history of the App Store with the in-app purchase  stuff, that we have seen the way that a change in policy can can totally give birth to a  new segment.  And we just need to put those two things together to have these new business models for  for apps.  And it's not just the trials of all those.  I mean, Apple, like if you want to do the subscription stuff on Apple's like institutional  support, if you want to sell like on a per-seat basis, also very poor.  The reality is, is like just the unless you have an internal enterprise App Store, it's  actually very hard to sell to multiple consumers.  You want to sell to a school, for example.  And and so I think the point about having someone focused on this on a holistic level  is a really good and important one.  There's no one on Apple's executive team that is focused on the app.  And then two, I mean, the App Store policy is in one of the it's in Phil Schiller's  org, which is one of the more there's been less new blood than in some of the other orgs,  particularly in engineering.  And I think there's probably more of the old school Apple mindset of we're going to control  it. We're going to control everything.  We're not going to hold houses by anyone.  We're going to make it super simple for consumers.  And that's it.  And I think that's the key to the App Store.  Super simple for consumers.  And that's it.  And I think that I'm not so I wonder if there needs to be more of a change.  Right.  Kind of as a new product.  I think it's like I don't think it's going to be impossible forever.  Exactly. I mean, I think we need the credit Craig Federighi of App Store policy.

It was developer relations were very, very important to Apple.  It's really telling that there's nobody at the top level of the executive team that's  even thinking about that.

Start time: 5055.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the difference is there's so many the App Store is doing great from a top line  perspective. The revenue numbers are huge.  There's no incentive to do that.  It was and there's no there's no warning signs, no red flags from executive.  Well, they are coming in.  But the problem is almost all that money is from is coming from, you know, games and also  subscription services like Netflix and stuff like that.  And and so if you're Tim Cook and you you have 40 gazillion things on your plate and all  you see from the App Store is that it keeps going up and to the right.  Like you're there's no incentive.  How is this going to ever break through?  Right. To me, the big the big signifier of the App Store is iPad revenue, which I think  there is just no reason to buy an iPad.  I think that's because there aren't enough of the compelling apps that make it a must  buy. But we're getting into kind of a very convoluted chain of cause and effect.  That's I will admit, hard to prove.  And I might be wrong about this.  I don't think I am, obviously, but I can appreciate why this hasn't broken through to  the higher levels of Apple.

Transcript:  Hey, things change.  But but here, let me just.  So one of the things was Apple needs a czar for the App Store.  Well, no, they need a business model for the App Store that expands beyond what it is.  And this is but this is and Ben, you were there during this time period.  This is Microsoft's unwillingness to cannibalize its own Windows business to build the  future.  Eventually wound up costing it.  And this is the same dilemma that Apple finds itself in 180 degrees the opposite  direction, their unwillingness to cannibalize their highly successful consumer App  Store business in order to make it palatable to businesses and enterprises.  It's the same exact thing.  No matter how much you talk about the willingness to be able to disrupt your own business to  see the future, it's it the you may be intellectually willing to make that happen.  But when you have to deal with quarterly results that where every product line that  you're selling is bringing in multiple billions of dollars or tens of billions of  dollars per quarter, you don't cannibalize that.  And that's what you don't need a czar.  You need a you need an executioner who's going to come in there.  And and and basically say this business has to change because in three years the spigot  is going to stop flowing.

But more or less Craig Federici is running across or like across the product line.  Johnny Ive is running across the product line and there's more Angela Aarons is now  online and in store retail.  They combine those two things that hasn't happened with App Store.  You still have app. I think store managers like people whose job it is to sell stuff  from the store. I think they would love a lot of the things that we're all talking  about. But people who are not developer relations because developer relations and  evangelism and review are separate organizations all under Phil Schiller, but  separate. There are there are the ability to go across those orgs and make things  happen. I think the czar is the guy, you know, I don't know if he's an executioner  per se, but I think the czar is the guy who goes in and makes all that happen.  The VP who does have that cross the cross company power to enact positive change.

Transcript:  Let's talk. I think it does make a really interesting point, though, that all the  app store policies are very well tuned for a widespread consumer market and they're  well tuned for the iPhone, frankly.  The sort of apps that succeed on the iPhone are are well supported by the current app  store. And what and I talked about before the distinction between a niche business  model where you're maximizing revenue per customer and a scale business model where  you're maximizing the number of customers.  It's very hard to to support both or to kind of wrap your head around both.  And what is the exact thing we're talking about is even the free to play games.  That's still a scale model, because the whole way they work is you get the games  as many people as possible and you get like one percent of them to give you a ton  of money. That's like a casino money from.  Yeah, exactly. And so so yes.  And the iPhone is a scale play.  You got to remember, the iPhone is like 60 percent of Apple's revenue and profits.  It's just a huge part of the company.  And and that more than anything is is the thing with with the iPad.  I mean, it is it is a niche product and it's going to always be a niche product from  Apple's perspective.  And all the change we're making are primarily to benefit or proposing are primarily to  benefit the iPad. And that's I guess that that's a reason to be to be concerned and  frustrated and to appreciate why it doesn't seem they think it's a problem, even  though like these things just seem like such low hanging fruit.

Looks pretty clear that they held on to it for at least six months, if not longer,  waiting, hoping to make deals with networks to provide it and turn it into an over the  top set top box. They weren't able to make those deals.  They finally did release it.  What is Apple?  Renee, give us the lowdown on Apple TV.  This was a hobby for Apple.  It's still a hobby, as far as I can tell.  Is this important to Apple's overall plans?

Start time: 5414.36
End time: 5487.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's important in that traditionally the Apple TV, like the Apple Watch, enhances the  overall Apple ecosystem.  So if you have an iPhone and an Apple watch, an iPhone and an Apple TV, you get greater  value than just having the iPhone by itself.  The Apple TV and the Apple Watch aren't really devices unto themselves yet.  Maybe the Apple TV will get there.  But you're getting a really small.  Apple TV was originally this really small version of OS 10 with a big hard drive and  it didn't really go anywhere. And you had to sync over all your content.  And then with the second Apple TV, it became an iOS device that just streamed everything.  And they've been building on that.  So now you have a box that's based on iOS 9 as an Apple A8 processor.  It runs Metal, which is Apple's version of OpenGL or DirectX.  And it runs apps now.  You have an app store and those apps are different binaries than they are for the phone  or the iPad. But you can sell them on the app store in bundles.  So you can be playing your game.  You get home, your game just keeps playing on your television.  And there's going to be apps for Netflix that can do more than just what the Json  frameworks allowed them to do in the original Apple TVs.  They'll be able to be full on apps and offer a ton more features.  And you have the natural language interface with Siri, which does a sequential  inference thing. But they've really tuned it well for the television.

So when they get it, they just hash it.  And then they wait till many people access it in the app to make sure, one,  that it really is public and is and it's popular.  And then they start servicing that.  So you get a sort of an absolutely assured public information.  But the most the most popular version of that public information as well.

A lovely device and I can imagine it  being successful in some living rooms, it feels like an accessory to me  in the same way that Apple Watch feels like an accessory.  You have to be invested in one of the major high  cost, high value components of the Apple ecosystem, either a MacBook or an iPad  or maybe one of the high priced iPhones.  And then you start to see the value of the watch and the TV.

But I think the bigger issue, which I thought you were going to say, Adam,  is the usage for younger generations.  They're primarily watching these services on iPhones or on iPads  or on their computer.  The actual usage of the there's going to be a bifurcation  between the viewing of TV content and the uses of the TV set.  And the the amount of time spent watching TV has made remains super consistent for ages.  It's actually it's a huge deal that decreased by a couple of minutes over like this last year,  which is like the first time it's ever decreased at all.  But even then, it's still been very, very much.  And if you include screen time, it's probably going up.

Here's what's on my phone.  Look at my phone. Here's what's on my laptop.  Look at my laptop. It's not.  I mean, the idea of a big screen in a living room is, first of all,  the idea that you have a living room is alien to a younger generation.  And the idea that you then have content that's coming exclusively  to that big screen and that everyone sees at the same time is also alien.

And I wonder because continuity and extensibility and all these things  are playing huge into Apple's current plans.  You're playing a game on your iPhone. You come home.  No one else is using the TV.  You're just playing it on the Apple TV. It's a continuous experience.  We used to complain that, oh, I have Angry Birds on one device.  I can't even pick up my iPad and play it.  And you're going to be able to pick up on one device, play on another.  So I think the lines are going to blur.  And to the previous point, I'm going to keep saying this, Leo.  Amazon Prime still isn't in Canada.  It doesn't matter to me if it's on the box or not.  I don't know how many channels you get.

And that that's going to be the case for the foreseeable future.  And so, yes, the it it's kind of a similar thing to the iPad thing.  You can have the technology in place, but if you don't make the deal  in this model in place, then it doesn't matter.  And so I think for some people, like if you're a Yankees fan  living, not living in New York, like that MLB app and Apple TV looks  freaking fantastic, but you're you're you're that's not everyone.  I think it is going to be more of a niche product.  And it's and a big part of it is the business part has to come through.  And I think people are like people in tech have been predicting the end of cable  and linear TV for like going on like 40 years now.  That's before cable even existed, which shows how in-depth this sort of argument  is. And yes, it is fracturing.  And the reason it's fracturing is because the jobs we ask TV to do  are getting narrower and narrower.  But that doesn't mean that tomorrow next year we're going to be watching  NFL football games with our NFL app on Apple TV because the economics  just aren't there until they're there.  It's going to be a niche device.  Weaving aside the fact that I'm not sure how much young people  are even using big TVs anyway.

Transcript:  The issue the issue is that the  the differentiation in TV is driven by the content.  It's not driven by by the device.  And this is why for why the App Store is potentially the most interesting part  of the of the Apple TV is because the App Store,  if that becomes a differentiator, that gives Apple more control  and more leverage with the content providers.  Right now, the content providers are the ones that have all the leverage.  And it's the same thing in music. I'd add as well.  Like in music, it's the labels that have all the leverage,  which is why from a pricing and content perspective,  Apple music isn't differentiated.  You can look at it compared to iTunes.  What made iTunes the juggernaut that it was, was piracy.  And what I mean by that is the labels were so scared of piracy,  they were willing to do a deal with Apple.  Today, streaming kill piracy, which means the labels are,  in some respects, stronger than ever been.  So Apple gets no special favors.  And if you have the same thing in in video,  where if the content provides a differentiation,  that means there's not going to be a dominant player.  Like the in a stack, in whatever industry might be,  there's one layer that matters.  And that layer and everything else, it's going to be commoditized.  Is Chromecast the solution?

Start time: 6344.06
End time: 6356.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

You've got all those things in there.  But ordinary people, just their eyes glaze over  and they try to imagine the idea that there's something  they're watching on their phone or a tablet or something.  And then they have to go through a series of  if it's more than one click to make it appear on the TV,  it's not going to happen.  And it's still the barriers to entry are too high.  There's a reason that Google made the price of the Chromecast  thirty five dollars or or whatever it was, because they wanted to.  They they they wanted to seed it out there.  Yeah. Into the technically sophisticated audience.  But I don't think that ordinary people are going to be able to manage  this complexity. We still have the problem is still complexity.  Right.

Transcript:  Everyone is focused on this complexity issue, but that that is second.  There's two aspects of complexity.  There's UI complexity.  And it was like, oh, I can't wait for the cable to box to die  because it's the UI is complex.  The problem is that is a second order concern.  The first order concern is can I find the stuff that I want complexity?  And the cable box still wins here.  And the complexity that you guys are driving at is do I look at it  at Apple TV, look at it on Amazon Fire, look at it like, where do I find it?  That is a different sort of complexity that Apple TV has yet to solve.  And the UI can be as beautiful and as intuitive and as fun to use as it could be  until it solves that first order level of complexity, because what matters  is the content. That's what I mean by that.  That being the differentiated layer, it's going to have it's going to have trouble  breaking through in competition to something that has all the content,  even if it's got this convoluted remote in this ugly grid on the TV screen.

I write books, I write books and manuals  and articles that explain to people how to do things.  And the hard part is not the step one, step two, step three.  The hard part is the conceptual.  Yes, where you where you explain to someone how this thing works so that when  the steps that I just wrote about stopped working because Microsoft or Apple or  Google came out with an update in two months that breaks that that step by step  regime that I talked about, if they understand the conceptual  thing that I explained, they can get through it very easily.

Turn on the TV with a small silver remote,  then choose cable set from the onkyo remote,  then make sure the Xbox is turned on by pressing the Xbox button on the game  controller, then choose TV on the Xbox.  Sometimes the TV turns off.  So if the screen goes dark, turn it back on with a little silver remote,  then use the Xfinity remote to choose seven or two.  That was to watch one thing once.

When we come back, we're going to talk about the things Apple left out.  So very big things that Apple left out of the keynote.  Renee Richie is here from my more dot com.  Ben Thompson for Stritechary, Ed Bott from ZDNet.  I got I am I got the three smartest people in the world here.  We are this is we're getting down to it.  You could run an Apple keynote like that, Leo.  I feel like this stuff is like chess or something.  I mean, no, it's worse.  It's like a Rubik's Cube mixed with three chess.  And you make one move and then three years later, all crap.  We screwed up the business model and the whole thing falls apart.  It's it's I don't know how anybody survives in this world.  It's gotten too complex.  And that's why I'm going to move to a farm.  Are you buying the new iPad, the new Apple phone?  Maybe you want to find somewhere to put your old one.  Can I make a suggestion?  Gazelle Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.  Gazelle Gazelle makes it easy to buy and to sell.  So let's talk about selling first.  That's how Gazelle got famous.  You can trade in your old devices, get by the way, get a price that's locked  in so you know what you're going to get and you have 30 days to decide.  They will buy even broken iPads and iPhones.  Of course, they buy other devices like BlackBerry's and Samsung Galaxies.  They'll buy Surface tablets, Google tablets.  If you go to Gazelle.com, you'll see what?  Three hundred thirty five dollars for my six plus three hundred seventy five  dollars flaw. That's awesome.  Now, here's the deal.  You've got 30 days to pull the trigger on that.  You don't have there's no no obligation.  The only obligation is from you to from Gazelle to you that they'll give you  that price once you decide, OK, I'm going to take advantage of this.  You check out they send you a box prepaid  postage, a postage and anything worth more than a buck.  You pile that box, it put a lot of stuff in there.  You've got old gadgets that are just gathering dust.  That's crazy. That's like saying, oh, here's a hundred dollar bill.  I'm just going to leave it in the drawer.  That's crazy. Send it there.  If you forget to wipe the personal  information or you can't because the device is broken, they'll do that for you.  And then they turn it around and they give you your money very fast.  You get a check in the mail.  You can get a direct deposit for PayPal in your PayPal account.  That's really fast. Or for an extra five percent, use the Amazon gift card.  If you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon, that's a great deal.  Gazelle's paid out well over 200 million dollars to over a million customers.  And now they buy and sell.  So the best stuff that comes into Gazelle will be sold.  You can buy certified, pre-owned.  When I say certified, I mean it.  They have this very elaborate 30 point quality inspection on every device.  They sell make sure everything not only functions totally perfectly exactly right,  but that the screen doesn't have scratches on it.  There's no defects, things like that.  You can get their various quality.  You can get it like new.  That's going to cost a little more if you want to save a little more.  And this is what I do for my kids when they lose their phone.  I get the slightly used it's kind of, you know, slight signs of wear.  But again, 100 percent functional 30 day return means you're guaranteed that it's  going to work. You have 30 days to return it.  No risk to you. I just really love Gazelle.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E to buy to sell.  Remember Gazelle.  Calm. She's a good time to buy last year's  iPhone, Gazelle and get a great deal, save a lot of money if you're worried about that.  All right, we're going to get back to the conversation.  Lots more to talk about with our great panel.  But first, if you missed this week on Twitter, you missed a lot.  Take a look.  Previously on Twitter.

Transcript:  We're talking high tech.  We're really talking Apple today.  There's a lot of Apple information from the week.  There's been other news, too.  We'll get, I mean, Twitter.  I'll just say the words Google, Facebook.  They're all involved.  What is you maybe can clarify for this for me, Renee.  I'm very confused.  Somebody in the chat room is saying, oh, you can't store apps on the Apple TV.  They use on demand resources.  Serenity Caldwell wrote a good article explaining this.  Are Apple TV apps limited to 200 megabytes?  That doesn't sound like much.

Start time: 7077.84
End time: 7112.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. So what happens is they don't have  giant hard drives in them, so they have limited NAND flash storage.  So what happens is you have a 200 megabyte initial download.  That could be something as simple as a splash screen.  It's whatever they want.  It's designed so that if the device is full, it doesn't give you this big error  message that says, sorry, you're out of room.  Please go delete something because they don't want you to have to do file system  management on the Apple TV.  So what it will do is download that 200 megabytes, which will almost always fit in  and then download a payload of up to two gigabytes immediately if there's no  storage pressure, otherwise it'll start removing resources from other apps as it  downloads that sort of intelligently balance what's on the device.

Transcript:  I might want to play a game like Crossy Road and I have to wait till it downloads

Start time: 7116.40
End time: 7154.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because it's well, you have to wait to download anyway.  So what this does is you want.  Well, this is the same thing.  So in your example, if you downloaded like Infinity Gauntlet or something and you  didn't play it in three months and then you downloaded Crossy Road, it would start  removing the oldest played levels from the Infinity Gauntlet game, the ones you'd  already passed and haven't played in a long time to make room for the very first  Crossy Road levels.  And then as you played more, it'll download more and more levels and get rid of older  ones. So it's trying to intelligently balance all the space, sort of like iCloud  photo library or iCloud music where it wants to keep everything near lines.  You have a much bigger capacity.  It's Ed's CloudPoint again.  You have a much bigger capacity than you have on the lower device, on the local

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're not doing anything other than.  So when you make an app, you just the developer tags like this is this is the  need this download. Right.  These are the levels. It might be like video tutorials.  Once you've watched the onboarding thing, you don't need to store that for a gigabyte  video anymore or a cutscene anymore.  So it just dumps them. And if you ever decide, yes, I really want to watch that again,  it'll go download it for you.

Transcript:  One thing they didn't mention, which kind of shocked me, is HomeKit.  I thought the new Apple TV was all about HomeKit, the home automation.

Start time: 7212.92
End time: 7222.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They moved that to iCloud.  Initially, the Apple TV was a remote access point.  So if you were at the airport, wanted to switch off your lights, you could do that.  Now that happens through iCloud.  So it doesn't have to do anything on the Apple TV anymore.

Start time: 7223.06
End time: 7224.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so that's that.

Start time: 7225.98
End time: 7248.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, some people want it to be some people have got older home automation  equipment and they would they were hoping that Apple would do something where the  Apple TV would magically make all the old things like light like our Hue light bulbs,  Leo, work with HomeKit without having to go buy a new Hue hub.  But then it still wouldn't be secure.  And then Hue hasn't made the lights work with anybody's hub by themselves.  So that's sort of a fantasy at this point.

Start time: 7248.84
End time: 7256.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is Google? Google seems to have the same fantasy.  The on hub router really seems to be less of a router and more of a home automation hub.

Start time: 7257.24
End time: 7271.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will, but it's still, for example, unless Hue enables their lights to work with it,  it's not going to work with it.  So there's a lot that has to happen on both the the the vendors side and on the  platform owner side for that to work.  You have to essentially make every light bulb its own tiny hub instead of just

Start time: 7271.22
End time: 7279.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  having that one Hue hub that connects to all the light bulbs.  I'm increasingly of the opinion that nobody's ever going to get home automation  working and it's just to look at their really optimistically.

Start time: 7279.92
End time: 7281.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we're optimist today.

Start time: 7281.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but you and I were doing stupid things like Hue lights and.  My doorbell with a camera on it, but nothing talks to anything.  Leo, your great grandchildren are going to live in this amazing world.  Now they're not they're not going to be able to watch the more  they're not going to be able to do anything.

Transcript:  You're in the you're in the trough of depression, which is like the  adoption curve, which is there's there's a ton of hype at the beginning and it goes up.  And then it way overshoots the capability. Right.  And then I was like, this sucks is never going to right.  It's never going to happen. It's going to come through.  That's where and while the technology just keeps increasing, keeps increasing.  And then eventually the expectations match up with what's actually there.  And you realize, you know, what's the what's the great Bill Gates quote?  Like you will always overestimate what can be done in a year  and drastically underestimate what can be done in 10.  And that applies to a great many things.  I would imagine this is this is one of them.

Start time: 7330.40
End time: 7340.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's the other thing, Leo, is there's no 4K story.  And yes, 4K is not not many people own 4K sets yet.  There's not a lot of 4K content yet, but the Apple TV does not.  The new Apple TV does not support 4K.

Start time: 7340.58
End time: 7357.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And while there was some speculation that maybe the hardware could,  they just turn on on with the software, which the problem is HDMI 1.4.  Yeah, it's going to really be a good solution for 4K.  It could do it, but only at 30 frames.  This is not a 4K device.  Do not delude yourself.

Start time: 7358.38
End time: 7378.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And again, like there's a lot bigger problems to solve.  Like if there becomes an iTunes 4K, how are they going to handle upgrading your content?  Like I remember when it went to HD, they offered you the ability to pay  to upgrade all that stuff and.  Yeah, but I could shoot 4K on my iPhone, my new iPhone.  Yeah, but then it gives you awesome digital zoom and the ability to crop down  to these to sample down to awesome 1080p.  Right.

Start time: 7379.66
End time: 7407.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you have just made my point that the Apple TV is an accessory.  Yes. For people who already are invested in the Apple ecosystem  and are willing to upgrade it in a year or two or three of and and and are perfectly happy.  If someone's coming into this for the first time, they're going to focus on the limitations.  If they're coming into this as a member of the Apple ecosystem already,  they're going to focus on the synergies.

The idea is what that the the camera, as soon as you point it at something  for a second or two, it's just recording already.  Then you take the picture five seconds and then it records another one point  five seconds. And then what?

Transcript:  Well, we didn't talk about that, but the 3D we haven't talked  with the iPhone at all, which is interesting.  Let's yes, isn't it?  The 3D touch, though, is really good.  Yeah, but it's super easy to use.

Start time: 8088.20
End time: 8105.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did want to ask you about that because I have to say I was very skeptical.  Force touch on the watch is not intuitive and kind of I'm not sure what's going to happen.  It's even worse on the laptops because it just it's not consistent  and you can't really tell.  But everybody who tried it on the phone said this 3D touch actually works.  Yeah.

Start time: 8105.44
End time: 8152.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think part of it is on the laptop, you don't have the immediate  feed, you don't have the direct feedback.  You need the haptic feedback. Yeah.  Well, it's not just the haptic.  It's that you're not touching the item like the the the the abstraction  of the touchpad makes it much more difficult to pull off.  I think the thing that's most impressive, though,  compared to the watch in particular, is that it always works on the phone.  Like it like it works every time.  And what I think Apple is doing that smart about it,  I think Apple's always been good about this.  It's something that in contrast to say Microsoft, for example,  is that they're keeping all of the at least for now.  And they hope they can do doing that.  All the 3D touch interactions are just ways to do  actions faster that you could do in traditional ways.  And so because the issue is it's kind of a hidden

Start time: 8153.12
End time: 8158.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  right. Are you going to know is it intuitive?  Are you going to know what it's going to do and kind of get it?

Start time: 8158.76
End time: 8183.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a stage called.  At least now it seems it seems pretty consistent, especially  if it comes like peeking and stuff like that.  But the point of the matter is, if you don't know how to do it,  it won't change the way you use the phone at all. Right.  But if you do know how to do it, it makes certain aspects.  It speeds things up. Absolutely. Absolutely.  And I think I'm I was relatively skeptical as well, but I was  probably more.  I was very, very impressed in actually using it in hand.

Start time: 8183.24
End time: 8207.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is back to that conceptual point of view.  Once you learn how it works,  you can extend it to other things.  You learn it in one place. Right.  It works in other places that has been historically  Apple's strength in terms of user interface design.  You know, they may not be first.  They may not be best, but they are certainly most consistent.

Transcript:  Well, I'm liking it to to give Microsoft credit. Right.  Click. Right.  The contextual menu that popped up with right click  is very quickly adopted by people.  People got it right away and it was very much of a power tool.  He's called me.  Because there's only one.

Start time: 8224.70
End time: 8267.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What Microsoft got wrong about right quick was there were things  that that you had to use right click for. Yes.  And that was actually very difficult for all, especially novice users,  because they could wear the.  Actually, I think the Mac did right click better  was because it was always optional in part.  It was forced because there was never two buttons on the laptops and stuff.  But that meant that anything you put right quick,  it also had to be visible elsewhere in the eye.  So if you didn't know how to do right click, you could still you could still access it.  And I think this is a really critical point in you.  I think that the watch is a problem for the watch is when critical  aspects of the UI are hidden.  It's it's a big problem.  And and that's the case for the watch.  And it was the same problem for Windows 8.

End time: 8295.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it was a huge problem.  So I mean, one thing that we was kind of shocking to us when we got  when it first launched was the like for Windows 8,  a app you needed to swipe down on the top or bottom screen  and that actually bring in the controls.  It was kind of frightening.  The number of people that watch Windows 8 app and never once  swipe the top or bottom like there was just no what's the charm's bar?

Start time: 8312.50
End time: 8343.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right now, there's this thing is intuitive.  There is there is can you learn it quickly?  Right. Can you if you can?  If you can learn the concept quickly and extend the concept to other things.  That was the same thing with right click.  Right. Right. Click wasn't mandatory ever.  It was it was a way to quickly get to features  that you otherwise had to go find menus for.  Interesting. Interesting.  And that was the that was the benefit of it.

Start time: 8344.38
End time: 8456.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting thing here is that I mean, this is they've been working on this for years  and they've been doing a lot of hardware work, a lot of interface work.  And the idea is you have a single column view on the iPhone,  which is very different than on a computer with multi windows or an iPad,  even with a split view.  And it just wasn't fast.  Click that email or the next screen wrong email.  Go back. Or now the phones are bigger.  And we talked about this a long time ago, Leo, but like you can solve  for one handed ease of use in other ways than just having a small screen.  And this is sort of the confluence of this, where they've done a lot of work  on making sure that the clicks and you can adjust the click,  the the 3D touch in settings.  You can turn it off if you have, for example, physical impediments to using it.  But if you don't, they've done a very good job of making it.  So you press a little bit and you get a hint.  It's almost like the head shaking animation that tells you what if there is something there  and if there's not, that sort of motion will open things in other apps.  So you start to discover it a little bit.  Then you push a little bit and it gives you the preview, which is called peak.  You press a little bit more and it commits to bring it full screen,  which is called the pop.  And it has a lot like you can force swipe to go right to the multitasking interface.  So there's a back button now in iOS nine for inside an app.  And there's the force to go back through the app stack.  You can force you can 3D touch the keyboard to switch it to the trackpad,  like on the iPad, on iOS nine.  There's a whole bunch of things that they just made super, super fast  by virtue of implementing this thing.  And what makes me what I find so cool about this is back in iOS eight,  I said extensibility was going to be one of the biggest breakthroughs Apple has ever done.  And I think I undersold it because so many of the new technologies,  from content blockers to video game recording to all these views that are being,  they've basically totally unbundled apps.  Apps are not these discrete binaries that you arduously go and search for and find and launch.  They're these little bits of functionality that you pull down or press into or swipe up.  And little bits of apps are everywhere.  And it makes the entire interface almost like it's accelerated.  It makes it so much faster to use.

End time: 8479.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is subtly different that the Android back button always had two purposes,  inside the app and outside the app.  And Apple's got two discrete actions, one for inside and one for outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it reminds me of the fundamental difference between  the difference between Amazon and Apple where, you know,  a lot of times Steve Jobs wouldn't get his way.  And Jeff Bezos got his way with the fire phone.  There weren't enough people there to say, no, no, this is a terrible idea.  We're going to do this, this and this and not this.  And he would curse at them, go off, say they're all going to fail and he'd fire them.  But then it would work out and everyone would be fine.  So you always need those people to tell you no.

Transcript:  To to to his credit, though, and to Amazon's credit,  they learn from their mistake and they're not trying to do version two.  And they're they're like,  I mean, the issue is Amazon is a is a horizontal services company  that needs to be reaching people on every platform, not not trying to own the one.  And and yes, you're right.  It should never remain in the first place.  And probably all of us, definitely myself, were saying it was a bad idea from the beginning.  But that said, if you're not if you're going to do the wrong thing,  at least learn from it and change going forward.

Transcript:  Well, you know, that's that's that's why Nadella deserves credit.  It is because it was important that Microsoft was was at that event.  And it was important because what matters to Microsoft is not Windows.  What matters to Microsoft is is that Windows is now is when Windows was the market.  Microsoft, the great thing about monopolies, you don't need.  I talked about that whole distinction before about about being a scale offering or being like a niche offering.  When you're a monopoly, you're going to be both like it's very easy.  And so Microsoft never had to make these kind of trade off decisions.  Are we going to be focused on a vertical area or be focused on a horizontal scale play?  And now they do have positions because Windows is no longer the whole thing.  It's only a part of the market.  And Microsoft's by nature and by business model and by history is a scale company.  They're a horizontal platform sort of company, which means they needed to abandon Windows.  I mean, yes, Windows is still being produced and things, but it's clearly often its corner and it's doing its thing.  And the focus of the company and all the growth is on platforms that are on that are on Windows and are on iOS and Android are on the web.  And that's exactly right.  Exactly what they should be doing doesn't mean they're going to necessarily succeed.  They have a lot of challenges in front of them.  But at least they are finally now going down the right road.  And and, you know, I have great respect and admiration for Nadella for having done that.  And on the flip side, that was my big contention and problem with Steve Ballmer was he conflated Windows with Microsoft.  And and that was to that led to a lot of blind spots.
