I'm rocking Intel at the moment  Because Brianna and I both have she's got a little bit more powerful  The red room. I only have eight cores  On my 5900 X but it's a very I have to say I'm very impressed and I only got the 3080 not the 3090  But boy, it really looks good and I'm driving a big 4k display  An OLED which is really nice and I have to say it's not just for gaming anymore. It's really nice to have  I'm running Linux. So I went tile a tiled window manager  So I have four different 1080p windows open the same time and they're big and it's just I'm loving  Life, it's a desktops aren't dead.

So yeah, it's interesting to see I'm doing sim racing myself and I just upgraded to  a vibe to  HD or you're doing the VR thing  So I stepped up from an rift s to a vibe to and there's a lot more pixels  I got to push now, so that's why I need a little more horsepower on the original vibe at home

Transcript:  So if you're so you're a a real racer, I know you do ice racing  How close is the VR game to actual racing?

Start time: 362.70
End time: 403.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty amazing how close it can be especially with this newer sim is set of course the competition  A the physics engine that is is unbelievable  They measure the the tire temperature down to three different positions within the rubber for example  Just to give an idea of how how in-depth this physics engine is and the feel the sound especially in VR  It's really really engaging and I also do a lot of rally racing  And when you're doing that then you constantly need to be looking over your shoulder as you're you know  And so even if you have like a triple monitor set up it doesn't really work very well  But as soon as you get into VR now, you can look anywhere you want to and it really like you're in the car engaging  Yeah, yeah, it's a lot more fun a lot more engaging and yeah, I love it  I'm always curious your opinion on this but for me, you know, cuz I do track days, too

Start time: 404.06
End time: 442.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I feel like the disconnect I personally feel when I try sim racing is so much of  Doing a track day. Well, I feel like  Doing a track day  Well, I feel is getting to know the g-force and when your tires are going to break  That to me is so much of the skill of it  And when you're doing it in VR, you don't have like you have steering wheel feedback  But you just don't feel it in the same way. Yeah, it's  I can be I can be like racing my own literal track car and you know  One of these racing simulators and I just suck at it and it's it's because of that lack of feedback

Start time: 443.64
End time: 475.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it really is learning  I mean the mechanics are much the same that the reactions that you need are much the same  But but which this the feedback that you're looking for is very different now  It's really about what you hear and what you see so you need to learn to to kind of pick up the real  Tiny changes in perspective that you get when your car starts to slide and yeah force feedback wheels do help as well  But really it's about sound and vision and that's why I think VR again helps  But it's also why a high solid frame rate is really important because if your frame rate stuttering at all  Then that throws off your perception of what the car is doing that makes it really really difficult to stay ahead

It's by this this Belgian  they build I think a Belgian company called cowboy and I I liked it because it's partly electric and  To my father  So it felt like a toy, but it still doesn't do all the work for you, so it helps me get fit  So it's kind of the best of both was I didn't want a basic, you know basic push bike  And I also didn't want something that was just gonna  You know, I'd like a motorcycle  Like a basic motorcycle or something like that  I just wanted something that was a bit of both and and I think these electric bikes have really come on a long way  I love it. I really love it. I'm not going crazy journeys with it and I'm mostly using it for pleasure  But it's it's great because I can use it on the road and I can cycle through the forest that we've gotten it here

Transcript:  That's pretty cool. Sounds great. I've glued you all to your seats so that you can't go anywhere  While we talk about the week's tech news, I'm sorry. It's just not as interesting but that's that's we're gonna talk about  Today this was a big week  For tech companies and quarterly results all of the tech companies had  phenomenal quarterly results right Microsoft Apple  Google  All making a ton of money  It actually is interesting. There was an article  About big tech in the New York Times that pointed out that in  2020 now that we have all the results out for 2020 when you combine the revenues  Yearly revenues of Amazon Apple alphabet Microsoft and Facebook  trillion dollars  That's growth of 25 percent over last year in less than one week  Those five companies make more in sales and McDonald's does in a year  The they are behemoths and of course always concomitant with this kind of success  then there's both public kind of  Upset and there's regulatory scrutiny this week Apple  Got the charges from the EU that they are that the App Store is is a monopoly  This is at the behest of Spotify  Antitrust violations in the Spotify case. There's Marta Vista here the competition commission at the EU  She's really become the pitbull that  Against a big tech in the United States you regulators  Say Apple squeezed rival music streaming apps  Spotify which is you know where this came from by requiring them to use Apple's in-app payment systems to sell digital content  They also say Apple distorted competition  That's the phrase they used by limiting how app developers can inform users about cheaper ways to subscribe  This is a long-standing problem. You know Amazon didn't sell books in the Kindle store on  Ios and when they had the temerity to say oh  By the way, you can buy these books on Amazon.com Apple said you can't say that  Apple's in-payment system, of course charges 30% for most people  They've now lowered that for people that make more than a million dollars a year, which is all the big boys to 15%  There's a second data point on this. I don't know how much  credibility to give it  But you know Apple's in tomorrow Apple's gonna go to court with epic the big battle has begun epic has hired an expert to analyze  Documents obtained from Apple and discovery Ned Barnes. He's a financial and economics researcher  Said Apple has a 78%  margin in the app store 78%  profit  Is is Apple's app store?  It's obviously a problem for Apple now they're getting a lot of scrutiny  But is it really is there is there a good reason for it to be problem Brianna is this?  Is there something wrong with the way Apple's doing it?

End time: 820.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think this is a hard situation to talk about right like no one there's a fan of iOS or the Apple  Ecosystem wants them to open this up to competitors part of what keeps all of us safe is  You know the curation and the the limiting of who's able to run apps in the the app store  Just to really be frank with you Leah. The only reason I stay on iOS is the privacy, right?  There's there's no other reasons not the features. It's not the hardware  So that's one side of it on the other. I think it's really increasingly difficult to say  You know Apple deserves that high a cut  You know, what value are they really producing for to earn that 30% is not payment processing which is cheaper than ever  It's not really discovery because the app store tends to favor the biggest fish and you know  People that can afford to do their own marketing  You know, what what are they providing here as far as the profit itself? Wow stunner headline  Monopolies and duopolies are insanely profitable who would have known that so  You know, I think that if Apple doesn't want to be increasingly under the gun of regulators  I think it would be smart of them to bring that down to a margin. That's frankly doesn't seem as exploitive

Start time: 821.00
End time: 865.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the number 78% isn't confirmed by Apple. In fact, they asked the judge. Can we not talk about this?  They literally said to the judge your honor. Let's not talk about this and the judge  I don't know the judge hasn't ruled yet, but somehow I feel like that might be  material in the in the in the epic case  Apple's services segment according to Apple's own quarterly results  And services includes Apple App Store, but other things is 70%  The gross margin for its products is is 36% This is an incredibly profitable company  Making an awful lot of money, but is that illegal?  Nate, what do you think you're you're you're from the former member of the EU?

Start time: 866.60
End time: 882.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought I mean I followed this I follow this stuff closely and and frankly Apple's hardware margins on iPhone used to be a lot higher  Than they used to be I think they were even comparable to some of the margins that we're talking about for App Store that this analyst  was discussing. When you combine services and products the total gross margin for the quarter was 42 and a half percent. That's

Start time: 885.00
End time: 899.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a phenomenally successful company. I mean, I know my company is not nearly nearly so profitable  But I would guess most companies would be very happy with anything above 10% maybe 20%  42 and a half percent. Wow.

Start time: 900.08
End time: 1087.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think so there's a few ways of looking at it because you know on the one hand you could say well  There's nothing wrong with a company  Being profitable making money, you know, that's kind of what capitalism is predominantly all about and the question is whether it's being abused and whether it could  Rather that whether that that profitability and that market position is being abused and if so  What needs to change in order for it not to be and I don't believe that the EU is going to take a  As much of an issue with the profitability of the App Store  From the perspective that well, you could just make less profit and actually it will come down to well, are you  artificially prohibiting  People who depend on your App Store from circumventing your payment platform  So if you look at what Apple did with the sign in with Apple  System where if you offer a sign in with Facebook or Google you have to also offer sign in with Apple  Apple can push the benefits of choosing Apple over the others by saying well, look, it's more private  It's faster. It uses face ID to authenticate  You're not typing in your password all of which is true  To do this because it's faster and more convenient if Apple were to be forced or choose to allow another form of payment  system within an app  Essentially the user as at as epic demonstrated with the fortnight case that kind of spearhead a lot of this stuff  That you know, you give someone a choice and they can go with Apple and it might cost more money  But it's tied into the payment system  It's done without going to a separate webpage like when you have to pay with Paypal or something like you could see that well  There's a legitimate argument that people are still going to use Apple because it's just faster and more convenient  So I think that is probably what will end up being talked about a lot more than just the sheer profitability  I mean, I think that's a good point  I think that's a good point  I think that's a good point  I think that's a good point. I mean a rolex watch is a is very much more than 42% profit. I'm sure  Yeah, yeah  so I think that's what it'll it probably will come down to and and just one other thing that I thought was worth pointing out is  This reminds me a lot of the conversation that went around to this sort of turn of the millennium with  With microsoft and its anti-trust battle with the exactly you very much so, you know  Yeah, I mean  But but the result for microsoft was essentially that it lost  It lost its ground on a lot of products and and like browsers obviously in particular  I think windows media players suffered and I think that kind of had a knock on effect that  Microsoft was maybe less willing to be as aggressive in pushing its products against  competitors  Then it may otherwise have would have if it wasn't scared of antitrust and i'm going to be looking out for whether  Whatever the result of this happens whatever decisions made whatever appeals are made or overturned is whether this changes apple's  aggressive pursuit of  Dominating its ecosystem or whether it will eventually end up ceding ground in a way microsoft did and I think that's going to be fascinating

Start time: 1087.68
End time: 1132.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure there'll be debate over this  But I agree with you. I think  even though the doj microsoft  Battle which went on for almost a decade ended up, you know kind of in a draw it tempered  microsoft's aggression  It's certainly I think you make a strong case that  Google for instance might not have existed if microsoft hadn't been more careful about entering markets  You can also make the case that it's not been bad for microsoft that they have as a result found new areas  To make money and and it's actually I don't think you can look at microsoft today and say they suffered because of what happened  In the in the late 90s in the early 2000s with the doj the companies the companies worth over

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two trillion dollars at this point. Yeah, and it lost the windows phone battle  I mean if you if you would look at an example of maybe how microsoft would have approached a market  Opportunity more aggressively were it not for fears over antitrust look at windows phone perfect  Like that was that was not a product that should have failed really it had everything going for it in terms of the people  Who could have pushed it harder and didn't and eventually it lost out

Start time: 1157.72
End time: 1187.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have never heard anybody say that's why they lost the windows phone market  You know usually it's the carrier stores in the u.s that are blamed for not I don't think exclusively  I think it was just a part that makes sense. There were other things wrong with it microsoft  Certainly was chastened and was much less aggressive  In a way we've lost because it would be great to have others another standard besides ios and android  So and it was if I think windows phone was great, but uh, so the consumptive customer has lost a little bit  But I don't think a a less rapacious microsoft is a bad thing in general overall

Start time: 1188.28
End time: 1257.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just I just want to come back to this this issue  You know, I think because i'm looking at the club twitch chat  I don't think any of us here begrudge any tech company for doing very well and you know  Making a lot of money. Um, I don't think anyone here has any kind of problem with that  My interest in this really begins and ends  When you have companies that are so large that we cannot continue to have innovation in the tech industry  And I think we have to be asking ourselves could you launch another facebook today?  Without that being you know gobbled up by facebook. Could you have a really strong?  A hardware manufacturer come along today with an operating system and and compete with apple or microsoft  I I think the answer is increasingly  Probably not  So my only interest here is making sure we can continue to foster innovation in the tech industry  Because if we don't I mean this thing that all of us love is just going to stagnate  And I think we are unfortunately seeing that in many ways competition even for those startups who do fit within this ecosystem

Start time: 1257.46
End time: 1298.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who could write an app that will fit within, you know app store guidelines now need to make 30 additional  Margins on their end just to to break even because of the high fees that apple is charging  I mean if you think of your average retail space, you know  There isn't a shopping mall on the planet that would cut take 30 off of  All the sales of any of their stores and expect for those stores to survive  But that's exactly what apple's doing and it's hard for that to not look egregious and regarding margins  I love that apple's response to to the margins wasn't this is in valor. This is wrong  It was we actually don't calculate that and we can't calculate that which is totally bs. Of course they calculate  Of course, they know that this because they don't report it doesn't mean they don't have a number ready and willing

Start time: 1298.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't know we have no idea how much we make no idea at all  By the way, they're spending 90 billion dollars to buy back stock  They announced that as well in the quarterly results  That's a huge amount and that will of course inflate the stock price even further  Which means that people who own apple stock probably members of congress will be very well disposed towards apple  It also means that employees will get you know, bigger stock grants and and so forth and so on somebody in the in the club  twit chat they are pointing out that the cost  Isn't to spotify  Or amazon it's to you because in most cases companies just pass along this 30 to the consumers so  Joe's saying, you know when you buy  YouTube premium  On the web. It's 12 bucks when you buy it on the i store apple store  It's 16 bucks and on and on and on and that that actually kind of makes sense. It's uh  It's there are some services

Start time: 1353.78
End time: 1372.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That that aren't available elsewhere  You know if you're buying a premium app a game something like that and you can only get it through the app store  Then you don't have an option there's no way around it  So that that premium certainly is baked in there is being passed on to the user  But you know if the app is 30 higher more expensive than it would be otherwise  Then do you expect to have 30 if you were sales?

Transcript:  Probably so the funny thing is and this is why it's so hard to cover  Apple is this mixed bag because as you said brianna you use it because it's privacy for focused  Uh, I would say you could argue that the app store makes it a more secure  I think the iphone is a more secure platform whether it's the app store or apple's engineering or the fact that it's such a closed  System compared to android, but for whatever reason I think it feels a lot safer  And then apple is this week apple released ios 14.5 ipad os 14.5  Which is you know  Sticking it to facebook  With their app, you know application tracking  Switches and their privacy statements all of a sudden companies like google and facebook have to admit  They're gathering huge amounts of information and consumers get to decide  A whether they want to let them continue to do that and b whether they even want to use  whatsapp or facebook messenger  Maybe i'm going to use something else because i'm looking at that privacy statement and comparing it to signal  And I you know, I don't want to give up that information  So apple's doing some real good, right? We we agree

Transcript:  With this this new att stuff take it for a former political fundraiser the amount  Of information I can get on you from your facebook account is it would it would horrify you if you really found out about it  Just from right your facebook account. Well now people are  Exactly, they're horrified  You could do list matching with it. I can ultimately find out your address. I can find out what your interests are  I can find out what website she visit because all this is collated and I have to tell you they sell it  For a song they sell it for an insultingly  low amount so  You know, I think having seen how the sausage is made  You better believe I was I was sitting there waiting for them to update it on my iphone. I'm like install now install now because  Uh, this is it's it's such an obvious step forward. I think it's really sad that you know  Google is probably not going to do this on android because I think in many ways  That's an ecosystem that needs this even more this week apple also released its air tags

Transcript:  Uh something that the company tile which is up to now has been the leader in booth bluetooth. Uh track tracking tags  Has been very afraid of tile ceo has testified before of congress saying apple apple is going to put us out of business  They're going to use their market clout  They're going to use the fact that there's a billion iphones out there to completely dominate and it's happening  apple two weeks before they released air tags  Did open the find my system?  another bluetooth tracker chipolo  agreed to support it giving these guys much of the benefit that air tags have but  It's very hard to compete against a bluetooth tracker that uses the fact that there are a billion iphones out there all of which will be  You know keeping an eye out for your lost keys. That's a tough  thing  To compete with and this is the problem  You want apple to innovate you want apple to do these things?  You want them to be good. You want them to make money. You just don't want them to use their monopoly position  to kill competition or disadvantage consumers  And and it's difficult to think of for instance a solution to the app store that would somehow  Fix this problem open putting a third-party app store is not going to change things dramatically

Transcript:  No, but I wanted to say I I think that I think that part of the reason this has grabbed so much of the cultural zeitgeist  especially with  you know millennials and people younger is I think there's a  A growing sense that the financial industry is is fundamentally corrupt  And I think there's a sense that like this is the way we get rich. This is our time  This is our scheme, you know, and I think it's about I think so much of the bitcoin  Fever, I think it's about kind of a resentment about a monetary system that works for the warren buffets of the world  And isn't working for a lot of people under under 40.

It's a lot of younger people saying  You know we can manipulate the market as well, you know, this the system has been stacked against us for so long  But if we get together we can actually make this work and we can show just how ridiculous this entire thing is  And I think that really shed a lot of light on on on people's perspectives in terms of investment crypto versus a traditional stock market investment  That everything is kind of imaginary. Everything is built on faith. Everything is built on what everybody else is doing  So there's no reason to think that one thing is is inherently more valuable than than something else

It's all bits  Actually, nate you wanted to mention this apple instead of doing what you thought maybe microsoft did under all that scrutiny  Backing off has really doubled down. They're apparently about to launch  lossless streaming on apple music  competing with uh  Does spotify even have lossless? I know  Deezer and tidal do or have high bit rate. Anyway, I have a classical music subscription prime phonic, which is lossless  Um, I get oh, yeah spotify launched  Uh lossless in february. All right spotify. Hi-fi

My point was lossless streaming is is is one thing but i'm particularly excited about the prospect of high res  because as part of some of these rumors, um that have been written about is that  This may potentially support dolby atmos  Audio and that gets me very excited because what apple's done with atmos and with the spatial audio with the airpods pro  Is extremely effective. It does create a very very different movie watching experience and a lot of live  concerts and audio  Streams music streams. They're recorded or mastered in in 5.1 surround sound for instance  So the idea that maybe apple which does want to start doing much more with with its music service. It wants to do these live  uh music experiences and even if it's documentaries or concert streams or whatever  I kind of see that all being part of the same thing and maybe this is uh, apple's step into  Very interesting lossless audio, but spatial or let's stream  Yeah, but for live concerts and events and things like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are terrible and and well they are  Terrible compared to if you if you buy a big, you know, nice set of headphones because bluetooth  Uh compresses audio wireless is going to be good. Yeah, even aptx. Yeah  But um, but there are ways around that for sure and there's and there's hi-fi and  Apple has its own chips in the in the earphones and maybe you can take that a step further

End time: 2377.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is very an iphone. This is what they did with the home pod, which is they sell what is essentially  kind of low end  You know not certainly not high fidelity audio equipment  But then they make a big deal about how they own 90 anechoic chambers and they hire the best engineers and this is  You know and then they sell this thing for for 300 bucks and nobody wanted they had to cancel it after a year  I remember the ipod hi-fi they were selling steve jobs said i'm selling my high end audio gear  Because this is so good. And of course it died immediately too fair. This is very apple

Start time: 2377.96
End time: 2403.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is and I think the only way apple's going to get something like this off the ground is if they do it in  tandem with  A premium set of airpods which right lo and behold it just so happens to have released a very expensive pair of headphones  So because people need to be able to put it on on their head and really  Immediately tell that difference and with the spatial audio stuff you really can that even someone whose ears aren't so good  um  Could probably notice the difference with

Start time: 2404.56
End time: 2444.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So i've done a lot of work with high fidelity. This is uh, oh interesting  So they're they're amazing. Um, and one of the problems that we're running into  Is the original airpod, you know, it will play that to you  It's not capable of doing that spatial audio and even though they could update the uh, the the algorithm that goes  You know helps it connect from the airpod to uh, you know your iphone or ipad or mac  They won't do that my my I suspect they kind of want you to go and invest in  You know the airpod pros are some new apple product despite the wild popularity of airpod

Start time: 2444.74
End time: 2456.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They sell a five hundred fifty dollar over the year headphone the airpods max that even  At that price, which is a steep price is widely considered not to be particularly high fidelity

Start time: 2457.36
End time: 2493.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but my my point here is you've got a startup this comes back to our previous discussion about monopoly, right? And  so you've got a  Startup that's trying to compete with you know clubhouse and doing spatial audio for conferences  And interesting zoom meetings like a real a lot of interesting applications. There you go. It's not about high fidelity music  Right. It's not high fidelity of the company. So if they if they would come in and update that audio codec  It would it would help this space and you know apple in in some ways is more interested in selling

Start time: 2494.52
End time: 2510.44

That person's in front of me would be huge  So he's selling a spatial audio api. This is not the same unfortunately as apple's

End time: 2625.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh sure, they'll they'll work with him. No problem  Yes, he's pretty important person philip if they invite you into the apple headquarters to talk do not go  Or bring your lawyer. Anyway, that would be my advice  Uh, oh, that's interesting. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense  So we're not talking because apple I think you could argue has done more to ruin people's taste in music  because of the kind of kind of low end  And  You know headphones that were ubiquitous and the and the uh, ipods they've just created and uh, you know  128 kilobit ac they've created a generation of people who just don't know what good music sounds like now  I really sound stupid. I sound like neil young or something. But but really they that's they become the kind of the  The low bar for audio philip, but but on the other hand  Spatial audio in a context like a concert or a meeting  It's not about the quality of the fidelity of the sound it's about the spatial experience that makes a lot of sense  And I could see apple doubling down on that. They they do unfortunately. I'm sorry philip own that  At least mine mine share of that  Very interesting. Is he is his technology in any hardware yet? Uh, how does uh,

They've had their event for this month  One more story on airtags, then we're going to take a break  uh  I thought a very good story, uh on uh mashable  by a journalist who  Said, you know apple says you can't use airtags to to stalk people  But she gave her two roommates airtags and was able to with no trouble at all  And no alert to these, uh her friends. I mean she told him ahead of time, but there was no other, you know  Way, they would have known  Able to stalk them for days down to their exact location their street address and so forth

The national network to end domestic violence says apple's got to fix this  You know, this has been a problem with bluetooth trackers from day one, but they they were  The tracker network the tile network were always so scant that it really didn't there was no way to track anybody with this all of a sudden  You've got a gps better than a gps device  That you could slip into somebody's purse or pocket or  And and follow them around

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now didn't apple say there was something built into the system  That would alert you if you were within close proximity to the same air tag that wasn't registered to you  Like yes to find my network. I think it's essentially it's  It's every iphone every ipad is you know, and and similar is is a a little  You know a little beacon for these things. So you don't need wi-fi necessarily, but if it detects one  That isn't registered to you. Then it can say hey look there's in theory. This is the press release

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so credit to brenda stoljar at mashable who actually tested this  And found that a lot of the protections apple puts in are not  effective to permit  to prevent stalking  so  for instance  um, they say that uh, if if  once the air tag is  Uh separated from you it will after some period of time  Start beeping  Right, it'll you'll get a safety alert. Now. First of all, you have if you have an iphone with 14.5  You're a little bit safer. You'll get a safety alert that says your current location can be seen by the owner of this air tag  Her roommates had android phones so they saw nothing  It takes about three days  she said  before the air tag starts  Beeping at you saying, uh, there's an air tag in your purse three days is plenty of time for a stalker to do his dirty work

Start time: 2800.76
End time: 2813.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

She's going to her house  It will be three days before the air tag starts beeping if she does not have an iphone with 14.5 on it  She'll have no idea. It's there  This is a good article to read she was able to use the air tag to track her roommates down to the address  Her roommates thought I was kind of creepy. She would text them and say are you at 118 with dougal streak?  And they'd say that's creepy as  You know what?  Are you at jeans right now? Oh my god stalker  I thought this was I mean, it's not it's not scientific but  Apple has not been clear about what the period of time is for instance before it starts beeping  in theory if you go to a regularly visited place your home would be the primary one, but like  Like your work the the air tag will disable but that's only again if you have ios 14.5 on a  on a late model iphone and so  Yeah, don't use this to stalk anybody who has a late model iphone. I guess and keeps it up to date  But there's still there's some there's some real issues with this. I think

Start time: 2888.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't want to I don't  I don't want to sound apple fangirl and and and but i'm going to defend them just a little bit here. I think  My interpretive that my interpretation of this is it's always different  When you have something tested internally at apple versus releasing it to the mass public  And seeing how they handle this to me. The real question isn't  Does this work today? It's is it apple interested?  in creating an architecture that will  You know, uh help minimize this obvious problem  And I think that answer is yes  So the things we're talking about here can all be updated for you know future update to air tags into ios  They can fix it for sure. They can fix this. I also think it's just worth saying  You know, we can master blast apple for this and it's fair  But if you want to talk about real stalker where  I urge you to look at some of the infosec dangers that are possible on android in in in regards to stalking  And we're talking listening to everything you do  recording every single site you visit  broadcasting or your location  And this by rooting the phone very very easily like there are companies that specialize in this  So i'm not saying the danger isn't there i'm saying I personally have faith that apple is going to address it  Maybe you're more cynical than I am, but that's my take

Start time: 2980.44
End time: 3016.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, i'm sure they will be but only if they get pressure so we're giving them pressure  Thank god for journalism apple clearly  Thought about it. They were aware of this they even mentioned in the in the event and in their press releases  You know, here's what we're doing to prevent this been used by stalkers  It's just important that people raise this issue  And I think this article on mashable by brenda stolyar is very good  At raising some real critical issues and people should be aware of this  I guess one solution is for everybody to buy an iphone apple wouldn't mind that solution  But another solution might be for apple to make some some changes to how this works

Start time: 3016.78

Start time: 3025.96
End time: 3057.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so  You can actually disable it even with an android device if you find it  So it it has nfc in it and you can scan it  And it'll say this this tracker belongs to this person and you can disable it at that point  But you have to find it and if it's you know, and brenda makes an excellent point  I mean every smartphone is potentially the worst tracker in the world. It has a microphone camera and gps  and there are ways to make any smartphone be  dangerous to you so  This is a general battery in a phone

Start time: 3058.62
End time: 3073.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The battery in a phone would die after a you know  A couple of days if you're running gps and everything on it was this the battery in an airtag  I think can last about a year. Yeah, which is um  Yeah, I mean, I it's I think I think it could be problematic much as I don't want it to be and I hope it isn't

Start time: 3074.12
End time: 3093.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, it's something to be aware of that's all I you know, and I think apple needs to respond to these  I think reasonable criticisms  Somebody by the way is pointing out somebody's in the in the rsc says, you know, you can't disable it you hit it with a hammer  Or you can you can actually remove the battery so it's if you can find it you can disable it that's not hard to do

Transcript:  Yeah, they have replaceable batteries now, but I think now the perception  That you throw away the tile when it runs out of juice is still with a lot of people  I mean, maybe they made some steps wrong, but boy  I don't think anybody ever wants to compete with apple  That's just a bad place to be, you know, maybe google will in fact, it's interesting google  Uh i.o is coming up in a couple of weeks may 18th  Sundar pichai and then we'll talk about google in the next segment but sooner but shy but this little t's sundar pichai in the  quarterly analyst call  Basically said yeah, we kind of took it easy  Last year and the cadence product cadence is going to step up and we're going to have something very big to announce  Uh at at google i.o  And I wonder if they're going to move the pixel six announcement up normally they do that in the fall  And we know that google is going to design its own chips this time  And so the pixel which really the pixel five was kind of like, uh  Uh, in fact so much so that I didn't even I still stuck with my pixel four and you know me  I always get the whatever the latest is  Um, I think this could be very interesting and that's only a couple of weeks off. So  I want to see I want to see a vital engaged google. I don't like the google of 2020 the sleepy google  The sleepy google that that wasn't good. We will talk about google's quarterly results and amazon's profits and  a whole lot more  including  A google privacy robot in their offices  But first a word as long as we're talking about privacy from express vpn. Have you ever browsed in incognito mode?  It's not as incognito as you might think in fact, there's a five billion dollar class action lawsuit against the company right now  Because a user said, you know, I went in incognito mode little did I know google's still collecting user data  Google's made its fortune by tracking your movements online  Uh google says well incognito doesn't mean invisible and they do have an announcement. I guess when you go in there  But really you should know  That even if you're using private browsing and safari or you know, any of these so-called incognito modes  Your isp can still see everywhere you go when you search on google google knows you're there  How do you actually make yourself invisible as possible online express?  Vpn that's our sponsor for this segment  We're big fans even in incognito mode your online activity gets tracked data brokers to still buy and sell your information  Data harvesters can use your ip address to uniquely identify you and your location with express vpn  Your connection gets rerouted through an encrypted server  Your ip address is masked you're given a random ip address  That is shared by many many other express vpn customers  So it's a lot harder for third parties to identify you and harvest your data  The best part is how easy it is to use express vpn no matter what device you're using phone laptop or smart tv one button  Gives you protection sometimes i'll turn it on and forget leave it on for weeks  And finally go. Oh, but why not leave it on if it's that fast  So if you really want to go incognito  And protect your privacy and secure yourself with the number one rated vpn visit express vpn.com  Twit you'll get three extra months with a one-year package  And you'll be helping twit out by just going to that website  Express vpn.com  Twit  Get three extra months free with a one-year package  It's the only vpn I use because it really it no logging it respects your privacy  It's also very secure express vpn.com  slash twit.

They don't build plants  They really only help shareholders and employees  So maybe that's what you're saying is it'd be nice if they put some plowed some of that into something that would help the economy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm still incredibly skeptical. But uh, you know all signs are pointing that they really really really want to make some money  Yeah, yeah, it just seems like  Like, you know, there was a whole  Apple tv thing, you know  The actual apple television thing where again all the signs were pointing to they're going to do it and then ultimately they kind of  Scrapped it last minute. It seems like they're just so much more motivated to make this happen one way or another  So yeah, I think we're going to see something. I still don't know exactly what it's going to be or  If they're going to actually try to manufacture car or partner with somebody like magdon to make it happen  But for sure it's going to take uh take a lot of money to make it happen  And if you're going to do it, North Carolina would be a pretty good place to do a lot of engineering  There's a lot of amazing engineering talent in the motorsport space around there.

Transcript:  uh actually  In response to the chip shortage  I think you're seeing some big commitments from a lot of companies including tsmc the taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company, which makes all of apple's chips  They're going to spend tens of billions of dollars on chip fabs in arizona  Intel has announced they're going to do the same thing a lot of response to the chip shortage  But the problem is it takes years to put these online and those chip shortages. I just samma balsamit our our car guy  Just told me tim that uh ford's  Saying now they're only going to be able to make half as many cars as the demand  Uh this year

Start time: 3863.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really amazing  So many manufacturers have spent so much time over the past five years putting putting chips into everything from suspension to of course  infotainment and and smart climate control systems and and you know a lot of that stuff was  Not very well integrated. So your average car has you know, half a dozen or more different bit silicon in there  And so if any of those is affected by the the numerous shortages going on around the world right now  Then suddenly you have a big problem and four definitely does and just about every manufacturer on the planet right now does too  So it's you know, like you said, there's no easy solution here because it does take so long to spin up a new fab  A lot of companies are now making investments in doing their own chip research  Just like apple, of course  But again, it's going to take years before anybody can really make any massive headway on that front  So we could be seeing the ramifications going for quite a long time on this  Which is one of the reasons why we're seeing used car sales  You know go through the roof and used car valuations are going through the roof right now  Not quite as much as you know dogecoin  But for sure I have a lot of friends who bought a car two years ago who are  Going on to pick any random online used car market and getting cash offers for more than they bought their cars for which is

End time: 4098.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  stand back to to compare those two because their their business models are the same from a consumer standpoint, but also  Wildly different from a you know how they make the sausage perspective  You know youtube kind of sits back and lets all the content roll in more certainly they do have you know first party productions  But by and large it's  His you know let everybody else shovel the coal in the furnace for them  Whereas netflix is going out and investing millions of dollars into original productions around the world  Uh, it would sound so much harder than what youtube has to do to but yet they're making  You know pretty soon they'll be making the same amount of revenue and that that to me is pretty fascinating

Transcript:  Absolutely netflix is going to spend 17 billion  To make new content. That's the driver for netflix's success youtube just says hey y'all make some videos  And we'll and we'll figure out which ones are the best with our algorithm and then we'll put some ads on them. Cool  That is modern. That's what tiktok's doing. That's the modern way of doing things. That's the  Netflix is the old hollywood model, which is you throw a lot of money in production  You make money in a handful of successes  I think quibi proved that was not the the way to do it in the digital era  YouTube is clearly the way to do it going forward

Start time: 4165.10
End time: 4188.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because youtube isn't telling him and they're not saying yeah  We sold the the ad for 50 dollars and we're going to give you 25. They don't say that they just say here's 25 bucks  Enjoy it kid  Thank you very much  So I don't know if it's 50 50. It's certainly  Look at if it's 50 50. That's a lot more than 30 take that apple takes out of the app store  50 percent that wouldn't be surprised do we know does anybody know

Start time: 4189.56
End time: 4207.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you do get a pretty good insight into what exactly it is  But I I can say the rates are are very low  Um, you know compared to what we can get in house through our own distribution. Oh, yeah, you might know for your yes  So yeah for sure. I I I don't know if I can or should but we certainly do have a pretty good insight  Yeah, i'd say it does make apple look pretty generous

Transcript:  So here's a jason jason howell has looked it up on investopedia  And uh, this is what they say  There's a 45 55 split for all content creators google keeps 45 percent  And you get the remaining 55 percent  Uh, let me see though where they get that information because I feel like google is a little cagey  If you are a major content producer

Start time: 4234.82
End time: 4252.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have their partnerships and things like that and it is possible to integrate ad sales as well  So you could bring basically kind of bring your own pre-roll in some situations as well  Yeah, which changes the math to some degree as well, but for sure it is  You have to be generating a lot of used kind of makeup for for the overhead. Yeah

Start time: 4254.50
End time: 4268.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so they're that you know if apple wants to defend it's 30 percent all they have to do is say well look what microsoft char  Sony charges in their stores  Look what youtube charges in effect by taking 45 percent of the ads 30 percent. That's not so bad

Did you this by the way?  This is a new york time sunday time story, but you shouldn't read it in the paper  Because the article online has all these hysterical  I guess they're animated gifs  So google knows people are coming back, but they're redesigning  How their campuses are going to work?  Keep showing this because there's some fun stuff in different ways for instance  When you go back you might be in a new team pod  Where your team gets together in a blank canvas?  There are chairs desks whiteboards and storage units, but everything's on casters. So you arrange it as you wish  There are also these  Meeting room concepts. Here's one called campfire camera in the middle  Some employees are still remote so they're on avatars kind of like we do twit some people are in student  We should do twit like this.

Transcript:  I think there are definitely some interesting concepts here other than the incredibly slow inflatable wall  but  I mean, I think it's a little bit unfortunate for me to see so many companies making these major investments trying to make their  Offices this kind of hybrid work environment work when so many people just want to stay home, you know  Let them stay home. Yeah  There are all these huge investments being made to develop these systems that ultimately  I don't think a lot of employees want I think if these companies would just spend a little bit of money to let people  Get a nice office chair at home if they would pay for them to upgrade to the gigabit  Ethernet at home  Then these people would be much happier just to stay there companies can save so much money on real estate  Their employees would be happy there's study after study shows that people who get to work from home are more productive  They're more happy. They're much more likely to stay at their current jobs  Um, so why do these companies keep trying to make this work? Yeah, there's that problem, too  Um, so it seems like a simple solution and they're instead of coming up with all these incredibly complicated

I have huge respect for them  And we don't really know what happened. We know what casey newton said it happened based on interviews and employees  uh to his credit jason  uh  Did say if you don't like the new policies  We will offer you a generous severance package. So that's probably why 15  Employees took advantage actually, it's 18 now 18 people have tweeted that they're going to leave  Might have to do more with the severance pay than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, so this to be clear  So, yeah, so these are names people signed up for base camp with probably mostly joe phony joke names casey compared them  to you know when bark calls mow the bartender and says can I speak to uh, uh, hug and hold  Yeah, mr. Butts, uh, mr. Butts see more buts  Seymour buts is a call for you and ha ha ha. It's an old prank thing. He compared it to the seymour buts and amanda hug and hold  Right, but I don't I think that the fact that no one will say what these names were I think they're probably racist

Transcript:  They're sexist. They're probably awful, right? Yeah, probably it's probably making fun of it  but my my guess here is you know david and  You know, they're both people who?  I respect them professionally, but let's be honest. They they have a little bit of ego  In the way that they conduct themselves, uh in their in their professional roles, right?  and  Like you know david particularly we had in my show basically picking a giant public fight with apple which you know  We supported with hey, you remember that yeah  Yeah, and so I suspect this isn't just about a list or shutting down politics at work  I I my feeling that I get if you really read into some of these tweets is it's about a wider  Company feeling that they didn't feel heard by their founders  Um, you know, particularly the diversity committee that they had started a lot of people on that committee said that they didn't feel  They had a voice where they could make an impact on the company  So I I think this is just frankly about a lot more than it must be politics

Start time: 6155.90
End time: 6230.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it must be you know, I was reading the  letter that uh  They sent out the blog post that they sent out and honestly I could see myself writing this to to be honest  I'll give you the quote  One of the quotes today's social and political waters are especially choppy  Sensitivities are at 11 and every discussion remotely related to politics advocacy or society at large quickly spins away from pleasant  You shouldn't have to wonder staying out of it means you're complicit or wading into it means you're a target  These are difficult enough waters to navigate in life, but significantly more so at work. It's become too much  It's a major distraction. It saps our energy and redirects our dialogue towards dark places  It's not healthy. It hasn't served us well and we're done with it on our company base camp account where the work  Happens people can take the conversations with willing co-workers to signal whatsapp or even a personal base camp account  But it can't happen where the work happens anymore. I can see writing that  Yeah, uh, I understand that those conversations can become very problematic, uh toxic difficult  Uncomfortable and people are trying to get work done so I could see saying that I think there's a hard

Start time: 6231.14
End time: 6296.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  discussion to to be had about  How can I put this so people don't yell at me there?  There is a difficult conversation to be had about toxic activism  And you know, I personally see this a lot online and  The way I can square it in my twitter presence sometimes is when someone's screaming at you  I think it really comes down to them telling you I matter  I hurt i'm not being heard  This is important that I understand  Yeah, but I also think it's true. It comes out in some ways that especially in the workplace like I run a political pack  We make political ads. I very deliberately don't ask people who they vote for  You know, we we try to keep it much more about the product versus what we ourselves think  Right. So I I do think there's a discussion to be had here about how we go about it  I suspect that this company base camp just wasn't one where the companies felt like they could have a productive

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And me being the cynic  Might think it's point two in the blog post  Where he says for years we've offered a fitness benefit a wellness allowance of farmers market share and continuing education allowances  They felt good at the time. We've had a change of heart. It's none of our business what you do outside of work  It's not base camp's plan to encourage certain behaviors regardless of good intention. Basically they ended those benefits  Uh now they're going to give them cash instead which you know is fair  I think it sounds like a good workplace to be honest with you  I really I feel like there's more to the story than we saw in the casey newton  Article, they also eliminated committees not bad  No more 360 reviews those are horrible  And it's good to get rid of those that's peer feedback. That's where people shoot at each other anonymously not good  so  You know, I think jason and david are thoughtful  But as I think the hey.com thing was a good example of david  You know kind of being a little uh abrasive  In in in maybe somewhat inappropriately. He also remember he was the guy who tweeted  My apple card gave me a much higher credit limit than my wife  Even though we have the same we should have the same credit  It's you know, it's unfair apple actually had a big investigation ftc had a big investigation. They cleared goldman sachs  Just recently on that so they're these guys are  They they're  Big people big personalities and when you work at 37 signals or base camp you're really working  Just as you would be a twit inside the sphere of their personality and maybe it grates a little bit. I I understand

Transcript:  It definitely reeks of of hubris and an ego to me as well  Like brianna said and I feel like that is really contradictory to what you need to have good management  And and this whole thing just reeks of you know hr disaster of them really not having the structure in the framework the support system in place to  Ensure that employees feel like their voices are being heard  You know if you're having to shut down a portion of discussion sure I can definitely see  Why you might feel the need to do so but to do it in such a heavy-handed way and  To do it in a public way like this whereas, you know, presumably maybe there were some individuals who were  You know more outspoken than others who were causing issues  You know these are situations that should be taken care of in a one-on-one a direct way  Rather than just you know dropping the ban hammer on basically the entire company and thinking that's going to go down  Well, and obviously it didn't but yeah, it just reeks of of poor management skills to me. It's the ban hammer

Transcript:  Yeah, you carjacked it our show today brought to you by  Mint mobile I got my iphone se from mint mobile plugged in that mint mobile sim and now i'm wondering why do I go anywhere else?  And I have to say when I first heard about memmobile. I thought really 15 dollars a month  after years of fine print contracts getting ripped off by  the big wireless providers  We've learned at least one thing there's always a catch  So when I heard that memmobile offers a premium wireless service for 15 bucks a month, I thought wait, what's the catch?  But after speaking with them and most importantly after using their service it all made sense. In fact, I said wait a minute  They've got a 30 dollar a month unlimited plan  This is incredible mint mobile's secret sauce is they're the first company to sell wireless service online only no stores  No crazy overhead the savings get passed down to you and for and and that is huge sweet savings  It's just you know, they're these guys they cut costs like crazy what they don't cut is service premium  Wireless service all the plans come with unlimited talk and text plus high speed data delivered on the nation's largest  5g network  It's t-mobile. Don't tell them. I told you it's t-mobile. They're an mvno  So what they're doing what you're doing is instead of paying by the way for the exact same service  I pay t-mobile three times more  For the exact same service so instead of doing that why not they'll send you the sim  They don't even charge you for that  I just think it's fantastic  This is a great company offering a great deal. You can use your own phone  You could port your phone number over just like that. It's very easy. So you'll keep your same phone number  You'll keep your same contacts, but you'll get a great phone. They also sell phones  That's where I got the iphone se that was 15 bucks a month 15 bucks a month in service  So for 30 bucks a month I get a new phone and great service. I mean this is incredible  Incredible if you're not 100 satisfied mint mobile has you covered with their seven-day money back guarantee. I like it so much  The service was so good switch now to mint mobile to get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month and  Get the plan shipped to you for free go to mint mobile.com slash twit. That's mint mobile.com slash twit  Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month mint mobile.com slash twit. That's all you have to know mint mobile is  Great. I stand behind it  Uh  The oh gosh, I we there's so many stories. Let's move uh move quickly as long as we're talking about cars

They call it ultium charge 360  This is one of the issues of course anybody who buys an electric car that's not tesla is concerned  Well, where am I going to charge it when i'm away from home tesla's got the supercharger network, but now  Thanks to electrify america  Uh and all the charge point there's a lot of them ev go  gm says we're going to solve this by by  Allowing you to use any of these fast charging  Systems, I think that's a good idea

Uh, and that's really what gm is doing  Porsche is also doing this as well and the goal is ultimately to to to  Standardize things enough that you can really just plug your car in and then all your credentials will be stored on your car

It's me. It's leo  The it worked perfectly the machine said oh great. You don't have to enter anything.

Maybe i'm misremembering it but it was asking why uh, I believe it was 20 percent  Of people that buy an electric vehicle eventually go back to a gas engine. What now interestingly  It's it's not tesla people  Yeah, it is people that buy like the nissan leaf or you know some of the the earlier like ford uh versions compliance cars  Right and and the number one reason was uh charging it was a hassle  Particularly if you live in an apartment complex or something like that. It's not the technology  It's the infrastructure and that's understandable actually, of course  Yeah, porsche before they brought out the taikon they announced a massive investment if I remember correctly  It was close to a billion dollars  Uh in in charging infrastructure through the united states  So I I think that I mean all of us here we take this problem seriously and I I think that  You know getting that infrastructure right is just absolutely going to be key

Transcript:  What's fascinating to me is how much of that is a psychological game?  You know most people who charge it won't really need to use supercharger ever  maybe they'll use it once or twice a year and so  the the  Revenue model on charging stations is kind of questionable because most people really again won't need them  But they need to exist for people to feel comfortable enough to go in  It's like and that's that's really a huge challenge  That's one of the reasons why it's so important that volkswagens have been pouring so much money into  Electroamerica unwillingly but they've been doing it at least to establish that network to make it easier and to make people feel more  Comfortable about using those those charges we have

Hey speaking of elon and space x and used cars. I'm going to tie this all together  SpaceX made its first nighttime splash down. It was beautiful. Let me see if I can rewind this  Video because it was it was incredible  Look at that middle of the night  Panama city 3 a.m. In florida  Crew dragon and and the uv light on those parachutes. You're right john. That's gorgeous  SpaceX first nighttime splashdown with astronauts since 1968  This is from nasa tv, but this is a used capsule  And this is one of the things musk has done. I I actually was asking our space guy rod pile who's with the  Space society  Is it really a savings and he said, you know  There's maybe look he's happy. He's happy to be back  Doing a little happy dance as he gets out of the capsule. That's really awesome  Reusing does save a considerable amount of money  And it's also just seems more environmentally friendly not to just get rid of these capsules  So that that dragon capsule had been used once before the crew dragon  And refurbished they cleaned out the ashtrays. I think they they hosed down the upholstery, you know, so it's practically new  It's fresh. It's clean

It says  Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. Of course, this is a state. There's also interstate commerce because  Twitter and youtube and facebook aren't in florida  Anyway, uh, they could be fined for banning political candidates  It's uh, it's expected to be signed it's passed the florida, uh legislature and  I'm sure ron de santis will uh, will sign it

Uh, I don't particularly like the boston globe  I had to work with them when I was running for office and  you know, um, uh  It's just ridiculous the government trying to tell a private company who they have to facilitate and who they don't it's just absolutely ridiculous

Yeah  um, let's see  I'm trying to i'm trying to cherry pick the good stuff. I feel bad for volkswagen. This is a roadshow story  Volkswagen did their april fools joke just a little bit early announcing that volkswagen america was going to be rebranded as volt  volt volkswagen america  Apparently the sec is now investigating  Come on  Come on  Uh  Well on what grounds?

Transcript:  This was bad  basically that um  Well, of course that there was an impact to the stock price based on this release  And so therefore the company went up based on fake news. Yeah  The reason that I think you should not feel bad for volkswagen is because they really sold this  You know, i've been covering tech journalism for a long time now. I've  Survived many an april fools day. I've never seen a company do  They said volkswagen did it was not a joke to make this see believable. Yeah  Yeah, absolutely  Every time in in the history of my doing tech and automotive journalism if I ever had a doubt that a story was was real  Or not I would get on the phone with uh with a representative and say hey seriously and they'd say, you know, of course not  It's april fools. This is a joke  On the record off the record we were told up and down  This is absolutely legit in the way that they structured in time the releases to go out it actually  This release accidentally leaked quote-unquote leaked the same time as another embargoed press release that was supposed to go out  They did everything to perfection to make this look like an actual story  And it's more up and down than it was true. Uh, so I we we we bought it  I feel terrible that we did we report on this as fact as did most other major journalistic outlets in the world  and yeah, there was a  Tangible increase in the valuation of volkswagen for the day that actually persisted  Uh long after the the the reports came out that this was indeed fake  So that's why the sec is involved  I'm very curious to see what the reaction is going to be to this because uh, yeah  I'm frankly you can probably tell i'm still pretty mad about the way that this shut down you were burned  Exactly, we were burned  And that's the first time that i've ever been burned like this and I hope that it never happens again

This is fun. This is entertaining  You're volkswagen who's still really you know  Walking around with a black eye thanks to dieselgate and everything else around there is now joking about you know taking emissions cutting very seriously  Um, I don't know what they thought was going to come from this but certainly uh, a lot of negative is coming for it  And I hope they're more continuous too

They have a really  Promising future ahead of them here and it's just it's I mean, it's not just like the stock risk that they're doing  It's so counterproductive to burn relationships with people like you because I bet when that technology does filter down  Tim I mean you're not going to be taking that phone call as fast as maybe you were a year ago

Transcript:  You know  And in a day and age where you see people on facebook and twitter resharing onion articles as real  There's a real hazard  To this people don't necessarily have a sense of humor or any sense of any judgment about whether this is ridiculous  Like this story, I think this is ridiculous. You've all seen this picture the the famous meme they call it disaster girl  Uh, she was a four-year-old girl her  The truth behind the story is actually it looks like she's looking at her house burning down and giving you kind of an evil side glance like  See what I did in fact  The the girl in this picture zoe roth and her father dave roth  Went over to watch a house being burnt down. This was actually a fire department controlled burn on purpose  He took this picture in 2005 of course immediately went viral  It is now an nft  A non-fungible token. I thought we were done with nfts to be honest with you  But a disaster girl decided to sell her meme. She's now 21  She got half a million dollars  uh  You don't own the picture. I mean, I guess you technically do  Uh, they will get 10 of resale value, which is nice  They maintain copyright, which is nice  They haven't really given anybody anything.

Start time: 7852.32
End time: 7928.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but in all seriousness my I think the problem that I have with nft like we all agree is terrible for the environment  The problem I have with is that the underlying architecture of the protocol with it doesn't make sense a lot of the people  selling nft  The way that it's coded is is basically just pointing to a url  Well, what happens if that url for that video disappears?  You can do it in such a way that it's more than you could use ipfs or something like that  Exactly  But it's it's not the reality of how many of these are being sold  So, um, I think there need to be standards for this and frankly none of it's worth  Anything until there's some sort of you know legal  Copyright that the owners hold that is, you know validated by the courts. So  I'm very skeptical that these are going to have value in the future, but I also think it's true that you know because of the  You know the income inequality, you know  There are a lot of people that have assets around and they're like where do I put this?  Where it could possibly make money and it's it's like just a high risk bet for some people  Will it pay off? I don't think so, but maybe it will yeah

Transcript:  Yeah, what is it taylor that makes those machines? Yep. Yep  And uh, and the things are so hideously complex that they're almost always broken  So much so that somebody wrote a bot to try to order a mcflurry at every mcdonald's  In the country and then it's an updated live updated map of which mcflurry machines are down  But then uh another another couple created a raspberry pie  Device that would make these things much more reliable. They were trying to do a frozen yogurt bot  and and taylor like  Completely came down on it. They hired a pi they  I mean they it's a fascinating story

Start time: 8637.46
End time: 8688.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's a good episode to listen to the reason it qualified for scam town  You know is the fact that they deliberately make the ui so  Uh unreadable by the people that work at mcdonald's that they end up having to fall back on  Basically bringing in the text from taylor which are very very expensive  and you know, it's it's actually the revenue from their uh maintenance part of their company is  25% of their bottom line. So there's kind of this  alliance between mcdonald's where they're like  You can only use this one machine if you want to be a franchise owner  And then you know the company that makes the machine has a financial interest in having it basically always broken  So don't get angry at mcdonald's if you can't get your oreo mcflurry like get angry at taylor
