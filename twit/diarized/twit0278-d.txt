Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it.  No, no, it's very appropriate, frankly, for this show.  For a bunch of yanks.  Yeah.  Thank you for being here.  I haven't seen you in ages.  I appreciate you showing up in the middle of the night.  You know, I also haven't seen you in ages, although she was here I think on Wednesday  and I missed her in studio because I was in France.

Start time: 195.16
End time: 205.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm thankful I did not find that.  You should be able to smell it by now.  Also here from searchengineland.com, Danny Sullivan.  Great to have you, Danny, in a very appropriate time because there's been a lot of Google stuff.

Start time: 206.91
End time: 213.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's been a lot going on.  The packages, new phones, new computers, all sorts of things happening.  It's kind of hard to keep track of it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you for joining us.  And finally, last but not least, well, maybe least.  Least.  Very much least.  John C. Dvorak from channeldvorak.com and his little purple friend, Barney.

Transcript:  Barney.  That was a good one.  Now we're off the right foot.  We're off on some foot.  That's not a foot.

Start time: 238.84
End time: 252.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Look what I got.  Look what I have here.  It's the black helicopter of laptops.  No insignia.  In fact, I'm surprised you didn't talk about this on No Agenda, John.  This is an absolute stealth laptop.  I bet it doesn't even show up on radar.  Look at that.

Start time: 252.96
End time: 255.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, when you lift it open, there's nothing inside either.

Start time: 256.35
End time: 276.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really hard to type on.  The only thing inside is a browser.  This is the new...  Oh dear.  Oh, I'm opening the wrong side.  So you can't tell where you open it.  This is the Google CR-48, which is their kind of demo hardware.  I'm sure you have one as well, Danny.  In fact, everybody on the panel probably has one.

Start time: 277.20
End time: 277.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't.

Start time: 279.48
End time: 280.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We like to do that to John.

Start time: 280.64
End time: 282.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a little sticker on mine.  They handed them out.

Start time: 282.75
End time: 286.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's your sticker?  What are you talking about, John?  I've got three.  Well, send me one.

Start time: 286.52
End time: 288.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Danny has a sticker.  Oh, that's pretty.

Start time: 288.62
End time: 291.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like that.  Yeah.  They had to do something, I guess.

Start time: 291.50
End time: 293.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When it launched, they were handing out skins and such.

Start time: 296.68
End time: 313.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the deal on this is this is not a product, but this is a preview of what will eventually  be...  I guess Samsung might be the first to make an actual notebook based on Google Chrome.  So this is the first...  Is it a hardware...  Danny, would you even call it a hardware reference platform?  What is this?

Start time: 314.32
End time: 356.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it's just...  I don't know.  A hardware reference, I suppose.  Super alpha test platform.  I mean, when I got mine, I didn't spend a whole lot of time trying to look through the look  and feel of it or anything like that.  It just really seemed like a box for them to house the software in that they really wanted  people to look at the most.  The final product is going to be different depending on which of the makers.  It's kind of like saying, here's this computer from Google, the Chrome notebook OS or whatever,  and that's what you're going to get versus having come out with, say, an Android prototype  two years ago and now look at all the different Android phones that you have in all sorts  of shapes and sizes.

Start time: 356.14
End time: 358.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is almost like the G1 then or something like that.

Start time: 358.56
End time: 361.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very much like the G1, but although without even any of that kind of branding.

Start time: 362.32
End time: 390.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No branding at all.  It doesn't even say Google anywhere on it.  So the weird thing about this, and I have to say I cannot get my head wrapped around  it is, now under the hood there's an Intel processor.  I know because there was a card in here that says, hey, there's an Intel processor.  Like Intel must have done a deal.  Two gigs of RAM.  There's not a lot of RAM.  There's a solid state drive.  I don't even know how big it is.  You don't get to know because there's no optical drives because the whole point of this is  you don't need storage.  This is just a gateway to the cloud, right?

Start time: 391.94
End time: 402.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  When I was testing it out, I was getting very confused trying to figure out where I was  making screenshots, where they were being stored at, where my downloads were going.

Start time: 402.16
End time: 403.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You were actually able to do screenshots?

Start time: 404.41
End time: 444.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  It's like Control N or something like that.  I did the article up on search engine.  There are all these alternatives that you can use on the keyboard, but when you do do  a screenshot, you don't get any feedback that you've actually made it.  And I talked with them afterwards and I was like, well, it's kind of hard.  You're trying to figure out where all your local files are and you don't seem to have  a file explorer.  You don't seem to have a finder.  And they're like, yeah, we don't.  If you want to explore your files, you're going to do that when you're using some program  that needs to find a file, say WordPress, when you're uploading.  So there is local storage then?  There is there, but they really kind of view it as this is just sort of a temporary shelf  was the way they put it.  We want you to put your files there just temporarily and then push them off to the cloud.

Start time: 444.80
End time: 449.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in order to find that screenshot you took, you'd have to email it or upload it somewhere?

Start time: 450.16
End time: 467.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Or, you know, I think it was control would bring up a little tiny tab and then you could  see any downloaded files that you would have that were out there.  But they they really don't intend for you to be doing a lot of local storage on here  or trying to do file management.  They just don't really want you to think about it.  Just throw it out there into the cloud.

Start time: 468.06
End time: 499.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I have to say I'm playing with this and and I it's basically Chrome.  The browser is the interface.  It's the it's everything.  It's Chrome, the browser.  There's nothing behind it.  There's not even a desktop.  The browser.  And and I had I put this next to my MacBook Air, which has exactly the same browser.  In fact, I've got it synchronizing.  So it even has exactly the browser apps.  If I buy it on one, it synchronizes to all.  And I'm thinking, well, I get exactly that.  Plus, I get a whole operating system and applications in it.  I mean, why would anybody why would anybody want that?

Start time: 500.60
End time: 506.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get everything the MacBook Air has and less.  Yeah, it's like, oh, you just wanted a browser.

Start time: 506.52
End time: 509.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No problem.  With just one, it was like it.

Start time: 511.32
End time: 535.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I asked them that as well after I went through the review and I, you know,  I was kind of underwhelmed.  And they said the main thing that they suggest that you're going to get that's more of is  you're never going to have to supposedly think about upgrading the software.  Right. It's going to operate for you.  It's all going to be synchronizing.  It's all going to be working.  And, you know, potentially you're going to be even more.  Maybe it's really cheap.  We're protected.  Is that the other right?

Start time: 536.34
End time: 548.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everything that you're saying, Danny, it sounds like it's kind of designed for the cloud  and all those kind of things.  Is it going to be priced more like a netbook or like a subnetbook?  Because even netbooks can run Windows 7.  And for one hundred ninety nine bucks, that thing will be worth every penny.

Start time: 548.60
End time: 550.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's it. Two hundred bucks max.

Start time: 550.96
End time: 554.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if it's if it's that little, if it's really cheap.  Sure. Yeah.

Start time: 555.42
End time: 578.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't think this even this this platform, first of all, it's too big and heavy.  But but I don't see how this could be even to ninety two hundred bucks.  I mean, it's going to cost more than that.  No, it can't.  Well, it can't because I don't know why you'd buy it, because for for three hundred bucks,  you can get a netbook that has an operating system for if you want something really light  and beautiful and thin, you can get a MacBook for a thousand bucks.  And so I just don't know who the audience is for this.

Start time: 578.38
End time: 580.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I don't know that could bring it directly.

Start time: 580.80
End time: 581.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, Kelly.

Start time: 582.26
End time: 591.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it does seem to be going just the total opposite way of everything else.  I mean, so many people are into apps these days.  Then, well, there's apps driving a lot of.

Start time: 592.36
End time: 597.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, I mean, they have a Google app.  So, yeah, they're HTML five.

Start time: 597.68
End time: 599.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What? Right. Right.

Start time: 599.64
End time: 602.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they have dangerous crows wherever that game is.

Start time: 602.48
End time: 607.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dangerous crows. Say that again.  Dangerous crows.  Is that did you actually say that?

Start time: 607.82
End time: 614.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dangerous crows, flapping sparrows.  I'm not sure what that what is that?  Angry birds mean.

Start time: 614.26
End time: 616.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. You you you must have played it, John.

Start time: 617.46
End time: 620.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I'm completely out of the loop on everything.

Start time: 620.86
End time: 654.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is I know I come on the show anymore.  I don't either. This is so.  This is we've heard that, Leo.  We already know.  We have no idea what we're doing with you.  This is now this is actually a MacBook running Chrome.  And what's interesting is the Chrome browser does sync.  You log into your Chrome account.  So when I buy an app in the in the Web Store, and this is another thing,  Google announced a bunch of stuff this week, including you can see here.  Google Books.  There's a bunch of apps.  Some of them are free. Most of them are free, but some of them are a buck or two.  But but an app is really just a website.  So I'm I think that's stank.

Start time: 655.66
End time: 690.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the challenge that they face with this is that,  I mean, if you go back, it's not even that you have to compare it to a netbook.  You can compare it to any laptop computer and you can get good laptop computers,  full full blown computers for what?  450 in that price range.  And this is going to give you if you bought one of those and you're running Chrome,  you have everything that the Chrome notebook is going to be giving you.  And it's still less, except that, you know, in a year or two,  you may have to upgrade the operating system.  I don't know that that's going to be that compelling at that price.  But it's very similar.  We're like going to come out.

Start time: 691.18
End time: 700.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's criminal. It's going to come out separately  so that you can put it on a laptop or will it only come down with, you know,  I was I was at the web and Mike Harrington asked Marissa Meyer

Start time: 701.98
End time: 717.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  point blank, she said, are you going to make this so that I can install it  on a MacBook Air?  And she said, well, that's something we'd like to do.  It's not, you know, something we're announcing,  but it's something we'd like to be able to do.  I don't know why you do that.  Why? You got a better question

Start time: 717.76
End time: 736.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that should have been asked by Mike Harrington point blank.  What was that?  Which is can I take that machine that you're holding there  that I paid 200 bucks for, let's say, and put a nice Linux operating system  on it, download it, is it got any kind of way of doing that?  Well, can I pull out that hard disk and stick it someplace else  and then put Linux on there, shove it back in that machine  and have a real computer?

Start time: 737.18
End time: 738.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of aggressive, John.

Start time: 739.20
End time: 766.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just a little bit underneath the battery is a underneath the battery  is a flip that you can you can throw onto it  and you're supposed to be able to root it and do what you want.  Really? And I suppose, yeah, there's just there's some sort of toggle.  I haven't gotten to it.  But, you know, if you can go through and then figure out a way to get the  whatever the operating system that is running underneath it  to recognize whatever data or files you want to throw in there,  I suppose you could do it.  But why? Exactly.

Start time: 766.64
End time: 778.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you have a real computer for a low price.  That's what I'm guessing.  I don't think that's what's going to happen.  They got to subsidize the thing.  They're going to be giving it away.  They're going to take it like it is those a game machine.  So you take a beating on the on the hardware and sell all the software.  That's what I mean.

Start time: 779.10
End time: 842.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't think that they will.  And I think you can look a real parallel between this and Google TV.  So with Google TV, they're not subsidizing Google TV in any way.  You know, if you want it, you got to go buy it.  You buy it either from Logitech, from Sony and it's pricey.  And it actually if you look at this sort of laptop  and then you compare it to something like the Roku box,  even though something like the Roku is giving you a lot less,  it's working and doing some of the things that like a Google TV can't.  And so here you have a laptop that isn't really giving me.  It's not really giving me a compelling reason to dump my my MacBook  or to dump a Windows machine.  It really is that  I'm not going to be able to save files.  I'm not going to be able to plug in all sorts of drivers.  I if they don't bring it out.  And in particular, this means the hardware manufacturers  can't bring it out for an extremely low price point.  I don't see the point.  And they haven't suggested anything like, oh, and by the way,  we're going to, you know, subsidize it through ads  or any of those sorts of things that they used to talk about,  like they do with the cell phones and that they never did in that case either.

Start time: 843.68
End time: 869.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One thing that is in here that maybe is a little unique, but it but it's much needed.  I mean, John, this has in spades what you've always complained about  with cloud computing, which is it's completely and utterly useless  if you're not connected to the Internet.  You can't do anything.  So it has three G as well as Wi-Fi.  Now, Google, when they hand these out, gives everybody  100 megabytes a month on Verizon free for two years.  Danny, is that going to be is that just for journalists  or is that part of the actual?

Start time: 869.12
End time: 893.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's I mean, that's very unique.  They said anybody who gets one of these notebooks  is going to have some basic connectivity built into it.  And that seemed to apply also to the ones that the actual hardware  manufacturers will put out that they, I guess, have a part of a requirement  or that's the part of the deal that they've managed to cut with them is that  you will be able to have this basic connectivity.  I mean, it's 100 megabytes, so it's not going to last too much.  But there's some pricing plans in there.

Start time: 893.66
End time: 896.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. No, Leo. Yes, John.

Start time: 896.68
End time: 907.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be just I mean, you should have something there  that would be really useful, something I'm looking forward to  getting a hold of one of these days, which is the MacBook Air.  I think that's the machine people should be looking at.

Start time: 908.18
End time: 920.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should probably explain that John has been lobbying for well over two months  for us to give him for reasons I don't understand.  Give him a MacBook Air.  Like I was just like, right.  What are you accusing me of?

Start time: 921.90
End time: 929.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to say, the one thing I'd be slightly jealous of is I love it.  If my MacBook Air had that inbuilt 3G, that would be fantastic.

Start time: 929.60
End time: 931.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That I agree would be nice.

Start time: 931.30
End time: 975.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know what?  I mean, I saw I have a MacBook Air that I take out and I.  So now I have both of these.  In fact, I'll go off on a trip and I'm going to take them both just to play with them.  But I carry a separate my fight card from Verizon.  That works. And I'm already paying $60 a month for this plan.  And there's no way for me with, say, within the Google thing to tell it,  hey, I already have an account.  Just use your, you know, your inbuilt telecoms and tap into my existing account  and my existing phone number, whatever.  I, you know, I I'd have to buy if I want that thing to be standalone  and separate plan at this point, I don't kind of want my stuff built into the notebook.  I'd rather have the separate unit either in my phone or in the my fight card  that I can take around on my iPad or on my, you know, Mac Air or my laptop or whatever I want.  It's more really convenient.

Start time: 976.08
End time: 988.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But see, we're all geeks. We want it to be flexible.  We want geek power and all that stuff.  So I presume that Google intends this for somebody who's not a geek.  But even then, I think they would want more than just a browser.

Start time: 988.28
End time: 1000.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, you know what this what that really reminds me of?  And it's just kind of struck me is it seems more than anything like the O.L.P.C.  It's like underpowered. You can't do anything apart from the Internet.  You're not quite sure why anybody would want it apart from the price.

Start time: 1001.16
End time: 1002.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The O.L.P.C. did more.

Start time: 1006.00
End time: 1008.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1008.92

With your name written all over it.  I'll just slip the card that says it's got an Intel chip in it.  So I think we're agreed that this is an interesting product,  but there doesn't seem to be a no, no, we didn't agree.  It was interesting. Not even an interest.  Oh, I'll tell you something interesting.  You want something interesting? I'll tell you something interesting.  No caps lock key.  Finally, Google says something like now, no, nobody will be typing mean  comments anymore in the in the because they won't have a caps lock key.  You can revert it in the control panel.  But instead of where the caps lock key would be, there's a little magnifying glass.  They say it's a search key, but it's not even a search key.  It just opens a new tab in the browser.

Transcript:  Sorry, I was I was I was leaning forward because I was looking at my keyboard  because I was trying to work out on Windows.  You got the Windows key on Apple.  You've also got the little Apple command key.  Do you have like a little like some kind of Chrome keys or a little G key?

Transcript:  No, you got control. You got alt.  No G spot. No G spot.  That's what she said.  It does have. Now, what it did do a little bit is it changed the function keys.  There are function keys, but they're not function keys anymore.  They're browser keys.  So there's escape, back arrow, forward arrow, refresh, full screen button,  new Windows button, and then the traditional brighter screen and and sound buttons.  But there are no function keys.  You know, it's first of all, this is just not even a hardware reference.  It's got a camera.  You know, Google chat will give you video calls on it.  It probably does a lot.  You know, Intel's got its operating system designed for netbooks.  So does Ubuntu.  There are a lot of simplified systems that do a lot more than this,  that are also free, that would run on inexpensive netbook hardware.  If there is a market for that kind of secure, simple,  automatically updated cloud focused device, there are a lot of choices.  I think this is.  I think it's an interesting idea.  I don't see it going anywhere, to be honest.

And it populates it.  If you've already set up Chrome to sync, it populates it with all your Chrome stuff  and your Google Docs and all that stuff.  You know, I think it's a I see, you know, Pandora's got an app on here.  Evernote's got an app.  Google Reader and Calendar, there's Groove Shark is on here.  I mean, there's there's, you know,  you can functionalize it with everything you would do on the web.  But I don't see. But by the way, when you install those apps,  they also install on every other Chrome browser you've got.  So I don't I just don't I don't get.

Transcript:  You know, I'm reminded of the I mean, you have to go to the meetings  and be in the offices, obviously, when they do this stuff.  But I'm reminded of the years, years back when WordStar  came out with this word processor that was I think was called  easy or something like that.  It was after the window or the word star 2000 debacle.  Then they came out with this thing and there was horrible.  And this this program called easy was like Bob.  It was really bad. Yeah.  But the point but I asked them about who's going to buy this.  And they said, well, we've designed it for people who don't like word processors.  Right. And I said, well, who's going to buy it if they don't like word  processors in the first place? Right.  And I get the sense that this is the same kind of thing they're looking at here.  Well, there's a lot of people that don't like computers,  so they want something really simple.  No, they don't like computers.  They don't want a computer simple or not.  I mean, the fact is, Callie was right when she says that the things  that trends are going in the opposite direction.  I've never seen a piece of software come out that actually gets simpler  every time they bring out an upgrade.  It doesn't make any sense.  This is crazy. This device.

I didn't mean I got off on a tangent.  Yes, you did. I did.  But you know what?  I'm going to go on even farther in a tangent.  You may smoke them if you've got them, as they used to say  when I was in the Navy, because  I'm glad I got a laugh from somebody.  I don't know who it was.  But because I'm going to talk a little bit about one of our fine sponsors.  How about that? The good folks at Citrix who make GoToAssistExpress.  If you have to support people, and I know a lot of people who listen to the show,  whether they want to or not support family and friends,  and many of you are in IT, you support, you know, actual humans,  or perhaps you're in software support, GoToAssistExpress is a great way  to save time and money to make yourself a support superstar.

Well, you could see John wasn't talking about Citrix.  He loves Citrix. We all do.  I started using GoToAssistExpress actually in the screensavers days.  We use it on air to actually fix people's computers.  A lot of times on the radio show, I wish I could use GoToAssistExpress.  It is a really great way.  Let me give you an example of what it's like to use GoToAssistExpress.  I'm on Skype with my mom and she says, I can't, I'm using, I'm sorry, mom,  I know you don't talk like this, but this is so they understand

End time: 1545.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so I said, well, great, no problem. I can fix this.  And I started a GoToAssistSession, gave her the link right there in the Skype chat.  She clicks it, never installed it before in her life.  Thirty seconds later, it's not only installed, but I'm in her computer.  I'm saying, let me move those files here. This is what you do.  She can watch me. She can watch the mouse move. She can chat.  Best of all, once I've installed it, now I have unattended access,  if she allows me, and I can fix her machine any time I can get on and fix her machine.  You can do things like run eight sessions at once.  So if you start installing one machine or a scan, you can move to the next.  The next that really helps. I think GoToAssist users,  this is a study that GoToAssist did. GoToAssist users report an average  40% increase in productivity for these support professionals.  That's like two days a week in improved productivity.  You can see what software is running. It's 128-bit SSL, 24-7 support for you,  which is nice. I want you to try it free. PC or Mac,  go to go to assist dot com slash twit,  go to assist dot com slash twit and try it free for 30 days.  We thank Citrix for their support of go to assist. So let's see who's fallen off.  It looks like John C. Dvorak is hidden behind a piece of paper.  Hey, I'm right. I'm right.  Callie Lewis is just hung up. So there you go.  She said, I don't blame her. I don't want to be on this show anymore.  The FCC says, Oh, you know, before we get to that, Danny Lewis,  any thoughts on Google books? Try Danny Sullivan. I mean, Danny Sullivan.  Who's Danny Lewis? They got married and there you go.

Transcript:  Sorry. Yeah. You know, they've,  they had started off with all this scanning and bringing in all the books to  help people search them out. And then, you know, in this time,  we've had this sort of whole online book reading device  software to actually read books directly from your computer is coming along.  And I think it's them jumping into that kind of a space.  I think it may complicate things for them because they still haven't done the  settlement. I think this is still wrapped up in the courts.  And you're going to have some publishers who are going to point at this and say,  see, this is once again, Google trying to like, you know,  rule the world or whatever. Although when I looked at this,  the last time it was that I think you could buy Google editions through Google,  or you could buy Google Books through Amazon.  Or I think you still had a variety of other ways that you could go through and,  and purchase the books as well. But you know,  it will be interesting to see how successful they are in that they haven't  really been that successful when they've done these kinds of we're going to sell  retail products, if you will. One example was when they had on Google video,  you know, they actually were selling you the ability to,  to download video content and watch it. Yeah. And then, you know,  it ended up dying. And in fact,  all that stuff that you bought went away and they stopped supporting it and  people were upset and you know, Hey, you know,  and I think they gave everybody refunds in the end for it. But you know,  whether this takes off or not remains to be seen.

And because it's vector based,  at least you get something and you can tilt the maps with your pinch gesture  and it's 3d. It's kind of like Google earth. Now, right.  They had some sketch up models in there. That's nice. What else?  Anything else? Oh, they're updating the Android market.  And here's actually, I got a lot of email, a lot of complaints about this.  One of the advantages Android had over iPhone was you could install an Android  app and you had 24 hours to uninstall it and you'd get your money back.

I thought Jobs was saying something like trying to suggest that the activations  were different from them doing upgrades or something else like that.  People, people all play things with the numbers,  but I don't think there's any doubt that there's a lot of Android phones that  are out there and more and more seem to be getting sold each day.  And it's an amazing story because if you went back two years ago before it was  out, you kind of could have thought, well,  I guess iPhones kind of wrapped it up and nothing's going to challenge them.  And they really come in there as an alternative.

Transcript:  Well, another thing Steve Jobs said was in that famous conference call with  analysts. And by the way, people say, Oh, you're an Apple basher.  I'm not bashing Apple, but I got to point this out. In the conference call,  Steve said, nobody wants a seven inch screen. He said,  this iPad is this a seven inch screen is half the screen real estate.  We won't make one. That's just a hardware manufacturer making up demand.  There's no demand for seven inch screens.

Transcript:  Oh, that's a good image.  All right.  Let me talk about Carbonite.com now that we've had a little moment.  The holidays are here, and I got to tell you, I get calls every single radio show from people who say,  I got a call today from a guy who said,  Yeah, I burned all my pictures to CD.  Then I deleted the pictures.  But now I can't read the CDs.  What do I do?  And I'm thinking, that's not a backup.  When you only have one copy.  I don't care if it's like on a disc you name backup.  If you have one copy, that's not a backup.  So I had to explain to him,  and my friend Peter Krogs,  the guy who came up with this,  the 321 backup.  This is a big, very important concept.  If you get one concept out of this show,  this is the one.  He's got a great website he did with the Library of Congress  and the Association of Professional Photographers.  It's called  DPBestFlow.org  and there's a backup article there.  Now he says, here's the deal.  You've got to have,  and photographers,  you take a wedding,  you do a wedding shoot,  you lose those pictures.  They're not going to have another wedding.  That's it.  Or baby, or Christmas, or Connick,  the holidays are here.  You don't want to mess with these pictures.  So he says, here's the deal.  If you want to make sure you never lose data,  three copies of everything.  That can be the original and two backups, that's fine.  Three copies though.  Two of them, two different formats.  So hard drive and DVD,  but two different formats.  One of them has to be offsite.  If you put everything  in the backups next to your computer  and the house burns down, there's a tornado  or an earthquake or somebody breaks in and steals everything,  it's all gone.  Including the backups. So offsite is very important.  That's why I love Carbonite.  It's automatic offsite backup  to the cloud, as Microsoft would say.  Mac or PC,  $55 a year,  that's 15 cents a day,  for everything that's on your internal hard drive.  So you can get a backup of your personal data  on your internal hard drive.  But you could try it free for two weeks right now.  You don't need a credit card.  In fact, I really encourage you to try it free so you can see how this works.  Once you install it, Carbonite just starts backing up.  Doesn't get in your way, waits until the computer is idle,  uses your connection to upload to the internet.  It's great for a laptop because wherever you are,  when you're online,  even in a hot spot,  it'll be backing up and because it uses 128-bit SSL,  you're absolutely secure, private.  You can even add additional encryption,  so your data will be absolutely private.  And here's the best part,  you can get to that data from anywhere,  anytime.  You log on to your Carbonite account on any computer,  there's your data.  Use the free iPhone app, there's your data.  The BlackBerry app, there's your data.  You're never at risk of losing anything.  This is the perfect backup.  Automatic, offsite,  accessible anywhere.  Try it free for two weeks, just use the offer code  carbonite.com  If you decide you like it, I want you to try before you buy,  but if you decide you like it,  you'll get two months free if you use the offer code TWIT.  So it's even more affordable.  carbonite.com  You gotta back it up to get it back, so  do it right.  With Carbonite. Now John's removed  the magic shield.  Hi, Leo?  Yes, Callie?

OK, you go after Assange,  you go after WikiLeaks,  you go after the New York Times,  you shut down the internet.  And this is the big...  Well, that's what they want to do.  And this is the thing that's scary is  apparently without legal authority  they've put pressure on Amazon  and PayPal, MasterCard,  they've put pressure on hosting services,  effectively are  doing something  to WikiLeaks that wouldn't do  to the New York Times.  You wouldn't dare do to the New York Times.

And in fact, the Amazon stuff  is largely overblown because  it sounds terrible. Amazon  has kicked WikiLeaks off. Oh ho, what are we going to do?  And the WikiLeaks stuff's all over the internet.  Amazon wasn't hosting the WikiLeaks site.  The stuff is all distributed on Torrent files.  It's all being replicated in New York Times.  And if you went through...  Hold on a second, John.  And if you went through and Assange had done an interview  and he was active about it and he was saying,  yeah, we put our stuff all over the place  kind of like test cases. So really,  I kind of got the feeling he might have been disappointed  if Amazon had stood up for him.  Actually, he would have been happy either way.  He would have been happy either way.  If he got some publicity about whatever pressure  might have happened with Amazon.  But being on Amazon was not essential  for WikiLeaks to survive.  Go ahead, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it's totally illegal,  how come somebody hasn't filed an indictment  or something? There's nothing been going on.  Somebody just says it's illegal.  There's nobody in jail.

Start time: 3621.49
End time: 3695.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the problem?  Well, there is somebody in jail.  The guy who actually stole the material, allegedly.  He's the one who... He was arrested.  He's the one who's alleged to have taken this material  and leaked it out there, and he's in jail.  And he's going to be in violation,  presumably from the U.S. government,  of laws against taking classified information  when you're not authorized to do it.  And fair enough.  If he's broken laws and taking information  he wasn't allowed to take, then he takes his lumps with it.  And that's why we have courts.  The question is whether or not it's illegal  to republish information that was seized by somebody else.  And in the U.S., pretty much it has been no.  It's too bad.  But if there's government information  that has leaked out,  the journalistic organizations have not been felt  liable for doing this.  It's like Daniel Ellsberg  and the Pentagon Papers, right?  Well, exactly.  And it all revolves around the Espionage Act, I guess,  which is that you can decide  if somebody is guilty of espionage or not.  And maybe a journalist could fall to that  or not.  And nobody's applied it in this case.  And in fact, it apparently has been  very, very rarely ever applied to any publication.  So I was reading one article that said  it was maybe once in World War II  against one publication  they thought about using it and they ended up giving up.  Now, I want to...

Transcript:  First of all, there are plenty of places  where this is being discussed from a political point of view  and so forth.  What I want to, because this is our beat,  is talk about the technology angle.  And really the concern I have  is that a federal agency  would use its ability to  censor a site  is a threat to, it seems to me,  a threat to the free and open Internet.  Now, here's the second part of it.  Of course, there is a response  which is anonymous.  You know, the anonymous,  which is of course many people,  DDoSing Amazon,  DDoSing MasterCard, DDoSing PayPal,  and the government  and The Guardian,  published an article  asserting in a sense that this is the first global  cyber war.  Hackers, in fact, have said  this is a war.

And the problem is then you get in the war  and you really regret that you got in this war  because it is not good for anybody.  And I do have some concern.  It sounds like, Danny,  you're not too worried about the health of the Internet  as a result of all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean,  I'm not happy about people having  their domains taken away from them  or the government putting pressure,  but it's not, none of these things  have actually happened through official government action.  Until I get official government action  and I'm actually doing this sort of stuff,  that starts throwing my radar screens up a lot more.  And, you know, we had,  two weeks ago, I think we had domains  that were literally being seized by the US government.  This is the Department of Homeland Security.  That's far more of a concern than  Wikileaks goes off and does some things  and private companies that,  you know, are providing services  decide, you know what, I don't want to be associated with this.  Because there are lots of things  private companies might not decide  they want to be associated with.  And private companies, they don't have to do that sort of thing.  I'm probably most concerned over the fact that,  you know,  Wikileaks had registered a .org domain  and it remains unclear to me exactly how  that domain was taken away from them.  I understand we don't own our domains,  but the registrar,  I don't know who it is,  whether or not it was the registrar  that sold it to them, or  whoever is in charge of .org domains  said, you can't have that resolved anymore.  But things like Amazon,  or things like MasterCard, or things like Visa,  if they don't want to do these sorts of things,  they shouldn't have the right not to do them  in the same way that Wikileaks should have  the right to do what it wants.  And, you know, you can be all negative about it,  or you could go say,  well, we want to support other businesses that are actually  supporting Wikileaks, is that what you like?  You know, the whole war overall has been  like, okay, done nothing.  You know, if it was a war,  it didn't cause MasterCard or Visa  to put anything back online.  It didn't cause Amazon to put anything back online.  It was definitely, if you will,  a cyber boycott in some ways.  I tweeted once, I couldn't tell  whether or not I was feeling like  people were boycotting lunch counters,  or boycotting buses, or burning them down.  And the burning down aspect  of it I don't particularly like.  But, you know,  there's a lot of  upset going on about this  when you actually start looking at  the actual actions  that the internet did not grind to a halt,  nor did Wikileaks drop off the face of the earth.

Start time: 3910.68
End time: 3989.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think it's also kind of,  you know, ironic that  in response to the, you know,  sort of lack of free speech that these  companies were, you know,  were not helping with, i.e., you know,  not supporting the Wikileaks cause,  the response to that from Anonymous was to try  and take these sites offline,  which seemed like the ultimate  in freedom of information denial.  It seemed completely sort of at odds with the whole  ethos of what was going on there.  I think, you know, at the end of the day,  there's debates today  about whether Amazon has gone down  in the UK this afternoon  because of whether, you know,  which may or may not have been Anonymous  or could have just been a random server bug.  All the two could be vaguely interrelated.  I think what we've seen is, as Danny has said,  it's been just distinctly underwhelming.  And I think that's good from everybody.  You know, it's underwhelming because  nothing really substantial has happened to it.  Nothing really substantial has happened to Wikileaks.  They're still around, they're still alive,  all the data is still out there.  Nothing really substantial has happened to MasterCard  or PayPal or Visa.  And that seems like a pretty good thing.  The whole thing seems just like a lot of...  It doesn't seem like a good thing to me.  ...a lot of saber-rattling,  and not a lot of actual sort of results  on the end of it, which on the whole  seems probably like the best outcome.  What would you like to see, Jon?

Start time: 3989.60
End time: 4015.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't like Visa and MasterCard to begin with.  I think they're onerous, I think the government  is already caved into their ridiculous  interest rates and the whole schemes  that they set up and all the...  In fact, they have a special legislation now,  so if you rack up your credit card bill  and you go bankrupt,  the credit card bill stays intact.  It doesn't even affect bankruptcy laws.  I think it's a couple of basically corrupt operations.  So if something happened to them that was bad,  it wouldn't bother me.

End time: 4065.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, because they were fairly disingenuous.  Let me see if I can find the quote.  But first of all, you have to understand,  and I was really interested, as I mentioned earlier,  that there seemed to be almost unanimity,  at least at the Web,  of support for WikiLeaks.  It was just not even questioned.  PayPal had every right to do what they did.  I mean, I probably would have done the same thing  had I been there.

Start time: 4071.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's important,  but not necessarily easy to distinguish  between what WikiLeaks is  and what they have done  and what the things are that have happened  as a consequence of that.  WikiLeaks is an organization for publishing  data that has been provided to them somewhere  that is available,  and on the basis of it,  it's sort of whistleblowing.  And if we look back to, you know,  there seems to have been a massive storm  around this set of information.  Actually, the previous couple of sets of information  that they released were much more controversial.  Do you remember the video of the American helicopter  that didn't attract this level of kind of controversy,  which seems crazy.  But, you know, I think  what people are missing here is that  the single wrongdoer in this action,  the single wrongdoer,  is the person who took the classified material  and gave it to someone  out of the U.S. classified network.  That person, as we understand it,  is being dealt with.  That should basically be end of story  in terms of the morality of this.  Whether or not WikiLeaks is wrong or right  is kind of a thing. WikiLeaks is essentially a neutral entity.  It's just providing data out there.

And the first question  from Milo is why  PayPal blocked WikiLeaks payments  and froze its account.  The question, it says,  was met mostly with boos from the European audience.  It's actually booing PayPal's action.  Begye said,  he made it seem like  PayPal had complied with a governmental request  to deny service to WikiLeaks.  We have an acceptable use policy  and their job is to make sure that our customers  are protected, making sure that we comply  with regulations around the world  and protect our brand.  This really got the crowd upset.  Later he clarified  and said the State Department did not,  the U.S. State Department did not  directly talk to PayPal.  And he was referring to a letter  sent to WikiLeaks  by the State Department.

They really did a good job  of covering the web and caught a number of things  that I heard  and didn't really register as scoops  including  and I'm sitting here listening  to this conversation  Microsoft offered  Mark Zuckerberg  $15 billion  for Facebook  with a B.  Yesterday?  No, not yesterday.  No, no, no, obviously.  Remember Microsoft bought a small stake  I think $240 million stake  in Facebook.  Small stake.  Well, it was it turns out.  But Fritz Lamond, Microsoft's senior director  of corporate strategy and acquisitions  was talking at LeWeb.  And he said  yeah, we tried to acquire Facebook.

I think Bill Gates, I think it's almost opposite  abilities. I think Bill Gates  was smart enough.  He reminds me a little of Steve Jobs.  He's smart enough to nab an opportunity  when it came to run a  brilliant businessman.  I think Zuckerberg, it's almost the opposite.  I think he does. He has kind of a tin ear  when it comes to how people are going to react  to him.  I think he's quite brilliant.  I think he's thinking very deep thoughts about  social and what it means.  I think the proof is in the pudding.  The reason Facebook is so amazingly successful  is because Zuckerberg has actually  done some really clever tapping  of human drives.  I don't think Bill Gates had that kind of insight.  I think Zuckerberg does.

Groupon salespeople are going out  and actually making deals.  Google salespeople are really  just servicing clients that already have come to them directly.  That was one of the key things  that Google would have gotten with Groupon  was this ability to get out to local merchants  that it wants in a way that  it just has not succeeded in doing.

If you've ever ridden in the Singapore subway,  you know what I'm talking about.  We were out at Ford...  When were we out?  We were out there in July, right?  That was so much fun.  Went to the Maker Faire there at the Henry Ford Museum,  but the best part for me was the tour of the Rouge plant.  I mean, this is...  I was talking...  Actually, I think I overheard this conversation  on the plane yesterday.  A guy was talking about Ford,  just kind of independently saying,  I think Ford is single-handedly getting America out of recession.  This is a company that's really...  was an industrial giant.  At the turn of the century, Henry Ford built the Rouge plant.  The idea was trains pull up with iron, ore, lumber, raw materials,  unload at the other end of the plant.  This ginormous plant.  I think it's a mile by a mile and a half.  No, I'm sorry.  A mile and three quarters long, half a mile wide.  At the other end comes out Model Ts.  In goes ore and lumber.  Out comes Model Ts.  Brilliant.  It's still there. It's going.  We were able...  I hope you saw the video to get down there on the truck...  on the assembly line.  They're making the Ford F-150 trucks.  This was one of their green plants.  The building rooftops are covered with a succulent  that keeps the facility cool in the summer,  creates oxygen,  reduces energy costs.  It's just a really cool company  that is working very hard  to be part of the 21st century  and to keep industrial America alive.  And man, the products they're making.  You've heard about the EcoBoost V6 engine in that SHO.  It's a 7-speed manual transmission.  It's a 7-speed manual transmission.  It's a 6-cylinder engine  with all the horsepower of an 8-cylinder.  And the gas mileage...  real economy of a 6.  365 horsepower.  The new 2011 Fiesta, we've talked about that.  The most fuel-efficient compact car on the road today.  It's a gas car with 40 miles per gallon!  I just...  I have to say, if you've not driven a Ford,  test drive a Ford and see.  If you haven't seen the Fords lately,  you've been missing out on something really great.  I love my Mustang. The Fords sink in them.  And I do want to mention,  because we're running out of time.  December 31st is the deadline.  The 2012 Ford Focus Global Test Drive.  You could win a trip to Madrid, Spain  for you and a friend to test drive  the all-new Focus coming out in early 2011.  Ford will also donate $10,000  to the charity of your choice if you win.  Here's how you enter.  You go to twtfordfocus.com.  It's a Facebook page.  And you'll submit a video under 2 minutes.  You have until the end of the year to do it.  Saying, A, what cause you'd like to support.  And B, why you should go to Madrid  to test drive the Ford Focus.  I saw the Ford Focus.  I don't know if you saw it, Kelly, at Blog World.  What a sweet automobile.  Just a gorgeous car.  You could be going to the Spain's National Institute  for Aerospace Technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

The reason I always shortened it to Will  is because when I was a kid  when you're doing arcade machines  there's only ever three letters to enter your thing.  I've got two middle names  so I can't even use my initials.  I was like, I'll just make it W-I-L.  That's an awesome story.

According to Pew  I always like saying it.  Pew Research Center's  Internet and American Life Project  8% of online Americans use Twitter  74% of adults in the US  this is US, are online  18 and older.  So if you include all the people online  it's about 6% of the entire adult population  that uses Twitter.  Women use Twitter more than men do.  10% of women use the service compared to 7% of men.  18% of Twitter users are Hispanic.  Is that higher than the percentage in the general population?  Or is that about the same?  I think it's a little higher. 13% black, I know that's higher.  5%...what?  18% of users are Hispanic, 13% are black, 5% are white.  No, there must be a typo.

People who tweet  are more likely to be urban  and have had some college education.  The majority of people on Twitter are between the ages of 18 and 20  and the older you get, the less likely you are to use the service.  Which means John, you and I are way too old to be tweeting.

But what they're saying is 13% of the blacks on the internet  use Twitter.  As opposed to 5% of the whites on the internet.  I see. 5% of the total white population.  That's clear as mud.  So it's out of proportion.  Blacks and Hispanics have much more use out of proportion.  So basically black people
