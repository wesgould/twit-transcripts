Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  La la land.  But you're all going to die when it slides into the earth.  Into the sea.  Yeah.  So enjoy it.  Enjoy while you can.  In your little Sodom and Gomorrah.  Just enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cardinal's not that bad up here.  It's pretty nice actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's gorgeous.  I want to be outside.  and we can all go out.  I don't want to get this done before the sun goes down.  So here's a really interesting story that I just saw.  Just came across on Declan McCullough's blog on CNET.  And just kind of a stunning story.  The FBI, I don't know if you've seen this yet,  is putting up hyperlinks that are,  it's basically a honeypot.  Hyperlinks that purport to be illegal videos  of minors having sex.  And then if you click on them,  they raid your house, arrest you,  put you in jail, try you,  and throw away the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're outside right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it happened to a guy named Roderick Vosburg.  Now here's the problem is that people are using these links  to rickroll other people.  You know what rickrolling is?  Where you put a...  Never gonna let you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Never gonna run around and desert you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  We just rickrolled the Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the first tweet.  Rickroll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got you, 400 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Try 200,000.  No, I'm just saying in the chat room right now.  Just the live ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey, back on track here, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So rickrolling is where you send a link that says,  oh, look, this is an amazing story about the FBI  and what they're doing with links.  And then when you click the link,  it goes to a YouTube video of Rick Astley singing,  never gonna give you up.  It actually started with other pictures and images  and, you know, goatsie and so forth.  But this is an interesting thing  because people apparently are passing around these hyperlinks.  If you click on it,  doesn't matter if you have any past history.  They don't have to show any intent.  A doctoral student at Temple University  taught history at LaSalle University.  His name is Roderick Vosberg,  was raided a year ago.  He allegedly clicked on this FBI hyperlink.  They threw him to the ground, handcuffed him.  He was charged with violating federal law  which criminalizes attempts.  It's illegal, do you know,  to attempt to download child porn.  You don't actually have to successfully do it.  Just clicking on the link breaks the law.  The jury found him guilty in November, April 22nd.  He'll be sentenced up to three to four years in prison  even though he never spent any time in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd like to get more details on this.  This whole story sounds like bull.  Well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know about that.  I mean, they are definitely setting traps for people.  I mean, that's pretty well known.  Well, furthermore, they had experts testify

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that he had spent no time in this...  It was in a forum, a message forum.  He had spent no time there.  He had not done anything on this ranchy forum.  Raunchy.  It should be raunchy, but it's actually R-A-N-C-H-I.  See, that's to hide it.  Wait, I thought you said this was child pornography,  not bestiality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what it is.  I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I didn't click on the link.  I'm not going to do it.  I don't know what it is.  I didn't click on the link.  Honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I think a little reporting needs to be done on this.  Essentially, this is a rumor about a rumor about a rumor.  I don't think so.  We have no details on this.  How come this Declan did this one thing?  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think he's done quite a bit of due diligence on this.  Declan is one of the most hardcore,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  pick up the phone, go to do 10 meetings right once.  Oh, is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's funny because he wrote a column about me  the other day where he never picked up the phone  or asked me to clarify anything.  What did he say about you?  He put a bunch of BS in his article.  It was ridiculous.  So I'm not buying that argument.  Being a member of the media myself  and not having been called.  What did he say about you?  You look it up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I had no idea.  I wouldn't have quoted him had I known.  It does look like he did a lot of due diligence.  There's a lot of quotes.  He talked to a lot of people apparently,  including professors at George Washington University.  You know, there were experts.  Saying that there was no evidence that he ever viewed  the full size images that the thumbs.db file  that the FBI is using a thumbnail as evidence.  These thumbnails in the thumbs.db file.  There's no evidence he ever saw the big images.  They weren't found on the hard drive.  Who did Declan talk to at the FBI?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll have to find that.  I'll look through it.  You don't believe it.  In other words, you think he's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm not saying that.  I think there's maybe some validity to the story.  But I just don't see that this is being followed up enough.  I mean, unless someone has.  Seen that reviewed the legal documents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Who did he talk to at the FBI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's got the FBI affidavit.  Since he picks up the phone so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, now this is interesting.  I don't know.  I mean, it looks like a very well researched article, John,  to be honest.  Let's presume for the sake of argument  that the FBI is doing that.  And they may well be.  Well, nobody denies it.  In fact, the FBI apparently says,  yeah, we're doing this hyperlink study.  Hyperlinks.  Apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's got a couple other people quoted in the story.  I'm going through the story right now.  And so he definitely has.  I doubt the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, I got phone numbers of three or four guys at the FBI.  They'll be glad to take your call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, this is.  I mean, he's got some of the court documents here  explaining what happened.  But I mean, I guess what we're talking about here is  people who would normally not do something deviant  can be tricked into doing something deviant.  Stumble onto something deviant.  I agree.  I'm not going to argue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, Will's on.  OK.  I'm not going to argue that.  I mean, there's a lot of situations.  In fact, I think the more recent one that happened in New  York City where they were leaving iPods and wallets  lying around.  And then people would pick one of them up.  And then they'd be busted for one reason or another.  Oh, Dateline, yeah.  Because cops are like trying to do.  You know, they're bored.  Or they can't chase real criminals.  I'm not sure what the deal is.  And yeah, there's a lot of situations like that.  And I think it's abhorrent minimally.  Except when I see these stories and I don't see a lot of other  similar stories, I would like to get a little more information.  It seems that somebody should talk to the FBI.  That's all.  That's all I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Joining us right now, Mr. Will Harris from ChannelFlip.com  who spilled coffee into his MacBook Pro this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you need a little death march on there.  What a complete disaster.  Brand new?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, tell us, take us through the exact thing that happened.  What size cup?  Was the coffee hot?  Was it a full cup?  Don't do Declan McCullough style reporting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So picture the scene, right?  We're at my mother-in-law's, or my future, my mother-in-law's  to B's house.  And Alex is cooking Easter lunch, right?  So I figure I'll keep her company.  I'll sit in the kitchen.  I'll do my bit of video editing work while she's like, you know,  chopping up the roast and making potatoes and stuff.  So it's Easter in England, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  They have Catholics in England?  It's Easter all over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so I've got my big cup of coffee that I'm just sitting in  and I'm eating while I'm drinking while I'm doing my stuff.  And I just get to move the cup of coffee,  and I'm looking at something else as I'm doing it.  And I spill the cup of coffee.  It's a really big, it's like a, it's kind of like a venty  Starbucks cup of coffee, right?  And it just goes all over the keyboard of this maybe  file, four-month-old, 17-inch MacBook Pro, high-res screen,  four gigs of RAM, 2.5 gig processor, 300 gig hard drive.  Oh, it's dead.  No sugar, thankfully.  Just melt.  So you could have the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it stopped operating, and that's the thing,  is you had power in it, and it's probably shorted out.  So I very quickly, you know, I'm like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I very quickly, you know, I tipped it upside down.  I got all the coffee off the surface.  I let it drip.  I put it in the air and cupboard to heat it up.  Oh, you know what you need to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You put them in the...  The dryer over it.  You put them in the dishwasher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're listening at home,  do not put your MacBook Pro in the dishwasher.  Well, what has he got to lose now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, did this legal immediately or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I've made some progress, right?  So it turned off completely when I did it.  I tried it like six hours later,  and it wouldn't do anything.  Like, you plugged it into the mains.  It didn't do anything.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You've got to give it days, weeks, months.  It has to really dry out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I tried it, I just tried it five minutes ago,  and when I plugged the MagSafe into the side,  the MagSafe does now light up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm telling you, you're just impatient.  I did this once.  I dropped my cell phone in the toilet.  That happens all the time.  You don't want the details on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It happens all the time for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many times have you dropped a cell phone in the toilet?  Has it never happened to you, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are you kidding?  You never once have dropped a cell phone in the toilet?  It was so funny.  I'll never forget the first time I saw this.  I'm in a men's room, and some b**** walks in,  and he's on the phone.  He's talking really loud.  Everybody is looking at each other like,  oh, I don't know.  He goes up to the urinal, keeps talking at the urinal,  and it slips out of his hand and falls in the urinal,  and everybody is howling,  because this guy, God has come up and said,  he's looking at it.  He's going, do I get it?  Do I not?  What do I do?  What do I do?  And he's frozen in indecision.  See, in my case...  Is he still peeing, though?  I think he probably was.  I mean, can you stop on a dime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What exactly happened before I fell in?  He was using the facility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh.  In my case, the facility had not been used  when it tumbled into the bowl.  So I whipped it out.  I whipped it out.  First thing you do is you pop the battery.  You whipped it out?  Well, no, I took the phone out of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  I misheard.  This show, I'll tell you, I don't know what I want to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  with you boys.  So I took it out.  I mean, I removed the cell phone from the toilet,  removed the battery immediately, right, Will?  Immediately, you got to get all power off of it.  Yeah.  I let it dry for literally a week or two.  The problem is, you know, in cell phones now,  they have a little test strip that turns pink if it gets wet  because what's been happening is people do this,  they bring it in, they say,  well, I don't know, it stopped working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it stopped working.  Oh, I thought that pink thing was to see if you were pregnant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the same technology, actually.  No, it's not.  That is in no way true.  I had a little plus sign on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could have let that one slide.  You could have said it was the same technology.  It would have gone into the public domain  and that would have become a meme or something.  No, it would be in Wikipedia by tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Adam, first drop the iPhone in the toilet.  I'm not mistaken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  iPhone in the toilet would be bad.  But if you let these things dry generally, it's okay,  But as I said, I did with a keyboard.  I literally do put my keyboards in the dishwasher  and it works fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm hoping in a, you know,  I'll give it a day or so, maybe a couple days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, a week, Will, a week.  Week, week.  I can't wait a week.  I need my baby back.  Shake it.  Take the hard disk out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Open it up as much as you can.  Shake it so that all the drops of water get dispersed.  And then every day turn it another direction.  Shake it hard.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This stuff works.  Well, it works.  And then do that with,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and when you're done, do that with the laptop too.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John's in an Easter mood.  If I forget something else,  it's a really good excuse to buy that MacBook Air  I've been lusting after.  Do you have any insurance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, what happens now?  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's insured on my home insurance.  So I'll send it back to them, I expect,  and just get a replacement.  If you had AppleCare, would that protect it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No.  Not against the policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  AppleCare is only extended warranty.  It doesn't cover accidental damage.  And actually, the number of things  that AppleCare doesn't cover,  even though it's supposed to be an extended warranty,  you're usually far better off taking off  like third-party home insurance cover.  Thank you for saying that,  because I've been saying that for ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Almost always, because the number of get-out clauses

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that are in the AppleCare are far more  than in your average AppleCare.  And that's your average insurance policy.  So I have, yeah, so it's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So when you joined us, Will,  John was saying what a lousy reporter  Declan McCullough is, which...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I didn't say that.  I said that the story's a little bit sketchy,  and no matter how these people have got quoted,  I'm just not buying this story at all,  because in fact, if the FBI was doing all this,  how come there's not like thousands of people lined up?  I mean, come on, there's people aimlessly  clicking on weird stuff all the time.  And the first thing, I'm surprised you talk about  these people getting somebody to click.  You know, what you do is you take that link  and then you post it someplace with some other attribution,  like, wow, this New York Times front page news  is really interesting, and then they click on it.  They end up clicking on the child porn site,  and then according to this story,  the FBI's busting down the door.  The whole story is sketchy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I believe it.  I believe it.  Okay, I guess that settles that.  You want to believe.  You're a believer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're a buyer.  I buy it.  I think they're doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, they're clearly doing it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because they have all the court documents here,  So what are we saying we don't buy?  He went to trial.  He was convicted.  Yeah.  Well, John doesn't buy that they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  doing the hyperlink sting.  Here's from the court affidavit.  On October 25th, 2006, looters in an undercover capacity  logged into the Ranchi message board  and creating a posting that advertised  a video of a four-year-old female engaging  in sexual activity with an adult male.  I won't read you what it said, but it's pretty appalling.  And the posting directed individuals  to go to these website links to download the video.  The preview is at uploader.sites.net,  and then the full 25 megs, and they have four links.  He clicked a link.  All of these links go to...  Are you reading from the court document  that says he clicked a link?  No, no, I didn't get to that part.  And then, I haven't seen the rest of this,  but this is from the FBI affidavit.  There we go again.  Well, I'm reading it on the page.  There must be true.  And then, apparently, it's hosted  by noip.com, which is dynamic domain hosting,  which goes to the court.  They record the IP address.  Now, analysis of the access log.  This is, again, back to the court affidavit from the FBI.  He's got the images in here.  You think he's faking these images?  Well, now, here's the way the story reads.  It's like the FBI is faking the links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So how are these images showing up in the first place?  Since these links apparently don't go anywhere  except they make a video of the video.  So, they're faking the links.  The links apparently don't go anywhere  except they make you look like you were trying to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, and that's the crime.  The crime is in trying.  That's what we said at the beginning.  Well, but they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I understand that story.  The crime is in trying.  But meanwhile, we're seeing evidence here  that there was more than trying.  Someone had accomplished this, which doesn't make any sense  in the context of this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The only thing they found on his computer  was a thumbs.db file, a thumbnail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's from Sirius Software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, no, Windows does it.  It's just, you know, it makes a, it makes a,  if you have an images folder, it makes a thumbnail database.  Oh, right, right, right, right, right.  I'm sorry, go on.  Yeah, thumbnail database.  And they looked at the thumbnails,  and in fact, there are, you know, these grainy icons.  Now, that's a good question.  Did those thumbnail images come from the FBI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, man.  It also sounds a bit like entrapment to me.  Well, and this is really the larger point here is

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that entrapment laws, this is Harvey Silvergate.  This is also from the poorly researched article  by Declan McCullough,  a longtime criminal defense lawyer in Cambridge  and author of a forthcoming book on the Justice Department,  said, because the courts have been so narrow  in their definition of an entrapment  and so expansive in their definition of probable cause,  there's nothing to stop the feds from acting  as you, Declan, posit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It feels like minority report, right?  Like, so if somebody ever thought about doing this.  Pre-crime.  Pre-crime, yeah.  Getting to precogs, yeah, I mean, it's like,  you thought you were going to do something.  I mean, what if somebody like saw the link and was like,  I wonder if that really is that, you know?  Like, they would never have thought  in their whole life to do it.  But because they were presented with it,  they're like, I wonder if that's fake or not, you know?  Same thing if you see an iPod on the ground

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and you pick it up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I would always return that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would always return it if I could or tried to,  but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do those Dateline things that Chris Hansen does,  do they make you queasy at all?  Oh, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, not the one with the people who are entrapping who  are, you know, bad at it.  No, actually, those ones where they're entrapping people

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  are just as creepy as anything.  And I'll tell you one other reason.  I remember I watched it a couple of times.  I got sick of it because Hansen's so arrogant.  He's annoying.  But they caught the same guy twice once.  The guy wanted to be on TV.  See, that's a bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's one of the things that bugs me is I saw it for the first  time just a couple of weeks ago on MSNBC, because, you know,  MSNBC, when they're done with politics,  they go right in the gutter.  I mean, like immediately.  It's like Obama, Obama, Obama, prison.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But whatever you think of, like, their methods or whatever,  I mean, these are people who are, like, out there trying  to find young kids to have sex.  Well, it's true.  They have a chat room.  Yeah, I know I agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But have you looked at these people?  They got their cross-eyed.  Many of them have IQs of 80.  They must have pretty low IQs.  And who knows what the heck's going on?  They believe anything.  I mean, it's just like, yeah, maybe they should be thrown  in jail for being idiots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you know, this is the thing that gets me.  OK, so what happens is they go in.  Chris Hansen, like, pretends to interrogate them.  They get on.  They see there's camera crews.  There's lights.  Chris has got blow-dried hair and makeup on.  They talk to him.  And then they go out the door, and they're thrown to the ground  by the police, who've been waiting for them to leave.  And you know, at some point, the NBC producer has to go up  to them and say, would you sign this release and allow us  to put this on TV?  Right?  That's if they don't want to be blurted out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you guys heard about the person who had this happen.  They got home or something, and then they killed themselves?  Oh, jeez.  Eight lines.  No, no, no.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that a separate incident?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me get that story, which was the controversial one,  which is the guy never got home afterwards and killed himself.  He never left the house.  And so they tried to lure him out of his own home,  because he had talked to somebody in a chat room.  And then they couldn't get him to leave,  and they tried everything they could.  And so the cops came over to his house.  He never went anywhere at all.  And then he was so freaked out, he killed himself.  And now there's a big lawsuit about it.  The guy had never intended to do anything.  He was just a big talker or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and that's similar to this story,  where you click on a link.  I mean, are you doing something when you're clicking on a link?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's obvious.  I mean, I know what their argument is.  But the point is, it seems to me that they're just trying.  I mean, you could probably get, I mean,  there's this kind of opportunity.  This is like a, this is a scam.  This is like what con men do.  I mean, most people are honest.  But if they're presented by, in fact,  I challenge anybody out there.  If a con man, a professional con man, targets you,  this is like being targeted by a professional assassin,  you're going to get conned.  And most cons are based on some sort of, you know,  you have to be kind of sketchy about how you see,  you know, what's legal and what's illegal.  But you're going to get conned if somebody targets and conjures.  And when the government is out conning people,  oh, click on this and you're going to see whatever.  This is a con.  When did our own government,  instead of protecting the public,  start conning the public?  It's unbelievable to me that they do this.  Go do real crime fighting.  Find people who are doing this stuff on their own  that are actually into it and arrest them.  Don't try to trick some idiot with an IQ of 85  into clicking on something.  Some people can't resist clicking on everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a compelling argument from John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like, are there real criminals out there?  I mean, if we, if you, if there's the 10 possible crimes  and you run every single person in the United States  against the 10 possible crimes,  what percentage are you going to go after, you know,  take an opportunity?  I don't know that it's not right, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I guess the argument you'd make is that these predators,  these predators are kind of operating kind of out of the...  That's a little different.  Out of the light of day.  And so you kind of have to go where they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I'm only taking that so far,  buying that so far.  There's a group called NAMBLA,  the National Association of Man, Boy, Love,  or something like that.  Anyway, NAMBLA has open meetings in the libraries.  Like they had one in San Francisco some years ago.  It's kind of scandalous.  These people are not that hard to find.  And they crack these porn rings constantly.  Those are what they should be concentrating their effort on,  not trying to create more people into porn  that probably are just, you know, they're not really into it.  They're being conned to be into it.  I'm not buying any of it.  Well, that's the end.  That's the point of why entrapment is illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I agree with you.  But you know, if we let them go, the terrorists win.  And I think that's the real problem.  That's actually what it's really all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all about fighting.  But it's happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That 3 a.m. cool, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what it's all about.  So I'm not actually, but I'm still maintaining my position

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that I think the story is not complete  and we don't know what's really going on  because I just don't see...  If you don't read it in the Times, you don't buy it.  Well, there's an element to that.  But it seems to me there would be more people complaining  than this one or two guys.  I mean, when they just target these guys for some reason.  I suspect there's missing information.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all I got on the...  You know, I have to say,  one thing you're absolutely right about is that this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  For three years we've been doing this show,  we've kind of always assumed...  I mean, we're not doing reporting here.  We're doing an analysis of existing reporting.  We've always kind of assumed that you can trust these stories  and we work from that point.  But I think increasingly,  because of the huge amount of blogging  and news sources out there,  putting pressure on the previously legitimate news sources  like CNET, there may be is.  There may be a little bit more vetting we need to do on stories.  You might be right there on that, John.  I mean, it may be that there's a lot of pressure  to jump on these things quickly before the blog does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Especially when it's anti-government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think the trend these days is, you know,  quick rather than right.  Exactly.  You know, I was watching a marvelous...  Do you guys watch The Wire?  Love The Wire.  That's the best.  So in one of the...  In the latest season,  they've got a running newsroom  and there's story centers around a paper.  Wait, are we going to have to have a spoiler alert now?  No, spoiler alert.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What episode is this?  What season is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Season five has already been shown  and I'm not going to say anything relevant.  No, I have it on my laptop,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  so I haven't seen it yet.  The guy just...  You're going to ruin it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will, there's a bit of humor there  that you're going to have to not.  You shouldn't probably talk about it.  If you haven't seen the ending of the show,  there's a couple of...  Is this the season closer?  Yes, the season closer.  It's actually, it's an hour and a half,  it's kind of a short movie and it's quite funny.  All I was going to say was that in the paper desk,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they have this one guy and he sends the guy off on a report  and he says, you know what, just take two weeks  to go and work up this story.  Never happened.  Just go and work on the story,  spend two weeks writing it  and come back with a feature for us.  And you just think, you know,  who in the blogosphere is spending the money  and who in the news business is spending two weeks  writing and researching a story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who in the news business is it nowadays?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm sure the papers like the Times still do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've gone from the point where these big mainstream operations  could fund that kind of mass in-depth,  every quote is fact-checked and every...  I'll give you an example.  Everything is counted and it's massively researched  to now where if you're working on a news desk  somewhere like CNET or something,  you've probably got to crank out two or three stories a day  just to earn your keep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  However, what happens is if you look at each of those stories  as part of the research, each of those as an atom  as opposed to a full story,  what you have to do is you change your news story,  your news digestion process from eating one big huge entree  to eating a lot of hors d'oeuvres and a lot of little pieces  and then you get full from a bunch of different stories  and the stories told sort of in real time across the blogs,  across podcasts.  And is that a good thing?  I think it's better because everybody gets involved in it.  You just have to change your expectation.  The story about the guy killing himself in the...  You hear about it immediately.  And it's on CNN had the same impact on things.  People would hear like,  oh my God, something just happened on CNN  and they would report it totally wrong  and for a couple of years everybody said,  oh my God, you can't trust CNN.  And then they realized, oh, live television,  you have a different expectation of trust.  You have to be open-minded.  But when the World Trade Center happened,  they thought it was an accident for the first 15 minutes.  The second plane hit and they still thought it was an accident  and they were saying on CNN like, oh my God, this is really crazy.  What's the chance of two planes hitting the World Trade Center?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you think as a consumer of news now,  what we should do is reserve judgment  until we kind of get a critical mass of information  that means it must be true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and understand that you may never reach the truth.  I mean, Jimmy Hoffa, what exactly happened?  John Kennedy, what exactly happened?  We're never going to know.  And so there's some cases that may stay open for decades.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I'll give you an example that's from this week's torrent  ripped from this week's headlines.  And Gadget reported, your former property, Jason,  reported on March 21st, two days ago,  that Sony was going to charge customers $50  to remove the crapware.  They were going to call it fresh start.  Actually, according to Ken Fisher writing in Ars Technica,  Michael Dell said a couple of years ago that this junk,  this trialware, this basically advertising  that comes on your new PC,  makes Dell about $60 a machine.  So you could see with razor thin margins  why somebody like Dell or Sony or HP,  which is notorious for this, would load these puppies up  because that's big bucks for them.  So Gadget said, Sony's going to do it.  They're going to have this fresh start program,  but it'll charge you $50.  The blogosphere goes crazy.  Just goes bonkers.  Finally, some reporting is done.  Ed Bott, our good friend John, talks to Sony.  Sony said, no, you know what?  That should never have gotten out.  It was an internal miscommunication.  We never intended to do that.  We're going to have fresh start as a no charge option  on some laptops, not on all.  And we're not going to charge on that.  Spin.  You think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Of course.  Exactly.  That comes back, even though that looks like dodgy reporting.  The actual far more likely thing there, as Jason says,  is that the plan's gone out.  The blogosphere's gone mental.  Consumer reaction's been terrible.  Oh, no.  Of course, we never meant to do that.  Yeah, but come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sony capable of reacting in 24 hours.  Look how long it took them to solve the root kick issue.  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe they've learned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think they've learned a lesson?  No.  I think you're right.  They probably haven't.  They don't move fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Unless there's somebody in there.  Maybe after the root kick fiasco, they hired one of those PR  firms that specializes in disaster recovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me give you a little bit of insight into this,  having been the person who handled all the legal issues  for Engadget, which there were a half dozen a month,  conservatively.  Here's what would happen.  People would, within the company,  not agree with their decision.  They would be friends with Peter Rojas and Ryan Block  at Engadget.  They would instant message, call, whatever,  see them for drinks, and say, here's  what's happening inside of Dell, or Palm,  or whatever company has Apple.  All these people were friends with the Engadget staff.  And they would disagree with the decision,  so they would use Engadget as a tool  to make their point internally.  And so people who are very pro-consumer  then looked at Engadget.  And that was one of the secrets of why  Engadget broke so many stories, is  because they became very inside friends with those people.  And we had many occasions where, for example, the people  from Razor, who makes the Razor?  Is that Motorola?  Motorola.  Yeah, so this is the best story ever.  Motorola emails us a lawsuit.  You cannot call the new Razor with a keyboard the RazorBerry.  And I'm like, OK, you're suing us  for using the term RazorBerry.  Interesting.  So I call up the attorney on the phone, and I said,  hey, how you doing?  Jason from Engadget.  Oh, yeah, hi.  And I said, you're a second year, third year associate,  I see, from your profile?  She's like, what does that have to do with anything?  I'm like, OK, let me explain something to you.  When we were at your booth at CES,  your people were calling it the RazorBerry, number one.  Number two, so you can sue your own employees.  Number two, I don't know if you've learned anything  about the First Amendment or anything like that.  We can call any product whatever we want.  And you've now basically solidified  that the name of this product is RazorBerry.  The RazorBerry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Goodbye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Never heard from him again.  No, even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I emailed back.  I CC'd the guy who was running Motorola at the time,  because I knew the CEO from some conferences.  And I said, hey, thanks a lot for the email.  Obviously, we discussed this on the phone,  and it's quite ridiculous.  But we'd love to interview you.  And I said to the CEO, we'd love to interview you  at some point for Engadget.  He writes back like, oh, no problem.  Totally would love to do the interview.  Boom.  that came up.  I would CC the CEO of the company and say,  hey, let's do an interview about it.  Interesting.  But it was always people on the inside.  Always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So how do you, though, I mean, now, OK,  now put yourself in Ryan's shoes.  That's difficult, because you know that you're going to,  you believe this is a true story,  and you know that you're going to look bad a day later,  because people are going to say, no, it was never true.  You should never have said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they know how to phrase it.  They phrase it, their sources say this,  and they know that they're going to have people deny  and all that kind of stuff.  So I always stand by it, and I always stood by them.  And you know, basically, your reputation over time  is what it is.  And if you look at Engadget's reputation over time,  they're right more than they're wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but don't you think there's  a risk among readers that pretty soon readers are going to say,  oh, there goes Engadget half cocked again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, they don't think that.  They think the opposite.  They think when Engadget is going to report on things early,  and there's a chance that misinformation will happen.  But we would get all these fake things emailed,  and we would sort them out really well.  It's very hard to trick those guys,  because they have so many internal people at each company  that if somebody sends a fake Apple device,  they know 50 people who work in Apple product development.  They can say, fake or not, and they go, fake.  They have been burned, though.  Yeah, like once or twice.  And when they got burned, it was like burned in air quotes,  because they said, here is the latest rumor.  Yeah, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they've done a marvelous job overall.  I mean, right from the beginning,  it was well set up the right way.  And I agree with Jason.  The people aren't going to reject, oh, those guys,  I'm not going to read them anymore,  because they've been wrong once or twice.  Actually, you want to read, and especially if they're doing  stuff that is a little like, wow, where did they get this  information, I think it makes people even more likely  to read them, because it's just what you would do.  Well, that's what we're looking for, I guess, in a blog,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  in a gadget blog.  We're looking for that kind of...  You're looking for rumors and gossip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's entertaining, if nothing else.  Yeah, when I met Steve Jobs at the Wall Street Journal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  D conference, I had Engadget on my badge, and he's like,  oh, I love your site, da-da-da.  He knew Peter Ross, and I said, can I ask you a question?  Like, why do you read it?  And he said to me, competitive intelligence.  Don't you have people for that?  He's like, you guys are better.  That was Steve Jobs said that to me.  That's nice.  I could give you the best Engadget story ever,  now that I'm a couple years out from it.  Remember the Trio 700 or something?  They're going to run Windows or something?  I may not have all my facts.  It was the first Windows Mobile, the Trio for a long time,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  because it's a Palm company, ran Palm only.  The 700W ran Windows Mobile for the first time.  So all the speculation comes out about the 700W.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm with Peter, pulls out of his pocket a Trio 700W.  And I look at that, I go, oh my God.  I said, this isn't out.  And I said, where did you get it?  And then he goes, well, and I said, you know what?  Don't tell me.  I didn't see it.  I don't want to know.  Want to know?  There were three of them.  There were three people who had the device.  Bill Gates, the guys from Trio, and Peter Rojas.  One of the internal guys had given it to him  to get his feedback on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow.  See, that's when you've got some power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how insider they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, of course, Palm lost a huge loss.  What was it?  $31 million loss, speaking of the Trio,  because of poor sales on the Trio.  They announced that this week.  $31 million last quarter.  Is it over for Palm?  John, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's never over till it's over.  And I hate to use that phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they can come back with the killer phone  and turn it around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm of the opinion that they're going to be bought out.  And I think it's going to be.  I'm of the opinion that, well, this is my thinking.  I think Motorola is going to buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  For what?  Not the Palm OS.  It's antiquated.  We haven't seen OS 6.  We have no idea what that's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, somebody's got to buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  $31 million loss compared with the profit of $11 million  the year before.  Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the trouble is with Palm now.  You think, you know, what do they do that nobody else does  better?  It used to be, you know, Palm was like the PDA people.  It just shows you, you can be on top of the world,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  even as recently as last year.  And Apple comes along and boom.  As soon as phones and PDAs started to converge,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you've got Windows mobile devices.  OK, we're shonky to start with.  But they're now actually all right.  The Razer Berry is not a bad device.  You know, the whole keyboard market's just  been owned by BlackBerry.  And then the whole kind of smart media phone thing is just  owned, well, not owned by Apple, but is heading  in that direction.  And so you think, like, what has Palm got  that nobody else has got?  Nothing.  Unless Garnet is something better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Unless Garnet is something really special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, and I mean, do you really want to introduce a new OS  again to a system now where, you know, nobody buying a PDA  or a smartphone now, for the most part.  You know, the general market is familiar with the Palm OS.  Cobalt, that's right, not Garnet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, KJ's pointing out in the chat room, John,  that isn't Motorola getting out of the cell phone business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They dropped their cell.  So maybe it's Nokia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they got the S60.  Yeah, that wouldn't work.  I just get the sense that they're a candidate for somebody  to buy because they did not.  Yeah, they're not doing well.  And the Palm OS is old.  But you know what really happened?  I have to assume they've been working on something  in the meantime.  You know what really happened?  People love the form factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's something about the form factor.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's sort of like a BlackBerry.  I've always liked that form factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that's nothing right.  It's very 2003.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People are loyal to that item, though, you know.  People are still carrying around their Palm.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But they've been struggling for a while.  I mean, I haven't used a Palm in years.  You know what really happened is Karl Rove switched from his trio  to an iPhone.  It was all over then.  Did you see this?  No.  Karl Rove, he's being interviewed by newsbusters.org.  He says, the interviewer says, I see you just got an iPhone.  How's that working out for you?  Karl Rove, I love it.  My life has changed.  I have a shred of coolness.  I've got my 3,500 people in my address book on the phone.  I can sync my calendar.  I keep track of my modest little stock investments.  I could check the weather of my house in Washington,  my house in Florida, my boy at school,  my hunt lease in South Texas.  I can destroy people's careers with a button.  I can surf the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say, you know the other thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other thing is that he then doesn't have to integrate  with anybody else's email systems.  So those emails you need to conveniently lose.  You've not got copies for anybody else to worry about.  Good point.  That's why.  No Blackberry server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like the theory.  And not only that, he says, not only that,  I also have a MacBook Air, which is really cool.  Even my wife is jealous of my MacBook Air.  He says that?  Yes.  What, is he working for the Apple now?  What's the deal?  And then the interviewer says, well,  you'll have to get her one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then he says, no, I don't.  No, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm the only one who's got a MacBook Air.  No, I don't.  I'm the only cool one in the family with a MacBook Air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you have a MacBook Air in jail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what the headline should be for that?  Carl Rove refuses to give his wife one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's spin it Carl Rove style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we should go after Carl Rove  and see what we can spin because Kevin knows he can't  do anything to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's harmless now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that guy got his **** kicked every day in high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Carl Rove.  But he got it back though.  He got it back and then some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, if anybody has a chance when they do these political,  you know, they every once in a while they have like,  you know, the Pennsylvania election probably have a lot  of coverage on the cable stations.  Watch the cable coverage on Fox News,  not, you know, the Fox News that's on cable.  And because they have a Carl Rove thing.  He comes on and he's like an analyst for them  and it is absolutely fascinating.  Oh yeah, he works for Fox now.  Yeah, I mean, he's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He talks before, aren't they?  No, they work for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's probably true, but not on the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, yeah, because I think that's often the case  when you get these guys in there unchained  and they can talk freely.  They really, I mean, it's like Jason or like you.  They have a lot to say.  They have a lot of knowledge.  Now that you're no longer working for the Triads,  I think we can really hear the true story  from John C. Dvorak.  I don't know.  Whatever that is.  New survey from the Computing Technology Industry Association.  Finds John McCain and Barack Obama  in a dead heat for the geek vote.  Each with 29%.  Hillary 13%.  Huckabee 11%.  Ron Paul only 9%, which kind of surprises me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he was number one for a long time.  I thought the geeks loved Ron Paul.  These surveys are not up to par.  I know, but it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you know there are 12 million IT workers in the US?  That's it?  Yeah, 27.  That's it?  Well, you're right.  I mean, given all the IT we do.  27% say they've contributed to a presidential campaign  on the internet.  Which kind of, that's impressive.  IT workers who are willing to apply a partisan label  are most likely to call themselves Republicans  or conservatives, 35% and 36% respectively.  Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what this says.  Because it seems to, I mean, call me roundly ignorant,  but when I think of IT in America, I think West Coast.  You think of hippies.  West Coast, I think, you know.  Remember, there's a lot of guys.  The sushi and Starbucks Democrats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, that's not IT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's high tech dorks that are in there.  The entrepreneurs maybe, but most IT is like everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There are other guys in the white short sleeve shirts  and the little skinny black ties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tecce, they're here, they're there.  Rochester.  Rochester?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you guys seen this website, intrade?  Intrade.com?  What is it?  It's a prediction market.  So you can actually, it's becoming like,  I know all these banker guys who are like  spending money on this.  They don't get enough of the stock market?  It's called intrade?  Trade.  You basically bet on prediction.  Oh, right, right.  I've heard of this.  The Democratic presidential nominee is trading at $79.90.  So you can sell that at $78 or you can buy it at $79.  Hillary Clinton as Democratic presidential nominee,  you can buy at $20 or you can sell at $97.  Whoa.  Yeah.  And then you have a trend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The idea here is the wisdom of crowds, right?  That the stock market encapsulates a lot of information  and accurately reflects that information.  And why not use the same kind of information  and why not use the same kind of market to...  The trouble is you need to be a set of signs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sticking with Hillary.  I just can't see Obama.  She's numerically out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How could she win?  Momentum.  The big moment.  Clintons.  There's no momentum.  In order for Hillary to get the nomination...  If she was perfectly, absolutely out,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  she wouldn't still be in this thing.  Well, I'm not saying she knows she's out.  It's not like McCain who actually has the numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You should go and read the...  There's a big Politico piece this week that caused a lot of fracas online  about how, yes, statistically Hillary is out,  but that she's very easily able to play still being in the race  because it's far more interesting for the media if she is in the race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it certainly keeps attention on the Democrats, doesn't it?  And even if John McCain is meeting with Iraq and President Sarkozy in France,  they still garner the coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is no political analyst in the world that would agree with any of that.  You want to decide on your candidate as soon as you can  so they don't start sniping at each other  and giving the other side ammunition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but the flip side is that, you know,  how much press has John McCain had in the last month?  How much has the Democratic Party had?  Is it good press?  Well, there's no such thing as bad press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, Jonathan Alter in Newsweek is right.  And I'm slowly seeing this idea spread.  There is no way that Hillary Clinton can garner the nomination.  In order to do so, she's not going to have the majority of delegates.  She's not going to have the majority of popular votes.  She would have to sway the super delegates to go against the popular vote  and against the delegate vote.  And at that point, black Americans are going to stop voting Democratic.  They're going to say, we've been disenfranchised,  let alone the young and the others who are supporting it.  No, it would actually force her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They'd have to pressure Obama into taking the vice presidency.  Well, he's saying he's not going to do it, I think, which is a very smart...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I know.  And if you talk to any black people, they all say, well, we vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I've talked to a number of people and they say, you know,  we've always been number two.  We're not going to take, we know it would be bad.  My wife came up with an interesting thing, though,  is if either Obama, I mean, either Hillary beats Obama somehow,  which would have to be kind of a sleazy way of doing it,  like it was described,  that they will have a repeat of those riots that took place in the 60s,  the late 60s.  I think that's not far off.  And I think that there are a lot of also young voters for the first time

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  getting involved who are going to be very disillusioned.  I think the Democrats do that at their peril.  Well, I think Hillary can win the popular vote numerically by,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you know, maybe like five delegates if they have a full recount in Florida  and in Michigan and she wins by over 60%.  She has to win every contest by 60 to 70% to do that.  Why don't we, on this topic, why don't we wait until after Pennsylvania  where we could beat it to death because it's going to be overanalyzed by then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm actually looking at the entry.  They have a ticker right at the top, which is great.  They show, you know, the US, are we in a recession?  $79 up $4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is great.  Clinton winning in Pennsylvania up $0.80.  This is great.  Clinton winning in Pennsylvania up $0.80.  This is great.  Clinton winning in Pennsylvania up $0.80.  This is just like a real stock market.  I love this.  So people put real money into this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and you can do things like weather.  You can do the weather.  And there's actually another...  Weather's dumb.  Don't do weather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it illegal in some way, shape or form?  Yes, it is.  Okay, well, that's all I wanted to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it in Trinidad?  How are they getting away with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even know, but there's another one that is selling futures in weather  to people.  You can sell futures in these things to people who are trying to hedge.  So there is a way to sell the weather right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you might hedge if you were buying oil commodities.  You might hedge the weather just to try to protect your investment, right?  I'm wondering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This number, by the way, is a plus, is out of the country number plus four four.  What country code is that, Will?  England.  Okay, so they're in England.  That's what I thought.  Well, no wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You could bet on anything in England, right?  Oh, absolutely.  In fact, there was a big...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're a nation of gamblers and drinkers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There was a big frou-frou, right, in Britain on Friday about whether the bookies  should have to close on Friday.  Yeah.  Because it's Good Friday, and they say nobody else is closing.  Why should we close?  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When did they become a country that cares about Good Friday to that extreme?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The biggest football day of the season, practically.  Oh, is that why they didn't want to close now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I understand.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The top four teams in the country are all playing each other today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, Jason, do you think that anybody's making a living on Intrade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ooh, that's an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In the same way that you could be a day trader in stocks.  The Intraders are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The guy who owns the site.  They're making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's definitely true.  Well, there's actually another one that's doing just weather, and I forgot the name of it,  but I met the CEO because he is a former Google person, and it's really interesting.  It's really interesting.  He's got people like people who run conferences will do a hedge against a storm or something like that,  and they'll pay, you know, whatever, $2,000 to protect themselves against $100,000,  or people who are ski, you know, ski, you know.  Bums?  Ski resorts.  Ski resorts will do that on prediction markets to make sure they don't lose.  That makes sense.  That's a way to hedge, yeah.  It's a way to hedge, yeah.  I don't remember the name of the weather one, but what happens is you have to click a button,  and what happens is you have to click a box that says I am doing this to, you know,  like hedge against these issues of my business and guarantee that you're not doing it just to bet.  You can't just be like I'm going to bet tomorrow.  I'm going to make money on rain.  Except you can't be a gambler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can see it being sold as insurance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's basically what insurance is gambling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is in some ways, right?  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're gambling that you're going to have a catastrophic illness,  and they're gambling that you won't.  Yeah.  I'm gambling.  But that's what you are.  You're gambling that you're going to die prematurely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gambling Will's laptop is not coming back.  I think that's a safe bet.  Who wants to take me home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm telling you, dishwasher, Will.  80% prediction market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like I haven't lost enough money already today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You want to use a little bit of Cascade.  That's a great detergent.  And then you got a little JetDry that will sheet the,  you don't want any droplets on the screen.  It'll sheet it right off.  It'll be incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm giving 100% chance of an audible commercial right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think you're very, that's a very safe bet.  My, my, you're amazing.  How much money did you put down on that?  That's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm betting 100% that people are going to go right now to audible,  and they're going to get 21 bringing down the house.  The inside story of how six MIT students took Vegas for millions  because the movie's coming out.  And this is an incredible story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Isn't that a great story?  I love this.  Take down the house.  Now you play poker, Jason, so you're probably kind of,  I bet you're the kind of guy they would have gone, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Won $400 last night at a $100 buy-in table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Didn't you swear off poker though for a while?  Two hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not swearing it off.  Are you kidding me?  If I had no job right now to play poker, 10 hours a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See, this is the guy you don't play poker with.  Love it.  This is the guy who takes you.  So what happened at MIT, it was a Blackjack club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was Blackjack, and so what they did was,  and the book goes into a lot of detail,  and you got to go get the audio book because it's amazing.  Oh, I listened to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was wonderful.  Yeah, highly recommend it.  So there was kind of an evil mentor, a Fagan, if you will,  who would scout MIT students for the ones with the best  mathematical abilities.  Right, but it's a pretty simple system, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you do is, if you see a face card, you minus one,  and if you see a regular non-face card,  or under a nine or something, you minus one or something.  And so then you just have to keep one number in your head.  So you're counting the cards as they come in,  you're counting the cards as they come up,  and if you get what's called a charge deck,  which is a deck that has got a lot of face cards left in it.  It's plus a lot.  Yeah, so then you're plus five, plus six,  and I was talking to a guy who actually did it.  He's been on decks that have plus 12, plus 15.  Then you go from betting $25 to betting $2,500 a hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the key is, you do this in a team,  the guy who's counting never bets,  he makes sucker bets, but he somehow has a secret signal  that he calls over the guy who's going to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  And it's not illegal to do,  but it's not illegal for the casino to-  Throw you out on your ass.  ... do service to anybody.  And now you have to count into like five decks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right, and they shuffle up after about a quarter of the way in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it takes you a lot of time.  You might sit there for three or four hours  and not get a charge deck.  You just cost you four hours of your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But that's why they do the teams,  because you don't want to suddenly see  somebody's betting pattern change.  But if somebody stumbles over, maybe he's a little drunk,  and he starts laying down a lot of money.  I got a bet.  Five pounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's very clever, and they did.  They took a lot of money.  It's a great story.  Good choice.  21 is the name of the book by Ben Mesrick.  It is available on Audible, unabridged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's Bringing Down the House is the name of the book.  21 is the film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They renamed the book so that you would notice it.  Oh.  So it's called now, you're right.  But I noticed on Audible, it now says 21.  And on the cover, it says 21, Bringing Down the House.  Very good point.  They changed the name of the film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bringing Down the House.  It's a much better name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know why they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds like a bad thriller.  Yeah, 21.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In a world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then Bringing Down the House kind of seems like a bad  Martin Lawrence comedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wait, I want to hear Jason do his in a world impression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In a world filled with twos and sixes.  Only one man.  And get an ace and a ten.  And that is 21.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Only one man can bring down the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, Kevin Spacey is going to be in that movie,  my good friend.  So that should be good.  You know, we'll get Kevin on the show.  He is a major geek.  And I didn't know he was going to be in this,  but apparently he is.  So that'll be fun.  He'll probably be doing the rounds.  We'll get him on the show.  That is our prediction.  An Audible commercial.  And Jason, you win the pot.  Very good.  Bringing Down the House is our Audible pick of the week.  Now, you've got to know about Audible by now.  Audible is the great place to get your audiobooks.  Instant downloads.  Play them on your computer.  Burn them to a CD.  Play them on many different devices.  It really is a great way to get your reading done.  In our busy lifestyle, it's hard to find time to sit down  with a book.  But I would hate to give up reading.  That's why I love Audible.  A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot com slash twit.  You can sign up and get a credit for a book.  Make it this one.  This will be a great show.  You're going to love this.  Bringing Down the House, the inside story of six MIT  students who took Vegas for millions.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but you could go do it right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  while you're listening to the show.  Oh, yeah.  And just get it and worry about it later.  Just pick two or three books.  Get them in your queue.  And then you have them for when you're on the bus,  where you're stuck online, or you're in your car.  Because at that point, you're going to wish you had gone  to the library.  You're going to wish you had gone to Audible.  So just go right now and get yourself  a couple of great books.  Simple enough.  Simple enough.  So easy to use, too.  It's brain that's simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I admire a guy who knows how to pitch.  He's a pitch man.  He's a pitch man.  But the question that comes to mind is, Leo, have you  ever thought of reading one of these books for Audible  or for some company or for a publisher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going out there to talk with them next month,  because I'm going to try to pitch them on sponsoring  this TwitLive concept I have.  And I'm going to ask them if I could read a book.  Because I would need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do they pay for that?  Do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm going to find out.  I think it's not a bad living.  It's probably nothing like what I'm used to.  But I think it's not a bad living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but I just think it would be cool.  I'm sorry, but I just think it'd be cool, because I think  you have a dramatic voice that would be really good.  It's listenable.  I think somebody could listen for hours to you reading a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm going to read it like this.  We're going to do the next born novel.  And I'm doing the whole thing like Boris Batonov.  It'll be great.  And I'm going to call myself Igor Stravinsky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You've got to teach me that voice.  It'll be fantastic.  You know how I got this voice?  I was on a chess cruise.  You know those geek cruises?  They have chess cruises.  And it was American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was like US champion.  It talks like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're all Russian immigrants to the United States.  And they can't speak English very well.  They're actually great guys.  They were doing these lectures.  But their English wasn't very good.  Mostly what they said is no good for black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What a loser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm John Dvorak, and you're listening to Moby Dick.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some years ago.  Call me Ishmael.  Yeah, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little or no money in my purse and nothing  in particular interests me on shore.  I thought I would sail about a little more in the worried  part of the world.  Was that the Jersey Shore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the thing is, I don't think I could read a whole.  I think I just would get tired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure it's hard work to do it.  Because they edit out all the mistakes.  You can't make mistakes.  Or they fix it, I guess.  And you're sitting in an airtight studio for long hours.  I mean, some of these books are 20 hours.  That would take you weeks, I would think.  But anyway, I'll do a short one.  I'll do like Horton Hears a Who or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, at least find out what the story is.  And by the way, so you immersed yourself  to get that Russian accent.  Oh, it was the Mordesian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would sit with Demediner.  And it's funny, because there was an American champion  on the cruise, and he didn't like the Russians.  So the Russians would sit at one table.  I'm not going to say any names.  But the Russians, if you're a chess player,  you know all these names.  They would sit at one table, and he would sit  at another table with his wife.  And I sat with him once.  He said, yeah, I don't like the Russians.  They treat service personnel terribly.  And I think it really has more to do with the fact  that they took over the American chess world  by beating everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Take mint tea with honey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Get it now.  No, come here, lady.  I got the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think bring mint tea with extra honey.  Bed for black.  Black loses.  I don't want to wait much longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I want to mate in one with you.  So OK.  Playing chess was easy.  We move on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not harder than getting green tea.  Let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK.  I had another story.  Oh, Jeff Bezos, front page of Amazon.  Bezos.  Bezos.  You know him.  I like to say Bezos.  Bezos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you say Bezos, it rhymes with Jesus,  which today is appropriate.  Bezos.  Bezos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apologizes.  Front page of Amazon.  My god.  This is such good marketing.  I am so sorry that we cannot make enough Kindles  to keep them in stock.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't this brilliant?  You practically hear the mini violins playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is just brilliant marketing.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm Jeff Bezos.  And I'm willy, willy, sorry that we didn't make enough.  Does he talk like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm just using any voice that sounds like somebody's talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bezos apparently has a wild kind of laugh, right?  Got the laugh is unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like, it just, it's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's worse than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was in a meeting once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was so loud.  Like my Ariane chair, I was in rollback like a foot.  All 10 people from the table went back.  It's like that Maxell commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Your ears are going flapping.  Unbelievable.  So he says, dear customers, we had, I love this,  we had high hopes for Kindle before its launch,  but we didn't expect the demand that actually  materialized.  We sold out in the first five and a half hours  and have been scrambling to increase our manufacturing  capacity ever since.  We've been shipping on a first come first serve basis,  but many customers have had to wait as long as six weeks  after ordering.  So for those of you who've waited so long,  you have our sincere thanks for your patience.  This is just great marketing, brilliant marketing.  Yes.  What they don't mention is they're capable of making  one an hour or something, right?  I mean, come on, come on.  You can't manufacture these fast enough to keep it with demand.  Does everybody have a Kindle?  What could the demand possibly be?  People are addicted to buying consumer electronics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and it's in their closet now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Why don't they?  Who has one on the show here?  I have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have one, Jason?  I don't.  I have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you have one because you don't count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I re- I use the word, I have one.  You have everything.  Well, that's true.  I don't count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's my job.  I wasn't going to buy one.  I actually resisted buying one.  And then I saw the ship date get later and later and later  and later and later.  And I thought if I don't buy one now,  I'm not going to get it till, you know, six weeks later.  So I did order it.  So you didn't want it, but when you saw other people having it,  you wanted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's sad.  That's one way of interpreting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm going to buy it when half the stuff is sold out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to buy it when half the stuff is sold out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to buy it when it's half the size that it-  half the weight it currently is.  I'm going to buy version two or three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm actually very happy with it.  I use it all the time.  It's- I mean, I use e-book readers anyway.  I use the Sony for a long time.  And I like the wireless, so.  Call me a sheep if you will.  But I have a nice wooly coat in the winter.  Blu-ray encryption cracked once again by those clever guys out  of Trinidad.  I'm sorry, Antigua.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, do the voice.  Give us a Trinidad voice.  We have now unprotected BD+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, never mind.  I can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you doing it?  Come on, we have unprotected it.  Everybody get blu-ray.  That's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thank you.  I just have to get the steel drums in my head, and I can do it.  So apparently, BD+, was a very sophisticated scheme  and very difficult to crack, unlike AACS, which was on HD DVD.  These guys at Sly Software, very good.  They make a program which will copy blu-ray discs.  And they sell it out of Antigua.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So unexpected.  Yeah, right.  You're telling me that somebody cracked the DRM?  Oh my god.  That's astonishing.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They said, admittedly, we are not really so fast.  Actually, I don't think their English is their native language.  His name is Pierre van Heuwen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Admittedly, we are not really so fast with this, because actually,  we had intended to publish this release already in December, as promised.  However, I don't know what accent that is.  That's a made-up accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a combination Dutch, German, who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We don't know.  I'm from an unnamed country in Liechtenstein.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  However, it decided for strategic, now he's Russian, strategic reasons  to wait a bit for the outcome of the format war between HD DVD and blu-ray.  And then they say, you know, we fully expect them to change it again,  but he says, we think we can crack it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, I'm on their website now,  and they don't have it on there for sale yet.  They still have any DVD.  They do?  Yeah, if you get to any DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, here it is. I see it. HD DVD and blu-ray.  And it's got the latest version.  It's got support for moving BD Plus copy protection.  I mean, BD Plus was supposed to be a copy.  I mean, BD Plus was supposed to be Sony's.  You know, that was one of the pictures that Sony had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of expensive. Isn't this thing kind of expensive?  It's $100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Two blu-ray discs.  That's like five pounds over here.  It's only expensive for the states.  Five pounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's 49 euros.  I'm going to check, yes, it's 75 bucks, but it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's about 300 US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and more all the time.  So, no, but I think that, I mean, of course, it's crazy to want a pirate blu-ray discs.  I mean, the blanks themselves cost more than the movie.  You don't do this to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're just ripping it to build a media store.  If you put together a bunch of storage, you just want like 720p copies of what you...  Exactly. This isn't piracy.  You're like psychotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're just like, I mean, if you're taking, it takes like five hours to copy one of these discs, I think.  Like, it's for, it takes forever.  And they're 25 bucks to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're basically...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or 19.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they're piracy proof.  I mean, you know, you'd be nuts to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's it called when you're addicted to committing crimes?  Ekleptomaniac.  Isn't it Eklepto?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't it Eklepto?  That's people that collect things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  A Baron von Munchausen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A mania that's addicted that's actually literally taking stuff, picking it up, and stealing it.  Alright, so same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Criminal addiction is basically, that's what you're basically talking about here.  I mean, if you're going to take 18 hours to figure out how to do this, you're basically just doing it for the sake of doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and I agree.  I've always felt most pirates were that way.  They collect stuff.  They're collectors.  They're junk collectors.  I agree with you.  They have copies of all kinds of weird crap.  They never used it.  I don't count them as against the bottom line.  Oh, we lost so much money because of piracy.  They would have never bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They would never have bought it.  These guys are like, I have all 20 seasons of The Simpsons.  I ripped them myself.  No, I remember very well in the early days of the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I remember a friend of mine, I won't say his name, but he opened his closet door and literally the closet is stacked from six feet tall with floppy disks.  He says, you know, I have every Mac program ever made in there.  You're exactly right.  It's pack rat mentality.  His name is Steve Wozniak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His name is Steve Wozniak.  I mean.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Amazing story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, Woz himself.  I mean, I don't think Woz ever got off being that kind of guy.  Woz is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had like a hamburger with him like a couple of months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Quite the character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God.  He has like a hamburger in front of him, french fries, and he is devouring it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he like, it's got ketchup everywhere.  Every finger is covered with ketchup.  And he's like, Jason.  He literally licks every finger, but he doesn't just lick every finger.  He like swallows like half the finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like half the plate.  I went on a cruise with him.  I ate dinner with him every night for seven nights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know exactly what you're talking about.  He's just like, he loves food.  He loves life.  He lives it with gusto.  He's the Zorba, the Greek of the tech industry.  He's in LA, right?  And I go to meet him with a mutual friend and they're at Bob's Big Mac.

He's Batman in reverse.  Then he's got like seven gadgets on the table.  The ketchup is on the Blackberry.  It's got the Newton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did he bring his cell phone that has a dial interface?  It's an old black phone with a dial interface and it's a cell phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I think I just cursed on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's all right.  I talked over it.  Nobody will ever know.  I didn't hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was listening to last week and you guys were going crazy with the cursing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know.  I don't know what happened there.  Dane, didn't you edit that out?  He bleeped it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did.  The whole show is beep, beep, beep.  And Veronica going, oh guys, guys, bring it in, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She wasn't happy.  That was the last time she's going to be on this show.  She'll never be on this show again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Once Dvorak starts talking about like potty stuff, it's just over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He has kind of a potty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So back to the...  That's not true.  I know.  Back to the evolution of security blog.  I miss here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You miss who?  I miss here.  I miss here things.  People say something.  And I think it sounds like you guys are being dirty and I'm calling you on it.  I have ideas.  I don't know.  How can you miss here if you've never left?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Change the battery in my earpiece.  All right, all right.  My hearing aid.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I'm loving the new TSA blog.  I have to say.  The security blog.  The TSA blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the end of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are you?  This is the funniest thing.  It's called the evolution of security blogger Bob.  Now this guy works for the TSA.  He's made a video now about the MacBook Air.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's in Windows.  I can't play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm laughing about the TSA.  Look at him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look at him.  Look at his picture.  Go to TSA.org.  I'm sorry.  TSA.gov slash blog.  And look at him.  And he says, we were able to get our hands on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw that guy last week at LAX.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We were able to get our hands on a MacBook Air and run it through the x-ray in our lab.  He's got a lab.  My lab.  My suspicions were correct.  The MacBook Air does look completely different than your typical laptop or DVD player.  I can't get into specifics, of course.  But there were a couple of areas of interest that would peak in the x-ray that would peak some interest for TSOs.  That's the security people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this the update Bob screens the MacBook Air?  Yeah.  Look at him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look at Bob.  Bob, you're probably a great guy.  I don't mean to.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the TSA always show up on technology that they're only making the video available in a Windows Media Form.  I can't play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the scariest part of all this.  They've done it in some...  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're addressing the blogosphere and like 0% of the blogosphere is going to watch that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the funniest thing is they even have a screenshot.  It says Windows Media Player on it to play the video.  I don't know what they did here.  I play it and I get a blue screen.  I love the guy at the bottom.  And they're blogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My acting debut on the blog.  I'm not sure if that's ironic or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The blog is published in Word documents actually.  It probably is.  It's a blog post as a Word document.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the good news is he has 544 readers according to Feedburner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is the deal here?  Is this the headline that says evolution of security?  Yeah.  This is the TSA.  It's like a green site.  It looks like something they're selling.  This looks like a brochure for like selling some whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a standard WordPress blog template.  I think it just cracks me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I want to meet the PR company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is like Edelman written.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You should do a blog because if you do a blog,  you'll really convince Americans that you're soft and fuzzy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should join the conversation about security  and how much people hate the TSA for dehumanizing.  You saw the tagline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Terrorists evolve.  Threats evolve.  Security must stay ahead.  You play a firetruck.  You play a fart.  I ain't even lying.  You play a part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You play a fart.  You play a part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You play a part by taking off your shoes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my god.  This isn't a joke, right?  Is this not a joke?  It looks like a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does except for the fact that URLs got .gov.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and if you go to TSA.gov without the slash blog,  you get the TSA.  This is their blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not even proper English, though, because they say  terrorists evolve, period.  Threats evolve, period.  That's not a sentence.  You don't put a period at the end.  It should be a bullet or like a bang between it,  a star or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You need to get in there and give them a little console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's not completely out of the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I mean, it's a, you got a noun and a verb.  They're all fragments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true, but come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  There's a subject and a verb.  That's a, threats evolve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, actually, if there was an exclamation mark,  at the end, it would be a sentence.  It would say terrorists evolve.  Evolve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  Get it?  That's a good point.  Question mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Question mark.  And you could, right, and you could have a question mark.  That would make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just like the title of the post.  Bob screens the MacBook Air.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'd be great if he gave his review of it.  He'd be like, you know, I personally think the solid state  drive, which looks great on the x-ray,  is not worth the $1,200.  It kills me that I can't play this video,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because you know this video has got to be funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you look at the bottom, it says that you couldn't have  that TSA and DHS do not endorse any product referenced  in this video.  And it's like, oh, good, because for a moment,  I was going to go and buy a MacBook Air purely  because it would pique the interest of my local TSA.  Oh, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's an Air.  I love Airs.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm giving, my prediction mark, it  says there's an 80% chance they're  going to interview somebody who weighs 300 pounds from LAX,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  who screams at you when you're on Southwest.  Because every time I go there, this is like 300 pound guy  who's like, shoes are off.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aptops are out of the bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not sure which is worse, though.  That guy, or the guy who thinks he's a Walmart greeter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Duh.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That guy's even worse.  How you doing?  Let's get the bottles.  We're going to work together.  Everything, four ounces.  We can put that back.  It's like, oh, shut up.  And then you're still online.  This is the crazy part.  The line has not moved.  And they start their speech all over again.  Oh, I know.  You've got seven bullet points, and then they start over.  Oh, shoes off now.  That has to be the worst job, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, come on.  That guy who has to say that all day.  I mean, but they don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's worth, both of the points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He doesn't have to say it all day.  So I'm looking at this.  He has to listen to people whining about him afterwards.  So I'm looking at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I'm looking at this post down here.  Diamonds are a passenger's best friend.  Diamond Lane program.  What is this diamond lane program?  Self-select program?  What is this?  Well, now, see, I'm in clear.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This isn't clear, though, right?  This is something separate.  Clear is embarrassing.  You must be a member of clear, Jason,  with all the flying you do.  I've been thinking about it, but.  It's embarrassing.  So you go to SFO.  First of all, you have to, they scan your iris.  They thumbprint all your, fingerprint  all of your fingers.  They do, I mean, it's the most elaborate procedure  to get into it.  And then when you go, you show them your card,  they'll give you a card.  And then when you go, you show them your card,  and they say, OK, put your thumb there.  They never do the iris.  I don't know what that's for.  And then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They think you click on 10 links, and three of them.  Or FBI porn links.  Have to get the seven out of 10 right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, but the FBI has the best porn, man.  So then, then what happens is your concierge comes  and puts all your stuff in a tray  and bulldozes her way to the front of the real line.  Hell yes.  She says, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.  And you feel like a kid.  You feel like a kid.  You're following her, excuse me.  And people are giving you the worst looks.  Yeah.  That's the worst.  I mean, I could feel the daggers in the back.  I'm sorry.  You know, I paid for this.  I didn't know what it was going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They know that I was going to like, yeah,  stick it in your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I thought there'd be a separate line.  I didn't mean to have to interact with you people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yo, sometimes I'll go, and I'll have like a business class  ticket, and there's like 50 people online.  And I don't even go through that shuttle on the side  that's like business.  I'm like, you know what?  I'm just going to get in a line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, we have, thanks to our chat room, irc.dslextreme.com.  Thank you, guys.  They're watching on the Ustream video.  We have the YouTube version of TSA Blogger Bob.  Oh, this is going to be good.  So we can play a little bit of this.  Blogger Bob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bob here from the TSA Evolution Security blog team.  We noticed some blog posts the other day about Apple MacBook  Airs, and it was causing some problems at checkpoints.  So we decided to get our hands on one.  And after looking at it, it is much thinner  than your typical laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Thank you, Blogger Bob.  Blogger Bob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you're also going to notice that it only  has three ports for a big Firewire user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not going to want this laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another thing you're going to want to notice here  is that this is actually aluminum, which is just  like the old G4.  You want to be extra careful with this laptop,  unlike the brushed human steel of the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  You've got to get in.  And one thing for frequent travelers,  you can't remove the battery on this.  Yeah, yeah.  Just a little break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're watching movies, this may not be the laptop for you,  because you're going to need an extra external DVD.  I'm going to try to get that out there.  My theory was it's probably going to be laid out differently

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on the inside than most laptops we're accustomed to seeing.  So this might explain why it gets more scrutiny.  So we were able to get our hands on one,  and we're going to run it through the X-ray  and see what we can find out.  This is a whole new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This would be a great website.  Will it X-ray?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but he got his hands on one.  Will it X-ray?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Talk to Steve Jobs people, and he got us one.  Like the TSA, they were on Mission Impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He got our hands on one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's try it out right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Get Peter Rojas.  It's Bob at the TSA.  Now, Bob is either standing or sitting at the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it Bob from the Gadget?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we're going to talk about it.  Blogger Bob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  99% of the laptops we see look very similar.  But I can tell after looking at the X-ray image of this MacBook  Air, I can see some areas that would peak some interest that  looks very different than what we're accustomed to seeing.  In layman's terms, this uses a different drive  than your typical laptop.  There he goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's going into the review.  Let me just tell you.  The layman's term for it is drive.  You may have heard the variation, hard drive.  What's the variation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a hard disk.  What's he talking about?  Well, it's got the solid state, maybe.  Oh, it's the solid state.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He won't show the X-ray, though, because if he shows the X-ray,  that's proprietary.  Can't look at that.  All right.  Thank you, Blogger Bob.  I feel bad for the poor guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, you know, years ago when the first Toshiba had these light  machines, they still do.  They're 2.2 pounds.  They're lighter than this thing that Apple does.  And they're pretty cool.  And I remember when I had the first one of the R200s,  the early ones.  And they had an extra battery, but it had a battery built in.  If you took the battery off, the thing  was really incredibly light and thin.  It's, again, 2 pounds.  And I remember going through TSA with one of these things,  brand new.  And the way the guy looks at this, he picks it up,  and he says, wow, this laptop's really light.  And then he just passes it.  That was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You don't have to take off your shoes, sir.  You just go right through.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're going to wrap this up, because it is Easter Sunday  and the sun is shining.  And Jason's got a half-eaten hamburger  and some fingers to dip in some ketchup.  And we don't want to keep him from that.  I could talk about the fact that Gibson is suing the makers  of Rock Band and Guitar Hero, because they invented,  apparently, the technology to simulate  a musical performance.  Steve Gibson?  They created the air guitar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Gibson, the guitar maker, says that the guitar controllers  for Guitar Hero and Rock Band infringe on their technology  patent that protects the right to, quote,  simulate a musical performance.  Also known as buttons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what they're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or buttons on them.  I haven't made heads or tails of that, either.  I've been trying.  Every time I see the article, I can't figure out  what the real point is.  What's the lawsuit about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're angry that they didn't come up with the idea.  Actually, that's exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They had a licensing deal with Rock Band.  In fact, if you play Guitar Hero,  if you play Guitar Hero, you know  you could choose from Gibson guitars.  And they had a licensing deal, which they apparently  backed out of and then decided to sue them, Activision  and Harmonix both.  So I don't know what's going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're trying to get a $10 million settlement,  is what's trying to go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's exactly what they want.  Get a little chunk of change.  Rock Band or Guitar Hero?  What are you, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have both at the office.  I like our little Rock Band.  I like our little Rock Band myself because I like playing  with the group.  That's what I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I couldn't get my kid.  My kid said, no, I want Guitar Hero.  How about you, John?  What do you play in the Dvorak household?  Oh, Guitar Hero, of course.  Of course.  Do they have Guitar Hero in Britain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We play cello champion.  It's got a cup champion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm a flugelhorn fella.  We have Guitar Hero, but Rock Band doesn't exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't have Rock Band?  I have no idea why Rock Band doesn't exist.  Dude, Rock Band's the greatest.  I looked at the latest release dates from the UK trade paper  say that Rock Band is coming here in September.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is so fantastic.  The thing that gets me is I can't imagine people spending  $250 for a video game, but they do.  $250 because you have to have the guitar, the microphone,  the drums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you get 50 hours or 100 hours out of the game,  it's a couple of bucks a lot cheaper than going to the movies.  It's so much fun.  Oh, God, it's a party.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a party.  I always like the way you, how cavalier Jason is about spending money.  I know, spending my money.  Yeah, he's going to put another deposit down for a quarter of a million dollars  for some piece of car that's probably not going to even work for a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't need to believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, the Tesla is shipping, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wasn't talking about the Tesla.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are you excited, Jason?  When do you get yours now?  What number are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They only put numbers on the top 100, so I was after that,  but it looks like Q1 next year.  But you never know.  I got some inside hook.  Somebody drops out, I might be able to move up the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that thing just a Lotus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  With an electric engine.  It rebuilt it from bottom up.  At 8 million pounds torque.  Zero to 60 in 4.2 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I drove it, it's fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I showed, I gave a talk to radio executives.  A couple of weeks ago talking about new technology.  One of the things they all want to know is  when are they going to be able to listen to the internet in the car  because then we're dead.  I said, well, actually, they already can if you have one of these cradle points  and the EVDO, but just as a proof of concept,  let me show you a video my friend Jason Calacanis took  of my other friend Robert Scoble peeling off his Tesla.  This is live streaming video from an EVDO connection and a cradle point.  I showed them that video.  They loved it.  They didn't actually want me to continue with the speech.  They just wanted to watch you guys drive around in a Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was pretty epic.  It was very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't say much about your speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The cradle point is an incredible device.  It's only like a hundred bucks.  You plug your EVDO card into it and then you have,  I think you can support eight or 16 devices.  It turns it into Wi-Fi.  Yeah, so I put it up at LAX and I named it Mahalo.com.  Very smart.  I had like eight people.  I was like, oh my God, this is branding.  And so then like when I was at this other conference,  the SES in New York, I turned it on.  Boom, I had like 16 people using it and they were all like,  oh, thanks Mahalo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wi-Fi courtesy Mahalo.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can share your stuff.  Then another guy came in.  I like it.  It's so cool in the cradle point when somebody comes,  you can make a landing page.  So when you first set it up, it's a landing page with a chat room.  So people land and they're on a chat room when they open their browser.  So all of a sudden I see the first guy comes in.  It wasn't called Mahalo at this point.  And he's like, can anybody use this Wi-Fi network?  I was like, absolutely.  Anybody can use it.  And right now I'm downloading your Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And all of a sudden, boom, he just hung up immediately.  I could round the airport to see if anybody was panicking with their laptops,  but it was just too much space.  But it's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now I bought one and I just think it's the coolest thing.  It really is a neat device.  Well, that's what we'll have at the twit house when people come.  It's rechargeable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So when I had it in New York, we were driving in a car.  We had a driver for three or four meetings.  So I was with my guy Tyler.  We both had our laptops out in the car.  I opened up the cradle point.  Boom.  We're driving around in traffic and we got the laptops out doing Wi-Fi.  I was streaming over the Wi-Fi.  It was pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I got to go get some peeps because I can't take it anymore.  But we want to thank everybody for joining us.  A reminder that, oh, I forgot.  I forgot.  Actually, I have to do a special Audible ad, I think, today.

Transcript:  They were having a problem.  I don't know if you noticed this,  but when you would hit the, like you would sign up  to watch somebody or follow them.  Yeah.  I don't know if you ever had it not work  and it sort of timed out.  I think because of all their server issues,  it was timing out for like a month.  And then.  That's why that sudden jump for everybody.  And now everybody's adding all these people  that were backed up.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm glad we couldn't go to the show,  the entire show without gammering about Twitter.  But Jason, listen to what Jason's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's giving away a MacBook Air.  Yeah, great.  It's thin, you know.  Give away a Tesla, Jason,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and I'm going to go to Twitter.  I'm working on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am working on that.  So how does your contest work?  All right, here's the idea.  I had 10,000 people.  I said I want to beat Scoble  and I want to beat Barack Obama.  So if I get to 20,000 people  and number one, I'll give away this MacBook Air.  And number one?  Yeah, has to be number one, has to be 20,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if this is a legal contest.  Thanks a lot, Mr. Attorney Channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course it's legal.  Why don't you send me a Rick Roll, you know.  Let's ask Blogger Bob.  Just saying, just saying.  I'm getting a lawyer.  I appreciate that.  I'm going to get a lawyer to make a page.  And I told everybody it's all, you know,  contingent on me getting a lawyer to make it all work.  But I got that paperwork going  and we'll make it an official contest.  But anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because Barack has 17,800,  you, at this point, have 12,804.  We'll get it done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so it will be to...  So you're 5,000 behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You've not only got to get to 20,000,  but you've got to do it before Barack Obama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll extend it then.  Whatever.  Whenever I get to number one, we'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Scoble is 14,765.  These are people following.  So every time Barack puts out a Twitter  or Scoble puts out a Twitter  or Jason puts out a Twitter,  Jason puts out a Twitter,  12,000 people get it.  12,800 people get it.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so anyway, here's the point.  If I get to the top spot,  then I'll give it away to one of the 20,000.  So you don't have to be the new 20,000.  You can be the old.  But we're going to have some sort of a thing  where you're going to get alerted  and you have like an hour or two to get back to me  so that you have to be actually following me.  Oh, you must be following to win.  You must be following to win.  Right, exactly.  And so here's the thing.  If you think about it like building a mailing list, right?  Building a mailing list of like really high tech people  costs 75 cents a dollar each.  I'm building it for 17 cents each.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you're going to have a 20,000 person list.  $20,000 list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then once you get to know me, you love me.  Oh, he's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the way it's going,  it sounds like you can get five years to 15 too when you're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, it'll be much more interesting  when you start Twittering for prison.  I think that's going to be great.  That's a prison.  Today, Butch called me Sally.  An illegal lottery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to do the official turret thing.  It's just me giving it away to one of my friends.  These are technically my friends.  They're technically your friends.  It says the friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Scoble is at 14,765.  I noticed that he continues.  As you grow, he grows the same pace.  So what kind of a growth curve is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should I join Twitter just to see how...  John, you could get to 12,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look, I just crossed 12,000 a minute ago, by the way.  I'm at 12,004.  I'm only 800 behind you, Calacanis.  John would get 5,000 in the first month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, instantly.  10,000 in a month too.  But you have to post, John.  You can't just go on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Every day you have to say something pithy.  Can I find...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  Remember how you said blogs would never work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and they were terrible and then you launched one?  And now you're saying for a year that Twitter is terrible  and now you're going to launch one.  So it's pretty much a good indicator  of when something has reached the mainstream.  That's when you flip.  That's true.  When John flips, it's mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's basically like when white people start using hip-hop terms  you know their house.  Then nobody in hip-hop wants to go anywhere near it.  Thanks for the analogy there, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good one.  No, John, you should join.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It would be great to have you on there.  That would be fresh, John.  It would be stupid fresh.  Funky fresh.  Oh, wow.  So just so you know, Jason on Twitter is Jason Calacanis.  So you go to Twitter.com slash Jason Calacanis  and you can follow him.  He doesn't need any more publicity.  I want to encourage him because I'm going to beat him  even though he's given away all that stuff.  You're going to beat me.  You're going to beat me.  I'm Twitter.com slash Leo Laporte.  We'll not give Scoble's address out.  Will, are you on Twitter?  You're on Twitter.  I see you all the time on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Twitter.com slash Will Harris.  One L.  I just started doing it again.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We can't go a show without talking about Twitter.  John, what are you going to give away if people go to  devorek.org slash blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll come up with something better than the MacBook Air.  In fact, if I give a MacBook Air out for first place,  I'd have to give two out for second place.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a long way to go for that joke.  I'll give you some free advice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is it?  Don't take any wood pickles.  Dorek.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I still like, call me Ishmael.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Call me Ishmael.  That's good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Will Harris is the head honcho at his very own television  channel on the internet.  It's called ChannelFlip.com, and it's getting bigger and  better than ever, and it's definitely well worth  checking out.  Mr. Harris, it's great to talk to you.  I'm sorry about your laptop.  I hope that works out for you.  You and me both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, compelled to use a MacBook.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  World web MacBook keyboards are filled with blazing hot black  coffee.  One man stands alone.  And then, again, his coffee.  Another twist.  Is cutting vegetables.  It's in the can.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like a thousand people just said hello to me.  Hello.  They're all saying, hi, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Brack in losers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They can hear you, too, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  That's why I'm joking with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  400 people with no life other than the IRC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know what's sad?  As many of these people that actually been watching me do a  radio show since 11 this morning.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's hard to believe it.  Count me as one of those.  Round the board.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
