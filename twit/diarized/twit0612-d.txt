Transcript:  I'm going to tell you, I did not enjoy this. The sensation of having a chair lean backwards and recline while a monitor was over my face,  because I know how I feel when I accidentally drop my phone on my face when I'm laying down and tired.  So I just the idea of that thing crashing down and slamming me in the face is not great. I don't love it.  And also, I don't want to work laying down. I want to take a nap when I'm laying down.

Transcript:  I love that. That's thank you, Skype.  So this was the week of earnings, Amazon and Microsoft and Google via its alphabet.  And all three of them actually did very well in the cloud.  This was the quarter the cloud showed its strength, both at Amazon.  Now Amazon, you can't really judge from, because Jeff Bezos has a big knob or a lever or something in his office.  It has profit on one side and debit on the other.  He decides exactly how much he wants to make in any given quarter.  Total net income up to $724 million. A million with an M. Million. Nothing.  But a lot of it from cloud.  Microsoft's Azure cloud business grew 93% year over year, almost doubled year over year.  And that made a big difference in Microsoft's bottom line.  Google, which makes, of course, most of its money in advertising and made a huge amount in advertising, still did pretty well with the cloud platform.  They said in their analyst call, Ruf Porat, their CFO said, the fastest growing business, one of the company's fastest growing businesses was the Google cloud platform.  Although really, Google, you want to hear numbers.  Google's ad revenue has doubled since 2012.  In 2016, it had 32.8% of the total ad revenue.  But that totaled, let me see if I can find the number, just a massive profit for Google and big growth, I think almost 20% growth over this year, last quarter this year.  So, yeah, big, big, big, big business. Big, big business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  So why is it that why is it that rich middle aged men go to they fly their own planes or make their own plane?  They've always got to get into flying. Right.  How many times do you wake up in the morning and read the news and, you know, 55 year old so and so was flying his plane from here to there and crashed it?  It's flying or it's yachts.

Start time: 523.94
End time: 542.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then if you're a yachtsman, there's a couple of things you do.  We worked for Paul Allen when we worked at Tech TV.  And very famously, he built a submarine in his yacht.  And so there's apparently there's companies that make submarines for rich people.  I don't mean like little submersibles. I mean submarines.

Start time: 542.00
End time: 549.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 550.02
End time: 576.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Millionaires play with planes.  All right. There's you've got to get it right.  Right. If you go down onto the French Riviera or down onto the Greek down in the Greek islands, you can see all the yachts pulled up.  And that some of them have not just the submarine, but two tenders.  So two little boats as well so that if they come into the harbor and they want to go to the other side of the harbor, they get in the boat and drive across the harbor.  They don't walk around or catch a taxi. They get a special boat put out over the side.  I'm just waiting for the flying boats.

Start time: 581.42
End time: 599.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's I mean, the funny, the funniest thing was we were told that Paul Allen built his boat with a submarine in the belly because he didn't like to jump when he scuba dived.  He didn't like to jump in the water.  He liked to emerge into the water.  So got to make it so.

Start time: 601.29
End time: 635.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No words. Yeah.  Look, if I was a Silicon Valley billionaire along in the vein of a Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos, I mean, look, the rocket stuff I get like let's all go to space.  But also I'd be putting so much money into having robot servants like humanoid robots.  That's that's the thing I want.  That's the sign of true wealth to have little robot service that looks just like you.  You make like a little bunch of robot clones walking around your house like, Hello, Ashley.  So nice to see you today. Oh, hi, Ashley. Thank you.  Thank you. I do look fabulous.  Like, yes, that's what I want.

Start time: 681.20
End time: 707.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This one is Paul Allen's.  Under the radar.  And he built it to look like the Beatles yellow submarine.  Wow.  It can stay underwater for a week.  It's not as big. It's only 40 feet.  He also owns a $200 million yacht called octopus,  which has two helicopters, seven boats, a crew of 60,  and costs $384,000 a week to keep running.  But I love it that he built his submarine as the yellow submarine.  I think that's Paul likes rock and roll, right?

Start time: 707.06
End time: 710.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  I bet you the crew, he pays them to sing that every time he gets in there.

Start time: 718.04
End time: 728.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, he doesn't have to pay them to sing it  because he has a recording studio down there as well.  With a full-time engineer because anytime he wants to go down there,  he wants to be able to play.

Transcript:  So more to the point.  Sergey Brin is building, this article came out this week, a blimp.  They rent the old NASA Ames blimp dirigible, what do you call it, hangers?  Hangers, yeah.  Which were created during World War II to house dirigibles  until the Hindenburg kind of put the kibosh on the whole thing.  That was terrible.  Yeah, but of course that was pre-World War II,  but that was because it was later there made out of hydrogen,  which as everyone knows is kind of explosive, but slightly flammable.  But you put helium in these things, you don't make your talk funny,  but it doesn't explode.

Start time: 778.14
End time: 788.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Germans used hydrogen because that was the only gas they could get involved.  They couldn't get helium.  But the Americans always used helium because they have a naturally occurring source.

Start time: 789.00
End time: 790.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 791.16
End time: 813.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry, some nice Bloomberg lady is talking, never mind.  So this is the hangar, although that blimp is not Sergey's blimp,  this is 1934 when blimps were big.  And that hangar though still stands, and so he could build it in there.  I've often wondered, he rented the hangars, why not?  You know, why not?

Start time: 815.61
End time: 829.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm a big fan of that, why not?  I mean, he's got, if it's not coming out of the pockets of,  you know, it's obviously coming out of our pockets in some way.  But, you know, if I give up a little of my privacy so that Sergey can fly around in a blimp,  I guess that's all right.

Start time: 830.00
End time: 832.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty clear he hasn't yet taken it out for a spin because we would know.

Start time: 833.70
End time: 841.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We would see, yeah, I mean, unless it's, oh my god, what if it's an invisible blimp?  Oh my god!  I take it.

Start time: 1493.08
End time: 1522.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like, yeah, like I don't need them.  Well, you can see the reflection here  that I do have a prescription in there.  I don't need them to see close-up.  So technically right now I could take them off  and be fine and read stuff online.  But I need them to see far away.  And I actually have three pairs  of these glasses.  I bought the last two pairs  that LA Eye Works ever had.  They discontinued them last year.  And they called me and said,  They called you?  They know it's your trademark.

They go, Well, she's not wearing any lenses  when you see some pictures of me and things.  I actually have what I call a  stunt pair that doesn't have  lenses in it for photo shoots  and some other appearances because  of the glare.  I'm getting such an education here, Leo.

Start time: 1609.18
End time: 1651.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a crazy thing. I don't know why.  I do need them and I love them deeply.  Twitter is terrible.  I think people also can't believe that I would  choose these glasses for myself because a lot of  people are afraid of a bright  bold pair of glasses.  But I learned after  trying these on for the first time, I felt  like I put on Superman's cape.  It was amazing. I'd always  wear black glasses.  Then I tried these on and I loved them so much.  Someone told me at that store  that I bought them from,  she said your glasses should always match your  insides. I thought that was really cool.  I kind of live by that now.  When I buy new glasses, I'm like, do they  match my fun personality?  They should match your personality, not your clothes  every day.

End time: 1708.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't show him ever again. That's it.  I don't think  really this is a guy  thing exactly. The idea is it's an Amazon  Echo, but it has a built-in camera  with LED light.  It can shoot stills or video  and then send that information back  to Amazon.  For what, Ashley? What is it going to do to help me?  They have a feature

Start time: 1709.22
End time: 1736.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  called Style Check.  You can send two different outfits,  two pictures of two different outfits to Amazon.  They have a deep machine learning  algorithm and a computer algorithm  and some actual  supposedly fashion  oriented human  beings behind  Style Check that will compare  and contrast your two outfits and then give you back  sort of a, this one is  64%. This is the look  you should go with. See, if they had a human

Start time: 1741.00
End time: 1770.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's sort of the point that Amazon wants to do  at some point. Like, you'll have,  they do have human sort of stylists,  but then they're sort of  offsetting the cost of that,  you know, human by using  machine learning to sort of learn  what you like to wear and what your  style is. And then when you log into Amazon, of  course, Amazon is  going to recommend you all  of the great clothes that it sells  so that you can buy it and it knows  your style and it knows what you like  to wear. It has a

Start time: 1853.10
End time: 1860.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it looks like. Yeah, I don't think so.  I think it's more like a dot.  Don't you think this is like a dot?  Just looking at the size of it, the Echo is a big

Maybe my wife would be  into it, but she's also creeped out about  machines just getting into  every aspect of our lives.  I'm not sure. I don't think I'll be buying this at all.

Teenagers coming into  adulthood, like maybe in high school,  but it needed to be cheaper.  I feel like if it were $99  and maybe  $99, it feels like it's a little  too expensive for the set that it should  be for, which is a generation  of kids who are literally  plugged in and sharing pictures of everything  they do every second of every  day. Maybe we don't understand  that as much. I  know that I don't use social media to share  every bit of minutiae of my day.  But this is for the YouTube haul

They'll set up a whole set  so that their look can take pictures of them in a  very specific place in their house  or apartment. That is  to me, 100% of them.

Start time: 1987.36
End time: 2012.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I disagree with that. That crew is not going  to use the crappy camera in a $200  piece of rubbish that Amazon's  going to flog to everybody.  It's literally a way to sell more rubbish,  right? What Amazon needs  is a bunch of data  to feed the machine learning algorithms that it  needs to do. So it's got a bunch of humans behind  there, fashion consultants, whatever you like.  But it's never going to take  pictures at a sufficient quality that the  YouTube beauty vlogger.

That's a way for them to do  that and share it with their friends and  do these sort of little short videos and  things like that of a 360.  They don't have yet Instagram husbands  to take their photos for them and  stuff. That's literally  exactly who this is for, I'm telling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're able to do similar things  too. So I think this camera is meant  to replace some of those, like the people just taking  a photo in front of the mirror.  But I think that would be much more useful and that  would, that sort of visual data would be  good for Amazon too. So I'm not sure  who needs this hardware yet.

Just to  nerd out on this a little bit, is that YouTube  is full of all this fashion data.  And Google can go in with  its machine learning and its pseudo  artificial intelligence and start  mining the data sets that it's got from YouTube  to start putting this data together. So if it  decides that fashion is its thing,  then it can just take that data and do that. Amazon's  got to build a data set. So how  do you get pictures of fashion?  And in fact, this is going to build a very  beautiful data set  for training machine learning  because you're going to get real people  in fixed forms,  like in the home, trying on different  outfits and colors and things.  And you're going to be able to build the most comprehensive  data set for feeding into the  ML algorithms to get recommendation  engine coming out the other side. It's a great way  of exploiting.

Transcript:  front door so I could do it right before  I'm locked out and be like, do I look good?  That's what I want to do. And then also, it's like, maybe I could  take a picture as a kind of  pseudo security camera, like someone walks in  and take a picture of them. Well, that's interesting

Transcript:  That's exactly right. Right. You could have it have,  it could have skills later. I mean, any  Amazon Echo with  a camera could be used for a variety  of different skills. You know, Alexa,  they did say, we're going to expand  the skills on this and  sorry to anybody who has an echo  at home. Say echo. I'm triggering it. I'm sorry.

Transcript:  Yeah. So  this is a really interesting  kind of move by Amazon and it feels like,  you know, and I know  that on CNET, we had a little bit  of a scoop this week that was like, you know, maybe  Amazon's working on a touch screen  version. Interesting.

Start time: 2209.02
End time: 2224.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, there's some  evidence that maybe there's going to be a market for that because  Microsoft, when they announced  that they were going to put Cortana  in a similar device, said that  part of the specs for such a device would be  a touch screen. Right.  I'm not sure why you want a touch screen.

Start time: 2225.00
End time: 2228.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why would you want a touch screen when you're controlling  it with your voice? But yeah.

Start time: 2229.73
End time: 2261.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, because it's to close  the feedback. Once you control something with your voice,  like when you work with Siri on your phone  or your  Echo, the feedback  loop is really poor. You don't have  any sense of when something goes wrong.  There's no way of saying to Echo,  you know, or Google or whatever it is  that this isn't right. And when you  have a touch screen, you can actually  close the feedback loop and say, was this accurate?  Yes, no. And also because it's  a screen, it can be reformatted and  redapted as time goes by. You're not stuck  with just one way of doing something.

Start time: 2261.00
End time: 2282.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. On the Fire TV, actually, when  you use Echo, there are little cards that pop  up that give you more information than just the  voice feedback. So that could be a fail.  I'm not super excited about that. I'm wondering  though, we haven't seen too many cameras  kind of targeted inside  bedrooms or where your clothes would be.  This seems like a crazy hacking  opportunity and a really gross one  too. So we'll see.

Transcript:  But I also would  like, I don't think if I  set up,  I signed up for an invitation  and I don't think I would ever  set this up in a place where I was getting dressed.  Like more than  it would more be a place where  because you might share your  pictures. So it's like, oh, well, I would put it  in a place where I would be able to walk up to it  like a full length mirror in my  office or whatever where it's like I walk up to it  and do my picture and then I walk away.  For people in your business,

Start time: 2313.24
End time: 2334.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it would be hugely  valuable when we used to do tech TV  and when we had a stylist, they'd  take a picture of everything you wore  and put it in a notebook with the date and  everything so that you would know and you wouldn't repeat  and if something didn't work, you wouldn't use it. I mean  that is valuable information. I could see Amazon.  I mean, I think there's  a lot of people, it's mostly women I would imagine,  but there's a lot of people who would be very interested

End time: 2392.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think people, I think it'll start  slowly, but  I do think, I think right away  it won't be in stock. It'll be like  the original Echo. I mean, it was like  it took how long? Months before people  were able to just buy them. So I think it'll be similar  to that. I think Amazon is  very smart making this sort of an invitation  only thing so that way  if they undersell it, they don't have to  admit that to anybody. So  that's always a really good  strategy sales wise.

Start time: 2601.02
End time: 2624.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  of interesting trends. I don't really want to ask somebody  in the department store, like, hey, does this look good on me?  Because I don't know if I trust them.  I don't know what their fashion sense is.  But if a computer is learning about  my fashion and saying, OK, yes,  this looks better on you than this, then  maybe I trust a computer a little bit more.  But also, like my Twitter bio  says, I want to be a robot when I grow up. So  there you go. Right. Well, at least you'll have a robot  dressing you. Yeah.

Transcript:  I was reading some research this week about how  long retail will last.  And what they're  finding out is that you only need  to lose 25% of your current business.  Oh, man. And your whole company  goes out of business. Yikes. Because  the costs of your retail  are fixed, right? And the margin.  So as soon as you lose 25% of your business,  you might as well just close up shop and walk away.  So Amazon only  has to beat its competitors. It doesn't have to  blow them out of the water. It just has  to keep lowering the ceiling to the point where  there's no, where the ceiling meets the floor.  And then these people are dead. 25%.

Transcript:  So there's a couple of interesting trends here. One is  echo entering verticals.  And this is, of course,  if you're Amazon, the very first vertical you'd enter.  This is the most lucrative vertical. It's  right down their alley. But I can see other verticals.  It's also interesting because it ties  into, and this is  where Snapchat's done so well, individuals  creating their own content.  And  this is  something I'm kind of intrigued  by. It's the trend  we've been moving in the direction of.  When blogging first started, the old idea of everybody  would have a blog and everybody could create  content and YouTube came along. Everybody could create videos.  It's getting easier  and easier with Snapchat,  Instagram. Everybody is becoming a  content creator. Now you  got a camera that's already  connected to the internet that's ready  to take your picture. Your Instagram husband ready  and waiting at any time.  And I can see it in other verticals, too.  I wonder if Amazon's going to  start slicing off  these vertical markets, starting  with the most lucrative.

Start time: 2794.07
End time: 2821.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And more importantly,  Amazon has no profit motive. It's convinced  its investors that it can build  for growth over a seven year cycle.  So you look  at somebody like, well I'm trying to think  of some retail names in the US.  Macy's and Nordstrom's and that sort of stuff.  Is that right?  So those people have to deliver 20%  of their profits back to their investors  as dividends every year.  Whereas Amazon says, I can take that 20% and put it  back into this thing that we're talking about.

Transcript:  So if people want to know more about this,  have a search on YouTube for Scott Galloway,  How Amazon is Dismantling Retail.  I'll try and send you the link.  The chairman just mentioned that as well.

Start time: 2853.00
End time: 2859.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's a professor of marketing  at NYU.  So he did a 25 minute video.

Start time: 2859.04
End time: 2913.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Around about the 10 minute mark, he gives you a demo.  One of the more invidious  or tricks that's going to happen is  variable pricing.  So what Amazon is, is when you go  onto the Amazon Echo  and say, and he does a demo  of this live on stage actually,  he says, give me the price of some batteries.  And it comes back with a price.  And it says, but when I did this yesterday,  gave me a price that was a dollar extra.  And so one of the interesting things is  once Amazon's got you captive,  you have this interesting situation  where Amazon can give you prices that vary  over time.  And it's just amazing  what they do to do this.  And there was a Washington Post article  I think, hopefully I can find it.  Let me try. Talking about the same thing  about the death of fixed pricing  and how Amazon is leading that  and how much of a change that's going to make  to society.  They're so interesting.

Start time: 2913.00
End time: 2984.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Their algorithms and how algorithmically  driven all the pricing and all the moving  is going on in Amazon.  I have a friend who sells through Amazon.  More increasingly, stuff you buy  on Amazon is not sold by  and often not fulfilled by Amazon.  They're just a storefront  for people selling  content all over the world.  He sells an air purifier  that he  got made in China  to his specifications.  Got his brand right on it.  Sells it on Amazon.  And he noted  that all of a sudden  his sales tanked. He investigated  and found out that Amazon  was selling his product  itself.  And then he changed,  he dropped his price below Amazon's price.  And then Amazon's price didn't go  down. It went up.  And he had  some theories about this. But clearly  algorithmically they were deciding  whether they should compete with him or  instead offer the product at a higher price,  make fewer purchases,  but make more money on them.  And it's all happening  as you say, Greg, over periods  of minutes. That's right. This article,

Start time: 2985.06
End time: 2992.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  spice triples. Yes, of course.

Start time: 3003.00
End time: 3073.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As soon as Christmas is over the price goes through the floor  and the variable pricing is literally so.  This idea of going to the supermarket to buy  a can of pumpkin spice, which you expect to pay  $2 for  365 days a year, might be going away.  And what are the impacts of that?  But what Scott Galloway is pointing to in  his thing is not only is pricing going to be  variable and changing at any given  point in time, it may well be that once  Amazon knows that you're a white  middle class successful male with an  income over a six figure  income, your price might be $10.  But if you're coming from a lower socioeconomic  group, then maybe the price that it'll sell you the product  is $6. That's the first one.  And the second one is what you're leading to in your previous  part is about the death of brands.  So today we have Procter & Gamble  and Unilever with these massively  successful brands built around branded  toilet paper and branded laundry detergent  and trusted by millions  and blah, blah, blah.  But if you go onto an Alexa  or a Google Voice or  one of these Assyrians say, Siri, buy me  some washing liquid, which ones  are going to ship you?  Why doesn't it just ship you the  Amazon no name brand  where Amazon takes an 80% profit margin  for minimum effort and bam,  the brands are dead.

Start time: 3075.12
End time: 3096.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Scott talks about that in his video  as well with the, I'm going to have to watch  this video. This is actually quite  fascinating. He actually  gave it at an Amazon  L2 clinic. Here's the example he uses with  the baby wipes where it's basically  an agnostic  Alexa, buy batteries.  I do not want Amazon  Basics batteries. No.

Start time: 3097.79
End time: 3114.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

And Alexa  says, here, here at price  of Amazon Basics batteries is $7.99.  Do you want me to order them for you? He says  no. And Alexa says I have nothing else  to give you. Wow. So you  can only have whatever Alexa going

Rather than trying to remember putting it on a list  inevitably I'll forget.  Three days later, I go, oh, I needed  batteries. No. I just  so I order everything that way.

Start time: 3239.20
End time: 3247.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but they don't. Well, they make more  money on basics, but then of course they do  want brands to do business with them.  So I'm sure it's probably a bit of a balancing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  act. No, not at all.  What they want is brands that they can dominate.  Today's brands, Procter & Gamble is  bigger than Amazon. Well,  they have, you know, customers  are demanding the brand. So Amazon  has to sell it on the terms that  the brands have. Walmart has that

Start time: 3263.20
End time: 3272.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  kind of clout too. And Walmart absolutely  strong arms the brands. But  I've got to think the brands fight,  try to fight back in some way.  I don't know how they would. You know, where are you

Start time: 3273.02
End time: 3329.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  going to go to fight back? Yeah, that's  right. How are you going to fight back? Go back to TV.  Where do you go? Yeah.  Like in those Amazon results that we're talking about,  let's just jump right back to where we were at the first article.  Amazon's ad revenues grew by  like 100 percent in the quarter.  And they're now the fourth  or fifth largest online advertising  provider. And the only  place they advertise is on their own sites.  So you want to think about  that in terms of how much money they can make out  of just advertising on Amazon  and then how that feeds  into this loop. So they  can actually drive the brands out of business  because the only place brands can  achieve that 25 percent, right?  Keep in mind that you can still sell stuff through  Walmart and Macy's and not whatever those  supermarkets are.  But you've still got to get that extra 25 percent  to be in business. And Amazon  is going to have that. And they're going to have them by  the short and curlies. And then if they can say, well,  you know, we'll just promote our own brand,  then, you know, where does, where do

End time: 3368.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in the end. I see, but no.  Because what it'll allow is the emergence  of new types of brands that are internet  only. So why are you  buying Tide Soap from  Procter & Gamble with a 60  to 80 percent markup?  So take for example,  you know, these food delivery services,  right? That like Uber and Deliveroo  and all that sort of stuff. And what  is happening now is in  certain locations like New York,  there are restaurants that are not  restaurants. They're just a factory  that produces food for delivery.  Right. Right. Right. They have one

Transcript:  no, no, no, no. It's just literally  Yeah, it's basically a pop  up. It's they're somebody who does  this in an  industrial estate. Yeah, they do it in  an industrial area in L.A.  And they make amazing food. Like  the reviews on Yelp are unbelievable.  But they only take orders till a certain time  and it's all delivery only. Because the food is custom designed

Start time: 3391.46

Transcript:  for home delivery on the back  of a courier. Right?  So instead of lamenting the  death of the live restaurant and, you know,  and or maybe just having some food  that you get a bit of a lift in sales by selling  some out the back door to a delivery driver.  What you do is you change the business  model and you set up an industrial  building with a commercial kitchen  and you create food that is only  for sale by couriers.  That's the emergence of new business models. And that's  you know, the secret of everything we do  about the Internet. Right.  Are we going to talk about ebooks at all  and how ebooks have dropped away by  30 percent?  We've had several articles this week talking about  massive drops in ebooks. And the  publishers were beating their chests and saying, you know,  rise of the paperback book. It's here  because ebook sales have dropped by 17 percent.  No.  Yeah. Right. But what they're conveniently  leaving out is  that you  cannot, is that  as much as the publishers are selling,  the independent authors are now  selling directly to customers. That's right.  That's what's happening. And so the  publishers might be selling 17 percent  ebooks, less ebooks, but I promise you  the market is much, much larger.  And I found some statistics on that  which I could share with you  today. Trent Griffin  was showing me the statistics. He's saying  indie self-published books  and regular retail books are something  in the order of 500,000. Small  to medium ebooks is 200,000.  And Amazon publishing is 300,000.  So what you're saying is the big five publisher  ebook sales is 250,000.  Indie self-published  plus indie self-published full books  is three times the size of  big five publisher sales.  So a 17 percent...

Transcript:  That all comes back to, I mean,  even the shopping thing, Leo and  Greg is like, it's  a matter  of like, I tend not to go do my shopping  at department stores because I want to find  and I have the ability  to find individuals  who are self-publishing,  making their own clothing lines,  starting up their own beauty brands  that are smaller, more curated  and more designed towards me  as a customer as opposed to a really  large group of people.  And then for everything else, well, Amazon  Basics is fine. But it's like  there are those certain things that I'm like,  I want something very highly curated.  And now more and more we're having  the ability to do that. It's, you know,  there are even companies that are now making  shampoo and conditioner that's specifically  made for your  type of hair. You like to answer a quiz  and then they custom mix it and  send it to you. And I mean, this is like  this sort of...

Start time: 3559.16
End time: 3580.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Because I don't think  you can really scale on  the low end anymore in such a way  that would compete with an Amazon.  And I think that that's sort of the...  That's kind of the really weird  evolution of what's going on right now.  I think a Walmart or an Amazon  is, you know, if you don't play ball  with them and you want to scale,  they're going to eat your lunch.

Start time: 3617.04
End time: 3656.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the point is that you might  well be using Amazon as a delivery  mechanism. So if you're using the Amazon  online shopping experience, so  you're seeing the emergence of startups  now who build a product and the only  place you can buy it is on Amazon.  Now that is a change in the retail where  sure, you're out there marketing  and reaching users and driving  sales and engagement. But when they  want to buy it, so I bought some vitamins  this week. And  I went to the company's website to check  them out. I checked them all out. And when I went to click buy,  I just went to Amazon's website. That is a  perfect example of a  change in business model where before  they would have had to have a warehouse  and a distribution mechanism, blah, blah, blah.

Start time: 3657.00
End time: 3660.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you may not like them, but most people say, oh,  hey, this is even better. I know, I  do this. If I could buy a product  from Amazon or from the vendor,  I'll always buy it from Amazon as the price is the  same just because I know Amazon. I trust Amazon.  Well, the point is, they have  my credit card.

You have to somehow  find an audience and have the audience  find you. And that's what influences are

You need somebody like Amazon,  somebody with warehouses.  Sure. That makes sense.  And that's going to all centralize through probably  Amazon. But if you're  a podcaster or  you're an author,  I mean, Devindri,  you're a writer.  As a writer, I would think that this  offers all sorts of interesting possibilities.

Well, our GDP in California, I think, is really  close to France. So I think actually it's kind of  the same. So, but...  But if you look at just sheer scale,  there are a lot of  people who try businesses  and fail. And so...  And I do think that because we have  a very  capitalism-friendly  country, I think that that  is an encouragement. I think  that to see these guys  like Bezos and...

And as  time goes by, Australia has  become Americanized. So, through my  say 20s to 30s,  Australia was becoming increasingly  Americanized. And then there was this  distinct shift into Asia. So,  Australia realized that America  really didn't want to be  a, it's a love-hate  sort of a, you know, we love you this year, but not  so much next year sort of thing. And so,  Australia turned much more towards Asia. So, now  you have this culture which is very rich because  you've got Asian influences  very close ties with the Americans,  but a foundation in the European cultures  or specifically the English culture.  And it actually ends up  it's not sufficient to make a  generalization that Australia is very  Americanized when it's actually much more  Asianized currently.

And then  Apple has reduced the  yeah and then one of the fascinating  things that's coming to me is this Apple reducing  its affiliate fees from 7%  to 2.5%. If what we talked about  is valid and true  and I'm not sure, you know, I thought we all  agreed to it to some extent. I think so. Why would  Apple suddenly reduce its affiliate fees  and not encourage  influences and for people to engage  and participate in promoting their products? So I've  talked to a number of tech blogs

Start time: 4365.57
End time: 4402.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  maybe Devinder has some  input on this too. A number of tech blogs  that a significant amount of their revenue  comes from  links to the app store  and the tech blog. And they used to  make 7% of the  money made by  purchasing that app.  Apple on May 1st will lower it by  64% to 2.5%.  And now  that's not going to affect you and me buying  apps. It's not going to affect the company selling the apps  but it may very well affect  a number of publications  for instance that use these affiliate  fees for revenue.  Devinder, you have any thoughts on that?

Transcript:  Those sites rely on affiliate links  a lot. This was a weird announcement  because it just seems incredibly petty  in a way.  Is Apple trying to cut costs?  The app store is one of their big  money makers. It would make sense to  encourage more growth there.  Or maybe they don't feel like they need to.  Maybe it's so big now they don't need to really  sweeten the pot for these people.  Federico Vetticci.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  its affiliate fees too, right? I mean that used  to be a great way to make money. I think they restructured a lot of it.  In fact, as an author  I made more money from Amazon if you  bought a book on my website than I did  from the publisher. That was more than  my royalties.  Which is a sad commentary  in the state of royalties. But I think Amazon  has dropped those as well. So maybe this is just  they can? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that. It may also be  and I've seen this. You see this  not so much with the apps but you see it with  antivirus companies. A lot of  antivirus companies pump up  their sales by using these kinds  of affiliate fees and there's kind of  resellers. And what you  get I think is a lot of sketchy  websites and kind of sketchy  or suspect marketing techniques.  Maybe  Apple felt like it was losing control  of how apps were marketed.  There's certainly some people

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  who game the system.  I mean it's like and have these sort of  propped up websites.  But the thing is there I'm sure  there are a lot of those. I'm sure Apple wants to  you know obviously curb that.  But there are in the process like you were saying  I mean there's a lot of sites like  Touch Arcade who writes great reviews  of iOS and Android  games.  They will suffer tremendously  because of that. I mean that's that.  It's not all of their revenue  but it certainly is a good chunk of it.  And you know you don't want to lose writers  on a site like that. You don't want to lose people  who are hardworking just because  Apple cut it you know cut it a certain  percentage. But yeah  I mean I it's a bummer.  It's a real bummer. I feel bad  for all of the sites that are on the up and up  and really just need that money to survive  that are you know I think being punished  a little bit because of some  less than  less than pure actors  in the space.

Transcript:  indirection. The companies in Taiwan and China  that make the chips are paying Qualcomm  license. So now  Apple can't go and beat Qualcomm  up directly. And that's a brilliant  piece of business maneuvering. I mean  Qualcomm is one of the masters of sharp  business tactics and quite honestly  couldn't happen to a nicer company.  Qualcomm has been beating up  on its customers for quite some time  and is not well liked.  It's done a number of things like Verizon  and AT&T have had a run in with Qualcomm  over the CDMA technology a few  years back. It's consistent.

Jimmy Wales, guy  who created Wikipedia  is now creating a new news site  or trying to crowd fund  a new news site called Wiki Tribune  that will... it's annoying journalists  because they are having to work with  real people to  create these articles.  The idea is... and I actually  put some money into this so here's a disclaimer.  Journalists  will write the stories but then  much as Wikipedia  uses independent contributors  people  who... grammar checkers,  fact checkers,  fact finders, whistleblowers  will then contribute to the story  equally.  Which I think... okay  Devendra you're a journalist. What do you think of this?  Is this a good plan?

Transcript:  I just wonder how this is not going... because the thing  is... facts...  like we've  seen facts tend  to be considered...  like it's so  bizarre. This whole thing has been so bizarre  to kind of live through.  The whole fake news thing.  But it's like, yeah, when you have something that is the truth  regardless of what side  it helps. Sometimes it helps  one side over the other. And so people  weaponize that.  I would love...  I'm very curious to see  how this particular  project  makes an effort to  not become weaponized. Because even  ProPublica now, like you said, they're finding  their voice. But some people are  arguing that that is...  Oh, well, you've become liberal now.  And so  it's a really...  It's a hard problem.  It's tough to combat.  People...  Even before the internet, people would believe  things they heard in a town  about somebody else, a rumor, things like  that. So, I mean, fake news is not all  that old.  It's just really prevalent now online  where it wasn't kind of before. So,  I just...  Yeah, I don't know how this is going to  be received  by people. Is it really going to be  a source to be trusted? Is there  going to be one side or another that says, hey,  this is not...  This is now becoming weaponized.  You're fighting for one side or the other.

People who know what a wiki is know that there's  no relationship, but I think the general public  might look at wiki Tribune and wiki  leaks and conflate the two.  And, you know,  they actually have opposite missions,  I think you could say.

End time: 5128.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I just... I don't know  if this also does anything to help the  nature of the problem, right, of fake news.  Because what's happening right now,  we are in a weird environment where  reality itself is in  question much of the time. Yes.  And that's the bigger problem. Like, we're  in, you know, encroaching like  double-speak territory.  It sometimes feels like we're being  gaslighted by some politicians who say  something and then the next day will be like, oh,  I didn't say that. I didn't say that.  What made you think that? I don't know what you mean.  Those lights aren't flickering. And we don't really question it as much.  So, yeah, I don't know if this solves anything.  What would be really nice is if media companies  focused harder on like  making sure we don't start normalizing  this weird reality we're in right now.  Interesting article by... Or making it

Transcript:  entertainment. Like, I think that's another really big problem  is that like the news has become  entertainment. And this is a bigger  problem than just the last, you know,  six months, a year, whatever. This has  been happening for decades  at this point. And, you know,  when you read a quote like Jeff  Zucker, who is in charge of CNN,  considering that, you know,  this is a big drama to him and  that he's going to bring in... It's great for business.  Yeah, exactly. Great for business, he says.  And if I bring in people that,  you know, make this almost seem  like a dramatic reenactment of the news,  you know, people are going to watch  it and they'll be compelled to watch it. And the thing is,  just because it's interesting  to look at a train wreck doesn't make  it any less awful. Like, and  that's sort of the key there, is that  there's going to have to be  a moment where some real  soul searching is going to have to happen on the part  of these news  outlets, especially on cable.  And I don't know that it will.

Start time: 5185.67
End time: 5231.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in my view, news was always entertainment.  Right? It's always been, you bought  the newspaper to read it,  and just because you happen to get  viable politics, you know, balanced  views, politics,  societal information, but it was always  entertainment. People would sit and read the  newspaper as a way of being entertained.  Right? It's never not been entertainment.  It's just that the people who did the news  got really full of their own self-importance  and puffed themselves up as being the  guardians of democracy and the  gateway to truth and the only  arbiters, you know, shine the light  of blah, blah, blah. Right?  But it's also  hypocritical to say that you're the only  guardian of the truth.  News has always been entertainment  and that needs to adapt to the new environment  because now it has to compete against  Netflix, Amazon.

Start time: 5233.63
End time: 5258.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I disagree here. I think to say that  news has always been entertainment is  not accurate. I think news has  always been used to fill people's leisure time.  Like when you read the newspaper  50 years ago, you're getting information  and maybe there are  some things that entertain you,  but now the people delivering  the news have become the entertainment  as opposed to the actual news itself.  That's the problem. That's what I'm saying.  That's what I mean by the news has become

Start time: 5259.16
End time: 5284.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  entertainment. And my point is, is that  the news that we get today is not fit  for the medium that it's being delivered  on. So when you see news  being delivered in a 30-second  video on Facebook Live or  in Instagram or whatever  it is, these people haven't adapted  to the modern era to deliver it in such  a way that they can tell the story  in the new medium. They're still stuck in  I can publish a Sunday newspaper  and make a living model.

Like a couple of organizations are  using Snapchat to  kind of make their  reporting better. It's not the medium, it's the  fact that, I don't know,  like I've been having  an existential crisis, an ongoing  one, because every time you turn on the  news, it's like we're talking about these ridiculous  things that are happening and nobody's  like, hey, wait a minute, this is insane.  This is like, you can only say  that so many times before.  I mean, there

Start time: 5317.55
End time: 5358.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is, it's actually quite interesting  how  just with repetition, your  standards change.  Your expectations change.  I wonder, Greg, if part of the reason you see  news as entertainment is a cultural difference.  You know, in the United States,  the notion of a fourth estate  as almost a loyal  opposition to  speak truth to power,  to  afflict the comfortable and to  comfort the afflicted. That's something  we certainly, I don't know, is it  unique to the United States? I don't get the sense  that the British  Barons have that same attitude.

Start time: 5365.00
End time: 5380.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's in your cultural heritage. No, it's certainly in  my culture. I think it's fairly  universal across the world. But it's also  a fallacy to believe that  that's inherently valuable in its  own right. People used to read the newspapers  because that was the only form  of entertainment you could get on Saturday morning for

Start time: 5392.23
End time: 5424.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  maybe despite  that, but the best journalist and the best  journalism always had in mind  we are here  like the courts  in the United States. You know, we're the  fourth branch of government. That's what the fourth estate  means. We are here to make  sure that those other guys  stay on the up and up. And that's a  not the only function, but it's a big  function. But the  take away a free press. You're  really in trouble. There's no other way to  how would you find out what's going on  if you didn't have people trying to  dig into it? Exactly. But

Start time: 5425.06
End time: 5442.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's no longer only journalists can  do that. It's now anybody. Really? With  freedom of information and availability  of information on the internet. Anybody can dig  into that. Whereas in the past,  even knowing how to make a freedom of information  request, which government department,  what office, how do you fill out the form,  that was an impossible task for

Start time: 5443.00
End time: 5450.94

End time: 5462.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the same as what the internet has done to  every other business. It's cut the middle  man out. Do we need the  journalists to be the middle man anymore?  And in fact, part of what Trump is doing is  that's going. Well, but then you get a cacophony of voices

And  so if you don't have  you know, well, this is the Journal of Records.  So this, you know, there's some there's fact  checkers or some reputational  costs.

It's very easy to sit there and say  in all the forms of media  and like even the newspaper themselves are full  of advertising, which is blatantly  overstated or exaggerated  or flat out untruthful.  Right. So you put the news  this thing that you just said about the fourth estate  and you just put it right next to an  advertisement, which is a blatant lie.  Right. Well,

And it  disempowered the patient, etc.  Now, thanks to the internet, we can get a lot  more information.  There's a huge amount  of information out there and there's absolutely  no way to vet it.

At this point, anybody  growing up today is,  there's an avalanche  of information of all of equal merit.  There's,  it's very difficult. And  unfortunately, a lot of the fixes for  fake news people promote are, well,  we have to learn critical thinking and we should teach  people how to follow the links and find the,  no, it doesn't work.

He really wanted to reinvent  the  food system, etc., etc., etc.  So I'm not going to assume  in fact,  it's probably the case that this guy's big  mistake was he made it  he made a squeezer that was really  way over the top  too good and he has to charge  400 bucks for it. Look how over designed  this thing is.  All it's doing is squeezing a pre-  juiced bag of  stuff that you can do a better  job with your hand.  But it's not  like he was trying to con people.

Transcript:  I want to test the theory.  So I think you need to stop focusing on the machine and focus on the fact  that they build an entire supply chain  here. So you have to have a  mechanism that produces fresh vegetables  and fruits that are  then chopped and then put into these bags  and then you have to refrigerate them  and you have to freight them. So I suspect a  lot of that 100 million wasn't poured  into the machine. There's a back end in  here and each one of these...  I mean, this is all patently stupid, but  let's just go with it for a minute. But that's the point

Start time: 5947.16
End time: 5973.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is that they saw...  That fooled them.  Oh, you got to create a supply chain.  Instead of them saying, so is somebody  going to pay  $400 for the juicer and then  subscribe for... What is this?  How much a month? $100 a month.  $100 a month.  Is that a business? That's what they should have been  thinking. Not, oh, wow,  supply chain.

We can't afford a guy like that  because he's just killing it. He's just making  a huge amount of money. And the other thing is  is like... Why does he want to work  for somebody? I would imagine he's an  influencer. He accepts  money for appearances and things like that  and that's something that we  are not really allowed to do. Right.

Start time: 6295.48
End time: 6311.00

So I'm not going  to say anything. But there's plenty of other  bloggers out there where you don't know where their money is coming from.  They do take money from the companies

Start time: 6311.00
End time: 6329.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

And  they get a lot of free gear and things like  that. And so it's very much a really  interesting time in new media.  It doesn't

Start time: 6331.00

If you don't have integrity  or ethics in this area,  you will very quickly be found  out and people will quickly  their bull crap-o  meter will go off and go, this person's obviously  getting paid somewhere.  It doesn't work. You have to absolutely  be authentic and genuine. And if you're getting  paid, you have to say so. And I know  that because guess what my business is?  I get paid to appear at events.  I get paid to fly to conferences.  We do all of our shows  are sponsored. And the way that we do it  is we just tell our audience, this is sponsored.  And you have to be genuine  and authentic all the way up. And the minute  that you're not is the day that you'll be  you'll lose everything. Yeah. It's really

Start time: 6371.24
End time: 6392.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a challenge. And it's changed so much  especially now that I mean,  we do ads. I have to do ads.  And so we have to be very careful  about A, letting you know this is an ad and B, when we  talk about a product that we advertise, we  become very religious about disclaiming  it immediately and saying, you know, this is by the way  this is an advertiser because we're  always trying to make sure that  that distinction is very clear.

Start time: 6393.26
End time: 6418.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And in the age of new media where all of  these people are, where all of these  influencers and YouTubers and things are  coming up in the world, you know,  if you're not, if you're not cross  promoting, you're dying. I mean, like if you're not  on 500 different of your,  you know, fellow YouTubers  channels, that's like you're  dead in the water. And so how do you  how do you compete with that? That's  a really interesting question. It's like  something I think I think about it a lot.

Start time: 6419.77
End time: 6466.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the mass consumer market  where you need  to appeal to very large numbers  of people. So somebody like Casey  Neistat, six million subscribers,  he needs to have  produce a product which appeals to the largest  audience because his monetization is very small.  Whereas my business works  on monetization of a very small audience  that's worth a very large  amount of money to a very small number of  clients. So I can build a perfectly viable business  model. So you need to be careful about saying  generalizing what you're seeing. You're  talking about mass consumer markets,  but there are vertical markets where you can run  very specific businesses that are very  excellent places to work  like ours, right? Where  we only need to attract  an audience of 30 or 40,000 people  who have a total spending of roughly in the  order of two to three billion dollars a year.

Start time: 6467.22
End time: 6468.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whoa, I take those people.

Start time: 6469.61
End time: 6494.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And if you can influence  them, you've got a viable business model.  That's a good niche, yes.  So there's a gap between  500,000 subscribers, 10,000.  You have a business activities that you need to do.  So if you want to reach that audience,  yes, you need to cross promote. You need to get exposure  because the attrition rate, people  signing off from your YouTube channel as  opposed to staying with you, is very high.  So you need to continually get the churn going.  But I don't think Casey Neistat,

Start time: 6495.20
End time: 6510.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  somebody like Casey Neistat is not  is not making broad  videos for monetization  because he is sponsored by Samsung.  Like that's, I mean,  you hit a certain point where  monetization is  a very small part of the business.

Start time: 6511.61
End time: 6518.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 6519.69
End time: 6530.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think so?  I don't know because I think  a lot of his, I think a lot of  his viewers might feel that they could trust  him with a sponsorship like that.  Because even though he's sponsored,

Start time: 6531.00
End time: 6534.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 6535.32
End time: 6594.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think that that's  that is,  and I mean, I'm talking about this not as  a generalization, Greg. I'm talking about it in the  sense of a, as  entertainers. Like these are, these are people who are  entertainers who are bringing you information.  And, you know,  whether, it doesn't matter what vertical it's in,  but it's very much,  yeah, you absolutely can.  Even in the music industry, it's the same thing.  If you can build super fans who  have a lot of spending prowess,  then you only need a few of them  to sustain you. And you also have to  decide what your idea of success is.  But I just, I mean, in the sense  of like tech journalism,  I mean, just in general is like the thing that  I am familiar with because that's  what I work in. And that's sort of the  push and pull of, you know,  right now we're seeing a lot of  a lot of talent  at YouTube or, you know, doing  their own thing and creating their own brand,  really hesitant to join a  larger corporation because of  limitations. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but that medium  is not, is no, you cannot,  I don't believe that you can transfer from YouTube  to a corporation. The  corporation is effectively the death of the  independent creator because it starts to apply  rules. As soon as somebody owns your  salary, and they can start  to dictate the way that you work. And  sometimes it's overt and sometimes it's  subvert.  And it always creates... That's what I'm saying. They're not,

Tuesday, 6am Pacific, 9am Eastern  on twit.tv  You can join us live.  Our show today brought to you by  here's another example of Silicon Valley  kind of taking it and  running with the ball and it's done  such a great job.  Blue Apron, now the number one  fresh ingredient and recipe delivery  service in the country. Who knew?  And it turned out  people really liked the idea  of instead of going to the grocery  just coming home and finding a box  a lovely refrigerator box on the doorstep  with everything they need to make an incredible  meal for dinner.  They have two plans, one for couples  and one for families of four.  You could do it all yourself. You never have  more of the ingredients than you need  so if you need like a teaspoon of soy sauce  you get a little bottle with a teaspoon of soy sauce  and it's nice because you know, there's no waste afterwards  and you may get great leftovers  because I have to say they're fairly generous  in the portions. These are delicious meals  you cook them in 40 minutes or less, you get the recipe  card and it really is a great way  of kind of expanding your repertoire.  That's what I think of it as.  Because you know, when I cook, I cook kind of the same  five or six meals all the time.  And it's nice to have something new, new ingredients  new styles. By the way,  ingredients, amazing,  fresh, high quality  from 150 local farms, fisheries  and ranchers across the United States  the meat is always fresh, the  fish is always fresh, never frozen,  the boxes are refrigerated, comes  just in the nick of time and you just make it  and it's incredible.  Their freshness guarantee promises every  ingredient in your delivery arrives  perfectly ready to cook or they're going to make it right.  Blue Apron, they deliver to 99%  of the continental United States.  There's no weekly commitment, it's not a subscription,  you just get deliveries when you want them.  You customize your menus every week,  just go online, say I want this, this and this.  Match your dietary needs,  they have vegetarian plans as well.  Recipes never get repeated within a year,  so you never get bored. Look at that,  go back to that, I want that.  Roasted pork and mustard pan sauce  with asparagus and fingerling potatoes.  Oh my gosh.  The thing is once you make that mustard sauce,  then you know, oh that's good, it's easy.  I'm going to use that 15 different ways.  It really expands your capabilities.  And my mouth is watering like crazy.  Spinach and fresh mozzarella pizza with olives,  bell peppers and ricotta salata,  or sweet and sour salmon with bok choy, carrot and ginger  fried rice.  Look at these, it just looks...

Transcript:  I'm so hungry. I know, it's so mean.  So hungry. So mean they make me do this.  That spinach and egg flatbread thing, that pizza looks...  Doesn't that look good?  I want to eat it. Have you ever tried this, Ashley?  You really should, you would love it.  Yeah, we have had Blue Apron  for a while, we like it.  I do too.  I think we split between that and another delivery one.  Let's not mention the other one.  But it's funny, you mentioned  doing Blue Apron,  we actually became a little bit more adventurous  in sort of putting together our own stuff later.  Exactly.  We were just like, okay, so we can only get this  three times a week for dinner,  so how do we help ourselves the rest of the week?  Check out this week's menu.

Start time: 7145.46

Transcript:  I always like that thing about,  I don't make a lot of Indian food,  but I love it.  And I don't have, there are sometimes  I can't get specialty ingredients,  or it takes a long time to put them together  and to be able to just get them.  And not have to spend, especially with some of these  more expensive spices,  it's like 20 bucks for a bottle  that's this big. Saffron.  You need to use a quarter of a teaspoon  and then you never use it again.  So I like BlueApron for that reason.  That's really nice.

Transcript:  watches Twitter. They knew.  They were just like, drive me mad.  I'm like, I'll show you, Leo.  Twitter earnings.  11 cents a share versus 1 cent expected.  Talk about a Trump bump.  Revenue was 548 million dollars,  but better than expected,  still declining.  Monthly active users,  you know, it sounds like a lot.  328 million.  But it's a fraction  of course with Instagram.  Instagram is almost at a billion. Facebook of course,  almost at 2 billion.  But still, that's 328 million.

Start time: 7252.71
End time: 7260.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And a lot of them are bots.  You don't have to consider bots and  people who have signed in.  Or people who have signed in, grabbed, parked  their app.

Start time: 7262.36
End time: 7265.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  Twitter said the daily usage  accelerated  up 14%.  But see Ashley, you just told me  all you need to do is to  send people into my Twitter account.  It's still a very important  medium.

Start time: 7288.34
End time: 7294.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's my main way of people getting a hold of me.  On social media, that is it.  Twitter is the big one.

Transcript:  Oh, hello dog.

Start time: 7296.74
End time: 7367.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's ultimately, it gets down to  difference between multicast versus  incast. So mechanisms  like Facebook, chat, and  Snapchat, and  WhatsApp, and all  Instagram are all  about communicating to your friends.  Or to people that you know  and that you met, maybe less so with Instagram.  But Twitter  is one of the few, maybe  just Instagram is the only other one,  where you can send something to people  that you never know, where you can broadcast  a social media update.  And I can't help shake the feeling  that there's a different business model between  the way that Facebook runs  its chat apps and exploits them  for revenue, and to the way where  if you're broadcasting something into the open,  which is, and you just,  there's just not that much money in that.  And maybe Twitter has to accept that  the basis of this business model is that  there's a fundamental revenue shift between  if Facebook can  exploit your private data, because  you're presenting, you're only talking to your friends,  so they can get many  more signals to exploit advertising  signals, whereas what you say on Twitter is  not so easily monetized because  what you're presenting there is a different sort of  persona.

Start time: 7368.98
End time: 7402.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's, yeah, you know what, you make a good case.  I'm tempted to blame management  that they just never managed to take  something that is so critical  to our culture and make money at it.  But you might be right,  it's the very nature of it, that sure they're selling ads  and they made, you know, they had  revenue of half a billion dollars in three months.  Maybe, I cut  costs would be the first thing I would say.  Why is it costing  so much money if you can't make money at half  a billion dollars a quarter?  But at the same time,  they don't have the opportunities.  Go ahead, I'm sorry, Devinder, yeah.

Transcript:  We're seeing more licensing too, like Twitter data  is appearing everywhere now  and they're making big deals with  sports leagues and everything.  So it's like there's a lot of stuff happening,  but I guess making money is a bigger thing.  Personally, I'd pay a little money for  better Twitter apps and more controls.  You're not alone.  A number of people lately have suggested,

Start time: 7465.60
End time: 7481.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't make a business at five to ten bucks a month.  It has to be 20 to 50.  Look around you, look at all the startups  in Silicon Valley, they're all 20 bucks a month.  Plus, the race that they have  is to get enough value  to justify 20 bucks a month.  But are those companies also doing

Start time: 7481.64
End time: 7503.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  all of these licensing deals and all of these  other things? As a power user,  just to be able to pay  a little extra for the same service  with just a few extra tools  that are key to how I use it  and how other people who use Twitter a lot.  I don't know.  If they're still making money  in the ways that they're doing it right now,  maybe that's, maybe, but yeah, I don't know.

Start time: 7503.78
End time: 7521.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It costs a lot of money  to collect money, right?  And at five bucks a month, you're making nothing  because the cost of the back end transaction is three bucks.  So then you're left with two bucks a month  and now you've got to build an entire  infrastructure and back end to collect two bucks a month.  That doesn't work.  So even if you reach a percent...

Start time: 7522.04
End time: 7523.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they're screwed. Because nobody's going to pay 20 bucks a month for Twitter.

Start time: 7524.00
End time: 7527.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  Tune in to Internet Radio. I just bought...  I didn't want to buy it, but it's the only way you can...  There's certain limitations, but  you get books, you get a radio station.  That's 100 bucks a year. 100 bucks a year seems to be  the new normal, right?  At 100 bucks a year,

Start time: 7548.71
End time: 7574.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you can do a transaction where you  lose five bucks in  transaction fees. You need about  10 to 15 bucks to run the back end.  So to have an accounting system  and customer database securing that.  And now you've got 80 bucks a year  to do something out of your business.  So let's just say you're going to take...  You're going to have to take 20 percent...  You're probably going to end up with about 30 bucks  that you can use to produce something valuable  to justify the 100 bucks for existing.

Start time: 7574.42
End time: 7579.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the beauty of Twitter's model.  They don't have to produce anything.  Their users produce the content on Twitter.

Start time: 7580.38
End time: 7610.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, the thing is that  you have to charge 100 bucks  to create something that's worth 30 bucks  that you've got to convince people to buy 100 bucks for.  Right. Right.  So if you're Twitter, how do you...  I see what you're saying. Yeah.  Because by the time all the costs of the people  and the overheads and the administration  and the legals and blah blah blah  and international currency transactions  and all that stuff, right,  you're left with usually about one-third of the money  that comes in through the door.  So what are you going to produce for 30 bucks

Start time: 7610.50
End time: 7613.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 7615.21
End time: 7627.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And people will pay 100 bucks for it.  That's right.  So now let's say you get 10 million people to pay up.  So now you've got 300 million.  Yeah.  What are you going to get?  What are you going to create for 300 million

Start time: 7628.76
End time: 7632.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 7632.70
End time: 7656.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're screwed.  Better engineering.  It seems like a big problem with Twitter  is they can't get people to fix their crap.  TweetDeck has been a mess on the web forever.  Yeah, I understand this may not be  the most financially sound decision  and won't keep them alive.  But maybe really doing something  for these loyal users who really depend on the service  as the lifeline of information.  What if they build the world?

Start time: 7656.86
End time: 7677.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They are the backbone of the service.  The people who put up all of that information  and memes and the things that break all the time.  Those are power users.  Almost always.  So to not have tools for them  seems like a really good way  to get them to finally get fed up with it  and be like, I can't manage this anymore.  I wash my hands of it.

Transcript:  So last Sunday there was an interesting article  about a profile of Mike Isaac  in the New York Times profile.  Travis Callan, that's a great guy.  Travis Callanek, the CEO and founder of Uber.  By the way, this was a good week for Uber.  There were no negative stories after that one.  After that one.  But in that one we learned some interesting things.  One, that the Uber app had been,  and I think we talked,  did we talk about this last Sunday?  We've been talking about it all week.  The Uber app had been carefully crafted  to, you know, in violation of Apple's policies,  get unique identifiers for every user of the app.  And this was a really good week.  And this was actually Uber trying to eliminate fraud  on the part of its drivers.  But Apple says very clearly  you cannot get identifying information  and keep it.  They were using secret APIs to do that.  Apple can do it, but not the third party apps.  Tim Cook, Uber thought,  oh, we'll never get caught  because we've geo-fenced our app  so that it doesn't do this if it's in Cupertino.  What they forgot is Apple's kind of a big company  and they might have people outside of Cupertino anyway.  The Apple figured it out.  Tim Cook, instead of banning them from the app store  or even like making, saying things like,  well, all right, but you've got to tell your users,  Tim Cook just said,  now Travis, don't do that, you've got to stop that,  now knock it off.  And Travis did.  It would have been nice had they said something.  But that was the only thing we learned in that article.  As you're a little bit farther down in the article,  almost at the bottom of it,  we found out that Uber was buying  Lyft receipts from a company called Slice  and they were selling them to Uber.  And they bought the receipts from a company called Slice.  Slice had bought a company called Unroll Me,  a company I've recommended and used,  which had a great free service.  Unroll.me, what they did is  you would sign up, you'd give it your Gmail credentials  and then it would go through and help you  unsubscribe to newsletters you didn't want  and do a digest of newsletters you did.  Uncluttering your mailbox was a great idea.  Turned out, the business model was,  now we've got your email  and we can sell information  that we extract from the app store  and we can sell information that we extract from your email.  Like for instance, how many Lyft rides you took.  Now we'll anonymize that information,  but they did sell that to Uber.  Uber was using it for competitive research.  They were trying to figure out how much business  Lyft was generating and those were very valuable.  A lot of people reading this felt like  they'd been robbed.

Transcript:  Well, I think for me, it's not so much that  Uber was doing this,  but think about how many other data sources  Uber's got.  So now they've got access to  inverted commas, anonymized information.  And we have so much...  It's not anonymized, obviously.  It's not. Anybody can unanonymize this data.  We've seen that so consistently over the years.  So let's do away with the fallacy that it was anonymized.  That's bullsh**, right?  What we have is the data that came from Unroll Me.  How many other data sources was  Uber buying to build a competitive profile?  Much less its own data.  So the Uber app tracks you  when you're in the car, but it also tracks  you for 30 minutes, 5 minutes after you leave.  So if it's now getting...  Let's just take the Unroll Me thing.  If it's now seeing your receipts  for say, going into a restaurant,  and it knows that it took you there,  then it can say,  well hang on, Uber dropped this person at this place.  Here's a receipt for this exact time.  I can match up this person with their personal data.  So now you have...  You can build up a whole profile around somebody.  Now keep in mind that Uber can also go out onto the internet  and talk to Verizon  and get anonymized data about  their people's traffic on the internet  and suck that into that data platform.  Yes, that's now completely legal.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We used to say follow the money  to find out why something was being wrong.  And increasingly I find myself  in the data collection.  And in Amazon's case,  Amazon actually isn't about the money,  it's about the data.  And Google's in this business and Facebook is in this business.  It wants the data.  It wants to have mass, it wants your photographs  so it can mine them for information.  It wants your messages.  It doesn't care about your home address  and your mobile phone number anymore.  What it wants is the metadata associated with that.  It wants to know that your mobile phone  was in the back of an Uber  and it went to this restaurant  because that categorizes you as this person  which I can now target for ads.

Transcript:  Alright, so we're going to wrap with this  but let me ask one last question.  It's kind of taken as written  that oh well this is bad.  Oh, you shouldn't let this personal information out.  Tell me concretely and realistically  and a lot of people say,  well then the insurance company buys that  and they deny you insurance.  And I'm like, well, I'm not going to do that.  The insurance company buys that and they deny you insurance.  No, I mean concretely and realistically  what is the harm?  I don't mind, assuming that I don't mind  targeted ads, I don't mind being offered  a coupon when I get out of the Uber  to go to the restaurant next door.  Assuming I don't mind that, what is the actual harm?

Start time: 8067.72
End time: 8098.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the big problem  is Unroll Me is doing this  and just didn't tell anybody  and I'm sure it's probably in the terms of service  or something. It is.  But I wish, for me the harm is  like, yeah, these companies keep doing these things  and sneaking it in and not being fully  transparent about what's happening.  The consumer harm is maybe more stuff like  Uber though, like these lavishly funded  companies who can compile all this data  and use it to crush their competitors.  In a certain sense, it is like helping  to promote unhealthy competition  in some markets.

Start time: 8100.13
End time: 8171.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would say unhealthy competition would also  be like my answer. I agree with you  Devendra, I think you're absolutely right.  I think that  I was having this conversation about the Echo Look  this week and I think  that the next generation  coming up  is growing  up in a world where they  voluntarily share  their days, everything in their  day with the rest of the internet.  And I think  that the idea of  what pieces of privacy  are the most important to them,  they will have to figure that out  for themselves.  I think that we have an evolving  world of privacy  in which  we kind of have to decide  and I don't know  what the answer to that is, but  we have to decide how much  privacy are we willing to give up  for machine learning?  Because it only gets better with our data.  It's this weird  circular thing  where it's like chicken or egg.  It can only be good if you give it your information  but then how much information are you really willing to give it  so then maybe it's a little more limited than it  could be and not as convenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the thing about machine learning  is it inherently  rewards the biggest companies.  So there is no way  to have a small machine  learning startup because you need  the data to train the models to do  something useful so that you then have a service  that you can sell or a  revenue stream that you can create.  I call it exploit the data, right?  Which is its correct name. You call it selling it.  I call it exploiting.  So inherently to do machine learning  you need to have vast amounts of  cash to be able to  maintain data.  So the barrier to entry is huge

Transcript:  That's what late stage capitalism is ultimately  is monopolization by some sort of rubber baron.  Some sort of.  And the problem is ultimately is that  it's not, and I agree with  your point about we need machine learning  to do things to be  cyborgs. We are all cyborgs now.  If you're holding a smartphone you're a cyborg, right?  The machine makes you greater than you are.  The fact it's not embedded in your body is here or there, right?  To me anyway.

I think the point here is  that there are, there's no  control. I can't take this data back.  This data is stolen.  This data is taken from your digital  exhaust from the, you look at Verizon  acquired AOL and  Huffpo and all those companies  and it's going to buy Yahoo just  so that it can build bigger databases  so it can target better ads  to you and sell that data to other people.  It's all in ad tech play.  I didn't give permission for a lot of that data  and certainly this is where the FCC  roll back around net neutrality is starting  to be quite concerning but that data  is taken and used in ways which  I don't control  and if there are unintended  consequences or if there are  consequences down the line about a decision  I made today that affects the  rest of my life I cannot take it back.  And that is my problem is  I cannot take back, you know, if I spent  five years sharing my life online and  everybody can see that, that has consequences  for the next 50 years of your life.  So I just ignore ads

And then just give it away because some retailer asked you for it.  No, I'm doing it because they have an option for, it was your example.

People get upset about that.  People want it to be democratized.  They want it to be democratized, all the same price.  That's fine. I get that.  But it's like, that's just  the evolution of what's happening right now.

Transcript:  Hang on to the thoughts. We have one more ad.  I want to get that out of the way and I want to give you a chance  to sum this up.  This is a fundamental conversation.  This is exactly what we do,  which is we talk about  what's going on today  and what the impact is going to be  in the future and what it's going to mean to you  in the future. That's really all we do.  It happens to be all about  technology because that's where the  rubber is hitting the road today.  But that's what I think  to me the most interesting thing. I'd love to hear from all three of you.  But first,  a word from Harry's.  I want to talk about  almost all the advertisers in this show are  disrupting the status quo.  Harry's is a perfect example.  Two guys, Jeff and Andy,  serial entrepreneurs,  they were looking for the next thing and they said  what is an industry we can disrupt?  They were tired of paying $4  a blade for their  razor blades.  They said we could do better. I bet you we could do a  there they are.  We could do a razor blade  company that charges less and gives you  a better quality and we'll do it  by subscription and they created Harry's  and it's amazing.  Harry's sells great blades.  They did one thing that was very smart.  They took all that venture capital and they bought  the factory that makes the blades in Germany.  The best blade making factory in Germany.  They own it. So you're buying direct from the  factory so you get good razors,  great blades and they cost half as much  as the blades in the drugstore.  I love it. I just love this idea.  Now, there is a monopoly in  razor blade companies because they all patent  their handles.  So Harry's had to make a different handle  and that means you've got to get the handle before you can use  the blades but they've made that very easy too.  Normally you can get a shave set which includes  the handle, three blades, a full-sized bottle  of the shave cream or the gel  whichever you choose, the  travel blade cover. That's $15.  That's the Truman set. They have the Winston set with the metal  handle. I really like the Winston.  $25. But you know what? We got an even better  deal. We're going to get you started with Harry's  free. You just cover shipping when you sign up.  So what we're going to do, we've got a sample  that includes the handle. It's a very, the very  nice Truman handle. It's weighted.  It's a rubberized grip  so it feels good. We're going to get you  a couple of the cartridges.  These are five blade cartridges that include the  trimmer and the lubricating strip, everything.  And a sample size of the shave gel  so you can see how that is.  Free. Just, you pay the shipping.  And then you get the subscription  so you never will run out.  You will always have blades and you won't ever use a blade  longer than you should.  It's awesome.  I want you to go to harrys.com slash twit.  Harrys, H-A-R-R-Y-S dot com slash twit.  And this is  an awesome deal. We just started to  do this. You get the free set.  Just cover shipping.  And then of course sign up for the subscription.  It's a great deal. Get started with Harry's  today and you will be very, very  happy. And the nice thing is, you never  run out. You always get the blades.  You always have shave cream. You're ready.  You're ready to go. Harrys dot com slash twit.  What a great panel today.  Greg Farrow from the Packet Pushers Network  is always a pleasure to have you on.  You're so smart.  I don't know about that, but anyway.  No, you are. And I love it. He's a  ethereal mind on Twitter. You've got to follow him there.  And do listen to all the shows on the  Packet Pushers Network. They're really, really great.  Devinder Hardwar from Engadget.  He's the senior editor there.  And I'm pleased to say he's been a great friend  personally and of the network for  some years now. And it's always great to have you on.  Our newest friend.  Oh, it's that's the only other.  Yeah, our newest friend. I just  got a massive crush on now.  Weeks of friendship.  Yeah, it took me a month to learn her name.  But, no, I just  I love all three of you and it's always fun  to do a show. Last thoughts on this.  As we head off  into the sunset of late stage capitalism.  What is the antidote to this?  It feels so inevitable.  Yeah.

Well,  so in the UK there is a basic income.  There's unemployment benefits. There's nationalised health care.  Let's not go into that today.  It's a whole other discussion.  I'm not against all of that. I'm not against any of that.  Yeah. And I think what we need  is some sort of social safety net for our data.  There has to be some agreement around  what we own and what we control  and what we can say to the big companies  and say  that as a society  this is the limit that we want to take up to.

In fact he's doing very very smart  bringing very good  business ethics to how he spends  that money whereas a lot of governments  do not  wisely give away aid money. I will  absolutely agree with that. But let's not  lionize how much they give away  because it's actually a pittance. No I agree.  But.

They also did  I think they did with Josh Hushison  and Sarah Wayne Callas. I forget what the  name of the show is. Colony.  They did some drone racing through  that set too. It's not just  defunct television sets. They're also going  to shows that are actually being produced,  which is pretty neat. How fun is that?
