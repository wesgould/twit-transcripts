Transcript:  I'm keeping it light right now because we're going to probably get into a fairly heavy  conversation about Apple, the FBI and what the hell is going on.  And I have to say this story, which broke on Wednesday, came in dribs and drabs.  We didn't really kind of we saw the court order to from to Apple saying you've got to  help the FBI unlock this phone.  We saw Tim Cook's response.  We had a very good conversation, I think, with the technical information,  additions from Steve Gibson on Wednesday on this week in Google.  Jeff Jarvis and Matthew Ingram and I, with Steve Gibson's help.  But since then, more and more information has come out.  I don't probably need to summarize the story.  You all know there there was there was a cell phone that belonged to the San Bernardino  County Health Department, but was in use by its employee, the shooter in the San Bernardino  mass shooting tragedy a few months ago.  The FBI got that cell phone.  They didn't get the other cell phones.  Those were destroyed before the shooting.  But this cell phone survived.  It's an interesting position because it's owned by this by San Bernardino County Department  of Health.  It's not owned by the shooter.  It also he agreed to the right to monitor.  So really, there shouldn't be any issue at all about unlocking the phone and looking  what's on it, except that it is locked.  It's an iPhone 5C.  But of course, Apple is was updated to iOS 9.  It was encrypted.  And the FBI has asked the court to force Apple to help them unlock it, not decrypt it, but  unlock it.  The court said Apple has to make it has to do a few things, has to make a modified firmware.  By the way, as you probably know, firmware can't be put on an iPhone and will not work  on iPhone unless Apple signs it.  So they would have to sign this with their super secret signing key put on the iPhone.  This firmware would do a couple of things.  One, it would disable the automatic erasure if more than 10 attempts to unlock the phone  are made in case the bad guy turn it on.  And it would also reduce the delay in between key presses.  There's an 80 millisecond delay every between key presses to slow down brute forcing the  whole.  That's not quite right.

Start time: 404.18
End time: 457.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a five second delay.  Five seconds.  OK.  The 80 milliseconds is how long it takes the phone to actually process the request.  So they can't speed that up.  Right.  The minimum is 80 milliseconds.  It has to be done on the device because part of the key is a combination of the passcode  and the unique UID, the unique identifier of the device, which is not known to Apple,  is not tracked.  It's imprinted like in the silicon basically.  So the 80 milliseconds is the limit, which is the other thing here.  No one said how long the passcode is, but because of that 80 millisecond delay, if it's  anything but a four or five digit numeric passcode, it's going to be pretty impossible  to brute force anyway.  I presume it's just a four digit one, I should say.  But that 80 milliseconds is still a pretty substantial amount of time.

Start time: 457.80
End time: 507.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This kind of underscores.  There's a lot we don't know about this.  So the court order was that Apple should modify the firmware, turn off the delay, turn off  any automatic erasure on the phone, not to actually crack the phone, but just to give  the FBI an opportunity to run an automated, oh, and to give the FBI software access to  the phone so they could run an automated brute forcing attack so they could unlock it.  It's kind of a weird request.  But in the past, Apple has in fact been ordered to decrypt criminals iPhones and deliver the  information to law enforcement.  And they say they've done that.  In fact, they've done it, I think, 70 times.  They don't like doing it.  And that's one of the reasons they released iOS 8, which had full disk encryption.

Start time: 508.01
End time: 605.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  Well, I mean, Apple can't decrypt it.  I think that's the big thing here.  That's what makes this.  There's the multi levels to the story.  And I certainly feel your pain about it dribbling out.  I mean, I had a very widely spread.  I made a daily update free on Thursday that ended up having a couple of things wrong.  But I mean, it is what it is, which there's an update to it.  The way encryption works and Apple uses very strong encryption on the disk is that even  if you have the data on the disk, if you don't have the key, like you're not getting it,  you're just not.  It's theoretically possible, but realistically impossible, even with a brute force attack.  So the issue is, if the FBI really cared about this, they could extract the data off of the  memory chips and then try to brute force it.  But the whole issue is that it's easier, even with all these challenges.  The only realistic way is to break the passcode itself, which again has to be done on the  device because it's tangled with the device ID because no one can break encryption.  And I think that's what makes this a such a multi layered issue is I think the real  fear in the very long run for any of us in tech is the idea that Apple want to have to  make some sort of golden key or skeleton key for their encryption itself, which is a really  terrible idea.

Start time: 606.66
End time: 610.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And Apple says they can't do it, right?  I mean, they could going forward.

Start time: 611.45
End time: 637.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  You can't do it after the fact.  Exactly.  Which is why I think the real concern here is that the FBI loses this case and then  leverages that into congressional action to force this sort of gold key thing.  Say we can't trust Apple.  Apple's not going to help us, et cetera, et cetera.  I mean, all those times that Apple helped the FBI were pre iOS were as far as I know,  pre iOS 8.  Yes, they were.  They were.

Start time: 637.78
End time: 650.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was before the encryption stuff.  Right.  So it was a different sort of assistance where in a lot of times, but I understand they were  just instructing them to look towards tools that already existed from third parties and  not actually giving them any data themselves.

Start time: 650.70
End time: 741.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Although as Jonathan Zdarsky, who's a really great Apple expert, pointed out in a long  blog post, there's a difference between what Apple used to do, which is essentially do  what they needed to and provide the contents of that phone to law enforcement versus creating  a forensics tool, which is what the court is ordering them to do now.  And there is a much higher burden of proof with a forensics tool than there would be  when just Apple saying, well, here's what was on the phone.  So this is a fairly burdensome, as it turns out, fairly burdensome order from the court.  Apple has said it will won't do it and it will appeal.  They have some extra time.  It looks like they're going to be given three extra days to respond.  They have until Friday, February 26th.  Now, and I don't know what Apple will say.  We only know that as soon as this order came out, Tim Cook wrote this open letter and posted  on the Apple website saying, you know, this is why it's a bad idea.  We think this needs to be public.  Now there's some additional information that may change the color of this.  A couple of things.  First of all, apparently Apple had originally asked the FBI to do this under seal privately  and the FBI declined.  They decided to do it publicly.  The reason that might be interesting is maybe Apple was willing to comply, but just didn't  want anybody to know they could comply.  Or I don't know what.  I'm not sure why.

Start time: 741.94
End time: 847.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think that's true because in the narratives that we've had so far, it's been very clear  that they had tried the four different techniques that Apple recommended and none of them worked.  And so they were at the impasse of saying that our only option left is for you to give  us physical assistance to getting into the contents here where we can then try to try  to decrypt it.  So that's they've already said that the cooperation ended unsuccessfully.  And so now we're at the the FBI asked them to do a specific thing.  They said no.  And so we go to court.  Now one fascinating thing that seems to have happened here, though, that is different from  similar situations in the past is previously something like this starts out and the facts  come out first.  So remember when when Apple's phone was liberated from that bar, it was iPhone four.  All those facts came out first and then it turned into a court case and then the lawyers  got involved with this.  The very first salvo is from the lawyers from the Department of Justice and the response.  And Tim Cook might have signed that letter, but it was written by lawyers of or at least  vetted and sealed by lawyers.  And as a result, every bit of information that we've had on this story so far has come  in legal form, which means that every word is carefully chosen to communicate a particular  fact so that it might be true, but they might want us to believe something else.

Start time: 847.70
End time: 870.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There is some other information that didn't come vetted or in legal form, and it throws  further mud in the water.  Initially the FBI, Apple pointed out that the the iCloud password had been changed while  the phone was in the FBI's custody.  The FBI immediately threw the San Bernardino County Department of Health under the bus  saying they did it.

Start time: 870.42
End time: 873.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then they immediately threw the FBI under the bus.

Start time: 874.04
End time: 878.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They then tweeted, no, the FBI told us to do that.

Start time: 879.14
End time: 891.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although in my mind, they're both sort of incompetent because from best I can tell,  and I've been working on a story about this for the last few days, there was absolutely  no mobile device management software on the iPhone that was that was given out by the  San Bernardino Department of Health.

Start time: 891.86
End time: 911.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Apple pointed out, well, that's dumb.  Apple pointed out, though, had they not changed the iCloud password, it's very likely that  as soon as they went to a known Wi-Fi access point, such as his home or work, the phone  would have gone, oh, let me back up over Wi-Fi, and then they would have had access to that  backed up data.

Start time: 912.14
End time: 923.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we don't really know if that would have been the case or not, because we don't know  if there was another problem on the phone there, if that setting have been enabled or  disabled. But at the very least, they could have attempted it.

Start time: 924.14
End time: 991.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And let me give you a let me give you my conspiracy theory.  Sure. I think the FBI wants this case.  We know that James Comey, the director of the FBI, is one of the strongest advocates  in government. By the way, there is no unified point of view in government about encryption  and end encryption. In fact, the I've been told the NSA wants end to end encryption and  believes is important to national security.  But the FBI does not. They are worried about bad guys going dark.  That's the term they use. And Comey has been looking for a case to set a precedent. And  what better case than a terrorist and his phone belonging to a terrorist?  And so I think they were looking for exactly this kind of case. And if it were easy to  get the information, they wouldn't have been able to go for the precedent.  So my conspiracy theory, which kind of impugns the FBI here, is that they they didn't want  to easily decrypt this device. They wanted this device to be hard to decrypt. Why else  would you why would you change the iCloud password?  Is that a hamfisted attempt to get the data?  No, there is no better than that.  They know better than that. I know that.

Start time: 992.38
End time: 1002.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know that. I mean, I think that this might have been a case where they were so desperately  trying to get access to something and just made a sloppy mistake.  I would I would hope that was the case.

Start time: 1002.30
End time: 1006.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know what? I don't buy it. I think the FBI's forensics is much better than that.  They know what they're doing.

Start time: 1006.60
End time: 1026.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, there's actually an explanation for this.  They changed the they changed the iCloud password so that they could access the backups.  And then they discovered that the backups had stopped on October 19th or 20th.  And that's when they said, oh, there's additional information on the phone.  And the backups.

Start time: 1027.30
End time: 1034.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's still hamfisted. They could tell how the last backup without being able to unlock  it, right? Maybe not. Maybe you couldn't get into the computer.

Start time: 1034.62
End time: 1039.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, they had to get into iCloud to see the back.  I see. All right.  And then they would have.

Start time: 1039.84
End time: 1063.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so this is probably a case where they didn't want to wait for Apple to respond.  They wanted to get information as quickly as possible and went too fast.  And by doing that, ended up, you know, kind of screwing themselves.  I mean, but all of this, of course, is on the pre disposition that the the  precipitation that there is something on this phone that can be useful in this case.  And I personally don't know.

Start time: 1063.62
End time: 1067.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's not a lot of there's not a lot to indicate that there is.  They destroyed their two personal phones.

Start time: 1068.00
End time: 1098.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's I was going to say the two personal phones are destroyed.  Find my iPhone was enabled.  So for Find My iPhone to be enabled, the backups to be disabled.  Jonathan Zdziarski was pointing out that seems weird, too.  There are a lot of questions about this that make me think there might not be  anything on this phone, but that doesn't change the fact that that is your to your  greater point. This is a very important case for the FBI.  And this is the perfect case that you can try in public to try to get issues of  encryption legislated.

Start time: 1099.44
End time: 1212.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I think it's I think it's important to there's really three layers,  arguably more, but I would characterize there being three layers to this case.  And I think it's important to keep those layers distinct because otherwise  it's very difficult to keep track of what's going on.  So so layer one is what is not going on in this case.  And that is encryption. This case is not about encryption.  And actually, I've seen I had on the Wall Street Journal, the Apple FBI  encryption case. It has nothing to do with encryption.  No one is asking Apple to break their encryption.  There is not to date a discussion of this golden key, which I just brought up  recently, I think. But but it's something that looms over this case  because that is something the FBI has wanted previously.  It was put to rest at least temporarily last year and a bit of a  repaid account of the Crypto Wars of 20 years ago.  And in which an end there's been like reports have come out that the FBI has  kind of basically said, well, OK, we lost this round, but let's keep our eyes  open for a chance to reopen it, which this certainly would seem to fit the bill.  So that's what is what is not happening.  There's not a debate about encryption going on right now.  What is going on is is a debate about security broadly and security of iPhones  and whether or not Apple can be compelled to to weaken their security measures.  Again, they can't break the encryption. It's not possible.  But they can be compelled to do the things that you listed.  And the question is, is that covered on the All Ritz Act?  And as an aside, I'm a little tired of this act from 1789.  That's the act that established the All Ritz Act, which is not the All Ritz Act.  It's not the All Ritz Act. Oh, it's not part of the judicial act  which established the court system, which I don't think anyone is calling to undo  because the law happened to be passed in 1789.  I mean, the All Ritz Act is not an unreasonable thing.

Start time: 1212.64
End time: 1214.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And why do people cite the All Ritz Act as being?

Start time: 1215.64
End time: 1229.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what he's saying is that he's I think what you're saying, Ben,  correct me if I don't want to speak for you, is that you're tired of people saying,  why is this law from 1789 defining what's happening now when in actuality  that's sort of what the law was created for, which is a general,

Start time: 1229.46
End time: 1231.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  like a very general situation?

Start time: 1231.86
End time: 1248.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been cited in a lot of similar cases over the years.  It's been used in phone unlocking cases since 2005.  It was it was used as the basis for other sorts of cases.  So I mean, I think that's probably a good point.  I still think that they're using this as a way to get around the fact  that there's not legislation.

Start time: 1249.36
End time: 1366.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sure. I'd be happy to get to as my third point.  I mean, the All Ritz Act was a part of the just judicial act of 1789.  It's just just my only point.  I don't think that we should undo the Supreme Court because the law came from 1789.  It's part of the same set of laws that passed at the same time,  you know, all of the Bill of Rights.  So the third point, which Christina just referred to, is the political angle  and which is what kind of ties the first two together.  And and that's where a lot of this the new developments  and are from is an attempt to win the political war.  It doesn't really matter at the end of the day how or why.  From a legal perspective, it doesn't really matter how or why the past,  the I-Cloud password got changed.  It matters from a Apple making the trying to win the PR war,  where frankly, they're at a disadvantage because we're dealing with a terrorist attack.  That happened.  And the FBI, I think, is I don't think there's any question  whether or not they did this on purpose.  I don't know if there's any question that they see this as an opportunity  to win a political battle.  And I think these are clearly all tied together, but they are.  But they all have distinct issues.  And that's why it's easy to get these these mix up together is it's not about encryption  specifically, but but that's certainly in the background.  It is about this this compelling software company to create software,  not to simply take advantage of software they already have.  Pre-IOS 8, Apple simply needed to use their their root certificate  and they could extract data off the device because it wasn't encrypted  and they could extract the data off this device as well.  The only problem is it would be encrypted.  And then part three is big picture.  What's going on politically?  What is the attempt in the long run to compel this?  And again, and I think that's that's the that's what's going on,  especially over the weekend with this stuff.  This is Apple fighting back on the Apple was, I think, justifiably understand.  We pissed off at the at the FBI's court request, which framed this as a marketing

Start time: 1366.28
End time: 1374.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  stunt by Apple. The FBI literally said this is good.  This is Apple going full full bore marketing wise.

Start time: 1375.74
End time: 1379.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. I mean, which I mean, we can we can certainly get into.  But it is good.

Start time: 1379.66
End time: 1402.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, they're not wrong.  It's good for Apple to promote promote their privacy.  In fact, it was somewhat of a revelation to me that this was that Apple could even do this,  that they could sign a modified firmware that would make it easier to get into an iPhone.  I mean, you say it's not about decryption, but once the phone is unlocked,  the data is decrypted.  It is it is a methodology to decrypt the phone.

Start time: 1403.22
End time: 1406.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's it's not about forcing Apple to break their encryption.

Start time: 1406.28
End time: 1411.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, they don't have to break their encryption.  They merely need to break into the phone.  But the end result is the same.

Start time: 1413.18
End time: 1450.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it matters.  The reason it matters is is because one, they can't break their encryption.  That's the entire point of encryption.  To the FBI would like Apple to create encryption with a golden key.  With what's called a golden key.  This no.  But but that's that's that's  might be a slippery slope.  Yeah. Well, it's not just a slippery slope.  It's a you can see a scenario where Apple wins this case as they very well may,  because part of the All Ritz Act, as later defined by the Supreme Court,  which again was created at the same time, was that there can't be an unreasonable burden.

Start time: 1450.84
End time: 1462.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And there's quite a burden to this, if Jonathan Zdarsky is correct.  This is a significant effort to do this.  Well, I mean, Apple's not a forensics company.  They'd be required to create a forensics tool.

Start time: 1464.64
End time: 1541.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. And so Apple could very well win this case on its merits  from a legal perspective.  But then that's where you kind of come big circle.  Like you can see the FBI heading away, going to Congress and saying, look,  we had a terrorist attack on US soil.  Apple refused to help.  And legally, they were not compelled to.  We need legislation that won't allow this to happen again.  The best way to get this legislation is to make it so we don't even have to go to Apple  in the future. We have a golden key that lets us get the stuff.  And again, this is this is by far the worst possible outcome.  I mean, the problem with the big difference with that is then you have a silent failure  of security, because no one will know when or if that is compromised.  And it will be eventually.  And and so that's that's what makes it so complicated.  There's multiple levels going on.  And one of the levels is it is a PR thing.  And it's a PR thing because ultimately the end game is a is potentially  congressional action that could result in something even worse than what's Apple being  compelled to do here. And so there's there's multiple levels of thinking about this  that are going on and makes it which is why it's not going to be a story.  It's going to go away. And nor should it.

And some of the best security researchers in the world were brought in on this panel.  A, the conclusion there was there.  Don't worry. There's no reason for the law enforcement to worry.  There are more ways to surveil us than ever before.  And and they will have already said we'll use all of them.  But what Julian said is that absolutely that's going to be the upshot of this case  is a resurgence of legislation to provide backdoors.  That's what this is all about. He agreed.

Transcript:  And which is which is a far worse outcome.  And that's why I mean, I I I absolutely support Apple's position.  One, two, I agree there is a various very serious problem with precedent here.  But three, I'm also very wary of of.  How this is going to play politically.  And I've gotten some pushback from members about this in my because like,  no, principles principle like, yes, principles principle,  but there's multiple layers of principle and and make no mistake, a a a golden key  is a is the worst possible outcome if you care if you care about security.

Transcript:  It it's not it's not it would be impossible, because as you noted,  I mean, that's a forward that's a forward looking security measure,  which gets at why it's so terrible as opposed to something that that is backwards,  that is, you know, retroactive, which which which is the case here.  I mean, the more the more I I I've been.  Kind of making this point for the last couple of days, the more I think about it,  I think the you know, I do think that Apple is is right to fight and win this  and win on the merits. And I think the there is a great tweet the other day that  something about the US messing with the three great world religions.  And I can't remember the other two were certain was that was Apple.  And I think the FBI is probably going to get more of a fight and  than they bargained for on this, which is great.  I mean, we've all, you know, I  good, good, good on Apple for for leveraging that.

Start time: 1686.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What's also very clear is that there is an agreement in the federal government,  whether in the administration, law enforcement or Congress.  There's no I don't believe there is a consensus on providing a backdoor.  I think there are many members of Congress stepped forward and said Apple is doing  the right thing. Some did said Apple should absolutely comply.  I don't think that we've I've heard from others inside the beltway that  there is no consensus on how to handle encryption.

Transcript:  Well, I think that that's the that's the one I mean, you mentioned the NSA.  And I think the issue here is the FBI.  I mean, and James Comey has been particularly incalculant on this.

Start time: 1727.76
End time: 1731.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, we know personally, we know who wants a backdoor most.  That's James Comey, director of the FBI.

Start time: 1731.76
End time: 1841.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and I think the thing to remember is the FBI is mostly dealing with, yes,  they're doing they deal with domestic terrorism, but by and large, they're  dealing with, you know, probably mostly less sophisticated criminals.  There's a lot of of of drug cases that come up.  There was an interesting story about, you know, there's a thing in the all  page in the Patriots Act, like a peak, a peak provision that lets you invest  or basically spy on someone about them knowing you are if you got a court order.  And it was said at the time this is for terrorism is not going to be something else.  And since then, ninety five percent of cases have been about drugs and like  point five percent have been about terrorism, which I think the FBI just  wants this capability and they don't.  The problem is you look at a big picture when it comes to encryption.  We have more to lose by not having our stuff encrypted by we, I meaning the United States.  I mean, that's what the NSA says.  Right. Whether it comes to corporate secrets, whether it comes to things  or our government. And the other thing is, I mean, the United States has the most  capability of overcoming and avoiding that.  And we're the ones that all the satellites were the ones that are listening in on  communications all over the world.  And so if you game this out,  when it comes to a systematic look at our capabilities versus Chinese  capabilities versus the very anyone else's capabilities,  it behooves the United States to have stronger encryption because the United  States has more ways around that encryption relative to other countries.  So it makes the playing field more uneven.  So, yes, from a from a big picture perspective, encryption is good.  And fortunately, that has convinced enough people in in D.C.  Unfortunately, the FBI is has its head up its rear end a bit and only cares about  their particular problems and and, you know, gets us, you know, now we're stuck in  this morass.

Start time: 1844.18
End time: 1872.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Another point to be made is that no matter what happens with Apple, strong  encryption is widely available from sources all over the world.  I think it was more than 70 countries make encryption software available.  The math is out there and there's nothing anybody really can do in the long run to  prevent encryption from being used.  So the notion of putting a back door into software made in the United States, all  that does is weaken the product from United States.

Transcript:  This is getting but but that is getting you know, I understand how you can  game things out so that it gets to that point.  But it was going to get to that point anyway.  I agree. That argument.  Those bills are are being written.  Those those lobbyists are are working on this already.  If you're looking for a test case on encryption, this isn't the one right.  This because it does because as Ben rightly notes, it has nothing to do with  encryption. What it does have to do is setting the precedent that  large, very, very, very large and influential American tech companies can be  required to cooperate and provide technical assistance to the United States  government when a proper warrant is issued.  And one thing that I do like that the case and shouldn't that be the case?

And one thing that I'm really happy about in this case is that it's not coming  through the secret FISA courts that this entire thing is being argued  very, very publicly with good legal teams on either side.  So the arguments will be I mean, you know, Ted Olsen is working for Apple.  You don't get any better in terms of arguing before the Supreme Court than Ted  Olsen.

Transcript:  The other thing to remember is, I think if you go back to the cyber war, you know,  the cyber wars of of of the 1990s and this was when encryption was a,  you know, the first time that encryption was really challenged.  And this go dark debate is not a new debate.  In that case, the U.S.  government for a time actually limited the export of encryption.  So I think the most famous example was Netscape.  The international version had 40 bit encryption.

Start time: 2041.52
End time: 2061.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And look at the consequence of that, by the way, because that bad encryption still  plagues us today with signing keys for SSL.  You can. Yeah, there are escalation attacks that you could you could trick a browser  using weak encryption because that and that encryption is in there because of those  export restrictions from years ago.

Start time: 2062.14
End time: 2080.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. Because the US one was allowed to have 128, but it was too complicated to  verify you were in the US.  So everyone. Yeah. Right.  So everyone basically got the 40 the 40 bit version.  And eventually, again, fortunately, the, you know, the the sides of the angels, one,  as I would characterize it.  And but we're still at the end.

Start time: 2080.68
End time: 2088.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But there's a long term consequence.  That's the other that's the real import of this is that even that misguided law  plagues us still today.

Start time: 2088.86
End time: 2190.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It does. That's a great point.  The other thing, though, is is in response, Congress passed another piece of  legislation that people tend to forget about, which is which is known as the  Kaliya, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act.  And this was this was the counterpart.  This is again, there's always two parts to this going on.  This was the counterpart to the encryption part.  They find you can have your encryption, but we're going to do this.  And that's why all communications hardware and now software with all these  telecommunications companies has vendor ports or why AT&T has that unmarked  room in their systems.  Those are not AT&T, you know, kind of gets an unfair and Verizon get a bit of an  unfair rap. They are legally compelled to have those by an act of Congress.  Like they're not providing vendor ports and these unmarked rooms because they're  kissing up to the government.  Like it is because of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act,  which came about in response to the cyber wars debate and was like, fine, you  can have your encryption, but we're going to build it.  But in that case, we get capabilities to capture everything.  And that's where all this data collection and stuff that was revealed by Edward  Snowden on stuff that it all stems from this act, which again, just just to  reemphasize, there's there's multiple it's a it's all a security debate, but  there's different parts of security.  And I think what the FBI is trying to accomplish here is the equivalent of the  the the CLIA Act.  They're trying to say, fine, we'll let you have your encryption, at least for now.  But we want to have we want to weaken or have access to against all your other  security measures in the meantime.

Transcript:  Anything more to say before we move on?  I mean, this is a good conversation.  I think the facts are now fairly well known.

Start time: 2202.94
End time: 2282.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, there's a there's a couple of things that that I thought of here.  One is, you know, you mentioned that a lot of this dates back to the 1990s.  At the beginning of the 21st century, Microsoft actually proposed and was ready  to introduce, I think in 2003 or 2004.  I don't know if you were there at the time, Ben, but Palladium, oh, yeah,  which became formally named the Next Generation Secure Computing Base, which  was essentially this.  It's essentially what Apple has now.  But, you know, and and many of the pieces of what of what Palladium proposed have  made it into the existing PC hardware today.  So you have TPMs and you have, you know, BitLocker encryption that uses that.  And you've got, you know, the equivalent PCs for several years have had the  equivalent of Apple's secure enclave on them.  But but the point of bringing up Palladium is that when it came up in 2003, it was  shouted down hard and loud by the same people who are now rooting for Apple to  win this.

Start time: 2283.46
End time: 2290.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We saw it as a grab, a power grab by Microsoft that would allow them to keep  non-Microsoft software off their system, things like that.

Start time: 2291.14
End time: 2363.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  No, I mean, there's a I think the bigger point that it's making is the capability  that allows only Apple to install firmware here, which there's another point to be  made here, by the way.  But that's the root of the walled garden.  I mean, that's is the fact that only Apple can install an iOS device.  And by the way, this gets at why the FBI is definitely making if the FBI really  wanting to get down this phone, you know, it's widely believed that the government,  at least the NSA anyway, whether they want to share it or not, has zero day  exploits that they that they spend a lot of time and money researching and  understanding that would allow them to install the firmware themselves.  That would that would that would defeat this.  It was this this this 10 this 10 attempt before wipe sort of thing.  So in what that what those zero day exploits are about is about defeating the  requirement that all software that the core operating system software be signed  by Apple, which, you know, yes, there's lots of people who are on Apple's side  right now that a week ago were opposed to Apple's requirement that Apple sign  all the software because it's my device and I should be able to run whatever  software I want on it, etc, etc.

Start time: 2375.70
End time: 2390.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I do think you bring up a good point, Ben, which is the fact that I mean, I've  heard from a lot of people have been talking to a lot of security  professionals, a lot of hackers who who more than just NSA people believe they  can get into this phone and there are other vectors to get into this phone.  John McAfee thinks he's well, OK, but I'm talking about confidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm talking about actually competent people.  Yes, no, I agree.  You see crack heads, but alleged crack heads, alleged.  But no, I mean, but I think that brings up an interesting point, which is  it'll be interesting to see when this goes gets further into court is is how much  you know, the FBI, their position, the Department of Justice's position is very  clearly that the reason that they're going to Apple is because Apple is their  only hope, you know, help us Apple, you know, Tim Cook, Kenobi, you know, you're  our only hope. But that doesn't seem to be the case.  And it'll be interesting to see if that impacts this case or not and how that  impacts the burden, because I know that behind the scenes, there are a lot of  security professionals who are actively offering their services.  And I've heard that there are kind of two levels of people at the FBI.  There's kind of a higher political level where they do see this as kind of a  bigger political case. And there's a bigger statement to be made.  And then there are the people who are actually just wanting to work the case,  who just want to get into the phone and see if they can actually just, you know,  work what what's happening.  And so that disconnect that's even happening, you know, at that level on the law  enforcement side is interesting, too.

Start time: 2467.56
End time: 2659.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I think one thing that really highlights this fact that the  same. Apple capability that that is keeping this phone secure is also the one that,  you know, lots of people have been annoyed about, to put it to put it kindly,  gets to the fact that all this stuff has like it has tradeoffs and the tradeoffs  get really extreme when it comes to anything involving encryption.  It's very much a all or nothing sort of sort of proposition.  I mean, it's it's math at the end of the day.  Like you're going to get one answer or you're not.  And that is what makes this case this case tricky.  And I'm not sure it's one of those things where being an absolutist, you may be  right, but you there's a danger of losing winning battles and losing wars here, I  think. And that and you can't.  That's why I think it's useful to think about these different layers, because it's  very possible to be narrowly right on one issue.  And if you don't if you're not aware of and acknowledging the tradeoffs that that  has at other issues, there is no question that encryption makes the job of  legitimate law enforcement more difficult.  And there's nothing wrong with admitting that that's the case.  The burden is on us and the tech technological community to make the case why  that tradeoff is worth it.  And one thing that I think would be very helpful, I absolutely believe in a right to  privacy. And I think that that's an important reason to have encryption.  I'm concerned that's not the best political argument to make.  The fact of the matter is people have there's a long history of people willing to  throw away other people's privacy if it makes them feel more secure.  And but there's an even better argument here.  This is a security argument.  Like there are legitimate security reasons.  If you care about being safe, if you want to be safe, then you're not the the you  don't get it just fine. I'll trade away some privacy for security.  No, in this case, you are trading away better security for a short term sense of  feeling secure. Like Apple actually has the FBI shouldn't be able to make the  argument that this is security versus privacy argument.  And we're so sorry we have to violate privacy this one time.  Like the argument to be made, and I think the winning political argument is that  what the FBI is asking may help them in the short term, but in the long term, it's  making us, everyone, the U.S., every single citizen less secure because that  absolutely it happens to be true.  And that's I think the when it comes to that PR level, that's something that I  think all of us could do a better job articulating.  It's not just about privacy. Privacy is important.  Believe me, we can.  Where I think but the thing is we're preaching to the choir when it comes to  privacy. I think everyone listening to this show, everyone on here by and large,  agrees with that when it comes to winning hearts and minds, which is going to have  to be done with this.  It there's a security argument to be made in favor of this, and it's the right one.

Transcript:  Well, it's not the end of the line.  This is going to go on.  Apple is going to respond.  This story is going to go on.  But this is also going to be the first of many attempts in a variety of ways, I  think, to to break encryption.  Why is is this also partly an issue of digital technology being treated differently  than non digital analog technology?  In other words, if the if the police have a search warrant for my home, they can  search my home. If there's a lockbox in the home and the warrant covers it, they  can get into it.  If the chub, if it's a chub safe and they can't open it, they can go to Chub and  say, help us open it.  None of that is debated.  Why is this treated so differently?

Start time: 2709.80
End time: 2744.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't think it's the encryption issue because the encryption is breakable or  it's not like encryption forces this to be a fire.  Well, let's say there were an unbreakable safe, but there isn't.  Leo, that's the entire point.  Whereas encryption encryption is like and so that's that's what makes it that.  And the problem is you either fundamentally you either fundamentally  flaw encryption.  I use I think I just use flaws of verb or or or you don't like that.  It that's what forces this to be.  Well, I should point out you can't break math.

Transcript:  Encryption will continue to be possible.  Strong encryption will still exist.  It just means that Apple's version of it or Google's or whoever is forced to  provide a backdoor will no longer be reliable.  But it doesn't break encryption.  It just means your Chub safe is no longer uncrackable.  I'm not sure that that's a huge moral hazard.  Just if you're if you want privacy, you just don't use an iPhone.

It's not just the Fourth Amendment.  It's a few different ones has been found to make it so that people can't stop you  from using contraception or abortion, which is why the other issue is why the  privacy right.  This is why this political issue is so complicated.  I mean, when you talk about a right to privacy, there is a segment of this  country that their ears perk up and they hear abortion because that is the that  that that's at the root at the root of that.

The fourth layer is this isn't just a US issue.  This is about Apple selling in other countries.  The most obvious example is China, where all reports indicate that, you know,  Apple has successfully resisted similar requests from the Chinese government for  things like Golden Keys.

Transcript:  So I think, though, that there is some balance that we could strike that would help us  fight terrorism, fight criminality without.  I mean, as I said, if you really wish to have privacy, this does not.  This means you can't carry an eye.  Let's say this all goes through.  You could then is.  And at some point, there's a golden key for the iPhone or for Windows or whatever.  Doesn't mean you cannot pursue privacy.  It just means that this device can.  And frankly, I again would say if what you want is privacy, you shouldn't be carrying  a smartphone with you.  Right.  I mean, how can you how can you protect somebody's privacy if they've got a GPS device  with a microphone and a camera in their pocket that's broadcasting on the Internet?  How can you that seems like a tech that seems like a lot to ask?  Well, I mean, really, I think I don't think that we have a requirement to make sure that  somebody can take like you should be able to go jump off a cliff without hurting yourself.  That's not a requirement.  You can still pursue privacy if you wish.  Just don't carry one of these around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I appreciate you making the point, Leo, because I do think that it's easy for us in  tech to just dismiss, you know, very legitimate arguments on the other side.  I would push back on two points.  One, I already made the point that the it's not my responsibility to guarantee my ability  to speak freely, for example, to enforce my right, my right, my right to free speech.  That burden falls on the government.  The burden falls on the government to to respect rights that are enshrined in the  Constitution. So that's one.  Two, this is why the argument this is a political argument ultimately, because the fact of  the matter is at the end of the day, the threat from terrorism in the United States has been  dramatically oversold and leveraged to.

Transcript:  rights. No, that's not the argument I'm making.  I'm asking if there is some balance that we can make between protecting ourselves and  protecting our security and absolute protection of privacy.  I think it's kind of absolutist to say, well, this is why in no circumstance should the  FBI have be able to search my phone under no circumstances.

Start time: 3089.44
End time: 3135.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, that's fine. So this is why the argument is not to make a privacy argument, even though  one, I will go to the mat with you on it.  But two, I will respond to you by saying, OK, Mr.  Leo Loporte, devil's advocate, you say you care about security.  Well, let's back up and consider security as a whole and not in this one particular  case. If you look at security from a systematic basis, the fact of the matter is the United  States collectively has more to lose from bad security than any other country in the  world. One. And two, we have more capabilities of overcoming  security than any other country in the world.  So if we want on balance to be in a better position from security, we ought to encourage

Start time: 3147.04
End time: 3158.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the exact argument.  Is it the argument?  Yeah. If you want to make you can make the security argument that like if you want the  US to be more secure and make sure there's good, good, strong encryption widely available

Start time: 3159.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. The FBI is the FBI is so focused on like offense, right?  They're like this misbalanced basketball team that all they're focused on is what how can  we score the most buckets? How can we get the most data?  But to win a game, you have to play offense and defense.  And the problem is the FBI is seeking to fundamentally compromise the US's defensive  capabilities in order to score more buckets with the unwitting reality that that's a bad  tradeoff, because if everyone has the same level of defense, the US is like innate offense  is so superior to anyone else that we don't need to weaken our defense to have a systematic  advantage. And then you and the problem is the FBI again, they're just so focused on  their problems. They're not focused on.  And this is why the NSA supports strong encryption.  The NSA wants nothing better than to spy on everyone.  So why do they support encryption?  Because if you look at it on balance in a systematic sort of way, you can understand  that everyone having the same level of defense is an advantage to the country that has the  best offense. That's the United States and it will be for the foreseeable future.

Start time: 3232.44
End time: 3246.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, of course, they of course they shouldn't say that.  I think the larger issue that we have here, though, is one of a complete lack of  confidence in the United States criminal justice system.  That's the root.

Start time: 3247.46
End time: 3251.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's an interesting point.  That's the root of the problem here.  They need help.

Start time: 3252.62
End time: 3338.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and the other thing is that the law enforcement people, I, you know, maybe I'm  biased because I happen to know a few FBI agents, but I know that they wake up in the  middle of the night in a cold sweat thinking, did I forget something today?  Am I going to is my phone going to ring with somebody telling me the thing we were afraid  of just happened? And I think that's their motivation.  I don't think there's petty politics involved here.  I think it is coming from a sincere place from them.  But the fact is that what they're asking for here, essentially, they're asking for Apple  to set up a dedicated criminal justice lab that they can come to with a warrant and say,  look, we got a judge to give us this warrant.  Help us unlock. We have physical possession of this device.  It has information on us. Help us unlock it.  If if if you could actually create a system like that where everyone's phone was safe,  the only people who could break into it were Apple and Apple would only do it in their  secret lab with with a court order, that would probably be OK, except that nobody has any  confidence in that outcome actually happening and nobody has any confidence in those warrants  that are being issued being trustworthy because we have a history of the FISA court rubber  stamping those warrants for the last God knows how many years.

Start time: 3338.90
End time: 3348.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's a really interesting thing to say.  And I like it, which is if we knew that this could just be restricted to this phone and  and to it, it can't be, but it can't be.

Start time: 3348.82
End time: 3357.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, not just that, but how can you should only should only the US be able to ask Apple  to use a secret lab? Should the Chinese government be able to ask them?

Start time: 3358.10
End time: 3364.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 3364.64
End time: 3400.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It opens up a lot of precedents that I don't think that go way beyond this case.  But even just in taking it just to this case, of course, it can't just be restricted to  this phone. That's such a ridiculous argument.  I mean, because they can very easily get a warrant to change the software to make it  be done elsewhere. And as Jonathan Zdziarski said, you know, the fact that they would have  to go through testing policies to prove that the software they're creating was valid, they  would have to go through labs.  This isn't one of those things where no matter what this court order says, oh, you can just  keep it on your campus.  That's simply not true, because that's not how the forensics testing works.  There's so many layers to this.

Start time: 3400.34
End time: 3508.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That Zdziarski post is well worth reading because it may in fact be Apple's defense.  We don't know what Apple's going to say on the 26th.  But in the court order, one of the defenses Apple would have is that it's an undue burden  for them to create this tool.  And if it in fact is a true forensics tool, it's a massive burden.  And it's a business that Apple's not in.  They're asking Apple to do something that they don't do, which is create forensics tools.  I think that might actually be Apple's defense.  I do want to say one thing, though, and I think it's really important to say this, which  is I come from a point of view, perhaps foolish, of assuming that everybody in this is is  acting they believe in the best interest of the American people and of the of our security.  I don't think the people involved in this are malicious actors.  I think we can disagree about the what is the best way to go.  And I think that one of the reasons Tim Cook had this wrote this public post is he wanted  this discussion to happen.  He wanted people like you, Ben, to say, OK, I understand why you want this, but you have  to really understand the consequences of a golden key.  And it's so far reaching it actually.  And this is the most important argument to make to the FBI hurts our long term national  interest in our long term national security.  And if you can make that argument successfully to Congress, to the FBI, to law enforcement  in general, I think they are I do believe like you, Ed, I know many people in law enforcement.  There are people high up, people in the Department of Justice who listen to this show, I  know, on a regular basis.  And I think it's really important that we not come to the point of view that they're  malicious actors.  No, they're acting in our what they believe is our best interest.  And it's important to have this conversation so that they understand everybody understands  the full consequences of this.

Start time: 3509.60
End time: 3524.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that is something that, unfortunately, in the initial rush to judgment on this, there  is there is an unfortunate assumption from Silicon Valley that the motives of the government

Start time: 3524.68
End time: 3555.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  are evil, just plain evil.  And that's kind of what I want to separate out is there's an anti-government streak.  Look, I understand and I maybe don't even disagree with it.  But that is not really where the conversation needs to go, because that's that's a  different that's a political conversation.  And there is an art there.  You know, if you once you start saying, well, I don't trust the government anyway, they  should never have this ability.  You've kind of really lost your your moral standing to have this discussion.  I think Ben's argument is much stronger, frankly.

Start time: 3555.42
End time: 3670.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I completely agree.  I think that that's that's something that the point that I we're all in the same boat  here. I mean, this and this is why this is a political fight.  And being an ideologue about this is not going to help.  Again, you're going to you might win a battle, but you're going to lose the war.  And I think that that's a great reminder, Leo, and something to bring up.  One thing I do think that actually I would almost use an example.  I think this this John Zarsky post was very good and excellent.  And he's had a couple of really good posts.  I'd be wary of.  For example, I would bet the FBI should this post or similar argument say, oh, no,  we're we don't want to make a forensic tool.  And then the guy's already dead.  His defense lawyer is not going to make us verify it.  But this is why it comes down.  Like, it's broader reaching than just this case.  Well, it's about precedent.  It's about once the FBI it's in the FBI's interest to make this as narrow as possible.  So, for example, they're making it.  That's why Apple can do it on their labs and they can make it for this one phone.  And Apple can make this for one phone.  This, of course, is an applicant easily make it for another phone once it's done.  And and so the FBI is going to keep this as narrow as possible.  And frankly, you know, just as an as an observer and a former recovering constitutional  law student, it this is a very nice case because it is so clear cut.  It comes down to a matter of principle and of this interpretation of the All Ritz Act.  And I would I see, you know, it's kind of cliché.  Oh, this is not to go to the Supreme Court.  The reality is the vast majority of cases don't go to the Supreme Court.  It's a very few number of cases per year.  But this one is so clear cut and it's so clearly a matter of like there are arguments  to be made on both sides that I think it will.  And and it's going to be fascinating to watch it unfold for sure.

Transcript:  No, I mean, it's been said.  I think this will go to the Supreme Court.  I think that this is much bigger than just this case.  And I think that's why there are so many opinions about the size.  And why it's such a difficult conversation to have, because it's it's not just about this one phone.  It's about a lot more. And what that means down the line, we'll see.  It'll be interesting to see Apple's response on Friday.  Absolutely. That that's that's going to be the next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, there is there is one there is one more angle to I mean, the I mean, first off, this was the five C,  which these restrictions can be overcome by updating the operating system.  Basically, the operating system enforces the 10 passcode limit.  This would be significantly more difficult on the five S and on in because the the 10 limit and the delay between tries is enforced by the secure enclave.  With this, your enclave is basically a separate computer within the iPhone.  It's its own. It's its own silicon.  It's its own software.  You know, an Apple Apple's contention on background has been that, well, yes, it's but the same technique could apply, which which basically means Apple could update secure enclave to overcome this sort of thing.  I think what's going to be interesting from my perspective is not is probably not.  It's too it's too late for next year.  But maybe the year after that is is the counting this 10 password counting or the delay at least by the delay would be the more likely thing is that going to be etched in the silicon like.  So basically, Apple's going to be like, well, you can't change that.  You overcome this is.  Yeah, we have to build a custom chip for you.  Sorry.  Now, if you are not one reasonable burden, that's a good idea.

Transcript:  I mean, that's why this is the ultimate.  The last thing I would kind of say, what I think has been interesting about the last week is that it has been kind of this ultimate PR battle because you have Apple obviously fighting their side.  They haven't even filed a response yet, but they have filed their letter and they've obviously had calls to people on background.  And you have the FBI and the Department of Justice who are going full blast on their side.  And it's it's at this point, even though it's it's extensively not a political case, the entire way this is being handled on both sides is as political as you can get.  And it's already getting very, very ugly.  And I think it's only going to get uglier.

I think he wants to Apple to bring all of its manufacturing back to the United States, which would put it out of business.  So that's a good idea.  It's only the most successful company in the United States right now.  I, why not?

Start time: 4065.48

Uh, like to think there's, we can actually, if you can say, you want to say this about security, fine.  Let's talk about security.  And actually, uh, Apple is in the right here.  Even if you think there's no right to privacy, you think that's all a bunch of BS, like that fine.  I will, we, I'll win on a security argument.  Let's have that conversation.  Right.  And I mean, you know, the Apple manufacturing point is the value add, uh, to an iPhone is dramatically in favor of the United States.  The China value add is quite small.  The Foxconn add is a couple of dollars per device.

Start time: 4128.80
End time: 4135.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 4135.98
End time: 4201.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's not, it's not, it's not that much, but if you, if you go through the amount of value add to the iPhone, China is relatively low on the list.  I mean, the United States is far and away.  I think Japan is number one.  Uh, I believe South Korea is number two.  Taiwan's, I think number, I think Japan's number three.  Taiwan's number four.  I think Japan might be fifth or six or China might be fifth or six.  But I mean, it's the entire point where, um, being, there's an aspect of meeting people where they are.  And that's, that's a complicated issue to understand.  People don't live and breathe this like we do.  Uh, and I, I'm just concerned about people being so ideological and on, like it's understandable why people believe that unequivocally Apple should do this.  It's we got attacked, it's terrorism, et cetera, et cetera.  Uh, but the, I think it's an opportunity to win this war, not just in this case, but for the long run, which would be a tremendous benefit to.  To technology broadly and to the United States.

I'll keep that.  I'll keep that in mind.  Kids.  Apple has, uh, admitted that, oops, error 53 was an error.  We didn't mean to do that.  Uh, and that's kind of what I thought, but we didn't, weren't sure cause Apple wasn't being very communicative.  Uh, what of course happened and you, we've talked about this story.  We talked about it last week was if you had a third party fix your screen, didn't even have to be the fingerprint reader, but just fix your screen.  It would break the relationship between the fingerprint reader and the secure enclave.  Uh, of course that's a security flaw.  Uh, and if, at that point you updated your phone, you'd brick it with the dreaded error 53.  Apple said we never intended that to happen.  They released an update to iOS 9.2.1 that if you have an error 53 phone, we'll fix it.  I'm not sure how you would apply that.  I guess you'd have to plug it in.

Start time: 4265.18
End time: 4285.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's not quite right.  Leo.  Um, this, this was absolutely about the home button, not about the screen.  Um, sometimes the connector would be removed in the process of replacing the screen.  And that was enough.  Uh, and I actually, I think Apple is speaking very carefully here.  They, of course they intended to do this and actually this update, uh, does not restore the fingerprint sensor.

Start time: 4286.55
End time: 4293.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  And you will no longer have touch ID.  Right.  It doesn't have to be a third party.  My point was that it doesn't have to be a third party touch ID.

Start time: 4293.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apple's, Apple's error was in not having text that explained what was happening instead of displaying error 53.  No, the error was very much.  No, no.  Apple, the entire point of the entire point of the fingerprint sensor, the fingerprint sensor being tied in the secure enclave, uh, is the fact that the operating system, like should not to be able to interfere with that chain.  And actually that's why it's interesting.  It has an interesting tie into this encryption.  It's part of the overall security.

Start time: 4349.18
End time: 4363.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go ahead and let's, let's, let's, let's add in.  They've replaced the entire phone, but the, but the problem here was that they bricked the phone instead of just, instead of just disabling the touch ID capability and saying, and saying,  which is incidentally what Samsung would do.

Start time: 4364.02
End time: 4379.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Samsung has the same issue with Knox.  They would make Knox no longer functioning.  It would no longer have access to Samsung pay.  Uh, it wouldn't brick the phone.  And, but I think I credit Apple saying, we didn't mean to do that.  We're sorry.  That wasn't, that wasn't the intent.  Do you not think that's the case, Ed?

Transcript:  Right.  Well, it's just that you have a compromised device.  Fingerprint reading has been disabled.  Right.  Um, you know, you're bringing, bringing it to Apple and then it, yeah, it, it, but then again, I mean, are you searching to break the phone?  I mean, well, it's, it's why this is why this is whole issue is complicated.  The fact of the matter is this could be a vector to attack the security of a phone.  Like we already, we've already established that with the on disk encryption, the, the disk can't be attacked directly by far the most  efficient way to attack the disk is to attack the passcode.  Right.  And this is the fingerprint reader is a way around attacking the passcode because that's, that's what the fingerprint reader does.  I mean, the entire, the entire point here, I just found it fascinating how, uh, this is just a great example of how binary and problematic this  entire issue is, because I'm not totally certain that bricking a phone when you replace the fingerprint reader, if you actually do care about  security is the worst thing in the world.  It's a bad thing from a customer service perspective and from the way people  I don't care that much about security.

Transcript:  If that's the case, it should know it.  Look, this is the law of, this is the law of unintended consequences.  An update to the operating system is what bricked the phones that had been repaired months or, or a year earlier.  No, this was just sloppy software engineering and not testing because Apple employees don't have to take their phones, you know, their, their  test phones to a third party, third party point.  So they didn't, they didn't test this scenario because they didn't think it was going to be.

Transcript:  Right.  I mean, if you're in the Balkans and you need, and you need your phone fixed, you need your phone fixed.  I think that it's perfectly acceptable and reasonable to say that most users should understand that if you're, if you want your phone to work the  way that it shouldn't be under warranty, you need to go to an Apple store and pay their prices as inflated as they may be.  But the fact remains that if your phone, if you've got an issue with it and you need a working phone for whatever reason, then you can't send it off to them.  There's not a store there repairing your phone.  Shouldn't brick it with the software update.  I think that what they're doing now does make sense.  And I mean, then, then you make a good point.  There could be a potential security vector here.  But I mean, if you're shutting off everything associated with a secure enclave, which is what you would hope is being done and basically, you know, letting that just  not be accessible anymore.  And the only way it can be, you know, you can basically get Apple pay back is to get a brand new phone.  I think that's a fair trade off, but I don't think it's fair.  If you're getting your phone fixed and like Ed says, you get an update, everything has been working fine.  And all of a sudden your phone's bricked that you've got something that's completely useless.  I mean, at least deprecated to being the equivalent of an iPhone 5C don't, you know, make the whole thing useless.

Transcript:  Who knows what's really going on.  Steve would have wanted it that way.  All right.  Let's talk about Barcelona.  The Mobile World Congress starts tomorrow.  We actually have Father Robert Ballas there and a team covering it.  But of course, today both LG and Samsung had events to show off new phones.  Start.  Let's start with the LG G5 because that chronologically was the first nice looking new phone.  It's pretty much a kind of a reinvention of what was always a good phone, but never got much play.  The G4 is a great phone.  The G5 now has a pop out modular chunk on the bottom that will allow you to change batteries  or even add more battery or and a kind of a camera button on the thing.  See, there it is.  It's popping out of the bottom if you're watching the video.  This has been tried before by other companies.  I haven't seen a modular phone in some time, though.  What do you think?

Start time: 4787.99
End time: 4793.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love LG's phones.  I have a G4 and a V10.  Did you get the V10?

Start time: 4794.41
End time: 4798.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's the camera back, by the way.  Yeah.  What do you think of the V10?  That's a lot bigger, isn't it?

Start time: 4799.13
End time: 4820.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is considerably bigger.  It's like a six inch.  Yeah, pretty close to six inches.  Although it's not as tall as an iPhone 6 Plus or 6S Plus.  It's not as tall because it doesn't have the button.  It doesn't have to have the home button at the bottom.  The button is on the back.

Start time: 4821.74
End time: 4828.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And they've abandoned that, which I find interesting.  They've replaced that with a fingerprint reader.  They're kind of a Nexus 6P style fingerprint reader on the back.

Start time: 4828.94
End time: 4837.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the V10, this is the button and the fingerprint reader that are the same on the back.  Yeah.  Although it doesn't work about half the time.

Start time: 4838.50
End time: 4882.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're going to the same one that they made for the 5X.  I think LG made the Nexus 5X, right?  They're going to that same.  They did.  And it works really well on the 6P.  In fact, it's kind of a natural way to pick up the phone and unlock it all in one swoop in it.  I think it works quite well.  It's going to be the Samsung, I'm sorry, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820,  four gigs of RAM, 16 megapixel camera on the front and it's got two cameras.  None on the front, on the back.  And it's got a second eight megapixel camera with 135 degree angle, a wide angle on the back.  So I'm not sure how those will work together or maybe they won't.  Maybe you'll just use whichever one you want to use.  But in a way, that's kind of like having a zoom.

Start time: 4883.92
End time: 4887.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's similar to what the rumors are that Apple might be doing for the iPhone 7.

Start time: 4892.10
End time: 4914.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So it's kind of a similar thing.  I think this modular thing is interesting.  Although I'm always skeptical of anything modular because I like the idea in theory  and I think that it's cool that you could swap out something for another battery or  you could add another accessory or you could do other stuff.  I think that's interesting.  But if I'm being totally honest, it's one of those things I feel like,  okay, you invested a lot of money into R&D and development of this  and almost no one is going to use this.

Start time: 4914.84

Transcript:  But they need to, don't they need a differentiator?  This is the hardest thing when you're making an iPhone.

Start time: 4918.88
End time: 4942.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do need a differentiator.  But I guess my point is this still feels like a gimmick for gimmick's sake that no one who  actually buys the phone is actually also going to be buying the accessories because that just,  it's cool, but it seems like one of those things that's going to appeal to a very small  amount of people.  You might buy the phone thinking, yeah, I'll buy the accessories and swap stuff out,  but do you really want to travel or go around with having the different accessories in your pocket?  No.  I do like a replaceable battery.

Transcript:  The reality is there's a small amount of, the market for high-end Android is a small amount of people.  The market dynamics of the smartphone market are such that Apple has a hold on it and that hold is  slowly but steadily increasing.  And the sort of people who remain are the people who actually I think do tend to value  flexibility and modularity.  That's a reason why they like Android, why they'll pay $600 for a high-end Android phone or $500.  For that market, and this is actually why I wrote last year that I thought the S6  by Samsung was a really poor decision.  You'll remember last year Samsung focused on, we're going to have design, we're going to have all in one.  They removed a memory card, all that sort of stuff.  And everyone was like, oh, is Samsung back?  Are they going to make a thing?  Actually, the S6 was a big disappointment.  And the reason I think was obvious.  The reason is because the sort of people who were the market for a high-end Android phone  value those kinds of things.  That's why they like Android in the first place.

Start time: 5020.69
End time: 5023.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's the US here where you see most of the iPhones for sure.

Start time: 5024.60
End time: 5104.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The US is very dominant in Japan also.  And you'll see, especially in first-tier Chinese cities, there's iPhones everywhere.  Because it's a status symbol.  Right.  When you talk about selling the entire ecosystem, the ecosystem isn't just apps.  It's not just the hardware.  It's not just the status.  It's not just those things.  It's all that.  It's all that sort of stuff.  And the Apple proposition here is very strong.  Again, where the vast majority of Android sales are at the lower end of the market.  So I think we're talking about a specific niche, which is high-end Android.  And for the high-end Android market, which again, these are people who could afford an iPhone,  but they choose not to buy an iPhone.  And why would they not buy an iPhone?  Probably because they value the things that Android brings to the table.  And if you think about what they value from a software perspective,  it seems natural to assume that would extend to the hardware side as well.  Which again is why I think Samsung made a mistake with the S6.  I think the evidence bore that out that it wasn't received as well as they hoped.  And with the S7, which you haven't talked about yet, but they're adding back in.  SD cards are back, baby.  Right.  That's why I think this LG...  I like this LG sort of thing.  I think it's an understanding of what the high-end Android market values.  And I think it's a very interesting move in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if they will though.  That's the thing.  Neil Young couldn't sell a few thousand Pono players.  He didn't think LG is going to sell a few thousand on top of this phone  that's already going after a niche market.  I like the phone and I like a lot of the ideas.  I just genuinely don't think that most people who even buy this phone,  except for the reasons that Ben lays out,  are still going to want to buy accessories to carry around with them.

Start time: 5138.01
End time: 5151.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I could see buying the camera thing.  Now, it adds a big bump, but it also bumps the battery from 2800 to 4000 mAh.  That's a significant size battery for a phone like this.  You can't put it in your pocket.  Yeah. And then suddenly you have this big bump with a camera button.

Start time: 5151.06
End time: 5189.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. That's what I'm saying.  At a certain point, it still needs to be a phone.  I think that everybody who's tried this modular stuff,  it ends up not really working that well.  It didn't even work that well with laptops.  Back in the late 90s, early 2000s,  and that was when it was cool to actually have hot swappable bays in your laptop.  I love that on my Mac.  My PowerBook, my Pismo, that was the greatest thing ever.  But that was still one of those things that you didn't really see regular people doing.  So even if you accept that it's going to be a high,  just a small percentage of people buy this and that they like these features,  I still don't see... I mean, you have to carry it around.  But I like the phone.

Transcript:  They've also announced a VR headset that is bucking the trend a little bit.  Now, the new LG G5 is a Type-C connector. I'm happy to hear that.  And of course, Type-C, USB-C, if it's true, 3.1 has a lot of throughput.  And I guess it is because their new VR headset does not hold the phone as Samsung's does,  but in fact just has a Type-C cable that goes down to your phone.  And it's got its own built-in displays, dual 960 by 720 displays.  It'll have support from YouTube 360 and cardboard, so it's kind of cardboard-focused.  I don't know. What do you think?  Those who wore it at Mobile World Congress today said they felt it was nice and comfortable  and lightweight compared to what Samsung's been doing.  Nothing to say. Moving on.  Are you going to... I'm getting an Oculus Rift.  Are you going to get an Oculus Rift, Ed?  No.  Are you going to get a Vive? That's apparently now also announced for, what is it, $700 or $800?  Very expensive.  We don't even know. Yeah.  The HTC Vive. HTC announced it will be available later this year.  That's the one that's partnered with Steam.

Transcript:  Ben raised the point about the market segment response. There's a high-end Android segment.  I'm a member of that segment, and so I look at things in a certain way.  I do not understand outside of some gaming applications, some line of business type stuff  that might... The classic one is real estate for virtual tours, but I'm not sure that there's any  other business scenarios for virtual reality beyond things like that. Then a few tens of  thousands of people in Silicon Valley. I'm not sure who else is going to spend the money on  these VR headsets. Gamers, for sure.  That was the first thing I mentioned. Yeah.  They spend a lot of money.  Well, fine, but they are also a niche market. They pay for high-end video cards and high-end  sound cards, and they're the ones still buying desktop PCs with modifications and fans and water  cooling systems and all that crap, but there's not a lot of them either.

Start time: 5384.88
End time: 5425.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's not... Well, there's not a lot of them relative to smartphones. The gaming market  remains massive. The gaming industry makes more revenue than the movie industry. It's  a very large market, and I do think that's the focus. That's why I'm a little more skeptical of  these phone solutions. The advantage of the phone is that you... Especially, and this is why the LG  one doesn't make as much sense to me, the advantage of the Samsung is that you're actually using your  phone. Now you're kind of duplicating the cost, which I think it's not surprising that VR is  starting with gaming because, to Ed's point, these are people who have a demonstrated willingness to

Well, you know, if you like how technology is advanced, you could thank a gamer  because it was, after all, for many years, only gamers who were pushing processors and graphics  cards to get better and better and better. Without a doubt.  That's who was spending money on that stuff.

End time: 5464.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think that will be the case with VR too. I mean, it'll eventually go in other ways,  and we keep seeing them kind of try to get into more of the consumer-oriented spaces,  you know, the Samsung VR and this LG headset. But the software is going to have to get there too,  and I think that right now, I mean, most of the VR software developers I talk to are focused on  more of the high-end stuff and more of the gaming things. So, you know, it'll trickle down,

Transcript:  Thanks a lot, Leo. Here is a look at some of the things we're going to be keeping a close eye on  in the upcoming week on Tech News Today. First of all, Apple versus the FBI and the backdoor access  to the iPhone will undoubtedly continue on throughout the week. We're going to be keeping  tabs on that as that story progresses. Also, Mobile World Congress starts tomorrow officially.  We're going to be talking all about the many announcements, including Samsung and LG's  product announcements from earlier this morning. We're going to have Father Robert Balasar there  throughout the week with reports from the show in Barcelona. We'll see if we can't get him on  and maybe get him to bring back some jamon with him when he comes back.  Finally, HP and Salesforce have their earnings calls this Wednesday, February 24th. You know what?  News is always breaking. Megan Moroney and I will do our part to break it all apart every weekday  at 4pm Pacific on Tech News Today. That's a quick look at the week ahead. Back to you, Leo.

Transcript:  Thank you, Jason Howell. Tech News Today, every Monday through Friday, 4pm Pacific,  7pm Eastern here. Of course, as he said, the Apple topic will live forever, but it's not the only news  story. Mobile World Congress begins. Well, really, it began in effect today after Samsung's event. We  did broadcast live coverage of Galaxy Unpacked 2016. You can watch it on our twit live specials  channel. There was quite a surprise. At one point, after showing off the new phone,  showing off a new camera, they asked the journalists in that giant hall to put on VR helmets.  Look who was in the middle of the stage. Lo and behold, Mark Zuckerberg. He'd already come out  while everybody was looking at the video on their gear VR. Apparently, chaos ensued.  People rushed to the stage to take pictures. Nobody was listening to anything Mark was saying.  It was just because it's like, as the verge said, it's like Justin Bieber just appeared out of  nowhere. There were gasps, screams. People fainted. No, I'm exaggerating, but there was a lot of  excitement. Mark was there obviously to show Facebook's support. They own Oculus, and Oculus  uses Samsung's technology in its Oculus Rift. Of course, the Oculus technology label is  on the gear VR, those little basically holders for your smartphone that Samsung  sells. Let's talk about the Galaxy S7. You dissed the S7. I think it was Ben. I love the S6. I  love the S6. I thought it was one of the most beautiful phones I've ever used. Functionally,  I'd had lots of problems as many Android phones do. I didn't diss the phone itself. I'm saying it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  tough it is to succeed in the high end when you're competing against an iPhone, frankly.

Start time: 5983.44
End time: 6053.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The problem is that there is a perception that, my contention is that the common perception is  that high-end Android phones like the S6 previously and the LG and the other ones are competing  against the iPhone for high-end customers. My contention is that that competition is largely  over. They are actually competing with each other for high-end Android customers, which is a distinct  customer base from the iPhone. These are people who have had the opportunity over many years now  to buy an iPhone. They choose not to. My further contention is that these people value what they  value is different than your typical iPhone customers. Creating a product in the S6 that  apes the iPhone in being a beautiful piece of engineering, a beautiful piece of hardware,  everything all built in. You can't add memory cards, you can't replace the battery, all this  sort of stuff. Samsung was misunderstanding their competitive position. I wrote this when they  announced it a year ago. I thought that the projection that, oh, now they have high design,  they're going to sell a lot of them, was actually, no, they're actually going to sell fewer. That's  what turned out to be the case. They said they listened and they gave us more of what we wanted.

Start time: 6054.06
End time: 6178.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  As you pointed out, they put an SD card slot in. They also made it waterproof, which notably the  S6 was not. I don't know how big a part of how important that is. I guess people drop their  phones in toilets a lot. This is very much a design-forward phone. It's not as if they've  abandoned it. In fact, they've gone metal. It's black onyx and gold platinum. Also in the edge,  silver titanium. They've gone big. The S7 Edge is, what is it, five and a half inches? The  S7 itself is 5.1 inches. They're, I think, quite stunning. In fact, I can't wait to get my hands  on the new S7 Edge. They have also added an interesting feature, a lower pixel count camera.  They've gone from 16 to 12 megapixels. Just like HTC before them and others, they've said,  well, no, bigger pixels are better. I think Google said this with the 6B. Bigger pixels are  going to gather more light. HTC went to like four megapixels. They went to five. They may have gone  a little bit too far. They are using an interesting technology. I don't know if it's a Sony sensor.  That's one of the problems that these companies have. They're all using essentially the same Sony  part in their camera. This one is F1.7, which is extremely fast, much faster than the F2.2 iPhone 6S.  They are using some sort of technology that allows the pixels themselves to focus. Apple uses some  pixels for focusing, but Samsung says they're going to use all of the pixels. I don't know what this  means. It's just gobbledygook to me to focus, but they did say it will focus much faster. Also,  giant batteries, a 3000 milliamp hour in the smaller S7 and in the 5.5 inch S7 edge,  3600 milliamp hours, which is a lot of juice. That's listening too, isn't it? I think that's  responding to many Android users who say battery life needs to improve. Ed, which phone do you use?

Transcript:  Do you use a Nexus? No, I have the G4 and the V10. Oh, that's right. You said you like the  Nexus. Yeah, I just switched to the V10. I had a Nexus 6P, but for whatever reason,  and I worked with Google support on it for the Project 5 support team, and it would take 45  seconds to open a webpage on any Wi-Fi network that I was on. They sent me another one and it  had the same problem. I found other people that had the same problem. I wanted to try that Nexus  6P, but that's kind of a deal breaker when a webpage takes 45 seconds to load. So I went back  to the... The G4 has been just a marvelous phone. It's one of the best cameras I've ever had.

Transcript:  For now, yeah. They're making wonderful products. They're really doing some very,  very smart engineering, and I don't see a lot of gimmickry in what they're doing either.

Start time: 6250.12
End time: 6255.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Samsung, of course, the king of gimmickry. The challenge here is the order in which

Start time: 6257.78
End time: 6341.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  people make decisions. I believe that people first choose iPhone or something else, and then  once they decide on something else, or they explicitly choose Android, then they decide,  do I want Samsung or the LG or whatever? The problem for Samsung and LG and all these sorts  of guys is they can't change that equation. They don't have the control to change that.  So all they can focus on is the hardware aspects of their devices. If customers made a decision,  well, I'm going to treat all these as equivalents and then choose the best one. This is just a  nothing new. This is a replay of... I used to always chuckle when you would read reviews  in PC Magazine or back in the day of the new Apple laptop. At the end, they do like to compare,  and like, well, this compared to the ThinkPad, to the Dell, to the whatever. If someone is choosing  an Apple laptop, they're almost certainly not even considering the Windows laptops.  You're setting up a false comparison. Obviously, that was at a much smaller scale  than what is going on with phones, but I think it still holds. It's fun to talk about the Samsung  features relative to an iPhone, but it's a purely academic debate that I don't think has much

Start time: 6342.58
End time: 6351.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  that will really matter in the market. Although they, again, are they making the same mistake  that you thought they made last year? Is there too much design and too little tweakability?

Start time: 6351.72
End time: 6382.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have no problem with design. No, I mean, obviously...  For the Android market?  It's better. No, I don't think... I'm not saying Android people want like...  Ugly phones? Yeah, we do. Absolutely. Yeah. Give me an ugly phone.  My entire point was by... They went so extreme with the S6, like basically cutting out all  extensibility and all ability to tweak. I just think they... And I think they did it to take  on the iPhone, which I think was just a misunderstanding of where the market was.

Start time: 6382.58
End time: 6402.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, and I welcome the return of the SD card slot, but I have to say it really feels like  a very fragmented market where essentially you decide, I like this, and people are brand loyal  and don't change a lot. I mean, I think Ed's going to stick with LG for some time to come and  not be tempted.

Start time: 6403.24
End time: 6433.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The danger is losing what you have. And I think Samsung... That's what happened with  Samsung last year was they lost customers because they... That's the hidden cost of  features and being tricky or clever or whatever you've characterized Samsung as being. And this  is something that I think Microsoft really had to learn. I remember it was... It's way harder to  take things away and unwrap things than it is to add them in the first place. And that's something  that Samsung learned last year.  The power of no.

Start time: 6434.78
End time: 6494.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there was an extra... There was a double whammy for Samsung, which was Apple introducing  large phones finally. So there were a lot of people who were buying Samsung's or some other  fairly large, you know, Droid, Motorola, whatever, a fairly large phone because the Apple phones were  just too small. The iPhone 5, especially if you're of a certain age and your eyes aren't  you know, you don't have the vision of a red-tailed hawk anymore, you know, an iPhone 5 was not an  option and the larger screen was much easier on an older demographic. And there's plenty of people  in an older demographic who are still willing to spend money on it. But once Apple got in there  with the 6 Plus and the 6S Plus, all of a sudden, oops, that didn't become the critical  differentiator anymore. Oh, there's now an iPhone that's big enough for me. Fine, I can switch back.

Start time: 6494.90
End time: 6530.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I would say Samsung's new plan is to really create an ecosystem, an Apple-like ecosystem with lock-in.  And it's very clear, you know, their watches are no, you know, they're really not doing the Android  Wear anymore. It's Tizen. And their VR helmet only works with Galaxy. In fact, they are even,  if you pre-order a Galaxy S7 when it goes on pre-order in two days, on the 23rd, you get the  VR and six games for free. That's very interesting. That's smart. That probably means they haven't sold

Start time: 6530.76
End time: 6541.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a lot of Galaxy VR or Gear VRs. Quite a few of them lying around. But that doesn't mean that it's  not a great, you know, pre-order gimmick. I mean, frankly, the Gear VR is not a bad product and

Start time: 6542.48
End time: 6549.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Transcript:  Right. Although, I mean, people have had the phones now for about a week, so we'll see.  Oh, they have. Oh, I didn't know that. I don't know if I was supposed to say that or not.

Start time: 6571.50

Start time: 6574.74
End time: 6624.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to spring up pretty soon. Yeah, I have no idea when they're going to spring up. I just know people  have had phones. But yeah, no, I mean, I like what they're kind of returning to Ben's point,  kind of, you know, bringing back the water resistance, which I think is smart, bringing  back the SD card slot. I always really like the design. I thought that the camera on the S6 Edge  was great. I loved the camera. I think one of my favorite cameras actually of the year, and we did  a big camera shootout. Ray Wong from Mashable did. And in some, it basically almost was an even  split between the Samsung and the iPhone 6S. And so, but yeah, I mean, they're kind of in this  interesting place like Eucelio, where they are kind of trying to create this ecosystem. And they're  succeeding to some extent. But I think the problem has been they've spent all this time on the custom  Samsung software that just nobody's using. You know, those apps and that's-

Start time: 6630.56
End time: 6633.64

Transcript:  That's a surprising success given the competition.

Start time: 6634.40
End time: 6640.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I wonder if the success there is because it also does like the MagSwipe stuff. So I wonder

Start time: 6646.24
End time: 6662.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're taking advantage of the fact that it's got the NFC, it's got the MagSwipe stuff,  so it can be used in more places. But even then, I haven't seen a lot of people using Samsung Pay,  so we have figures to go by. But I more mean like their apps that they're building, you know,  like their own notes app. Just stop doing that, please.

All  of these hardware companies who thought that they could build a better Windows shell and shovel a  bunch of utilities on there. And it was just crapware, and you have crapware on mobile devices  too. And people- I'm with you, Christina. I don't know anybody who's using those Samsung apps,  and I don't know why they're putting the effort into trying to maintain that-  They've kind of acknowledged it.

Start time: 6741.24
End time: 6776.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think that there are two battles. There's the battle on the high end, which obviously you  have what we've seen from Apple exams.  And Apple doesn't care about low end, right? So that's-  No, they don't. Exactly. But that's where the scrap battle is, and that's where you have your  Huawei's and your Alcatel's and your Xiaomi's and your company of the week here. And then you have  the side stories like the Nexpet Robin or whatever, the phones that will never sell any  substantive amount of devices but are interesting. And we'll get some interesting stories because  they have an interesting gamut, but we'll certainly never sell in large capacities.

Start time: 6778.86
End time: 6849.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's the point. There's two markets. There's the iPhone market, and then  there's- I say there's really three markets. There's the iPhone market, there's the high end  Android market, and then there's the low end market. And the iPhone's biggest competition is  the iPhones that people already have and when and if they decide to upgrade that. I do think Ed's  point about the screen size is a good one in that it's almost the exception that proves the rule,  in that the one thing that it turns out people did care about more that guided their decision  before the operating system, before the system was the size of the screen. And I think the evidence  is that Apple added a ton of new to Apple customers with the new screen sizes. There's  actually not that much evidence that Apple certainly probably pulled forward some upgrades,  but I think if you look at the numbers carefully, they just brought in a huge wave of new customers  for the iPhone 6 specifically. And yes, certainly that was the one kind of trump card that Samsung  had for a long time. It's a great point that both Samsung and LG also announced 360 degree

Start time: 6850.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  cameras. LG's looks a lot like the Ricoh Theta S, which I've been using. In fact, both of them  are consumer oriented, I think, with dual cameras and a very wide fisheye lens on each. And those  are able to then stitch together into stills or 360 degree immersive video. The Samsung's looks  interesting because it looks like it can do live streaming. In fact, what Samsung kind of was pushing  at the event was the idea that your friends could be in Paris at the Eiffel Tower, you could be at  home wearing a Gear VR, of course Samsung product, and with your Samsung Galaxy S7 phone, they're in  Paris with their Samsung Galaxy S7 phone and the Samsung Gear 360 camera, and you are immersed in  what they're doing in real time. That's what it looked like. I might have been reading more into

No, that's video.  So we'll see. Although John Carmack tweeted that you shouldn't go any higher than 3840 by 1920 at  30 frames per second because the Gear VR just can't handle it. That was last year. Maybe it's  different this year. Anyway, I think that that's a big market. I'm very excited. I have a Ricoh  Theta S and I used it on my last trip. It was really fun. I feel like 360 video is a very exciting  thing. And that's by the way, when Mark Zuckerberg was on stage to say, yes, Facebook will support  this. We believe in this and the immersive video. So not a surprise. All right, we're way behind.  So I'm going to get to another ad because I want to get you out of here again before the Academy  Awards next week. Oh my God.

I think that's going to win best  director and Leo's finally going to get his Oscar. But based on, and I see I'm bad at this because I  based this based on who's won the awards and then you can kind of figure out like how the voting  blocks are going to go and it looks like the big short will be the one who takes it.  That's the one I haven't seen, of course. It's good. It's good. Brie Larson is without a doubt,  Brie Larson is totally winning best actress. That to me is without a doubt.

So Brie's biggest competition  would probably would have been against Charlotte Ramplain from 45 years, but Charlotte kind of  killed any momentum she would have had. But Brie has literally won that award from every other  award show award ceremony. So voting wise, I think that she's a lock for that. And she was great in  room.

And in this case,  I actually think that his performance in The Revenant was fantastic. But I think that Leo  has probably deserved Oscars in the past times he's been nominated to.

Transcript:  We're talking not about me, by the way, but Leonardo DiCaprio. My Oscar is long off, I'm sure.  Our show today brought to you by audible.com. Audio books are the greatest thing since movies.  In fact, I always think of an audiobook as a movie in your mind.  Truth is, sometimes I think I've seen the movie when I haven't. I just listened to the book and  it was... it came to life. I don't care how much money they pour into a science fiction movie.  There's no way those sets, that action are going to be as good as what you can see in your head  when you listen to these books. I love science fiction on audible.  I'm listening right now to Neil Stephenson's latest Seven Eves, which is really a hard  science fiction book, almost like The Martian. Same kind of idea, which is you're faced with a  really remarkably difficult problem and then you use science to solve it.  I'm sure he was inspired by The Martian. By the way, The Martian also nominated for best picture.  Best audiobook ever. You've got to listen to that. Here's the deal. I'm going to get you two books.  You can listen to both of them if you want. Go to audible.com slash twit two. That's twitting  the number two. You'll be signing up for the platinum plan. That's two books a month. That's  my plan. And by the way, I love it. The 22nd is my renewal day. So I look forward to every month.  Like in two days, I'm going to be able to get two more books. There's a wish list you can add books  to see if you hear us recommend something and you're already a subscriber, add them to your  wish list. But this, if you're not, this is your big chance. Get two books free. You'll also get  the daily digest of the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times. You can cancel any time in the  first 30 days. You'll pay nothing. But as always with Audible, those books are yours to keep. Oh,  The Help. What a great movie. But you know what? The book is even better. And the Audible version  of The Help is a dramatization that just comes to life. I am a huge Audible fan. I know you know  that. I don't know why you haven't tried it in the past. When you're in your car, when you're at work,  when you're on the treadmill, when you're walking the dog doing the dishes, it's nothing like having  a book. And if you have an Amazon Echo, man, I get home. The first thing I do as I say,  Echo, read to me and it will pick up where I left off and read my book. And that is awesome.  Audible.com slash twit two. Get your two free books right now. Audible.com slash twit two.  How could we have buried the lead, Ed Bott? HP's Elite X3 Windows phone.

The  whole day of like HTML5 is going to save us from mobile apps thing that that turned out to be false.  I really like what they're trying to do with it. I agree with that. I think it's a really good idea.  I personally don't think this is going to sell any and I don't think demand is going to be that  great. I think HP's best bet with this will be to bundle this when they're trying to like sell  their corporate customers. Like, hey, take a fleet of phones too. But I mean, you know, HP hardly has

And most tech journalists who are covering this don't understand the  enterprise at all. They look at this as a pure app store play and it makes no sense. But,  you know, there are scenarios where this could be a good business. There's no scenario where it  topples Android or the iPhone from one in two positions.

So if we're going to talk about the value that Apple brings to the American  economy with its mobile infrastructure, you really should talk about the value that, you know, the  boring enterprise. So boring, though. Well, yeah, okay. Money's boring.  Money's not boring when you have it in your pocket. If you actually looked at it, yes,  is that a new phone in your pocket or are you just being boring?

Transcript:  And this is, and so this is an interesting thing for me because I had this, this Surface Pro 4 was  not, it was functional. It did its job, but I had to, I had to go in and change the power settings,  to force it to hibernate, close the lid, hibernate. Now it only takes like 12, 10, 10 seconds, maybe  at most to wake up, which is not that much, but it's annoying. But at least it did its primary  function, which it worked as a laptop computer. The Nexus 6P that I had did not do its primary  function, which is to work as a handheld computing device. So I sent that one back and I gambled  that they would come up with the driver fix for this one that fixed it. And they seem to have done

But if they hadn't shipped it by now, I probably  would be turning that laptop back in. But now it's, but it's one of my favorite laptops. It's really

Transcript:  fantastic to play with. The sort of ironic thing about Ed's point, Microsoft certainly makes,  particularly makes a lot of money off enterprise. And you would have been better off investing in  Microsoft as of a couple years ago than Apple, for example, basically in part because they  remembered that's how they make money. Right. And frankly, because they were seduced by the  gadget side too. Among the many mistakes made with the Windows phone, I think by far the biggest  was the fact that it wasn't focused on the enterprise from day one. In fact, the Windows  phone was significantly inferior to the iPhone when it came to enterprise features for many years.

Start time: 7816.84
End time: 7821.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 7821.98
End time: 7872.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  well, right. It was enterprise first, right. Because they were the only ones buying iPhones  at the time. And then they kind of rebooted and they swung all the way to the other side.  And I think in many respects, there's lots of ways to talk about, you know, what Satya Nadella has  done at Microsoft. And I've been a big fan, but I think maybe the, if you want to really  bring it down to a nutshell, it's kind of remembering what Microsoft is good at and  refocusing the company on that. And the way that has played out, you know, folks on Azure and folks  on the cloud generally is the tactics of that. But at a high level position, I think it's been a  real narrowing of what, of Microsoft's ambition. And that's, that's can be a really good thing.  I mean, focus is, is, is something that matters. And, and kudos to him for that.

They were hit by ransomware.  The, the, I don't, I don't think it was targeted at the hospital. I don't think this was a  spearfishing attack. I think it was just a net. They got caught in a net and unfortunately,  they didn't have email. They didn't have access to patient data. They were admitting patients on  paper with pens. They, they were using horrors, fax machines and telephones to get work done.  Finally, they gave up and they paid the ransom, which turned out to be 40 bitcoins. That's all.  $17,000, right? Yeah. That's all. And, but you know what? Had I been there, I would have  counseled them not to because so many times we've heard of people paying the ransom and not getting  the key or getting a key that didn't work, but apparently it did. Well, for $17,000,

Start time: 7974.26

But there's,  you know, we're back to the enterprise again. And now all of a sudden you've got an interesting  enterprise story, don't you?

I don't think it's not hard to put a fairly nice little, we have it here,  a little appliance, security appliance in between you and the outside world that,  that stops things like ransomware from infiltrating. Or that mitigates their damages.  Well, a good backup would have mitigated the damage, right? Yeah. A good, good, a properly

So apparently I didn't realize this, but the Linux Mint website runs on WordPress.  Problem number one, self-hosted, as you know, with self-hosted WordPress, you gotta, you know,  keep on those patches. They must've missed a patch because a bad guy on the 20th got in  to the Mint website and repointed the downloads to their own server in Bulgaria, where they were  offering a nicely modified ISO of Linux Mint that had a nice backdoor Trojan in there.  The good news is because they encourage you, and I use Linux Mint and I love it, because they  encourage you to run against the MD5 to validate the ISO, it was noticed pretty quickly. I doubt  for it. They think not many people download it. Two days, two full days. In fact, they discovered

Start time: 8124.90
End time: 8146.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it on day one and they made the announcement, okay, we've fixed this now and everything's fine.  And several people in the comments section said, no, you didn't fix this.  No, it's actually not fixed, dude.  Yeah. And then they were still down. And so then they took the website completely offline.  And, you know, but this is, can I do a shruggy here?

I mean, it's become a cliche to blame WordPress, but one, I'd like to know how  up to date, as you know, the WordPress installation was, and two, what plugins they had installed,  whether they were edited. Because that's actually the vast majority of, the vast majority is out of  date plugins for most WordPress exploits. But then three, I mean, what was their web server  architecture that getting into WordPress, access to all this other stuff?

Start time: 8203.44
End time: 8213.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I would say it probably wasn't WordPress. I think that that, I mean, unless they were running  a really out of date version, because that's had automatic updates for a while and has gotten a  lot better, it probably was something on their server side where they were then able to actually...

They seized the Playpen, which was apparently a popular child  porn site on the dark web and kept it running. That's a little suspect right there in order to  catch more suspects. They used malware to crack the Tor browser that people... It was on the dark  web, so it was an onion site. So they were using malware to get into it. And on Wednesday,  a judge ruled that defense lawyers in the FBI case must be provided with all the code used to hack  the client's computers. When asked whether the code would include the exploit used to bypass  the security features of the Tor browser, the public defender told Motherboard everything.  The declaration from our code expert was quite specific and comprehensive and the order encompassed  everything identified. So we may learn how the FBI pursued this, the malware that they were using.  They apparently infected as many as a thousand computers.

I love Go To Meeting because it just makes a meeting more interesting. You know, nobody likes meetings.  And nowadays with everybody distributed all over the world, it's harder and harder to have a meeting.  And yet meetings are the most effective way to cut through the confusion, to get down to work,  to brainstorm. You just got to do it. If you're presenting to a client, you want to meet with them.  You want to make the client meet, want to meet with you too. It can't be a chore for them.  And that's why I love Go To Meeting. It's easy for you, but it's easy for them also.  You go to Go To Meeting right now and try it free for 30 days. You'll be up and running in minutes,  literally before the show's over. Certainly before the Academy Awards start.  And I know I'm confusing the hell out of people by saying that. And your clients, it's the same thing.  You just send them a link in the email. They click the link. If they don't have the software,  download seconds later, they're in the meeting. You know what? They're going to be pretty impressed  because now they're seeing your screen. And more than that, they're seeing you with that HD quality  picture. It's like you're in the same room. Share screens to present, to review, get feedback in  real time. I've used it to collaborate.

They were challenging the NSA's internet and telephone surveillance.  The case was the, was Ju-El versus the NSA. The EFF was authorized on behalf of the plaintiffs  to conduct discovery against the NSA. They've been trying to do this since the case was filed  in 2008. For eight years, the government's been blocking them. For the first time ever, the EFF  now will have access to what the NSA is up to, what tools they are using.  This is huge. The government was unable to prevail in court.  So the door is open for discovery. And I'm, you know, I'm very interested in what the, what the,  what the EFF finds out. The EFF is suing the NSA and other government agencies on behalf of  AT&T customers. This is exactly what you were talking about earlier, Ben, the secret room  secret room in the San Francisco AT&T headquarters, which were controlled by the NSA,  which we learned about because of whistleblowers like you. So please come forward and tell us what  you know. You probably don't like this story so much, Ed, the verge story, how, how schools  around the country are turning dead Microsoft PCs into speedy Chromebooks. Although this is a good  use of a dead Windows machine. Yeah. Yeah. These are eight to 10 year old Dell desktops and laptops.  I mean, these are not, what are you going to do with these? So you can run one to seven on it,  but yeah, no, you're making a point. Yeah, no, I think a Chromebook is a better idea. And you  know what's good about Chromebooks? You can't run Minecraft on them.  And that's what you need in the middle school and high school, right?

He's talking about how IBM came up with a good  voice for Watson, the computer that played Jeopardy. And of course now is doing all sorts  of things. In fact, you've seen the ads of Watson talking to people from everybody from Bob Dylan to,  to athletes. And he has clips, I guess, I guess Markov has written a book about  computer speech synthesis, which I think would be a fascinating read, but let me play some of  these samples. Cause you probably heard Watson. These are, these are examples that they use.  This island that was home to a notorious prison. This is the voice they ended up using on TV.

You could follow her on the  Twitter if you want to follow those Oscar tweets at film underscore girl. Yes. Mr. Ben Thompson  from Stratecary. He offers every week a free article. And this, this week it was of course  the article about the Apple FBI or DOJ story. I actually wrote about Zenefits, which we didn't  talk about. Oh man. What a story there. Huh? What the hell? So Zenefits was a high flyer,  three years old, right? Not very old. The idea of fact, we even considered using them. The idea is  you replace your old benefit system, which you might be doing your old HR system payroll  with this fancy super duper automatic software, great dashboard, easy to use, saves you money.  It seemed like a, you know, a modern way to handle HR. Turns out maybe not so modern. A lot of it was  done by humans who made a lot of mistakes behind the scenes, an extremely aggressive sales force.  And one of the things they were doing, of course, in order to sell, you know, the software,  medical insurance software, you had to be certified by the state and there was a fairly,  what is it, 52 hour course you had to take. So, hey, no problem. They wrote software that would  let the computer think you were watching while you were sleeping. I think they got in a little  bit of a trouble for that. Did anyone call it Zenron? They're not out of business. They fired  the CEO. They brought in a new CEO who has pledged to fix everything. They got rid of the sales guy  that was maybe overly aggressive. What is your take on this, Ben?

Transcript:  Well, I mean, they brought in a new CEO who was the COO who mysteriously didn't know anything  that was going on. I knew nothing. I know nothing. I mean, they're also, you know, they've  fallen very short of their revenue projections. So there was clearly a lot of pressure going on.  What I wrote about in the angle was there was sort of a lot of think pieces that came out along  the lines of Silicon Valley gets act together, the bad boy routine, et cetera, et cetera. And  they were comparing Zenifits to Uber. And my contention was that this current Zenifits situation  was very different than the Uber one. And so the point of the article was kind of exploring why,  like when does it make sense to challenge legislation? When does it not make sense?  And in this case, the regulation was unambiguous. No one was benefiting from challenging it other  than Zenifits. Like there's no consumer benefit. There was no recourse. Like Uber gets people to  protest and to write to their elected officials and things like that. They were banned in Utah.  Right. Actually, that was the angle I took, was I think the Zenifits Utah case was much more like  Uber and there it made sense to challenge it. Whereas this was just pure cutting corners. And  while there was a benefit, you could argue it wasn't worth the risk. It was just poor business  judgment. And so that was the point of my piece. I do have a daily update, which is subscribers only,  but I had one about Apple that I made free, which I again had to update.  And this one's from Monday. The Zenifits article is also free.

But as you  say, Mr. Crust made some fundamental errors in what he was assuming was Windows 10 phoning home.  It wasn't phoning home. It was phoning a Torado server for crying out loud.

Transcript:  You know, to me, the issue was this was a story that was on Forbes.  That's amazing, isn't it?  It had 400,000 people read this story and it was crap. It was fact-free crap. And then there was a  follow-up story that was even worse. And so it was... And despite the author of that story  thinking that I personally took delight in insulting him, I didn't. And in fact, I went  out of my way to focus on the facts in this story. There's just so much fun. And I will have a  follow-up story coming this week on what actually is in Windows telemetry.  Oh, I would love to know that actually.  You'll be shocked to learn how little there is there.

And they can fix it in a matter of days instead of waiting for the support lines to light up.  So on balance, it's a good thing.  So I got the headline for you. I turned off Windows telemetry,
