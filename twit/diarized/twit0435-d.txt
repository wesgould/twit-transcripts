Transcript:  the website so either works and the idea is and you know Jessica by the way  wrote many really good byline pieces for the Wall Street Journal that's where I  first became aware of you we've been trying to get you on Twitter since then  breaking a lot of news there and then like a lot of people I think people have  left the Times left the journal of Walt Mossberg Kara Swisher people like that

End time: 337.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you decided to do it yourself yeah I am I suppose that some of the  entrepreneurs neurial spirit in the valley runs off on you but it really  boiled down to thinking about sort of our audiences and so at the journal and  I loved working there I felt that the audience was becoming a more general  audience and tech and the importance of technology to business was exploding and  that there was a demand for a publication that focused more on  professionals and was at a little more sophisticated level that you could be at  if you were writing for a more general audience so this was something that was  sort of in my back of my head for a while and earlier this year I decided  that we wanted to go try and build it you know we've been quoting stories from

End time: 383.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  we're basically five journalists five trunks and the and I gather the idea is  and this makes sense to me I always said you know we don't do a paywall we're  advertising supported but and I always said that if you're gonna have a pay  wall you got to make money for people that the only reason people are gonna  pay for content is if they could see a direct benefit to them absolutely that's

Start time: 383.94
End time: 435.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  actually the main thing we think about I mean I think that you can't think about  a paywall and is it a good thing or a bad thing or what kind of paywall to do  use without thinking about the content behind it and what that's gonna be  worth to people and so we're out there at 39 bucks a month or 399 a year at a  price point that's really geared towards people who are going to expect to learn  a lot and get a business advantage from our content and I think that's the only  way that we can justify that and that's what we spend a hundred percent of our  time thinking about is how to deliver that kind of content but a lot of  there's a lot of interest in paywalls and business models in the media  business I don't think there's enough recognition that it really matters  what's behind that paywall and who that's targeted at in terms of whether  or not it will work so this is our bet that there's a nice audience fit at that

Start time: 435.92
End time: 455.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  price point with our content yeah Rupert Murdoch has famously tried paywalls but  there's a big difference between the Wall Street Journal which clearly makes money  for its readers and for which I pay and something like a Daily Mail which is no  reason to pay for and so where he's done paywalls on just kind of general content  it doesn't seem to have worked I think did you ever consider a paywall for the

Transcript:  also stayed intentionally small yeah yeah you know I watch with interest  because you know we always have to think about how we monetize we're pretty happy  monetization strategy but I think there's plenty of room for and it's great  to see a bunch of experimentation a bunch of different ways of doing this  good luck Jessica I think it's great thank you yeah thanks very much let's  get to some of the top stories of the week usually it's a little slow this time  of year thank God for Jeff Bezos who keeps things interesting right after the  show last week I went home I ran home because 60 minutes Jeff Bezos is on  Charlie Rose and this is where I think there is a difference in mainstream  media and tech media Charlie Rose says Jeff is gonna show us something no one  else has seen and Jeff opens the door and Charlie goes I mean really as and  what it was of course and we've all talked about it for the past week is  delivery drones this is a very even Bezos said a very beta idea and of course the  first thing everybody said is oh come on the first thing that's gonna happen  somebody's dog get chewed up by a beta by a drone dropping off a package it's  gonna be the end of that FAA approval of course the limitations but I was  interested to see there it is not brand new there there are there is a company  for instance that's been using drones or trying drones in Haiti for earthquake  relief in Haiti that there are places without roads that a drone makes a lot  of sense but is it this is so how much the question is how much of this was a  media play and how much of this is serious I know I actually think he's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  really serious Amazon's warehouses are a thing of technological beauty they are  completely automated the picking process which normally takes an army of workers  where they would go to different shelves and and put together an order that's all  done by robotics so in his mind I could see him saying well why don't we just  expect extend that automatic process one step further rather than dropping it  into the assembly area where area where gets put into boxes why not put it into  a crate that gets automatically delivered to the customer yeah it has to

Start time: 611.72
End time: 627.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  be a certain object and it has to be under yeah and it has to be a nearby  delivery obviously these drones can't go miles I think if that guy had come out  the door or the kid had come out the door 30 seconds earlier he would have  been chopped into pieces so that's a problem it actually ties into the other

End time: 664.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazon news which is that the Supreme Court says that they won't hear Amazon  make the case they don't need to charge sales taxes for other states that try  to the drug because once that's over it's essentially Amazon doesn't have a  reason to avoid being in a lot of states up until now it's tried to be in as few  states as possible so when I order stuff in California comes from Vegas it comes  from yeah Nevada yeah if you have to charge sales tax you might have might as  well have more facilities right you're not gonna be able to do drones if you  only have a few large warehouses far away from metropolitan areas they have

Start time: 666.08
End time: 690.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  91 fulfillment centers I mean Amazon is huge like they're one of the reasons  Amazon has historically not turned profits is they've decided they decided  since the dot-com bus to invest in fulfillment centers and infrastructure  Bezos is a master I think it's really interesting to watch somebody build a  business design not to make any money for a long time I mean he's really  thinking long term so drones if you're thinking if you think that long-term

Start time: 690.80
End time: 736.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  drones doesn't seem that crazy well everyone's making fun of it because of  course you could poke fun at the individual scenario well if you're  further than 10 miles away it won't work well if it's heavier than five pounds it  won't work well if the drone malfunctions it's gonna fall on your  car etc yeah that's a good problem but I mean look back to the history of  innovation there are so many things that people thought well that's stupid that's  crazy that's ridiculous the technical technological hurdles are just amazing  and they've become backbones I mean the internet itself is one of those things  so yes does it sound crazy yes is it technologic impossible no right so I'd  say if it's not technologically impossible something like this is  eventually gonna take hold now whether or not it's Amazon or someone else who  takes this idea and runs with it that remains to be seen and presumably

Start time: 752.28
End time: 811.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  oh I think he's very serious I do think he's underestimating the regular he's  probably not underestimating it but he is a little down down playing regulatory  issues yeah that still remain I think he in that 60 minute segment had some  forecast for when the FAA is licensed or expected to approve some of the usage  for commercials commercial usage for drones and I think what I've read is is  less ambitious so I think they're dead serious I think it's certainly coming  but like any other new category Google Glass etc I think we were we're gonna  have some battles play out in Washington and and maybe Amazon will go ahead and  and you know my big takeaway from this announcement was that they wanted to put  some pressure on folks you know get a little bit of a buzz and pop before the  holiday for Amazon but put some pressure on Washington in the industry because  there are gonna be a lot of battles in the coming years over this it's it's

Start time: 811.70
End time: 818.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  interesting because the consensus seems to be and you guys all pretty sharp on  this that this wasn't a publicity stunt so much as really something he's serious

Start time: 818.78
End time: 832.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about I think it's both a stunt and serious I mean the fact they're talking  about it now long long long before they can actually do it is a stunt but that  doesn't mean that they don't really want to do it right and it doesn't mean that  it won't happen in some form from somebody within our lifetime this is a

Start time: 870.80
End time: 883.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  much of a PR stunt as the Hyperloop was for Elon Musk I mean yeah but Elon didn't  put a penny into that he just said it yeah he just said it and people are  running with it maybe Bezos is hoping that people will do that with this

Start time: 883.28
End time: 916.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  technology I actually think Robert I mean and I think it's much less of a  I mean I think that the Hyperloop is an idea in Elon's notebook but I think  these I mean I think these drones are coming and Amazon is very very serious  about him so I like the sentiment but I but I think that you know there's a lot  of discussion Google is working on a lot of technology in this area as well I  would be shocked if there wasn't a major tech company that wasn't thinking about  this is a platform so it's in my two cents but I but I think that this is

Start time: 917.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  going to be very serious technology Jessica you would know this you you've  got your pulse on the inside of business is there visionary envy among some of  these big names that you know they they want to they hate it when someone else  comes up with that idea that inspires people they want to be the person that  says here's a crazy thing now make it work absolutely and I also think it's

Start time: 939.74
End time: 975.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  visionary envy among the egos but also among the companies largely for  recruiting purposes as well I mean I think that if you're an engineer and you  see those videos from Jeff Bezos and Amazon and drones Amazon is a place you  want to work it's a place where cool stuff is gonna happen so there's a lot  of brinkmanship in the look how cool I am these days I think Google's sort of  playing that card as well they've got Google X you know their place for  experimental moon shots I think we'll talk a bit more about Andy and his  robots later so I feel that for sure in the industry right now I love it

Transcript:  visionary envy I like it that's the that's the that's the wolfies these days  is I got a I got the most visionary plan yeah let's talk about Andy Rubin Andy  Rubin the head of the Android division until he left a few months ago at the  time I speculate I knew Rubin was really into robots that's why Android is named  and I think Larry's maybe with Sergey said he's gonna be doing a  moonshot well we now know what the moonshot is we'll talk about that in  just a bit Jessica Lesson is here from the information calm father Robert  Ballester of this weekend Enterprise Tech and the technologizer Harry  McCracken from time.com our show today brought to you by our good friends at  Citrix the makers of go to meeting this is a time of year when meetings are hard  and you know I bet you that Jessica's staff isn't all in the same room I know  ours isn't people travel people get sick but you still have to get together you  still have to share great ideas do a little visionary thinking with your  co-workers and that's where meetings really do make a difference but nowadays  online meetings make it a lot easier and there's no easier way to do an online  meeting then go to meeting from Citrix go to meeting lets you share the same  screen with your co-workers and clients and colleagues online not just from a  computer by the way Mac or PC but from mobile devices as well you can even  present from an iPad which is pretty cool to be sitting out in the garden if  it's a nice day sitting in the jacuzzi if it's a snowy day and working on the  iPad and presenting to a client I'm in the jacuzzi would you let's talk you  also get the HD faces you may not want to turn that on in the hot tub but the  HD faces means you can see each other face to face and crystal clear HD video  just turn on your webcam and there you guys are I just think it's fabulous I  know a lot of teams keep go to meeting running all day as a way to collaborate  in remote locations no credit card to get started you could try it for 30 days  you'll get it started in seconds on your computer a mobile device when you visit  go to meeting comm click the try it free button a big red button in the middle  there and use the promo code twit 30 days free as you know by the way we're  gonna have a little contest we do this from time to time as you know go to  meeting with HD faces let you meet face to face with your team no matter where  in the world everyone's located we want to know where in the world you would  like to host your ideal go to meeting tweet us a picture of your answer you  can steal the picture doesn't have to be one you took using the hashtag win twit  that's hashtag WI and TW IT and don't forget to make it at go to meeting as  well so that they can see it and you'll be entering for a chance to win an apple  gift card valued at $300 toward any Apple hardware accessory purchased an  apple retail stores or the Apple online store courtesy of our friends at  Citrix remember tweet us a picture this time of where in the world you'd like to  host your ideal go to meeting using the hashtag win twit and at go to meeting  the contest ends December 12th the winner will be announced on the December  15th episode of this show that's one week from now so don't waste any time  contest open I'm sorry to only US residents hey that's the law folks for  contest rules and regulations visit inside dot twit dot TV slash contests  Apple registered trademark of Apple Inc Apple is not a participant or sponsor of  this promotion thank you lawyers go to meeting.com try it free today use the  promo code twit Andy Rubin I read stories about Andy you go to his house a robot  answers the door it's like the Jetsons there's robots everywhere so it wasn't  much of a surprise when I read the article in the Times about Andy Rubin  his next job at Google is designing robots robots for it sounds like for  business more than for consumer not like a not like a Android in your house  butler supply chain stuff supply chain for instance if it writes John Markoff  in the Times if Amazon can imagine delivering books by drone is it too much  to think Google might be planning to one day have one of its robots hop off  an automated Google car and race to your doorstep delivering a package it might  be a little anthropomorphic but I guess it's possible Rubin's a smart guy is  this I wonder though is this you know any I think had done everything he could do  it Android and it really was probably time for him to move on is this a case  of well we just want to keep this guy inside the company so give him something  fun to do until we think of something better or is this really serious well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jessica sorry yeah no I totally agree so at the information we reported the same  day is the time story very similar story that talked about Andy and and working on  robots and we also hear that it's not just manufacturing so I think in the  short term yes that's what they're focused on but Andy has a lot of  ambitious ideas and has been thinking you know about what would it be like for  humans to get used to having assistants and people essentially robots with them  so I think that's the scale he's thinking on we know a little bit more  about the project we know that it's being called replicant which of course  refers to the robots in Blade Runner so keeping with his naming convention of  sticking to robots and he has a massive office complex in California Avenue in  Palo Alto that has a ton of manufacturing equipment that he may open  up to startups as well or to companies he's close to so there's a lot to watch  in the project but you know I think both we and the Times had reported they  require Google's acquired a number of companies in this effort you know it is  part of Google so this isn't just Andy although it often is just Andy when he  has his projects going but it's exciting and we you know he's pulled people from  Android to work on it it's pretty hush hush but it sounds there's some real  momentum building now and I think he's gonna really try to get robots into the  mainstream and in a way that you know they haven't been and we're probably  many many years away from but he has a vision around that and it's gonna be fun

Transcript:  to watch I think Amir it was Amir who said he was walking down California  Avenue and looked up the stairs at the office and there's some sort of robot at  the top of the stairs did he say that I think he was yeah I know there are robots

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  outside the Android building or some just sort of replicas of them but Andy  has a ton of robots at Google he had one that was trained as a coffee barista to  make coffee it's it's part of his quirkiness and passion and I think it's  it's exciting for him to be at this phase you know the the one thing we do  hear from folks who are close to the project is that everyone continues to  say how ambitious it is and there's very much a sense of how are we gonna do this  but that's often a good sign that you're on to something I think if you feel that

Start time: 1424.48
End time: 1454.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  way so wonder how if Google has to be sensitive at all to the the Skynet  factor the idea that maybe it's not such a good idea to build autonomous robots  and everybody's a little afraid of Google anyway and the last thing you want  is is Google to have autonomous robots that are today how sensitive when you  when you when you guys talk to people like Larry and Sergey how sensitive are  they to that that that the common person might be a little scared by this idea I

Transcript:  think they come you know it's interesting because I was thinking about  that when in the follow-on from Amazon so Amazon announces it's working on  I didn't read a lot of concerns about privacy and surveillance I am sure they  were there but that wasn't the knee-jerk reaction we had to that  announcement right if it had come from Google I think it would have been the  knee-jerk reaction you bet and you bet I think that I think this gnaws at people  at Google so I think the company Google is very aware that they're gonna have to  that this is gonna be a problem for them and in getting mainstream adoption of  their technologies I'm not sure how much of a concern it is at the point of  creating these projects and in terms of the engineers how front and center it is  but clearly the company at large thinks a lot about it but this was one of those  examples where you I think Google has to be you know they have to be thinking  about these things and everyone's right to stress tests on them but they you  know we should be asking the same questions of Amazon and I haven't heard

Transcript:  reason I'm confident in that is that that was sort of what happened when I  was at the journal for eight years we were also behind a paywall and when we  had stories that warranted picking up by other outlets they would pick it up  but it didn't cannibalize our core base and so that's the attitude we're taking  about the story though so that we hear that Google is getting ready to as soon  as sort of the first quarter of next year launch another one of these cheap  set-top boxes kind of like the Apple TV something that does not replace cable or  TV but gets you Hulu and web video and in this case also games I think having a  gaming console and something that in some way can stand up against the Xbox  and the PlayStation is what Google has in mind here of course Google I many many  years ago focused primarily on Google as a beat reporter and I was writing about  Google TV and you know a whole slew of products that were their attempts to get  into the living room you know this is another one we saw Chromecast earlier  this year which basically helps push stuff that's on your computer or tablet  onto a bigger TV you know this category actually boggles me a little bit because  I think we see so many you know Roku's and Amazon's coming up with a box and  Google and and I just kind of wonder what it is about this around a hundred  dollar category that doesn't seem to be really taking off that has all these  guys pushing forward and I think what it amounts to is that no one can afford to  not get a toehold in the living room in terms of delivering advertising or  delivering other kinds of content people are gonna want to get it on their bigger  screens and I think these companies feel like they have to have a presence there  and they haven't been able to do big deals with the cable companies or the  satellite companies or the other providers so they're going at it on  their own I just don't know how many hundred dollar sort of little boxes we  need to plug into our screens so it's not a big it's not a big selling category

I don't know  if that's true and I don't think that's true. I think you know yeah we're gonna  malign bomber he made a lot of mistakes but he he wasn't a horrible CEO he  didn't drive the company into the ground and he actually was involved with all  the different divisions of Microsoft. The value of Microsoft from the day he

Start time: 2523.38
End time: 2559.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Balmer messed up Microsoft and I think the odds are pretty good that no matter  who was CEO of Microsoft over the last decade they would not have monopolized  cell phones or tablets the way they monopolize the PC just because almost  never does does the company that dominates the old world dominate the new  one as well. That's the challenge. Balmer did make mistakes but I think  if you think that he was terrible and is to blame for Microsoft not being at the  center of the technology world anymore you're setting a bar for him that almost  nobody could have met. Steve Jobs is the one person who did meet that bar. Well I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  CEO and then make a transition. Although Balmer said he was leaving though because the transition  needed somebody who would be with that for the long term so if they do hire  somebody who's not there for the long term and doesn't plan to be there for  the long term that does not jive with the rationale for why Steve Balmer is stepping down.

Start time: 2610.18
End time: 2647.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah I also think that tied up in this question is what is  Microsoft in terms of what businesses will stay or go. I mean there's been  lots of discussion of whether online services or Xbox you know should be  separate businesses. I mean should it all be this one Goliath and I imagine  those questions you know will fall largely on this this person and so and  they're very much alive now so I think that that complicates the CEO choice but  very much still in the background in terms of you know what this business  looks like and what is the focal point of Microsoft. Is it still Windows? Is it

Start time: 2648.00
End time: 2690.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Office? Is it Xbox? These are good questions. I want to see if that whole the revamping of the  philosophy to go towards devices is gonna survive the change in the CEO  because it actually sounded like a decent change in where we're leading  the company. If we're moving away from the siloed version of Microsoft where  Office is competing against server competing against mobile competing  against entertainment and now looking at just having users that are in the  Microsoft environment I am actually very attracted to that. If the new CEO is  gonna say no it was better the old way where this division fought that division  that for resources you know I don't want to see that. Clearly dysfunctional right?

Start time: 2690.42
End time: 2737.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's wholly dysfunctional. You know Elop for a while the thought was Elop comes in and does do the split.  Elop said I think he said he wanted to sell off Bing and Xbox. That's the story.  Which is the wrong kind of thing. I think if you ask me the wrong thing to do and not even doable.  Bing is so intertwined with what Microsoft's up to that I don't think you can even do that.  Sacha Nadella who's their cloud guy is a good candidate inside. I don't know I don't know.  I think this is tough. I don't is there you think there's a Marissa Meyer out there.  It's kind of a somebody nobody expected that could be hailed as a conquering hero  as somebody who could come in and turn the thing around. Who would it be?  There's only one person I could think of.

End time: 2774.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No I was just saying I'm sure the answer is yes but it doesn't seem like that's totally the direction  that the search is going largely because of what I think what you identified this is such a complicated company  that you're really you know is it fair to throw someone in that who doesn't know some of the nuances.  I mean Yahoo at the end of the day I think has straightforward problems straightforward opportunities.  It's quite different but I don't I don't think we'll have a big surprise on this one.

And to be the greatest possible Microsoft CEO you need to be really good at both of those things.  And it will probably be somebody who is really good at one of them and learns how to do the other one.

Transcript:  I got talked to by the Park Service.  You did in Washington D.C.  We had this major event.  One of the portals was the White House.  But you could only get to it by putting your hand through the gate to get the GPS close  enough to the building.  So you had dozens of people doing this and if they didn't turn the volume off on their  phone it was saying target locked.  And so you've got people targeting the gate of the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know how much it's a game but it gets them so much data from people's GPS devices  about the maps about where people congregating.  They can actually figure out movement patterns of people and where they go.  And people think it's just a game for Google.  That's actually big data.  Yeah.

Start time: 3252.67
End time: 3275.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a great idea.  Speaking of big data Apple has purchased topsy for two.  We think two hundred million dollars although some rumors that maybe it's a little bit more  a lot more than two hundred million dollars.  Topsy was a data analytic company Topsy Labs that launched right about the same time as  Twitter and they have every tweet ever published.  They have what's called the fire hose.

Start time: 3276.50

Transcript:  Why would Apple want Topsy Labs?

Start time: 3286.24
End time: 3344.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it was not just about social data because I think that Apple frankly doesn't  have a well it's not their business.  It's not their business and it's not that it isn't important but Apple thinks about  you know software and how we can sell more devices.  And so I think I don't just think it's for the raw data.  I think it's for the talent and the engineers and the expertise and thinking about software  that goes beyond sort of software today.  I mean Apple has this I think a strategic challenge in that for many years iTunes was  the killer software that you needed and that got you to buy an iPod and then eventually  an iPhone.  And Apple's been investing as iCloud is another one of those sort of killer software  platforms that you just lock into and that has an intense amount of loyalty so that keeps  you in the Apple ecosystem.

Transcript:  And doesn't work very well.

Start time: 3346.62
End time: 3364.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it doesn't work very well exactly and I think you know Apple doesn't have to Apple  software and services are important in terms of engendering loyalty to hardware and it  needs new expertise in that area and I think the team at Topsy is looking to them to help  chart the next course.

Start time: 3365.84
End time: 3374.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just it's puzzling to me because it isn't in Apple's wheelhouse in any way or even in  their core business in any way.  And you just have to look at Ping.

Start time: 3375.33
End time: 3414.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it is.  I mean.  But it really is.  There is a golden cow here in social networking.  Well I understand it's a good business but it's not Apple's.  No but not the social networking business itself.  Because most of the tools for social networking have been decent at taking the firehose of  data off of Twitter off of Facebook and figuring out trends and influencers.  One thing that Topsy was trying to do and I think Apple that's the reason why they  bought them is they were trying to get proactive.  They were trying to tell you you want to get your products in this person's hand.  You want to get your event in this city because this is where we see a chain reaction of social  engagement.  That's absolutely in Apple's business.  That's how they sell their products.

Start time: 3415.14
End time: 3418.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're saying they're going to take it private in effect.  Oh absolutely.

Start time: 3419.70
End time: 3428.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is their internal engine that says this person needs to be using a MacBook.  That person needs to be using an iPad.  This person needs our new wearable tech because they're going to influence everybody else.

Start time: 3429.18
End time: 3435.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That makes sense actually because it's clear retail is a big part of Apple's financial success.

Start time: 3436.32
End time: 3464.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean the fact it's not in Apple's wheelhouse is probably a good reason for them to be acquiring  companies like this.  A lot of it comes back to big data.  We know that that has never been a strength of Apple's examples such as Apple Maps are  everywhere.  Right.  And it therefore makes sense for them to acquire people who are good at that.  It may not have that much to do with searching Twitter.  The Topsy-Pokes folks have proven they're really good at analyzing vast quantities of  data and making sense of that.

Start time: 3465.34
End time: 3474.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They just sent them an analysis I think which is very tricky.  You're not merely saying there were 38 tweets about the Apple store.  You're saying of the 3,800 tweets about the Apple store 53% were happy.

Start time: 3476.80
End time: 3496.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the same reason I think it's unlikely that Microsoft will end up selling Bing because  Microsoft also needs to be able to understand vast amounts of data and the closest thing  they have to a team focused on that is the search people.  And they're going to need that for Windows Phone.  They'll need that for Windows 8.  They'll need that for enterprise stuff too.  Google is the one company that's already good at that.

Start time: 3497.58
End time: 3528.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  I think there's also to get to the merchandising potential of the data.  I think it's less in terms of retail because Twitter signals or social media signals are  probably only one signal for whether you're going to buy a $2,000 computer.  But also if you think of the iTunes and the App Store and solving discovery problems like  how do I find new apps and how does that keep me engaged in my device.  And Apple bought a search engine called Chomp a while ago for a lot less.

Start time: 3529.70
End time: 3532.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was about recommendations though, app recommendations.  Right?

Start time: 3533.38
End time: 3574.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was.  And people who were on that team have taken on broader sort of data science recommendation  roles within Eddie Q's organization within iTunes.  So I'm not 100% sure if that's the case with Topsy.  But I think it reminds me a little bit of that and that expertise.  And I think that we sometimes forget, while Apple does sell devices, the App Store has  become just this ginormous ecosystem and people complain about app fatigue and how  do you get people to continue to buy new apps and also music and video and all the other  media within iTunes.  So I can see Topsy playing a big role there too.

Start time: 3576.40
End time: 3586.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I guess Apple's got cash to burn.  It seems like they could have just hired Topsy.  They didn't have to buy Topsy.  I mean that's what Topsy's business was.

Start time: 3586.50
End time: 3592.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's one of their core concepts.  They want to own all the core technologies.  And so if that's going to be a core thing.

Start time: 3593.50
End time: 3603.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or maybe keep others from using it.  If it's a good technology and Apple's retail could use it or Apple's recommendation engines  could use it, keep it out of the ecosystem so the others can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, let's buy it.  Gift.  You could pay them $1,000 a month or you could just buy them for $200 million.  I'll take it.  It's a deal.  We'll amortize that in 100 years.  I do want to talk more about Apple retail and about iBeacon because all of a sudden  it's like the world discovered iBeacon.  Robert Scoble's been on this show many times going crazy about iBeacon.  The problem is when Robert Scoble goes crazy about something, I usually go, okay, but really  I should have paid attention because this is very interesting.  There's a reason why iBeacon is suddenly going to be a big, big deal.  We'll talk about that in just a moment.  Our show today brought to you by our friends at squarespace.com.  It's web hosting, yes, but it's also the best content management system and the web  hosting together.  By making the two things interact like this, you get the best web hosting and the best  content management system.  Squarespace sites never go down, for instance, and we got a lot of traffic at our blog site  this week, inside that's with that TV.  At no point was it unavailable because Squarespace, when there's more traffic to your blog, they  put more bandwidth on it and it's automatic, it's instantaneous.  You'll never even notice the difference.  The content management system, it's so good, it's so elegant, it's so modern.  It's always up to date.  You never have to worry about security or updates because it's automatically up to date.  I want you to try it.  If you're interested and perhaps you want to, maybe you're looking for better hosting  or you want to start a new site, maybe you want to do e-commerce, Squarespace has that  too, visit squarespace.com, click the get started button and all you need to do, you  don't need to give them a credit card or anything, is just pick a template.  You start with 20 gorgeous templates, all of them mobile responsive.  By the way, that's momentum.  I like that one.  That's a full bleed.  That means the picture goes all the way to the edge of the screen.  You might say, yeah, but what about what size screen?  doesn't matter because even if it's a 27 inch screen or a four inch screen, Squarespace  sites adjust automatically to fit the screen.  So your site always looks great.  There's no separate mobile site.  It's all there.  Even the e-commerce is mobile enabled.  That's really special.  And that's a pretty looking dog there.  So pick your template, but scroll down and you'll see all the different things done with  the same template.  And that's another thing I like about Squarespace.  You don't have to be a designer and have a great looking site.  You don't even have to know CSS or JavaScript or any of that stuff.  It's all drag and drop point and click.  You add the social media, add whatever you need.  If you are a developer, they have a developer platform.  That's very, very nice, but you don't need to be.  And that's the point.  Every site looks unique.  You want a little help.  They've got the best customer service in the business.  They've got webinars online that you can take.  They've got a great active user base and forums too.  So there's always plenty of places to turn for help with your Squarespace site if you  should need it.  SEO, automatic.  It's all taken care of.  All the things that Google or Bing or whoever need are done, things like sitemaps done for  you automatically.  I am just a big fan.  Now, if you try it for two weeks, and by the way, you can import all your existing content  into it.  If you try it for two weeks and you say, yeah, I kind of like this, check out the pricing.  It's as little as $8 a month when you buy an annual plan.  Most people go for that unlimited plan of $16 a month.  That means you could do something like the information because you could have unlimited  galleries, unlimited blogs, unlimited pages, unlimited contributors, total control over  who has admin access, who has publish access, all of that stuff.  Unlimited bandwidth.  You suddenly go big.  You get slashed on it or tweeted or dug or whatever, and you're never going to get a  bandwidth bill.  Unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage, and when you register for a year, you get a custom  domain and they hook it all up for you free.  $16 a month.  Want to do e-commerce, they do that too.  $24 a month, they do not take a transaction fee.  That's it.  $24 a month.  You get unlimited physical, unlimited digital, unlimited service products.  You can have unlimited, it's the word, right?  Pages, storage, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited contributors.  They will help you track inventory, do taxes, and that's not trivial.  I mean, all over the country, different taxes, even in different cities, they do that all  for you.  They will help you with shipping, complete coupon controls.  It's $24 a month when you buy an annual plan.  And we're going to make it even more affordable because when you use our offer code TWIT12,  because we're in December, 12, you will get 10% off your new account at squarespace.com.  So the free two-week trial, you don't need our offer code squarespace.com, but when you  decide to buy, use TWIT12 for 10% off.  And when you get the annual plan and it starts to add up some real savings.  Very impressive site.  See, you should have done that with the information.  I bet you, you're spending more than $12 a month on your site, Jessica.  It's not cheap.  A little more.  We just agreed to redesign our TWIT.TV site, which we redesigned a year ago, because it's  just so dysfunctional.  And it's expensive.  It's hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Yeah, to do it right.  And we're not even doing something as elaborate as you're doing, Jessica.  Boy, when you look at $24 a month, it just sounds like such a deal.  So you might say, well, why didn't you do Squarespace, Leah?  We do for our blog.  But I think for the podcast, for all the stuff that we do, we're using Drupal and we need  that kind of more powerful.  What are you using for your back end on the information, Jessica?

Start time: 3979.32
End time: 3989.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't say the name out loud, but all my editors and teams and friends at the journal  knew exactly what I was going to do.  Yeah, I was interested in their views and opinions very much.

Start time: 3991.94
End time: 3996.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3997.36
End time: 4015.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So from the day I left the journal until launch last week was about almost six months to the  day.  We wanted to get out there.  You've got a bunch of reporters who love the news and want to write stuff that you can't  really vanish for a year and hold on to your stories.  They don't last that long.

Start time: 4016.22
End time: 4030.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  Yeah, everybody's champing at the bit, I'm sure.  And I'm sure the developers are going, be patient, be patient.  I'm writing as fast as I can.  It's very, you know what I like about it?  I haven't paid for it, as you know, I'm still, but just going to the front page is very clean  and very straightforward.

Start time: 4030.99
End time: 4058.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's our goal.  We're big believers in the importance of technology and have a lot of ideas around new features  and products and ways to improve it.  But the end of the day, our value proposition is the stories and the content.  And so we wanted to put most of our effort there.  And of course we don't have advertising and we don't care about tricking people to stay  on the site longer or to click a lot of headlines.  So that left up a lot of room in the design.

Start time: 4060.10
End time: 4102.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a really good point.  And I think it is something that has become a bit of a problem reading technology news  is link bait.  What do they call the lists, the little lists that people...  The listicles.  Yeah, just the listicles.  It drives me batty.  And of course, you know, all I do day in, day out is comb through tech meme.  I use Prismatic, which is Brad Cross's kind of social media triggered news site.  I use Feedly.  All these tools, Nuzle, Jonathan Abrams Nuzle.  So I look at and of course my own feeds and I look at tons of stuff and 90% of it is crap.  It's really depressing.  So I think I better spend some money.

Start time: 4103.70
End time: 4107.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 4116.34
End time: 4179.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The other thing that you hit on that I hear a lot and felt a lot is not only is there  variety in the quality of the content, but I think there's a lot of the same thing every  day.  And because everyone's so focused on whether it's Amazon drones or sort of weighing in  on these topics that are known to generate a lot of traffic, what you have is a sort  of, you know, in any given day, we're sort of consolidating coverage around these attention  grabbing topics.  And I think that there are many reporters out there and there's so much going on in the  industry.  You know, why is that true?  Why are we just all running to the same place on the field?  And I think a lot of the reason is because of the economics of the business models that  are dependent on advertising and capturing sort of what there's buzz around.  And we think differently.  And one of the things that we hope to do is, you know, introduce some new points into the  daily conversation around tech.  So we're not all just talking about the one or two things that happened that day.

Start time: 4180.61
End time: 4217.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking as somebody who will be rehashing your content regularly.  Thank you.  I actually we want to we really want to.  We just hired Mike Elgin, as many of you know, we really want to beef up our news coverage  and and even if we could maybe break some stories.  I mean, what we do is punditry.  But I think you're absolutely right.  You can't just be corned beef hash all day.  Occasionally you need a steak.  Hash.  I do like corned beef hash.  So let's talk about iBeacon.  What I found very interesting this week was the nugget.  OK, so first of all, what is Harry, maybe you can explain.  What is iBeacon?

Start time: 4218.38
End time: 4246.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a Apple technology that uses Bluetooth to very precisely determine where somebody  with an iOS 7 device is within an enclosed space, such as an Apple Store.  And they're using it with a new version of the Apple Store app.  So that if you're looking at an iPad in the iPad section of the Apple Store, they know  the app knows that right and can do things such as give you information to help you decide  to buy an iPad.  And it uses Bluetooth LE.

Start time: 4247.28
End time: 4308.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what I found very the thing I learned or we all learned this week is that it turns  out every Bluetooth LE device that Apple's been making and that goes back to the iPhone  4S, maybe even the 4 is also a beacon.  So I've thought for a long time you had to buy a beacon, glue a beacon to the wall, glue  a beacon here.  You are a beacon.  Every, so there are stores where they talk about LeBron James shoe store in Miami, LeBron's  shoe store.  Every shoe has an iPad display that goes with a shoe.  That's not uncommon nowadays to see that kind of thing on a showroom floor.  Every one of those iPads turns out to be already an iBeacon that can, with some simple setup,  be set to say to your iPhone or your other Bluetooth LE device, oh, you're over here  by the, you know, the Nikes.  Maybe you'd like to go over to Adidas or whatever.  Or here's a coupon.  It also could be useful for more than retail, right?  I mean, you could use it at a museum, I guess.  Are there some non-commercial uses for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, if your phone is your beacon, you could also use it theoretically.  Turn on lights as you enter your house.  Anything that should be triggered by your presence, you could use your beacon for, especially  since it's slow powered.  Now, you want to know why Apple buy Topsy?  It's for stuff like this.  These beacons are a major source of big data for Apple.  If they can correlate your beacon to something you tweeted, something you put on Facebook,  you said, oh, my MacBook's getting so slow.  The next time you walk into an Apple store and you walk next to the MacBooks, it goes,  oh, you know, why don't you try this?  No, it's been three years since you bought your last MacBook.  This is so much better.  They can custom tailor using the Topsy engine.  It's actually kind of brilliant.

Start time: 4352.02
End time: 4371.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and the brilliant stealth move is they've been building this in every Apple device for  the last two years and we didn't know it and they flipped the switch in effect.  And I think that's where Apple can really surprise people is to say, oh, yeah, by the  way, it's already everywhere you are.  Does this kill NFC, Jessica?

Start time: 4372.63
End time: 4381.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I was just going to say that.  So in sync.  Yeah, no, I mean, to me, when this comes out, I think, you know, everyone's been waiting  for Apple's move in mobile payments.

Start time: 4382.12
End time: 4385.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it was clear they never put NFC in any of their devices.  It was clear they didn't like it.

Start time: 4385.64
End time: 4485.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Google did and everybody else did.  And Google was betting on it and Apple didn't, which actually isn't that unusual for Apple.  I mean, people think of the company as very innovative and defining new categories, but  it does so by sort of coming in right when there's a more mainstream tipping point.  So not in the very, very early innings.  And so they did.  They sat and they sort of waited on payments.  And I think the sense I was getting from reporting inside the company was that, you know, they  really didn't want they wanted to do something that was much bigger and more leverage than  just sort of point to point payments.  And I think it's still unclear exactly what they have in mind, but very clear that this  is the technology they're betting on to do it.  And I still don't think they'll come out with a square killer or a PayPal killer in it may  have that effect of harming those companies, but I don't think they're going to release  a product that directly resembles those products, but something broader, something tied in and  has a sort of platform components for app developers.  But yeah, I can't see much of a big future for NFC.  You know, it was sort of wavering for a while anyway.  But now that Apple's placed its bets, it'll be interesting to see.  You know, I barely even used any of those products and I'm fairly early adopter.  So I don't think it's that hard to pull out a credit card.  So I'm not sure what the next innovation will come in payments, but I think it's got to  be a lot more than just that sort of point of sale thing and more around software and  you know, offers and other kinds of stuff.

Transcript:  PayPal in September announced a beacon, they called it beacon, device for payments with  Bluetooth low energy.  So this is, I mean, this, but Apple was, Jessica, you did the best articles about Apple when  you were at the journal.  Did you?  No, I mean, I read it religiously.  Did you have any clue that Apple had this very clever stealth?  This seems to me a stealth strike.

Start time: 4512.28
End time: 4555.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think not directly.  No.  I did write about payments and I, the main story I did on this subject in Apple was from  the point of view of like basically a division inside the company a bit on strategy and figuring  out at the most senior levels how aggressive to be and how not aggressive to be.  And I think that this was a timeframe of probably 18 months ago.  And it was clear that they were sitting on the sidelines because of NFC.  But I think that Bluetooth out, they've been very vocal about their support of Bluetooth  LE.  I mean, Apple people actually are very involved in the standard setting around it.  So that was one big hint that there was something like this, but.

Start time: 4557.06
End time: 4572.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we knew, I mean, we knew if you had a Fitbit which used Bluetooth LE, you knew which  devices a Fitbit would work with.  And it was an iPhone 4S and later, a Mac mini, a MacBook Air, an iPad.  Yeah, I mean, Bluetooth LE.  We knew it worked, but who knew there was a beacon?

Start time: 4572.90
End time: 4587.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it'll be hard for the rest of the industry to catch up just because Apple only has to  make Bluetooth LE work in a few devices and Google has to convince every handset maker  that uses Android to support Bluetooth LE in a similar manner, which is going to take  a while.

Start time: 4587.90
End time: 4608.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are Bluetooth LE Android devices.  Yeah, there are some.  Galaxies S3 and S4 do it.  Yeah, not yet a standard though.  It is far from a standard.  Everybody, everybody's standardized on NFC.  Everybody but Apple had put NFC in their phones.  Microsoft hedged their bets.  The Surface has, I think, no, maybe it doesn't have NFC.  It has LE.  The Nokia has NFC.

Start time: 4609.16
End time: 4630.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't necessarily see them killing each other off.  NFC requires some sort of active motion from the user.  You have to tap it.  When I want to bump with somebody, I'm actually holding my phone up against theirs or I'm  tapping a payment screen.  iBeacon is, it's more of a location where technology, it could be used for payments.  It could be used for a lot of stuff.  Yeah, when you walk up to a desk.

Start time: 4630.92
End time: 4643.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I could walk up to you and your iBeacon would say, here's my contact information.  Kwikset makes a lock that unlocks when I get near it.  It only works with an iPhone because it's Bluetooth LE.  But I think they own this.

End time: 4656.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I admit, and of course, we're all sensitive to that now, but I just feel like there isn't  room for two.  One of these...  No, if I'm a shopkeeper, I'm looking carefully to see what to install.  I'm not thinking, oh, I'll buy both.  I'm looking at what...  I can afford one and I'm waiting to see.  I think there was a lot of...  I was mad that Apple didn't announce NFC on its 5 and 5S because I thought that's bad  because if they don't do it, then that makes every shopkeeper go, well, I'm not going to  take a chance until I see what Apple's doing.

Start time: 4697.94
End time: 4734.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's also this in terms of a chicken and the egg problem.  So the advocates of NFC say that it's not going to require shopkeepers to do it because  the actual credit card companies just need to adopt it and they refresh their point of  sale terminals, et cetera, et cetera.  So it actually doesn't require a huge burden in the point of view of the retailers.  I'm not sure that's true.  I think the...  But it is interesting.  I mean, I think we have to...  We're at this point where there is going to be...  People are going to have to make choices about what to adopt.

Transcript:  You know, and yes, strategically it's very, very savvy, but I can read an iBeacon from  dozens of feet away.  I need to be within inches to read an NFC tag.  So if I'm stepping back...

End time: 4796.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I like.  I like that.  I like the ability to say, there is no way for me to read your NFC tag from across the  room unless I'm sitting there with a yaggy antenna and you're probably going to notice  it.  Whereas with an iBeacon, the whole purpose of an iBeacon is to use low power but give  location data a distance away.  So now let's say you go into an Apple Store.  You're surrounded by 50 people all crunching to get the latest iPad.  Are you really going to use that as your payment system with all those beacons active at the  same time?

Start time: 4797.18
End time: 4832.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So in this case, probably not.  Probably not.  But you're not going to use NFC either because you're Apple.  Probably not.  You're not.  No.  You're going to have to figure out some solution.  I just think it's been a while since we've seen a company do something this clever and  surreptitious.  I don't think anybody had any inkling that Apple was putting...  We all knew it was a receiver but nobody knew that they were actually building iBeacons  into every single device.  There are hundreds of millions of iBeacons out there now.  I got one, you got one, everybody here's got one.

I learned something interesting at the Christmas party on Friday.  About me?  About you and Father Robert Balliser.  So Father Robert, I guess you were doing this, it was like in the middle of the night, even  though the cameras were on, because we're always on here at the beautiful Picasso.  I finally realized that what I'm doing is reality TV.  I thought it was tech coverage.  This is reality TV is what we do here.  You stuffed, okay, did you or did you not stuff a pig down the hole underneath the tricaster  here?  Did you or did you not?  I like to take the fifth.  It was not a live pig.

Start time: 5003.06
End time: 5023.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wasn't a live pig.  It was a little rubber pig.  It was, we were playing around with the tricaster.  Alex was downstairs and Chad and I were upstairs and Alex had a camera pointed up at the little  hole through which all our cables drop.  We were going to show the mascot pig from the TD desk coming down through the little  hole.  Oh yeah, to say hello.  So we had a camera shot of it going into the hole and it never came out.

Start time: 5024.84
End time: 5036.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So a pig got stuck.  So maybe people don't understand that the way we do this, our technical director's desk,  a rotating desk, that's where Chad is right now.  Are you going to rotate it?  It actually rotates.

End time: 5068.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When it rotates, the camera goes with it, which is bizarre.  In order for that to work, you've got to have all the equipment, all the wires from the  equipment go down into the basement where all the gear is through a hole.  And that hole is fairly large.  It's eight inches in diameter.  It should have fallen right through.  Pig should have gone right through it.  But the funniest thing is I found out Russell, our IT guy, Russell Tammany, he had to get  the, he had to rescue the pig, reached up and he said, when the pig came out, so did  a bunch of red hairs.

Just raised I think four million dollars in venture capital.  SumAll is truly amazing and one of our sponsors and we love them.  Talk about big data and data analysis.  The idea of SumAll and it's free, which is pretty good because if you were trying to,  you know, if you were using one of the SAS or something, that's that's some big bucks  on this stuff.  It is free.  You connect up all your services, your Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, your Instagram, your  YouTube, your Foursquare, your Tumblr, Google Blogger, WordPress, Google Analytics, Moz,  I mean, I can go on and on.  You see everything eBay.  If you're selling on eBay, for instance, you can say what is the correlation between sales  and Twitter feeds or a particular Twitter poster?  How does my Instagram feed drive content?  Should I win my mail stuff from Mailchip or Constant Contact?  You can see how valuable this is to get a view.  This is something that big business has been doing for years, but nobody's been able to  for this as a small business.  We use it and it is so valuable to us in managing our social media campaigns, understanding,  you know, how T-shirt sales are impacted by some of the things we do.  Lots of people now are using it and you can too.  SumAll the insane growth is 20% growth over the last month.  Now there are 60,000 companies and customers using SumAll's data analytics service.  They've recently added some new ones like Foursquare and I mentioned Instagram, Tumblr  and Blogger.  Stripe, do you use Stripe for credit cards?  If you use Squarespace, you're using Stripe for their commerce.  Braintree, BigCommerce and more.  You get improved modern analytics.  You get integration with related data streams, personalized daily or weekly emails so that  you don't have to even, you get pushed the information.  There's an export and spreadsheet view.  Many, many features.  SumAll now has a mobile app too that's gorgeous on the iPhone.  Is that your data chat?  Yeah, this is.  You track YouTube hits?

There's all these wonderfully crazy hypotheses about where it came from.  The NSA created it to destabilize third world economies.  No, really?  Yeah, it was created by mobsters or was created by a geek at MIT or was created by a group  of geeks at Stanford.  Well, we've got a story here that talks about how the 49ers have just won the game.  Oh, so that's a good story.  Big story.  Yeah, they have.  They have nine seconds left.  I don't think there's any way they can lose the game.  While they do that, what we're talking about with Bitcoin is that they think they have  identified who actually created it.

And everyone agrees that the math behind it, the theory behind it, economic theory behind  it is rock solid.  And whoever did this is very smart.  But this person, probably wisely, whoever he or she is or whoever he or they are, is  anonymous and never revealed their identity.  Nakamoto did communicate with a few people on forums and so forth.  And a guy named Zabo, Nick Zabo has done some syntactic analysis, which is not this is not  the first time this has happened.  I'm so geeking out over that.  Nick is the guy who they think is Satoshi.  Oh, Nick is Satoshi, the guy who did the syntactic analysis is another guy.  There's the blog post.  She's a she, I believe.

Transcript:  I've seen, you know, we had the director of the Bitcoin Foundation on triangulation some  months ago and there was some speculation he might be Nakamoto.  Nakamoto kind of handed off the reins to him and he's kind of run the thing, although it  doesn't need to be run by anybody.  I mean, at this point, nobody needs to do anything.  This was the guy, I'm trying to remember his name, who was giving away bitcoins for a while.  Yeah, trying to seed it.  Yeah.  I have to say, I mean, there's been syntactic analysis before.  It's not the first time.  There are lots of theories about who Nakamoto is.  I guess it doesn't really matter unless it's the NSA.  And then even then, does it matter?  I feel like it's just a great story.  It's of great interest.  There's certainly been, from the financial point of view, a lot of speculation.  Bitcoins are going back down now.  They peaked at well over a thousand bucks, but now down to seven hundred or eight hundred  dollars on Mt. Gox.  You can see from this graph of one month how spiky it is.  I mean, it goes all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of the things that the story really exposes is there was a little bit of a blip in the  value of Bitcoin because there was a story about, oh, well, why was Bitcoin created?  The creator of Bitcoin actually has now what is it, a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin.  In the current currency, he's a billionaire.  So that would be a good reason to create it and disappear by an island.  But now people are drawing back from that story.  They're saying, wait a minute.  So the people who got into this early are making tons of money off of what we're doing  now.  If you're getting into Bitcoin now, you have no chance of really mining any sort of fortune.  Whereas the people who were in it at the beginning have a vested interest in getting  more and more people to buy into Bitcoin.

Transcript:  I also think, Robert, that raises a lot of questions.  There's a lot of discussion I hear now about what's the future of Bitcoin mining and is  there going to be money to be made off that anymore?  Because right now there essentially isn't because it's so cost prohibitive.  I hear a lot about discussions of new ways and just distributed versions around mining,  where the insiders are trying to once again get an advantage.  So that will be an interesting thing to watch.  But I am personally fascinated by how the Bitcoin believers, if you will, have essentially  it's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy.  The more they talk about it, the more they invest in companies that are related to it.  I think that's certainly driven the pattern we've seen.  I haven't thought too much about it, but I wonder if it parallels other trends in technology  too.  Have other things like app stores or other sort of innovations been driven by the early  adopters who then help make them self-fulfilling prophecies?  Because I think that's playing out.

Transcript:  Is that just a sort of priming mechanism and then more fundamentals take over and businesses  do get built and there are opportunities or not?  I think we're still in the early days.  So it's hard to tell.  Although Bitcoin has been around for a very long time too.  And this is not the first time.  It's the first time that it's gotten to this level, but it's had many booms and busts for  years as well.  I think that's something that you don't often read a lot about.

Transcript:  Some names, by the way, I'm so bad.  I apologize.  I'm just an old man.  The researcher was Sky Gray, who came up with the name Nick Szabo.  And the guy we interviewed is the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, Gavin Andresen.  And that's a worthwhile interview if you're interested in Bitcoin on one of our triangulation  episodes a few months ago.  You know, the boom bust cycle that happened with technology in the 90s and parallel something  that happened with the railroads in the 19th century, the companies that built the Transcontinental  Railroads almost all went bankrupt and their investors lost almost everything.  But we got the infrastructure from it to power a complete revolution in the United States  economy.  Same thing in the 90s and the late 90s and early 2000s.  A lot of people lost money on pets.com and dot com startups like that.  But the infrastructure that was laid, the fiber alone that was laid, all that dark fiber  has made a huge difference in the economy in years to follow.  So there may be a reason for a bust boom cycle.  But I guess what you have to do is look back in time and the difference between a pyramid  scheme and a boom bust cycle is only history can tell the difference.  It's law.  Maybe that's it.  And there's no law applying to Bitcoin as far as I can tell.  It seems to be a very wild west thing.  Let's talk about 23andMe.  The Federal Drug Administration, FDA, has effectively shut down 23andMe.  23andMe was a very interesting startup by Anne Wojcicki.  Am I saying her name right?  I never say it right.  Wojcicki.  Wojcicki, is that right?  She was Larry Page's wife.  Sergey Brin.  Sergey Brin's wife.  Still is, I believe.  Maybe still married but separated or something.  I don't know what's going on.  I can't follow all this stuff.  However, that's neither here nor there.  It was, I think, a really interesting idea to bring genetic analysis to the cost point  where almost anybody could do it.  But the last time I did it was $99.  And you spit into a tube and you get a big analysis back.  A lot of people have said, oh, the reason the FDA shut it down was they didn't want  competition.  I think actually what the FDA did was kind of realistic because I did pay for 23andMe.  And I'm curious, you did it too, right?  I did.  Jessica, have you done 23andMe?  I did.

Transcript:  The fear the FDA had, first of all, the FDA didn't have any fear.  The FDA went to them and said, you need to explain how you do what you do, why you make  the conclusions that you make.  And it needs to be very clear.  And so now 23andMe has a big disclaimer on the front page.  We have suspended our health-related genetic tests to comply with the FDA to discontinue  new consumer access during our regulatory review process.  I don't think this is inappropriate.  I think there should be, there was no regulatory review because what you get from 23andMe could  scare the living daylights out of you.

Start time: 5962.86
End time: 5995.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the same reason why we don't like those instant disease tests.  You want to do that in the presence of a trained medical personnel so they can explain to you  what the test actually means.  They could keep you from doing something drastic if you find really, really bad news.  So I get what they're trying to do with this.  I mean 23andMe, as they were positioning themselves, could have been seen as we will tell you whether  or not you're going to live a long life.  That's not a great thing to do if you can't actually back it up at science.

Start time: 5995.98
End time: 6063.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think that's what's going on right now.  Now here's my 23andMe and I did this before the FDA.  So a lot of what, I'm 2.6% Neanderthal.  Sweet.  That's kind of interesting.  And it explains why I got hair on my knuckles.  My ancestry composition and all of that.  But then there's also health risks.  And this is I think where they get in a little bit of trouble because it can be scary.  For instance, that you have a doubled, my risk is 1.24 times higher for coronary heart  disease.  But then you dig down into it, it's because I'm a Western European genetic and that's  what you get.  And I think some people might get scared.  And I think what they want to avoid is an Angelina Jolie moment where a woman says,  I'm going to have a double mastectomy because of what 23andMe said.  Now the point is well made that nobody's going to give you a double mastectomy just because  23andMe said it.  You still have to go to a doctor to do it.  Nevertheless, I think that it's appropriate for 23andMe to reveal to the FDA and ultimately  to its users how this works.  Right?  Did you find it useful, Jessica?

Transcript:  You know, I found it fun.  I remember doing it.  I remember I had this cool, my parents did it.  So then I saw that I had one chromosome for my mom and one for my dad.  And that was very exciting.  But I haven't, I don't think I've dipped back into it in a few years having done it.  And to me, this whole episode raises this point that, I mean, we know that science and  technology are sort of colliding and that medicine and technology are colliding.  And 23andMe is only one of a million companies trying to do something in this space or something  related to health.  And I just wonder what the relationship between the regulators and the valley is going to  be over these new technologies.  I mean, even if you think about wearable devices today, which are fairly benign and tracking  our steps, they could do so much more.  And as a consumer and companies and entrepreneurs are working on so much more, and as a consumer,  I really want to see these exist.  But I also realize that there are many consumers who need protecting for a good reason.  So I think we at work, the information too, we've been thinking a lot about what the  intersection of this landscape is going to look like and trying to understand a bit how  companies out here are going to get their products through and what's the best way.  And because another interesting thing about this episode, I think, was that 23andMe had  been out for so long.  I mean, so we've used it and it's been on the market.  And so there's certainly a lag in the pushback.  But, you know, will there be a chilling factor now?  So it's going to be a very interesting space to watch.  And I think a lot of people were surprised to see this reaction from the FDA.  And, you know, we'll just have to see.  But I get it.  I mean, these things are important.  And there's a lot of stuff that normal consumers are people are going to have to be worried  about and made aware of.  But, you know, frankly, I think this kind of genetic testing is fairly, you know, benign  compared to what's technologically possible or will be very shortly.  And so what's the fate of that?

Start time: 6190.50
End time: 6201.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Well, until you get more science behind this and actually show me why there's a genetic  correlation here, it's the same thing.  It could be someone saying, oh, well, I do that because 23andMe told me that I need more

Yeah, because it's fun, but it's a toy.  And that's the that's the point.  It's not. And having done it and I think three of us have done it, I think we all agree,  unless you really care about how much Neanderthal you have or whether your earwax is

So this is for the federal register, which is a daily publication of the federal  government that's required to publish changes in executive orders, proclamations,  rule changes and so forth.  All the federal agencies contribute to it.  Some of them email. That's possible.  It is illegal to use a USB key.  They don't allow that. Many of them CD-ROMs.  But according to The New York Times, many of the agencies still send floppy  disks in. The spokesman for the federal register wouldn't say which agencies, because  that's embarrassing. But they were monitoring the at the register's office couriers recently  seen coming in and out as an employee pulled a floppy disk from one baggage and at least two CD-ROMs  from the others.

Transcript:  And finally, good news from Congress, and I hope it remains good news.  The House passed the Innovation Act, a law to slap patent trolls across the face with  a big wet fish.  By 325 to 91, they passed it without amendment, even though there were some attempts to amend  it.  I presume it goes to the Senate.  We know the President will sign it if it does because he supported it.  It's expected to pass onto the White House.  If it becomes law, one of the big changes I think will be that it'll be possible to  recover the costs of a failed lawsuit, which means it is not free to be a patent troll  anymore or almost free to be a patent troll.  It could cost you.  I think that'll slow things down.  And they've also prohibited fee shifting.  I'm sorry, protection for consumers, which means, which goes back to this issue about  there was a company that had a scanner patent or a Panner scatton, either way, the Panner  scatton, and they were going to end users of scanners.  They were actually going to businesses and saying, hey, you use a scanner and email the  result, you owe us money, and that will be also illegal.  Thank goodness.
