It's just such a bummer  Get your vaccines folks, please do everybody a favor just get your vaccine  Also with us. He's at in Monterey for the Concord Delegace and speed week  Mr. Tim Stevens from Roadshow. Hi Tim. Hey Leo. It's great to be back. What are you seeing down there? Oh

Start time: 255.74
End time: 272.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lots of beautiful cars this year's the 50th anniversary of the Cunta show that a lot of those lined up in the lawn and a  Bunch of beautiful Porsche 917 race cars and a lot of amazing stuff in the lawn. There's a new Lamborghini  Cuntas isn't there? Yeah, there absolutely is. Yeah, that was very big story. Probably the biggest story of the show for sure

Start time: 274.34
End time: 282.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it would be if I had two and a half million dollars to blow in a car. Oh  They're all gone. Anyway, they're all sold out already

Start time: 283.28
End time: 295.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Lamborghini is only making 112 of them and they were all sold before the car was announced  So if you are one of those privileged lucky very close Lamborghini owners, then you've already gotten Heather curve and they're already gone. So

Start time: 296.88
End time: 304.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the appeal? I mean it was a it was very it was like the famous  Car of the 80s right like the famous fancy car

Start time: 305.02
End time: 340.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  70s actually, you know  70s when things really began and it ran all the way through until 1990 and it really just defined what a supercar was  For that you're a really small beautiful shape  You know big V12 stuck in there and so that really defined what it was and it became iconic  It was the poster car of the 80s  And so now for the 50th anniversary and for the concours this week by McGee  He rebuilt the that car onto basically the the Sion which is another current Lamborghini  So brought a lot of styling cues from the original Cuntas back to a more modern car  So it's actually a hybrid this time and 800 horse  hybrid

Start time: 341.40
End time: 352.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so classically when you think of the Prius and other hybrids you think of kind of  Not so much. You know kind of kind of slow off the start and stuff  How do you get a hybrid to be 800 horsepower?

Start time: 353.74
End time: 392.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the hybrid systems actually pretty minimal. There's only about 30 or 40 horsepower that's coming from the electrical system  But interestingly, it's from supercapacitors  So it's not using a lithium-ion battery pack like a Tesla or anything else  It's a supercapacitor, which means it charges incredibly quickly and discharges incredibly quickly  So well, it has a limited amount of power you can get all that power out very quickly  So what Lamborghini is usually using it for in this car is actually filling in the gaps in  Acceleration that you get when you're shifting gears  So instead of the engine kind of cutting out where you shift a gear it can now  Do what we call a torque fill which is basically to give you more thrust during those shifts  So you don't lose an acceleration so you go from 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds, but it's it's really a plug-in hybrid, right?

Start time: 393.02
End time: 397.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's gonna mostly run off the battery or no. I know it's a very small battery pack

Start time: 397.34
End time: 415.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's really just meant to augment the performance of the car Lamborghini does have a plug-in hybrid coming down the road  That'll be their next the successor to the Aventador, which is their current big supercar  But this is this is basically just meant to augment performance is really not intended for a plug-in hybrid style  All EV driving just to make it go quicker. I'm confused

Start time: 417.06
End time: 421.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you what you can go 12 miles and then you have to pull over I don't understand

Start time: 421.74
End time: 433.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you still got a big six and a half liter V12 in the back  Oh the V12 is still there. Oh  Yes, yes  It's not a fully V so you need the big V12 to go anywhere and really the electric motor is just adding performance on top of the

Start time: 433.92
End time: 447.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  V12 so there there are two motors. There's a little hybrid motor  There's a big V12 motor and then there's a big V12. Yeah  Oh the battery pack is being charged by the small motor and and  Merely to take over when you're shifting

Start time: 448.32
End time: 457.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, and it's against the supercapacitor. So it's it's very different performance  Quick charge up. Yeah, a fact I think it's the only production car using a super capacitor in the world

Start time: 458.10
End time: 481.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we we were very excited a few years ago. Steve Gibson was all over this idea of super capacitors  He said was gonna change the world. The only thing I ever saw with a super capacitor was a rechargeable screwdriver that I had  charged very fast  Discharged all pretty fast as well  So it's interesting to see another use for super capacitors. They're a long way from being used in general for cars sadly for any manner range

Start time: 481.16
End time: 484.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're super expensive, which is why this car is, you know, two and a half three million dollars

Start time: 484.68
End time: 487.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, you got a couple mil  You can put a down payment

Start time: 490.54
End time: 502.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that one of the things about the Tesla Roadster is that you know, it kind of dispelled this pokey hybrid image of electric cars  Basically, yeah, absolutely going to torque, you know

Start time: 502.50
End time: 530.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's always been Tesla's MO which is you know, we make really nice cars that are fast and really nice to drive  Oh and by the way, they're also electric cars and that's really becoming the  Model of a lot of manufacturers these days are trying to build more fast more interesting more engaging EVs  Which is really exciting to see  You know even for a traditional brand like Lamborghini to be getting on board with hybridization now and someday down the road  They'll go on to the full EV program. It's definitely great. It's great to see I love EVs and you know, there's

Start time: 531.48
End time: 548.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty clear item model X and we have a bolt and now I have a Mustang Mach-E. They all have so much torque  There's nothing sluggish about an EV. That's a that's something maybe people thought because of the hybrids  They're really fun to drive. I would never want to drive a gas vehicle again. I love my EVs

Start time: 549.32
End time: 569.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so so my son Kevin has actually has a Toyota Mirai, which is a hydrogen fuel cell car and  He's the only person I know who has one  Where does he get that filled up at a carry around the corner?  Is the biggest station and they're building up capacity. Yeah, he can't drive  Like you couldn't drive to say

Start time: 570.82
End time: 611.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seattle like that would be out of the question because there's no hydrogen filling stations. That's the problem. That's right. That's right  It's a we loves the car. It's maybe you can explain this Tim  Toyota which really had an early leg up on hybrids with the Prius has been very slow to go to  EV in fact, I remember they were big donors to  Congress  Really effectively kind of supporting big oil, which is not what you'd think of of Toyota their alternative is  Hydrogen, but there's a lot of evidence hydrogen fuel besides being inconvenient  Isn't very good for the environment. You have to make the hydrogen

Start time: 612.16
End time: 670.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a big bet by by Toyota that hydrogen would be the way forward  As you said they had a really huge early lead with the Prius and they were the first really to market with a mass market  Hybrid which which you know kind of took over the industry in a lot of ways  But they really thought the fuel cells would be the next step because batteries, you know  Ten years ago were incredibly expensive incredibly huge and they thought well fuel cells are a more manageable technology  We can make that work better  But ultimately, you know  As I'm sure you're trying to see Mike that the the availability of those filling stations really hasn't improved that much over the past  Ten years if you're outside of California, you're pretty much out of luck  And so that hasn't accelerated which is unfortunate because that technology is really good for sure  Leo creating hydrogen right now is not very great for the environment  But ultimately that doesn't mean that it has to be going forward if there were a major investment in expanding hydrogen availability  Then there would also be an investment in hydrogen production and at that point the carbon  Equivalency of hydrogen versus gasoline would would definitely swing in the favor of hydrogen. Yeah, but because I'm not anything right now  It's not that way

Start time: 671.20
End time: 708.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is I understand it right now is that they're essentially extracting it from natural gas  And so the critics of it say well they take the whole industry of natural gas and say that's hydrogen production  But it doesn't have to be from from natural gas. It doesn't have to be unclean. The great thing  Of course is the only emission is water  So there's no you know  And you don't have the as big of batteries from a Tesla or something like that to deal with after the fact  you know, like you say Tim, I think if  multiple manufacturers were building these at scale we had  Stations everywhere and they were producing the hydrogen in an environmentally clean way. It would be really fantastic

Start time: 709.00
End time: 780.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unfortunately, it's not clear if that's ever gonna happen because you could in theory make hydrogen out of water  Right, but right now they're cracking methane  There was actually a study just came out ours technique  I had the story a couple of days ago that you know, there's three grades of hydrogen. There's gray hydrogen, which is terrible  There's blue hydrogen, which most of the hydrogen  I'm sure the Mariah is filling up on blue hydrogen and someday there may be  But there is not now in mass production green hydrogen, but this latest study said even blue hydrogen  It's here's the headline from ours. Technica is actually worse for the climate than coal  Now the way the study figured that out is they all estimated how much methane leakage  There is a problem with methane is very small molecule tends to leak from methane pipelines  It's a much worse greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide  And so any leakage is bad. They estimated about a 3.5 percent leakage rate  Which means anytime you're using methane and you've got in a pipeline you're you're really you know doing a bad thing  So hydrogen at this point, so it's interesting. So basically Tim Toyota made a bad bet and  That's put them kind of far behind. Are they gonna do battery electric vehicles?

Start time: 781.04
End time: 811.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they absolutely are and there are some concepts coming which actually look quite good whether or not that they made a bad bet  You know it reminds me seeing this is such an incredibly early time for the EVs, you know  Everybody thinks what Tesla's got this amazing head start  But it's the same thing if you look back at BlackBerry or any company like that  We're still at that that stage of the EV market in the US  It's still less than 5% of the US market  So it took Toyota will have quality EVs on the market within the next two or three years  At that point the EV market is gonna get really interesting  So if those EVs are good enough, it really won't matter. They'll catch up past five years. Yeah

Start time: 812.22

Transcript:  Does so Kevin Lexus MRI?

Start time: 815.02
End time: 835.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He loves it and he's it's kind of like a beta program  He's been interacting with Toyota the Toyota engineers on a whole bunch of things, but it's actually a very luxurious car  It's very fast. It's very comfortable and he has no problem getting hydrogen because of where he lives  So for him, it's just a perfect car. He got all kinds of subsidies too. So it was really sure affordable

Start time: 835.82
End time: 850.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think according to Wikipedia in 2019. There are a hundred and fourteen hydrogen stations in the US  It's not exactly everywhere, but if you live, you know, if you live around the corner from one  So he can't charge it at home. He has to just like going to a gas station  He has to go to the hydrogen station

Start time: 850.52
End time: 865.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much literally goes to he literally goes to an actual gas station that where they have I don't offer hydrogen  But the thing is that as an incentive that gave him six years of free hydrogen  Nice, he's got a Toyota credit card and he doesn't pay for it. How much how much the mileage?

Start time: 865.90
End time: 867.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, how often does he have to go to the gas station?

Start time: 868.80
End time: 884.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They they calculated in miles per gallon one of the things with hydrogen cars is if you drive in a certain way you can get  Incredible mileage so he can get you know, 70 80 miles per gallon equivalent to gasoline  So he doesn't have to fill it that often  So nice

Start time: 884.42
End time: 898.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's about a three or four hundred mile range if I remember correctly and roughly one kilogram of hydrogen is roughly equivalent in  terms of the energy density of one gallon gasoline conveniently  So it's actually pretty easy to do kind of the math and compare how efficient they are versus a gasoline

Start time: 898.68
End time: 922.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Power car in terms of overall efficiency, of course every time you say hydrogen. I think of the Hindenburg  But I think they've found a way to keep it fairly anything that's gonna store enough energy to propel a  Multitone vehicle down the road for hundreds of miles is gonna have enough energy that if it's released suddenly will be explosive  That's lithium ion batteries gasoline or hydrogen. It's a question

Start time: 924.86
End time: 932.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, unlike gasoline. This is highly compressed. So  You talk about explosive power, but the the tanks that Toyota uses are like you can shoot them with a gun

Start time: 933.12
End time: 944.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're literally tanks. Yeah, exactly  Yeah, yeah  Interesting does water drip out of his exhaust pipe it it

Start time: 945.94
End time: 949.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's an exhaust pipe. But yeah, there's a little bit of water. It's a little dribble. Yeah

Start time: 950.28
End time: 962.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's probably emissions and also a water vapor is itself a  Greenhouse gas what they're not so that is something to be tracked  But certainly the emissions of those cars are very very minimal compared to the ocean is letting a little water

Start time: 964.82
End time: 991.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe not worry about the cars so much. Hey, I am NOT going to you can rest easy talk about  Apple's mistake has been Thompson calls it their plan to scan phones  We've been talking about it since last twit but Mike Elgin has an interesting take and we're gonna well  I guess we could do that right now before we take our first break the reason the real reason Mike says  Why everyone hates Apple's child porn idea? Yeah, so I did a little

Start time: 992.14
End time: 1019.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  deconstruction on the opposition  So just to review if you haven't been following the incredibly good coverage on twit this whole week on this topic  Practically all we've talked about  Yeah, but but basically  Apple is  using hashed a  comparison of the pictures that you're going to  Upload to iCloud, but they're doing it on the phone and it's the on the phone part that is I think causing the problem

Start time: 1019.96
End time: 1107.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's really three. I guess I'll go through it real quickly, but there's three things Apple's doing  There is comparing against the Nick Mcnashall Center for Missing and Exploited Children's  Fingerprint database of known child porn images comparing those against images that you're uploading and downloading from iCloud  Basically doing what Google Facebook many other companies do  Comparing it against what you've stored on their cloud. That's one thing and Ben Thompson says and I agree that that's fine  Everybody's doing that. You probably should do it because Apple is notorious for never reporting  image child porn images the second thing they're gonna do is a  Little bit more controversial Siri and search are gonna warn  Children if they're looking at adult pictures, that's not the same fingerprint technology. That's a perceptual  image  Perception that says that looks like pornography and it says you shouldn't be seeing that and then if the kid says but I want to  See it then it says if you look at that we're gonna tell your parents and the kids looks at it  We're telling your parents. That's that's the second thing and then there's Siri and search are gonna also warn people  Oh, I actually the second thing was sending and receiving iMessages same thing  It's not that I don't believe they're using the CSAM hash from NECMEC for that  They're doing some sort of image recognition  But the thing that bothers people you're right Mike and the thing Ben Thompson says is a mistake  Is anything that's happening on your phone the phone?  Many believe should be sacrosanct now go ahead

Start time: 1107.84
End time: 1227.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think that I think the consensus among the smartest  Commentators on this including on Twitter and Ben Thompson is just do it to cloud and everybody's happy  But the way that I think the problem is first of all Apple  Perceives something that's true that users don't proceed  Perceive which is that the operating system of your iPhone does not belong to you. It actually belongs to Apple  This is very explicitly spelled out in plain language in the licensing agreement it says, you know, this belongs to Apple  This is ours. We license it you license it from us. You can use it under certain circumstances  Etc. So to Apple iCloud and your operating system your phone operating system is  Is all the same. There's no difference. Yeah, right  They want to have this consistency thing that they do on everything was one of the reasons that's great about Apple  Everything's consistent and and so on and they want to do everything in the cloud in on the device  If it's on the device, that means it's secure  But is the on the device part that is freaking everybody out?  And the reason is that no matter what this thing is that they're putting on there. It's hashed. You can't read it  It's not actual child. There's no images, etc. Etc. Yeah  Psychologically and it's irrational but psychologically people don't want anything to do with child porn on their phone  They just don't like the idea of it. It's it's counter to  You you look at like I just got a new iPad  It's perfect. It's pure. It's it, you know, it's wonderful. It's magical the knowledge that there's a child porn database  Or something like that on my device really bought, you know, really bothers people  Right, and I think this is the problem. But again, you're not going to change human nature. Apple just needs to back down  Run these comparisons in the cloud and the whole thing goes away. That's all they have to do  Oh and you agree. I mean, I is that

Start time: 1229.60
End time: 1234.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First of all, what's your take on this? I haven't asked you. I don't know. Well, I think you know, I think it's interesting because

Start time: 1235.60
End time: 1296.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Devices are basically useless without the cloud. I mean, I don't know anyone who  Yeah, it's just an iPod if you're not connected to the cloud it's not yeah, and you know, like the the convenience factor is  You know just tends to make you want to use the cloud  So I agree with Mike that like just doing the scanning and in the cloud is probably the solution for 99% of what Apple wants to catch  Anyway, and you know if someone is that you know  Paranoid that they're going to use the cloud  That's probably a tell that they're you know that they're doing things that are suspicious if that makes sense  But yeah, I think Apple just mishandled the communication on this and and also in classic Apple fashion  Doubled down and you know and said like, you know, we hear you but we're right and you know, you all need to be able to  And you know and said like, you know, we hear you but we're right and you know, you all need to calm down

Start time: 1298.16
End time: 1327.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If Apple had just said that part of problem also is the way they announced it they conflated three different different technologies in one  Yes message and that confused the hell out of everybody including some big-name journalists if Apple had just said announcement number one  We haven't been but many others suggest and certainly others do scanning images on iCloud  So we're going to start doing that using this technology which Google uses and Facebook uses  I don't think there would have been a fewer at all. Right Tim. Do you agree?

Start time: 1328.58
End time: 1378.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I definitely agree. I think ultimately it's a  Such a hot-button topic that would be really difficult to to kind of rule something sweeping out like this without raising some eyebrows  But for sure I think they did try to do too much in one shot and ultimately because the messaging was not great  And because again, it's such a sensitive topic and because again they they double down more or less there rather than listening and reacting  that has created this hotbed of  Problem for them. So I wish they would you know hit the pause button on this and kind of walk it back and then just kind of  Take some time to read rest. I think that's really all they need to do  It really wouldn't be that difficult to let this fear die down listen to a few more people get some more experts on board  and maybe partner with  An organization to do the ice been going forward when they do roll things back out again  I think that's the way forward for them. I kind of disagree with you Mike though

Start time: 1378.56
End time: 1426.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that the I think I don't think it's the ick factor of the oh that databases on my phone  Mm-hmm. I think it is the notion and you're right Apple owns this but there is this maybe it's just the sudden  understanding that Apple does own the phone because the perception up to now is this is my private device and I know most people  Are concerned that border patrol can look through it  We we talk a lot about celebrate and their ability to take the data off of your phone and that's offensive to everybody because the phone  Is such a personal thing. It's like my diary and so any technology that intrudes upon the phone is perceived as  What you're gonna unlock my diary and look for child porn. That's offensive and I think that for the understand that

Start time: 1427.10
End time: 1527.62

Transcript:  Yeah, I think that for the tech  Savvy people that watch and listen to this show  There's a concern about the back door about the idea that you know, okay  Wait a minute. You can rummage around and find things on my device  You could also theoretically rummage around and find other types of content and you had a great discussion on  Both twig and elsewhere on this but I but I I think that for the lay  majority  But it's two things that really bothers people the idea that there's a child porn thing on their phone  Yeah, and the second thing is that they're kind of it's kind of like  you feel like you've kind of been accused like for example, if you went to the  The store to to buy something they said can you give us your fingerprints? You know fingerprints are associated with  Accusation with criminal charges and all that kind of stuff the idea that they're always watching you to see if you're a child pornography  Pornographer is just offensive to to to common sense. I don't want to be a  Accused I don't want to be suspected of that sort of thing  I don't want anything to do with it really and I think that's the feeling maybe yeah that I think lay people have  There are there are sophisticated reasons and just  visceral  Reasons to oppose this but once again Apple could just do it in a cloud and it all goes away  And I think it's interesting that Apple misread this  So badly they thought okay if we do it on the device  Everybody would be more happy about that privacy wise  And the opposite is true clear. Yes, so I think that was I think that's interesting that they  Sort of mid misread their user base so badly

Transcript:  Hey, I also think that it reinforces  The sense that Appy Apple is kind of puritanical like Apple bands  You know they from the app store, you know, they banned things like browsers that can  Browser can go to a porn site any Safari browser can go to porn site  But they ban, you know things like reddit because or telegram because well it can be used to see naked people  it feels very  Old school and puritanical and I also think that that because remember the thing that you're doing with the kids stuff is not about  Child porn it's about any explicit image, right? We're looking for explicit images

Transcript:  Maybe they're maybe they're in touch with the whole world instead of just real because they've got to deal with yeah  well, they've got to deal with countries that are in fact quite puritanical and and I think you know,  I applaud the other two things they're doing and I applaud the  Intention behind this one. I just think they this whole thing doing on the device is a huge error  But the other things I mean, it's a real problem for young people growing up in the world today  with the amount of  Horrific objection material I agree, but I don't think it's Apple's job to protect the young people of the world  Is it well but but but I don't think so either but but every time they have to they're called to appear before any sort of  Parliamentary body. Yeah, whether it's the US Senate or store, you know the UK or whatever  They're gonna be called on the carpet about this stuff. What are you doing about this?  What are you doing about that and they're gonna want to have something in place  Where they can answer and saying we're doing something about it  We're you know, because at the end of the day they're gonna be pressured to do all kinds of this sort of thing only  Companies like Apple Google Facebook and others really can do something about it unless you have the even worse  Outcome of having the government directly just saying we're gonna we need access to so we can do something about it  So it's it's a problem and and and I think Apple's  Trying their best actually in this case. Oftentimes they don't in other cases, but I think in this case  They're trying to do the right thing and they just they just missed the boat on this  And and but but ultimately as you see in the news this week everybody tick-tock  These on the news three weeks ago  Facebook and Instagram  everybody's starting to do something about the problem of  children and objectionable material  And it's I think just that's kind of like one of those one of the stories of 2021  2021 which is that all these companies are finally doing something about the stuff.

I mean look Apple puts parental controls on they were late to the party  on that but they do and that's a I have no objection about parental controls and really you can argue that this  Text messaging thing is really just another parental control because parents have to turn it on and so parents will say look  I don't want any objectionable materials sent to or sent by my kid and I want to be notified if that's happening  I think that's completely a reasonable thing  To offer offer as a parental control and let parents turn it on or not  But a lot of what Apple does is is not just for kids. It's for all of I mean all of us  It's not just like well if you're under 13, you can't use telegram  They've blocked it's not they're notorious for blocking apps because they could be misused

I very excited  because uh  Two months we're gonna go down and see you guys in mexico for the Oaxaca  Gastronomad adventure. I can't wait for the day of the dead  Our show today brought to you by  It's perfect timing express vpn  you may  you know  Everybody's spying on you these days your isp  Google everybody wants to know what you're up to and and of course every browser has this thing called private browsing mode or at google calls  It the incognito mode  And and even I don't know have you read the fine print because incognito mode does not hide your activity  at all  Uh you no matter what mode you use no matter how many times you clear your browser history  Your isp can see every website you've visited even if you're in cognito mode every website you go to every time you do a google search  Completely visible you're you're you  That's why at home or abroad. I don't go online without using express vps the best vpn out there  absolutely privacy focused  Express vpn is committed to protecting your privacy by not logging your visit  So there's no way anybody even with a warrant could find out what you've been doing  They actually use an amazing technology they call trusted server when you sign on to express vpn push that big button on your app on  mac windows ios android even smart tvs or routers  It immediately  Spins up in ram on that on that server the trusted server it runs in ram in a sandbox  It cannot write to disk so no record of your visit can ever be saved and when you close out  It's gone out of ram  No trace of your visit. That's what I call protecting your privacy  it's  It's really important to understand that no matter  Who your internet service provider is isps in the u.s can legally sell your information to ad companies same thing with your wireless carrier  express vpn  kind of hides your  Traffic from them it hides it from bad guys  But it also hides it from your isp it reroutes your internet connection through those secure servers  So no one can see the sites you visit when you go to google for a search  They're not getting your ip address  They're getting an express vpn ip address used by hundreds of other express vpn users. It's meaningless to them  Most of the time you won't even know express vpn is on that's important too. They invest in their infrastructure  So they're fast fast enough to watch hd video  Lots of people put express vpn on their routers  Yeah  You can install it on certain routers then the whole house is protected and nobody's going to say boo because they won't even know  But because the connections are so fast  All you have to you know, I mean it just couldn't be better. You can you can watch video  You can do everything you want a lot of times i'll turn it on and forget it's on  I had it on my ipad for weeks. I forgot  Because it's so fast  I love express vpn. It's the number one vpn according to cnet. It's it's my choice. It's the only vpn I use  Check it out at express vpn.com slash twit three extra months free when you sign up for a year  exp ress vpn.com  slash  twit, please use that address so they know you saw it here express vpn protect your online privacy and more  with express vpn  dot com slash  twit  a new bill  Proposed by three democrats in the senate. This is the beginning  I think we're going to see a lot of this stuff and i'm not sure if this is posturing  Or if it's if it's really serious intent dick blumenthal amy clobachar  And marsha blackburn proposed  the brand new  I'm going to call it the oa ma  Oa ma the open app markets app  That will force google and apple  to allow third-party app stores  On their platform now. I have to say I don't i'm not sure how this changes what google does  They already have a setting that says you can go to a third-party app store  You have to turn it on maybe they'll force it to be on by default  But it is a big change for apple and man I can see apple just  hating this idea remember  Introducing it in the senate if you remember your schoolhouse rock  It's just a bill on capitol hill. It's not it's not a law until it's passed by the senate  Passed by the house reconciled and then given to the president for signing  So we're still a long way off from it being a law and I don't know what the prospects are  But wow, this is uh, this is the beginning I think of some very aggressive  Control over apple and google and particularly over apple.

Transcript:  yeah, um  And you know, I but I do think that you know apple is going to have to give something up  It may be control over the payment mechanisms in the app store like give you know making it  Easier to put a third party  Payment processor on there the big thing, you know, the big bargaining chip might be giving up on the 30%  Cut now that the 30% cut that the app store takes was modeled after itunes  And that was back when you would buy a song for a dollar and you know, just the way visa mastercard worked for small payments  30 cents barely covered the credit card processing fee on that 99 cent purchase  It's a dated  You know, it's a dated percent amount. It's you know, it's probably too high of a rake on modern high value apps  So I think that that that definitely might be on the table

Transcript:  google takes the same both companies offer cuts for  Subscriptions after a year and so forth, but I have to point out that's the cut xbox and sony  Take from their app stores, I think steam takes the same cut it's  It's more of an industry standard maybe because apple's established it as an industry standard

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, which is which is by the way a good indicator of an oligopoly, right?  If you know, you know no incentive to compete and offer a better right, you know  No, no one's coming along and saying like hey, we've got an app store with a lower take so developers  You know come you know come jump on this app store. Well, that's actually a good point

Start time: 2294.70
End time: 2371.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no market mechanism here that's forcing apple or google to offer a lower rate  And part of it is that like they do offer great market access like, you know  Getting your app in the app store means like instant distribution to more than 100 countries and you know  And more than a billion devices and that's a you know, that's an enticing proposition for a lot of developers  But it doesn't work for everyone you see this in the you know in the fortnight trial going on right now  and you know  It's it is really confusing because in the game console world you do have this 30 take and that's basically  You know justified because of the economics of console video gaming  But you know the you know, microsoft for example has been going through  Just gymnastics trying to explain well like we think it's okay in the xbox store, but not in other  other app stores microsoft of course is on the other end of things because now they've got their apps which are  Mostly distributed through apple and google because of course we know microsoft  Was a big flop in mobile and now they are in the interesting position of being an app developer dependent on these app stores  So they're kind of  You know on the other side of the argument, you know

Start time: 2372.24
End time: 2407.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, I should say that this bill doesn't mention apple and google specifically  It just says any person that owns or controls an app store for which there are more than 50 million united states users  Actually, that's interesting because that might also mean it affects epic and steams stores and others  it does say not only do you have to eliminate the monopoly, but you also  Have to allow third-party in-app payment systems  that you know, uh  That's exactly what epic wants from apple, right?  We want a store on ios and we want to be able to have payments for things like fortnight  Go through our store not go through apple. So there's no cut

Transcript:  No, I don't think it's a long shot at all  I think it's it's it's very possible that something like this will actually become law times are changing  I think  yeah, the the the the this is one of the few areas where  Republicans and democrats generally agree. Let's all just screw silicon valley for different reasons for different reasons  But anything that this suppresses their power, I think, you know on both sides of the aisle. Everybody's happy about it  I will say one thing I I you know  Google is clearly not a monopoly power. They don't have a monopoly power in  You know, they have a you know another version they just give away and you know, lots of we all know about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the question I don't think the  industry has really  Answered or the courts have not really answered is that in the world of ios?  Is the ios world the market and if it is obviously?  apple has a perfect monopoly and should be  Should be regulated as such or broken up or something should be done about it. If if that's the market that's a monopoly  or  Are they not a monopoly because the market is actually the smartphone world instead of just the ios world  So it's a it's an unresolved question. I tend to think that apple  Is a monopoly and that they that the market is the ios market because there's no  You know, there's there's no overlap between  The world of apple and the rest of the market other than third-party developers who choose to develop on both  But I really think that  You know this this is really  pointing a gun at apple  And and the question is is that if apple's a monopoly?  Then this makes a lot of sense if they're not  Then you know, this is probably  overreach by the government  Personally, I don't care. I mean I think that if they did allow third-party app stores most people would still use apples  Because of the protections because they you know  They they have this rigorous process for what they allow in the app store  There'd be a lot of more dangerous stuff on third-party app stores probably and they would have to compete  In that realm and sort of convince users. Please use our app store and here's why  You know that that might be a good thing, but I think the fundamental thing is the the courts or  Well the courts the courts have to figure out whether apple  Is a monopoly power or not and if it isn't  then you know  This is overreach

Start time: 2678.52
End time: 2708.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that that'll be their defense  I mean if they are indeed forced to put third-party app stores on they're going to be behind so many  Warning dialogues and messages and things that you're going to have to tap through that  It's going to feel like walking down a dark alley, you know  With a trench coat on before you're allowed to download any app for many of these services  So I think even if apple is forced to do something like that  They'll make it so onerous that nobody will actually want to  But if indeed as I said earlier if this hybrid solution comes out of this where they are just forced to  Enable third-party payments on their existing platform. That would be a huge win for consumers right there and that'd be great to see

Well, we're you know, this is going to be over the next 10 years or whatever  The next few years is going to play out very interestingly as  Congress does more and more  to limit tech  You know and mike you could say it's just for power but I think there you could make a case of society's it's in society's interest as well  Yes

You nailed it  That's you know, and they're often you know, they're calling the office. Yeah, right, you know  That's where apple I think is on the back foot is that  You know, there's a lot of people who are affected by their policies  And you know everything, you know  everything they talk about in terms of like the success of the app store and all the you know, all the economic activity it's generated  that is now kind of backfiring on them because  Yeah, that that economic activity exists so you have a lot of people's livelihoods at stake and I think apple  um  I think apple definitely needs to take bills like this seriously, but they also need to take the underlying  unrest among their

That's something they've historically not done a very good job of  I think they've been ignoring developers sometime and there's a lot of people  Like the author of overcast  His name escapes me at the moment, but it was you know, very  We're big apple fans and loved the app store. In fact did very well in the app store  and then uh now i've turned against apple saying uh, yeah marco armit saying  They're not listening to us anymore  You know, you actually there is a fourth branch of government now.

Transcript:  well, my best example for china being a leading indicator is the social credit system, which  You know, we we've been talking about for a long time and it's so horrible and it's authoritarian and totalitarian and all that kind of stuff  But then uh at some point I wrote for fast company, uh, I think last year  uh, I  A compelling case. I think that the united states has a social credit system, too  And it's just absolutely. Yeah, we don't do it  We do it one piece at a time one company at a time one app at a time  But if you add up all the ways  that corporations can essentially cancel you  Prevent you from going to bars prevent you from traveling prevent you from  Getting uh affordable health insurance prevent you from all these things  It adds up to a china style social credit system. Yeah, and so they you know, they're they're not they're they're a  techno authoritarian  government but but  they're also  doing things that  That we'll do some version of that at some point or we'll be confronted with the choice to do or not do those things  At some point because they're they're basically responding to events. They're responding to political opposition. They're responding to antisocial behavior  Same kind of stuff that exists everywhere in the world  so I think I I tend to think we should we should really look at what china chooses to do and think about  What we're doing as well and and think about how we can sort of not be like china

He crossed 100 000 followers this week went from  50 to 100 000 in five days  And that actually shows you I didn't tell him this but oh, I guess I guess president shi must like your cooking videos  because  Because that just shows you that at some point tiktok said we're getting behind this algorithmically probably but  Uh, and that's this i've watched him because he's done a lot of he's studying. How do you go viral on this platform?  and uh, and there's a lot of  Kind of wisdom going around amongst influencers. Well, here's what you need to do  And some of it's accurate probably some of it's apocryphal  But it's really interesting as he tries to push different things to see which levers make you help you go viral  His last video got more than two million views and I think that  Those two are kind of hand in hand.

Yep  um  and you know, do you remember how like facebook and twitter and linkedin were all fighting with each other over  cross-posting and all of that all that that whole idea of like you take something and you  Easily cross-posted from you know from twitter to linkedin or twitter to facebook that all kind of fell apart  They they shut off the api's they cut off the access  tiktok, you know tiktok said like we don't need to be proprietary about this like  Get the stuff out out in the world and everyone's going to be talking about tiktoks and it worked.

Yeah summertime in upper new york state is  Warm as wintertime  Our show today brought to you by podium  The um, I don't know if you've heard about podium but it is a very exciting this is now this is modern, you know  There was a time  In uh in uh in the world where you know, if you were a business and you didn't have an email address  Well, you weren't nothing or you didn't have a web page. You weren't nothing  Nowadays believe it or not if you're a business and you're not texting your customers you're missing out  on the hugest revolution in business text  Messaging I think part of this is because of uh the pandemic we kind of got used to the idea of you know  curbside pickup from your favorite restaurant and you know watching movies at home and  Visiting your doctor over skype  Your customers have grown to expect a more straightforward more direct way of doing business. No matter what your business is  That's why 90 000 local businesses of all sizes have turned to podium  You don't have to be a big business, but of course if you are it's fine  Podium can help you stay ahead whether you have one location or a thousand  They make doing business as easy as sending a text when texts get open business gets done and podium can do a lot with the text  for instance  My dentist uses podium after the checkup. I'm leaving I get a text it says hey, how was the visit?  Uh, if you liked it, would you like to leave a review on yelp and it was very easy and I did  Uh, you can do that. You can ask for reviews. You can answer questions  I think I like the idea of making an appointment. I started doing this with my hairdresser over text messaging  It's just so much easier  It's easier for employees too because with podium you have a single inbox  No matter how your customers are reaching out  Which makes it much easier for your employees to monitor and stay in touch and get responses back quick to your customers  Uh, you can use it to actually get payments  In fact, there's a a podium customers a dentist in new york city. He had a million dollars overdue collections  You know, they were slowly getting to everybody calling them. He signed up for podiums said everyone a text payment  collected  700,000 70 percent in two weeks  It's not that people weren't didn't want to pay they just needed the reminder and the text message was perfect  Great way to schedule appointments scheduled delivery  To sell things home service providers  You know the last time a window broke in the house. I sent text messages out to a number of different  Glaziers the one who got back fastest was the one who got the job  podium baby  It is the easiest way to stay in touch to sell things to to get reviews to get payments  Today's customers want on-demand everything even from local businesses stay ahead of the competition with podium  And I should mention that the open rate for text messages is so much higher than for any other medium well over 90  Percent nobody ignores your text messages. That's why you need to use podium p o d i u m  They've got free plans  If you're a small business you can get on board for free  But know that they'll be able to scale with you as your business grows and it will  podium get started free today p o d i u m  dot com slash  Twit this is an amazing text messaging platform that can transform business podium  dot com slash twit, please use that address so that they uh,  They knew they know that you saw it on twit podium dot com slash twit  Big birthday this week  I love the register the register is so good at headlines  beige against the machine the ibn pc  turns 40  51 50 not just a medical emergency  Also the beginning of the office brick it was on august 12th  uh 1981  Big blue released the first  ibn pc we didn't call it the 51 50 we call it the pc  um, and it transformed an industry because up until then there were lots of personal computers komodore and atari and apple  Uh, msi mitts all had made personal computers, but they were very hobbyist focused  When ibn arrived it gave it  A serious business cache and remember the full page ad that steve jobs took out in the wall street journal saying  From apple welcome ibn seriously  They might have underestimated  The impact ibn would have you do you remember mike?

I don't think they designed it to be reverse engineerable  But it didn't take very long for compact and others  phoenix and others to say oh we can make a  pc compatible bios  Which meant that within a year compact was selling a compatible it would run the same software run the same opera  Oh, that was the other smart thing  And the dumb thing that ibm did they were looking for an operating system for the pc  Uh, they they came out to to monterey, california because dr. DOS was a very popular  Operating system in the cpm days and  Gary kildall was a creator dr. DOS digital research  Founder and president was famously flying his private plane and declined to meet with ibm  So they flew up to redmond washington where there was another young upstart company microsoft known for its basic  Not for an operating system  They met with bill gates and said we need a operating system for the pc you got one bill said, um, yeah  He didn't  But he knew of a company called seattle dos  Which had a dos that would be compatible with ibm's 8088 chip the chip that they were putting in there  It's an intel chip and uh  He without telling the owners of seattle dos  Went across the street said i'm you know, i'd like to buy seattle dos  Didn't mention that there was another uh company interested  Bought it for a song and then turned around and sold it to ibm as pc dos  The other thing that gates did it was probably the single biggest business move in history  He made a deal with ibm and I don't know why ibm agreed to this not to give it to them outright not to sell it to them outright  But to retain the rights to it  Um, and and he looked like he was 12 at the time, um, yeah, we got it we got an offering system  I mean but but to me actually that's funny because seattle dos came from seattle computer products, which was staffed by high school students  So this remember in the early days, this is in the early late late 70s early 80s. This was a hobbyist thing

Transcript:  Nobody was serious exactly. Yeah, I mean he set the tone. I think as a historian of silicon valley  He set the tone for the industry. So you had these well-meaning, uh, uh companies actually producing  Good products that were you know, they were sort of relaxed about things and then you have this bare-knuckle aggressive  liar  Come along and just just just have this just a hyper aggressive  Attack on ibm saying that he had things he didn't have and then a massive work ethic to go with it willing to just  Do whatever it took. I mean when he did the altair basic, um, you know, he lived in a trailer in a strip mall  Yeah, and worked, you know, he dropped out of harvard and worked night and day to make that deal happen  It's not like he's lazy. Oh god. It's just a combination  It's just a combination of massive work ethic lots of brains no ethics and being a predatory business man  Basically exactly and that set the tone for the silken valley. We know and love today. He bought a pc dos

Transcript:  Uh from seattle computer products for 25 000 like the same month that ibm came to him and he didn't have anything  um  Just prior to the launch of the pc on the august 12th on july 27th  He's he went to seattle dos and said i'll give you another 50 000 for full rights  Um, and they didn't know anything about the pc. They said okay  So for 75 000 he bought an operating system  Which basically made microsoft and then he made a deal with with ibm saying well, we'll keep the rights  We'll just license this to you  And I don't know why ibm  Agreed to it  But what it made possible is the compatibles because then he was able to sell ms dos to compact  and all these other uh  Makers of pc compatibles and it made it completely 100 percent ibm pc compatible  Which is good for us

What was the code name for the original ibm pc? I'm trying to remember  Had a good code name  Uh  Project let's see project chess according  But I don't know if that was the code name for the original pc  Anyway, they designed it.

Yeah, here's an image of it from inc.com  Welcome ibm seriously  Welcome to the most exciting and most important marketplace since the computer revolution began 35 years ago  And congratulations on your first personal computer  When we invented the first personal computer system  Maybe a little uh hyperbole on that  We estimated that over 140 million people worldwide could justify the purchase of one if they only understood its benefits  Next year alone. We project that well over a million will come to that understanding  A million people wow little did he know?  What ibm was going to do and just kind of dominate the the space and to this day still pcs dominate  Not ibm is of course completely out of that. Yeah, no, they don't do it anymore  Although they do have a two nanometer chip. So good to good. They're not they're not sitting on the rest on their laurels  base price for a  fully loaded system more than three thousand dollars  You could have monochrome or cga.

Happy birthday 40 years ago august 12th  The ibm pc was born  Here's a shocker  I don't know if you watched this in april we did we actually streamed benson wong's keynote for nvidia sammable samit  And I did benson did it from his kitchen as he's been doing during the pandemic  Talking about all the different areas. I think nvidia is really one of the most interesting companies  Probably the most interesting chip company out there right now making chips not only for graphics processors and gaming machines  But also bitcoin miners, but also  graphics processors for cars  artificial intelligence  They're just firing on all cylinders  Nvidia revealed in a blog post  This week that that april keynote it was uh, it was cgi  They modeled his kitchen  But they didn't just model his kitchen  They modeled him  And for at least a portion  of the keynote  Benson wong was not benson wong. He was a cgi model  Of benson wong now. I have to say having  Broadcast that whole thing. I had no idea we weren't watching  The real deal. I mean in a way that gives new meaning to deep fakes if you can without telling anybody have your ceo  Giving a keynote, but it's a computer generated version of him  Look at here's the uh  That's creepy  Uncanny valley for sure, but uh, they got it working pretty well for the fooled me I have to say  Um, they generated his kitchen and the only thing that was a giveaway is at toward the end of the keynote  Benson's standing there in his kitchen and all of a sudden it goes  And flies out in a 3d space and he's standing in the middle of nowhere  Pretty wild  It's pretty terrifying. You should have this done. I should have it done for me. Is that what you're thinking?  You could podcast for first thing I was thinking I am posing right now

They create their own and I think that I do remember  Maybe it was blockchain, but they were using a way to verify that that actually is one of my personas  I think that was in the novel as well.

Yeah, right. They have deep fake audio  Of bordain reading his own words, which he never spoke in public but had written they were he was reading his own letters  And they don't talk about it at all. It's just anthony bryden talking but it's it's entirely computer generated  uh  audio  And so that's one example. I I wrote a piece for my newsletter recently called the banality of our deep fake future  Because what I think is happening  Is that deep fake fakeness?  Is slowly becoming just ordinary  Everyday occurrences. It's not a big deal. It's not it's not flipping elections. It's not having the disinformation  Power that we thought it would have it's really just little things like anthony bernane talking or this invidia guy doing  You know doing a fake version of himself for 14 seconds during a keynote and sort of showing up a little in little places  There's a there's a musical artist who?  Who basically created this website where anybody else can?  Make music with her voice  Uh invites people to do that. Wow, it's really kind of fascinating. It's her name is holly herndon  You can find her on twitter  but it's uh, it's a it's a  You know a twitter site called heard sounds, but anyway, it's just popping up everywhere and  uh  As this tom cruise guy  The guy's a professional they at first we thought he was some amateur who's doing this  But it's it's so good and so close that we're just right on the verge  of deep fake video being  uh undetectable  and that's a whole new world for all of us holly herndon has a

I do think we'll see more galaxy devices coming forward  But uh, but to make this their basically their premium line shows that they've they've got confidence that they've got the durability issues nailed  And the usability issues that still I think remains to be seen. I I still know that  You know these phones going mainstream. It still seems a little early to me  But but i'm definitely eager to see more of them in people's hands and in the wild

Yeah, and xiaomi announced a new phone pretty much at the same time  That probably it's more conventional  But but probably will do very well. The problem is xiaomi is a chinese company, which is not sold in the united states  Well, I guess you can get it if you if you shop around but  At samsung, you know what samsung's strength is really and and probably why they're so bullish is they are in every phone store in america  So whether it's their low-end j series or their very expensive folding phones  You can't get away from samsung at least in the u.s.

This is a breaking story  I give a lot of credit to a mother board's vice.

Nothing came out of it  Uh, they kept pitching vcs went back to google for a second meeting  Same kind of results they went and visited samsung and htc  They thought samsung might be interested. Yeah  Uh, they blew it kt lee saying he'd missed his chance with danger didn't want to see that happen again  So he was interested in getting him bored with android  kt lee  Told his team to make it happen. So we thought it was a done deal  But then we met with his team of 10 plus mid-level managers who said  Who's going to build your os when they said when we said brian  They laughed they had 300 people working on their own samsung os  Samsung asked if the team was dreaming nick said no, no, really brian  And a few other people they're going to build the os  They asked how could that be possible? We said well, not only is it possible. He already did it on the sidekick  After the business meeting samsung hosted a dinner to celebrate the new partnership  But the android team later learned the deal was contingent upon securing an order from a carrier  And they never were able to make that deal  So they they didn't come they didn't come away with a deal  Um, but by the way, that's why the code name for the first android phone the g1 is dream  because  That was the in memory of that meeting. It was just a dream  Then they went to htc  HTC  But at the time peter chow the ceo of htc said he wanted exclusivity  brian heard it  By the time we got back to our hotel room brian threatened to resign because he didn't join android to become another danger  And because brian's right in the os  They didn't they said okay fine, okay  Um

I mean, uh,  You know, they didn't have big screens  And in fact as I remember this, I don't know if this is in the book or not  I'm curious when the book comes out. I'll definitely read it  When apple came out with the iphone famously the android team said back to the drawing board  We can't ship this  And they made it look a lot more like the iphone  This is the big

Start time: 7030.22
End time: 7049.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, I think android i'm just just one quick thought leo. I think the whole purpose of android  Is to protect search and advertising on that's true. That's exactly right so that they could have the control  I mean you could imagine apple just one day saying no, we're not gonna have the google search engine anymore  Or google ads on iphones anymore and if android didn't exist that that'd be it for them

Start time: 7049.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's also interesting to think about what android would be like if htc had bought it or sansung or somebody else because you know,  We look at um web os from hp devices, which was a fantastic operating system and kind of sort of lives on in  lgs tvs at this point, but um  Really that operating system never got a chance to shine because it didn't really have the platform to do so

You have to have a massive team to do anything. I guess  But that I wonder how much you lose by that because the vision of some person just pushing that forward makes such a difference  Yeah

Yeah  So this is I don't know if if you don't if you don't have a kid and you don't follow this you may not know  how huge  These videos are  Uh, the the highest paid youtube star  Is a nine-year-old  named Ryan Kaji  He earned 29 and a half million dollars last year.

Transcript:  But that's not the only big channel on youtube there's ps toys reviews 1.78 million subscribers  fun family 3  1.41 million subscribers and a lot of these are just opening up toys  But youtube trying to protect kids is kind of interpreting these as as product placements or ads  and so  They're very concerned and I apparently according to  The information kaya yuri f the information is very well connected  these new policies may actually  Include toy unboxing videos and toy reviews  or  Says kaya and creators may be forced to reconsider how they produce videos such as avoiding showing product packaging  So that it's not an ad  They really are so videos

Start time: 7218.34
End time: 7244.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're they're paid product placements and they're also even videos  focused on the excessive accumulation or consumption of products, so even if it's just  Too commercial to buy buy stuff  It sounds like they're going to crack down on on that anything that basically incentivizes kids to buy something  Uh, and so that's that's the end of uh of of eight-year-olds watching twit, I guess

Transcript:  I was gonna say it reminds me of the deregulation of childhood television in I think it was early 80s. That's right  That's right  Basically all the great cartoons we think of in the 80s were basically  Toy commercials that were only possible because of the changes regulation that allowed  more advertising direct to kids in the 80s and so what was banned in the 70s suddenly became  You know prime time entertainment for when I was a kid and everything you could watch cartoons all saturday morning

Start time: 7347.52
End time: 7363.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get up you'd watch cartoons like until like  Mom stopped you  And and that's gone now by the way saturday morning cartoons aren't on tv anymore. And I guess that's probably because  Well, you can't put the ads on there anymore. So and and the ads were all cold cereal and

I'm sure I demanded it  I have to have cap grunge  That's just basically, you know haven't you have the sugar bowl instead?  Of course not. It won't cut your the roof of your mouth either  Google has put out there is this was actually leaked but google is apparently going to let employees work from home  But there's a calculator that will tell you how much less you will get paid  Both facebook and twitter and google  Uh cut pay for mode employees who move to less expensive areas

Start time: 7420.64
End time: 7491.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is totally fair in my opinion  um  i've been i've been  advocating for people to  you know  Helping helping people transition from full-time in office work to remote work doing that for many years  And one of the tactics that i've always advocated is to go to your boss and go to your company and negotiate a  A new contract where you can work remotely at lower pay  So you incentivize them with lower pay and then you move to some place that has a much lower cost of living and silicon valley  Is an extreme example if if you live in well, not silicon valley, but marine county just north of san francisco  100 and I think it's 110 000 a year is the poverty line there  Right. So if if you're making a hundred thousand dollars in a year and live in marine county  You can't make ends meet there because of the cost of living there. So cost of living  Is is always higher where there are tons of really high paying jobs and they're high paying jobs  So that people can afford the cost of living right there. So there's a connection between where you live  And how much you get paid?  So if google says hey you can live in you can live anywhere in the world  But you're going to take a a 25 pay cut. I would take that deal in a second

Start time: 7492.54
End time: 7550.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Google says if you work at home in the same city, we're not going to cut your pay  But they don't address the pay cuts that reuters reports  Pay cuts as high as 25 percent  For remote work if they left san francisco for for instance lake tahoe, which isn't much cheaper. I guess  But they're using stats from the u.s. Census bureau  Screenshots of this is from reuters story google's internal salary calculator  Show that an employee living in stampford connecticut an hour from new york city by train would be paid 15 percent less  While a colleague from the same office living in new york city would see no cut  Screenshots showed five and ten percent differences in the seattle boston san francisco areas. I guess it's I mean first of all, it's a  Private company, of course, they can do that  And I guess it does make sense. You don't have you're not going to pay for commute costs  Uh, you're going to have a lower cost of living. I guess that makes sense

Start time: 7550.86
End time: 7598.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a little bit unfair because they're effectively subsidizing people who choose to live in the city  Which which is a little bit distasteful if you choose to live in the city and you choose to live somewhere that you don't have  To but you want to live somewhere that you know, you like to go out and party or  Have a lot of restaurants then then should you really be paid more just because you can do that if you're still working remotely effectively  But for sure I think so long this is being done in a transparent way so that anyone can go on to this calculator  Internally within google and see that this is fair. It's being done in an equal way at that point  Yeah, I think it's totally about board and I think that more companies should follow suit and do something  Again, as long as it's very transparent and of course comprehensive. That's the other thing  I see a lot of companies that kind of have a kind of a half-baked algorithm for  Major metropolitan areas and everywhere else in the world. It's got to be all of our comprehensive than that

Start time: 7599.48
End time: 7623.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess and to expand on what do you get paid for do you get paid for the value of the work you're performing?  In which case you're still performing the same value of work wherever you are  So, I mean I we don't pay people well, maybe we do I guess we take into consideration  That you're living in petaluma. So we're not gonna have to pay you as much as if we were in san francisco  It's one of the reasons we didn't move to san francisco, frankly

Start time: 7624.10
End time: 7725.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's an employee market. So if you if you wanted to pay  Uh a rate that would be a good standard of living in central india  In petaluma you wouldn't have any applicants right because nobody could afford to live on that  So you so it's it's really about about the market but to expand on what tim was saying  I mean once it becomes normal for remote employees to get paid less lots of companies are going to revisit and say well  Why are we hiring people locally? We're paying them 25 more. We could save a bundle  If we with remote workers, we only hired remotely  At the lower pay and this is part of what I I talked about recently  There's a there and i've written about it for computer world. There are a whole bunch of factors  That are going to do a lot of damage to the two cities  Because people are going to move out of the cities people with you know  Some of the more enterprising people who can work remotely tend to be wealthier people have higher salaries  This is yet another dynamic where companies may be hiring remotely to save money on on salaries and so on  Bottom line is there's going to be less money in cities less money to pay taxes less money going to  Hipster cafes and restaurants and bars and all those things that make  Urban centers so nice to live in  As they as they sort of kind of go out of business because their customers are are moving out of out of cities  Uh, it makes the city even less desirable, etc, etc  And so I think we're going to have a kind of snowballing effect for some cities. Not all of course, new york city  Will always be new york city san francisco will will always be able to attract people but I think a lot of cities in the u.s are  Uh facing a crisis. They they're not really  aware is coming

Transcript:  Media dude in san francisco makes an interesting point in our chat room not in san francisco  I don't know where you are media dude media dude in our chat room makes an interesting point companies are also saving money with remote workers  Companies that were leasing huge buildings in san francisco now are letting those leases go  Including salesforce which just built a giant phallus downtown  Uh, they don't need all this office space because workers can work from home

Start time: 7752.60
End time: 7803.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except that they will be probably requiring the workers to come back to those buildings largely because they've already made that investment and we're seeing  So many companies are just blindly forcing employees to come back to to work  Which is really unfortunate, especially given everything going on with the delta variant  But even beyond that, um all the learnings that that we saw, you know productivity across the board was was up last year despite everyone  Working from home and you'd think that most corporations would go. Oh, this is a no-brainer, but but from what i'm seeing across the industry  I think corporations are just going to fall right back into the familiar pattern of requiring people to be in the office just like before  And as much as I would love for this to be finally the the remote work revolution that that we've all been waiting for for a long  Time. I I just don't see it happening  I wish I wish it would because i've worked remote forever and it's it's amazing but um,  It's not for everybody and I think that the people who is not for are largely the ones making the call

Uh, tim you and I love being remote  There are lots of people who hate being remote  But what we what we're seeing is a sort of turning of the tides where now the people who love going in office  We're talking about extroverts  Who get energy from feeding off of other people's energy?  um  They're going to have to work a little harder to get the in-office job that they want  I think you know, everything is a competitive marketplace and so lots of startups increase an increasing number of startups  I think will be 100 remote all employees 100 remote right from the beginning and they'll have a  They'll have a financial advantage. They'll have a hiring advantage over the companies that are in a city hiring people locally  And having them come to an office. So we'll see if  We'll see if that whole dynamic  seriously  Impacts the companies that insist on having no or few remote employees or not  But I have the feeling that going all remote is going to be a big advantage for startups

That's just the just the ads. It's a whole new idea  Very wild. No  It's really interesting to see how the pandemic has changed so much and not just temporarily  But permanently you wrote an article in computer world mike about business travel  Which died during the pandemic of course because nobody wanted to get an airplane but not coming back

Start time: 8202.56
End time: 8214.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. That's right. So what happened was the during the pandemic  Uh companies learned a whole bunch of things first thing they learned the most important thing they learned is that  Who knew zoom and all these other video conversations?

Start time: 8219.34
End time: 8366.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they also learned how incredibly wasteful business travel has always been  You have people who are making decisions about when and where and why they go on business trips who themselves don't have to pay for it  And so they're like sure i'll book i'll book three days in advance of the trip, which is way more expensive  I'm gonna stay at the really nice hotel because they give me all the points I want i'm gonna fly first class because you know, et  Cetera, et cetera, et cetera  They're making all these decisions and you think about all those decisions that are made around business travel  At a massive scale  Especially for like one-on-one meetings. Oh, i'm gonna fly to berlin because i'm gonna meet with this guy because you know  We're you know, maybe we're gonna work out a deal or something  Uh, and companies are now that they've gotten a taste  Of not paying for business travel. They're thinking wait a minute  Why did we used to spend so much money on business travel? And so now there's a new  concept that's circulating within companies about  about  Forcing business travelers to justify the roi on every trip. Why are you going? How are we gonna how is your trip going to?  Monetarily pay for itself through what you're going to be doing on this trip  So it's kind of the kind of the end of the what's the roi on the trip? Yeah, exactly  and so there's also a  Realization that that you know, generally that's been building for a long time that the travel in general is environmentally  Has an environmental impact and so companies who are hoping to show how you know hoping to launch new initiatives to be greener  One actually easy way is to redo if you can cut business travel by half you can you can demonstrate  Uh very very easily that you have a much lower carbon footprint  So all these factors are going to really transform the business travel industry  And by the way business travelers, as I point out in in my article  They make up a tiny fraction. I think it's 12 percent  I don't have it in front of me of the number of people traveling on airplanes, but they they give the airlines  75 of their profits wow, and so with that substantially being reduced  the airlines the hotels the whole travel industry is  in for a whole lot of  Of change and not the kind of change they really want  So it's going to be an interesting period of time over the next three years  Looking at travel business travel and the and the travel industry what happens to airlines

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I think though there's going to be a whole new business travel market, which is getting remote workforces together like  You know probably twice a year. You're going to fly the entire company somewhere really nice. I mean, that sounds good  Yeah, I like to be a boom for like hawaii mexico  Yeah, you know just like nice places to hang out versus kind of  business center destinations

Start time: 8390.68
End time: 8406.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or more likely dragging them back to headquarters. I I talked about this in the article as well  I also think that there's other points of additional travel one of which is that we have this concept of the workation  Uh and the and and at least and I wanted to move to barbedos for a year

Transcript:  Uh instead of yes. Yeah, I wish we had actually

Start time: 8410.80
End time: 8438.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but I think that I i'm predicting that there will likely be some companies that will fund  All or part of workations for some of their employees as a kind of perk  So it's like, you know, it's like a sabbatical you go to barbedos for a month keep working, you know work full time  But we'll pay for your affair and something else and sort of incentivize workations because workations are great  Especially for companies that don't want to really  pay for vacations

Transcript:  You actually bring up something else I had not heard about but I thought was very interesting the same article  the digital travel credential  Replacing passports with your smartphone

Start time: 8449.66
End time: 8506.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is something the un it's a un agency that handles the standards for  Uh for passports is working on a digital version of your passport. So just like we have  a global entry and some of these other programs where you get to bypass some of them, you know  Essentially people you bypass security or bypass this bypass that we're getting to a point where  Face recognition would just let you bypass everything you just walk into the airport. It recognizes you. Yep. Go right onto the plane  It'll handle your passport. It'll handle your digital health  certificate a separate one will  It'll handle your ticket all that stuff. So we're  You know a mobile phone and your face in a database is going to be the key to  Having travel be a lot more convenient and also less private but traveling with privacy is a  Thing in the past that will never exist again. Oh, yeah, we know that's gone for sure

Start time: 8506.94
End time: 8516.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean they always scan my passport when I cross the border. So i'm sure i'm in a database  So why not have it on your phone and you say he'll be uh, use blockchain

Start time: 8519.09
End time: 8577.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is I think interesting. Yeah, isn't that interesting? Yeah. Yeah, I I it's kind of a  Surprise there, but there are all kinds of things that are happening. So for example, one one of the things that I think is really interesting  is that  driver's licenses and  Identification cards are issued by states  Okay, so what's happening is that the federal government is mandating?  a new thing that  Called real id right which you won't be able to travel domestically  Without a real id compliant driver's license in I think it's may 2023  And so this is basically a little thing that goes on your  License so that essentially turns your state issued license into a national  License as well. So I I went and got my real I went to the california dmv here  Last week and got a real id, you know  Applicate there's an application process you fill out a form and and they go and they check higher standards of identification  You have to really prove you were a real id

Start time: 8577.28
End time: 8579.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to really prove you are who you say you are

Start time: 8581.67
End time: 8592.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. But the idea that you can't fly domestically without essentially a federal id  Id yeah is kind of a new thing in the united states something that they're putting into the back door actually

Start time: 8592.78
End time: 8596.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I did the opposite. My driver's license was was up for renewal and I did not want to go to the dmv

Start time: 8600.40
End time: 8610.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I opted to get the regular  Regular driver's license not a real id because I already had global entry right which serves as right

Start time: 8610.78
End time: 8630.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and when I bought it when I got a passport last time I got a passport card and i've asked the tsa  Can I use this to get in an airplane and they said yes, of course, that's a federal id  So it's a real id. Um, yeah. Yeah privacy's dead as far as travel goes. I think that's yes  That's pretty unless you drive everywhere. You're gonna definitely be tracked as you uh, as you do it

Start time: 8631.26
End time: 8685.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would like to make one other point about privacy because you'd mentioned it I think on a on a on a couple of shows this week  I don't recall which ones but basically the fact that  uh late last year  Uh, the there was a court that basically said the fourth amendment doesn't apply to  Your phone or your laptop and any other stuff you can do advanced searches. We can just download everything  We don't have to have a reason or a warrant or anything, you know, it's pretty pretty extreme change  From before before the pandemic when everybody used to travel to after the pandemic once we travel again totally different world  But I actually believe that this isn't going to hold up in the courts  This will go up and up in the courts and I think in the end i'm optimistic about this that  the current status is not going to survive the  the the appeals process  Call me too optimistic, uh, but I I don't think this is a permanent state of affairs. Well

Start time: 8687.06
End time: 8708.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope not. We'll bring you back when it all shakes out. Yeah  Uh, hey, I thank you all for staying late  I know you probably want to get back out there and look at the Aston Martin 217 mile an hour convertible  the valkyrie wow  I don't know if i'd want to drive 217 miles an hour in a convertible, but this looks like the batmobile

Start time: 8721.48
End time: 8744.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's this is a different sort of car though. This is a really a track only car  So you'll never really need to turn the wheel more than this  You're not going to be doing any three-point turns or anything like that. This is really designed to give you  Professional level race car performance in something that you can buy and you can go play with yourself. You can buy four how much  Uh, I believe the pricing of these is around we're still talking about the three million dollar mark  For these guys if I remember correctly. There you go. Nothing

Start time: 8746.46
End time: 8750.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 8751.00
End time: 8763.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really ought to yeah. Yeah  It really looks like the batmobile doesn't it?  It's a wild thing  Do uh, what do you think elon putting that yoke on regular street vehicles? That seems horrible. Yeah, horrible mistake

Start time: 8764.16
End time: 8800.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. The usability is horrible on that thing. Uh, I'm concerned a little bit of a safety issue as well  Both in terms of what happens in a crash because you have more sharp edges than you would in a normal round steering wheel  That will naturally prevent your hands from being in a bad place  But also if you are you know  If you're doing the typical uh cruise autopilot thing where you kind of got one hand on the wheel just enough to to keep the system  Going and suddenly you have to make an emergency reaction you reach up to grab the wheel  But it's not where you're expecting it to be  That as well could be a big issue  So I think it's a really bad decision on multiple fronts and I was really sad to see that actually go to production

Start time: 8800.58
End time: 8817.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he said, uh, no there won't be a round wheel option. You just have to  Live with the yoke. Sorry. It's a big mistake. Yeah, here's the bugatti  bolide  1500 plus  Horsepower there's another batmobile. These are looking like race cars, but that's really what they are, isn't it?

Start time: 8818.08
End time: 8835.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really where we're seeing a lot of money from these ultra exotic car companies is creating these very very limited edition  I think but guys can make 40 of these and of course they're all sold too  But these are very very specifically tuned for track performance  So this is again not a car you're going to be taking on the road and this one I think is five million dollars

Start time: 8835.94
End time: 8840.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The world and they're all here in monterey this weekend. Oh my god coincidentally  But these companies are are learning that they can create these ultra limited edition versions of their already extremely expensive cars and make them even more  Expensive which then gives them a whole lot of money that they can then roll into the next generation cars  So that's a huge trend  We're seeing this year is all these very very limited production teens or maybe a hundred of these cars  Selling for millions of dollars each and they're being bought up instantly before they even are are made publicly available with that small

Start time: 8870.92

Transcript:  Number of units is is it profitable or is it just more a showcase for the company?

Start time: 8875.12
End time: 8901.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because these cars are typically based on earlier production versions of the car  So they may be you know tuned up to have more power some different bodywork on there  And of course lots of bespoke so if you can get these configured any way you want to any color or anything you want  But largely they're based on existing platforms. So therefore the rnd development has already been covered  All the crash testing has already been done largely  So therefore they can just you know, put a lot of accessories on there basically and dial up the profit margin in a big big way
