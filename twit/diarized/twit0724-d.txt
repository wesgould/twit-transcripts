The bulb will flash on and off three times to show that the reset was successful.  If it doesn't.  The bulb will flash.  Maybe running on an older version of firmware.  Oh no.  I think that's the way there's more.  Which is designed for C by GE bulbs with this package.  Honey, can you find that packaging?  Oh my God.  Ready?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Inhumane tech experiences.  I mean, that'll be the featured experience.  My goodness.  Amazing.

Start time: 468.00
End time: 554.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I missed that whole thing because apparently I don't pay close enough attention to Twitter.  I apologize, but now we know the whole story.  The story I was going to start with is, I thought kind of interesting, which is  Facebook's decision to make their own cryptocurrency, Libra coin.  I said, well, Facebook says not ours, but it is kind of theirs.  I don't think if it were just another cryptocurrency without Facebook's  a premature, it wouldn't be of any interest.  How many cryptocurrencies are there?  There are many dozens.  This one has a large group of people behind it besides Facebook, including PayPal  and MasterCard and Visa.  No banks, oddly enough.  Facebook open sourced the technology, even though they developed it in-house,  and will, according to Wired, cede control of the blockchain to the neutral Libra Association.  Wired called it the Switzerland of digital coinage because it's in Switzerland.  Each of the initial 100 founding members, including Facebook, will invest at least $10 million  to fund operations and receive interest earned off the reserve.  There are some NGO members, Kiva, for instance, the micro lending company is part of this.  And that's what Facebook's pitching this as, is a way to bring banking to the next billion people.

Start time: 556.10
End time: 558.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd wait for them not to pay any fees.  It's pretty great.  Yeah.

Start time: 559.24
End time: 578.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in that regard, it's kind of like Facebook's internet.org.  It seems like a beneficial to humanity thing to do.  There was some question about privacy.  In other words, would Facebook get all the transactions?  They say no.  It'll be private.  So Defender, why does Facebook want to start a cryptocurrency?

Start time: 579.46
End time: 585.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's a big question.  I will warn you guys upfront.  I was off this entire week, so I was trying to stay away from a lot of tech news.

Start time: 587.72
End time: 589.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you knew about the light bulb.

Start time: 589.34
End time: 595.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so much for that.  Twitter.  That's just fun.  That's just culture.  But the Facebook cryptocurrency, you know.

Start time: 595.92
End time: 600.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you could say this off the top of your head because we don't really know anything.  It's not going to happen until next year.

Start time: 601.20
End time: 630.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you can speculate that having your cryptocurrency is smart for them because they  won't have to pay any transaction fees to credit card companies or to banks or anything,  which I think most companies want.  They want kind of the freedom to handle payments like that.  And also Facebook is so big, you know, we've said this many times on the show.  It's the thought it's bigger than most countries, you know, in terms of the amount of users.  So it kind of makes sense for them to have their own specific currency.  Actually, surprising it took this long.

Start time: 630.46
End time: 637.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook's bigger than any country.  If you take the two and a half, what is it, two and a half billion people use Facebook?  That's huge.

Start time: 638.54
End time: 638.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's huge.

Start time: 639.82
End time: 657.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp would clearly,  strikes me Facebook wants to be WeChat for the rest of the world, right?  Because WeChat runs commerce in China.  But on the other hand, that Facebook association sticks in some people's craw.

Start time: 658.68
End time: 661.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Almost like we shouldn't trust anything they say.  I don't.

Start time: 662.51
End time: 669.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Clearly.  Kate, which side do you come?  This is a good thing, yeah?  Or is it an evil plan?

Start time: 670.56
End time: 702.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think there's certainly good that can come of it.  And I think for whatever good that can come of it, like the banking, the unbanked and,  and, you know, sort of getting rid of these international transaction fees and,  and the kinds of things that prohibit people from being able to  support each other financially across global currencies.  Yeah, that it makes a lot of sense.  But I do think that it's wise of anyone to be suspicious of how it's going to play out  with Facebook's reputation for data breaches and overreaches.

Start time: 703.70
End time: 725.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not to mention if you're a bank.  This could be terrifying.  A threat to national sovereignty too, because, in fact, India has already banned,  you can go to jail for 10 years in India for using any cryptocurrency.  Because it threatens the government, right?  One of the government's main functions is to create and support a currency.

Start time: 727.90
End time: 756.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, one of the, I think one of the important things here is that these,  these coins are going to be backed by real assets.  So it's, it's not just Bitcoin that can, you know, that has a sort of a,  you know, a cryptographic value is still, you know, ascribed to it.  And that's it.  This will have money, apparently all over the world to back it.  They said four, they said what?

Start time: 757.00
End time: 765.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dollars, euros, yen and marks.  I can't remember what the fourth one was.  Yeah.  There are no marks.  That's the last one.  Pounds.

Start time: 766.78
End time: 770.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we're not, we're, we're a bit volatile right now.  Thank you, Brexit.

Start time: 770.86
End time: 787.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think that's one of the flaws with Bitcoin for sure is you don't know.  It's now $10,000 again.  You don't know what it's going to be worth.  Hence somebody could spend millions of dollars for a pizza,  you know, not knowing what that Bitcoin is worth.  So that's one thing that I think Facebook wants it.  They're not pegging it to the dollar, but they want it to be stable.

Start time: 789.00
End time: 845.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  They want it to, they want it to be stable.  And I think the other thing to be, to be, you know, I think we have to be very mindful of is  the fact that number one, Facebook has a massive trust issue in the first instance.  Anyway, a lot of people are very skeptical of Facebook because of its reach.  Also, we haven't really had a massively successful use of  crypto in the kind of mainstream world.  You know, we've seen companies like Dell accept it for payments for laptops and things.  We've seen stores accept it, but we've also seen plenty of stores drop support of it because the  volatility is too great.  You know, there's, I don't think we have a massively successful example to say,  this is the reason why this can be a success.  And I think that paired with the lack of trust that Facebook inherently has right now makes me  very skeptical whether this can take off.  And that's only magnified by the fact that no banks are involved in this.  So I think they're going to have a really tough time.

Start time: 846.72
End time: 878.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the other, there's really two problems with Bitcoin.  One is the volatility.  The other is just due to the algorithm for the blockchain, transactions can take a really long  time.  And if you're in a store to buy a pair of pants, you can't wait half an hour, an hour,  two hours for that transaction to go through.  It has to go through much faster.  Facebook says that they're going to be able to process tens of thousands of transactions a  second, but that's not a huge number compared to the potential if this becomes used by billions  of customers worldwide.

Start time: 878.24
End time: 904.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it is interesting that they're trying to keep it open, at least in some respect.  Knowing Facebook, like it seems like their first approach to everything, like when they got into  VR, Oculus was this closed off thing.  It took a while for them to even like cooperate with SteamVR and everything.  So the openness from the get-go is interesting to me.  I just wonder, is it open in name only because Facebook is probably the most, I don't know,  powerful force among that open source organization there.

Start time: 905.12
End time: 934.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kate, I read too much science fiction, so maybe you could get down to earth.  But if you read a lot of science fiction and a lot of it talks about corporate governance in the  future, there won't be countries, there'll be corporations, and you're looking in our current  of heirs for the seeds of that future, this to me could be in 20, 30, 40 years, we might look back  and say this was a watershed moment when Silicon Valley decided, screw dollars, we're going to use  our own currency.

Start time: 936.60
End time: 1020.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's true.  I think there are sort of shades of that going on.  But I think there's enough going on that Facebook and its partners tried to put into place to  alleviate some of those doubts and concerns.  Certainly this consortium of 28 or whatever partners do look like the kind of partners that  you would want to have involved in this process.  As you mentioned, Kiva and other NGOs that sort of provide this kind of stabilizing,  humanistic force to the whole thing.  But I do think that the association with Facebook is just going to be really hard to overcome,  that there's no sense that anybody's going to have that this is not a play to monetize the back end  of messaging.  And the content that Facebook is increasingly pushing to the dark corners of its platform,  where people are going to be clustered in groups and that sort of thing is going to need some sort  of reach, some sort of monetization.  This seems like a way to get around having monetization through the news feed, advertising  in the news feed.  And it does seem like they're sort of thinking two steps ahead to get to where they're diversified  and well set up for continued leadership and sprawl.

Start time: 1021.08
End time: 1066.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is completely weirdly paranoid of me, but I can just imagine.  I thought two years ago, Mark Zuckerberg, especially with his 50 state tour, he was going  to run for president.  I thought he thought, and I think this is kind of the, I could see the Silicon Valley billionaires  thinking and well not just Silicon Valley, Jeff Bezos thinking, you know, this democracy thing,  this is a mess.  We know we're smart.  We can figure this out.  Let's just let us do it.  Make it more efficient.  Yeah, it'd be more efficient.  Let us handle it.  And then I obviously, Zuck realized after he went to Congress and people thought he  was a robot.  Okay, maybe I'm not going to make it.  I couldn't become president, but who, you know, why would I want to take a step down?  I don't need to be president.

Transcript:  All I need is a currency.  I mean, seriously, this is what if global coin, what if Libra became the, I could see  how it would.  If there's no VIG going to the banks, it became a dominant form of payment.  It's how you do it.  We use PayPal.  We have international hosts.  It's easier for us to use PayPal to pay them.

Start time: 1092.74
End time: 1095.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The PayPal support is interesting on this, too, for sure.

Start time: 1096.54
End time: 1133.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure there's enough revenue to go around.  I'm sure they'll figure out a way to get something out of it.  But to me, this doesn't strike me from, at least certainly from Facebook's point of view,  as either an economic play like we're going to make a lot of money on this, although they  might have a hand in every transaction going forward.  That's Amazon's plan, right?  And I don't think this is a privacy thing.  I think that's missing the whole point of this.  If you say, oh, Facebook's just doing this so they can get more information about all  our transactions.  I think this is a power play.  I think this is Facebook saying, who needs a government?  Who needs banks?  Am I just being paranoid, Devendra?

Start time: 1133.82
End time: 1144.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think that's probably a good way to look at it.  To me, it's a little less scary than something like the portal that they announce their video  chat system.  And I should point out, I have two of them.

Start time: 1146.98
End time: 1149.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I thought I'd need two, one to talk to the other one.

Start time: 1150.14
End time: 1169.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it makes sense.  I mean, which is good tech, but probably came at the wrong time for them.  Whereas this, yeah, it does seem like a power play.  It does seem like, how can we just be a global superpower?  What if we didn't need banks?  What if we could just manage our own ecosystem?  It's preparing us for the world of the future where we're all living in VR and just buying  stuff digitally.  It all makes sense.

Start time: 1170.28
End time: 1199.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess I'm not the only one who's paranoid because the French government has already  said we're investigating and Facebook is going to have to go to Congress next month to explain  yourself, Facebook.  Because there's some, I think, reasonable concern in government about, well, what is  Facebook up to?  So maybe I'm not completely paranoid, although lately getting grilled by Congress is just  kind of table stakes for anybody who wants to play this game.

Start time: 1200.74
End time: 1237.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought it was interesting on that.  The Congress investigation articles that I've been reading that it's both it's a sort of  a bipartisan suspicion of this plan.  Right.  And you can easily see what sort of stakes that each side is thinking about.  One side's thinking about the sort of social and data privacy implications and one side  is thinking about, but banks.  Right.  Right.  They're stepping in and taking over banks.  So it is interesting that it is a bipartisan concern that's being expressed here.

Start time: 1238.74
End time: 1281.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you think about banks, not just central banks, national banks, but just commercial banks,  they really are an important constituency to Congress, I would imagine.  They spend a lot of money on Congress.  Congress has a certain sense of responsibility to banks and I'm sure that's what some of this is.  And honestly, I'm so torn about this because as you probably gathered, I'm not a fan of Facebook,  but at the same time, anything that disintermediates, especially banks,  I think that's a good thing.  So I don't know where to come down on this one.

Transcript:  Well, it's so easy to sort of fast forward a few years and imagine that the kind of  investigation that's been going on over the last couple of years about the Russian involvement in  the 2016 presidential election and the campaigns.  It's so easy to imagine a couple of years down the road, this whole obfuscation that happens as a  result of this all happening through Swiss bank and there's some data trail, of course.  Imagine that.  What data trail?

Transcript:  Can I just throw one other massive bit of skepticism in here?  And I feel like a massive naysayer on all this.  No, no, that's good.  Have we really examined why Facebook is doing this, right?  Because Facebook gets about 99% of all its revenue from advertising  and we know how that side of its business model works.  But what is its real motivation here?  I've heard talk about that the more people who have better access to money and banking  and revenue in general mean they may be more likely to want to spend on advertising and  therefore that's good for Facebook.  And I get that if that's the reason.  But maybe it's just my inherent distrust for most of what Facebook does that makes me just  want to question why exactly is it doing this and why is Facebook the right company to do  to do this and to pull this off?  What has it been telling other partners about why it's the right one to spearhead all this?  Amidst all this stuff that's going on with Facebook, why now and why Facebook?  I don't have a good answer for that.  It's a question I suppose to everyone else.  I find myself to be maybe more skeptical than some other people I've heard talking about this.  I'm not sure why that is.

And India very interestingly said this is just another form of colonialism.  We have plenty of experience with that.  No, thank you.  Yeah.

It wants to have a business model around, well, this is the place you can go for real-time chat  between a subscriber and the company being subscribed to.  It wouldn't take a giant leap of imagination to think that this could be built into something like  that where actually you can do your transactions on this platform.  You can send and receive money on this platform.  And maybe there would be an incentive to Facebook for you to do that.  Plus, it wouldn't necessarily cost Facebook anything to do that on an individual transaction  basis.  And I wonder if that's part of the long-term ambition here.

Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a lot of speculation.  But I feel what you're saying, Leo, that it's hard not to feel like there's a conspiracy here.  And I think it's not just Facebook.  They have a ton of partners.  And it feels like them working together with all these other technology companies and a lot of VC  firms, Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures.  I'm just looking at the list here.  Well, okay.

Start time: 1488.12
End time: 1502.37

Transcript:  Yeah.  This seems like the beginning of the ultimate digital currency, basically.  And they have these VC firms.  They have Stripe, which is a company that's handling credit card transactions for a lot of  online companies and things like that.  And PayPal, which we mentioned before, which is still big, even though it seems like an  old school company, they're still huge.  They have Venmo.  There's a lot of really interesting partnership here that I think could...  It's more interesting than just Facebook doing this on their own, basically.

Start time: 1554.70
End time: 1623.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think one of the things that makes it interesting is not only that Facebook's name is part of this  collective, but that Facebook has been kind of the name that we've associated with this  idea for the last few weeks as the rumors have been flying around.  And that also they're building the Calibra wallet that's going to be, at least initially,  the way that you manage the money and push things around.  So supposedly there will be third parties that will build wallets other than Calibra.  But I think that's an interesting function at the beginning, too.  And I still come back to, for me, I just see Facebook looking into their own future and  seeing that they're going to need to fundamentally turn their business model inside out in order to  deal with all of the complaints about content moderation and all the complaints that they're  getting about regulation and data privacy.  Their content that's been pushed to the newsfeed is going to need to be pulled back into the  groups and private messaging.  And so they need to think in a completely different way about how they monetize that  and how they make that a successful model going forward.  And to me, this just feels like one piece of that equation.

Start time: 1625.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It might boil down to...  Nate, you ask an interesting question, but I think a fairly impenetrable question.  What is their intent?  No, I mean, I don't know if you can look into Facebook's soul and see what its intent is  for anything.  Well, they've already helped us.  Facebook has a soul.  Facebook has no soul.  That's the point.  It's got the dark, soulless eyes of a man-eating shark.  But no, in all seriousness, it kind of comes down to how you feel about Facebook.  If you think Facebook is true to what Mark says all the time, which is it's all about  connection man.  This would be just one another way to do that, right?  And disintermediating banks and governments, that couldn't be bad.  But maybe it's also about getting a piece of every financial transaction in the future.  And the other question is, if not Facebook, who?  If Google did this, would we be having the same conversation?  You bet.  And if not Facebook, China?  I mean, I'm sure that there are other people trying to do this.  So maybe Facebook is the best possible choice to do this.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fundamentally, I don't know how different it is for Facebook to be doing this from China doing  this.  In some ways, I mean, there's still a lot of surveillance that kind of goes into the  equation.  And the amount of trust on the table is still just as much in question.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, maybe this is the future of Facebook, right?  I mean, it's still a really young company.  And in 50 years time, if Facebook's still around and somebody came back from the future  and said, Facebook is the global standard for international borderless payments,  and that's it, like a massive one world bank, I could believe it.  You look at a company like Nokia, which is my favorite example, it used to make toilet paper.  And then it decades later-  And then tires.  Tires and bits of rubber and stuff.  If someone came back from 2003 and said to this person buying Nokia toilet paper that  in the future it was going to make most of the world's smartphones, you'd be like,  how?  Not sure.  Maybe Facebook can do that.  I don't know.  But I'm skeptical for now.

Transcript:  Fascinating subject.  Yeah, Facebook is in a lot of heat.  Of course, the latest from Casey Newton, who does such a good job, he's once again blowing  the lid off moderation on Facebook, his article on The Verge, talking about the Tampa content  moderators.  And what a nightmare.  First of all, I think an important thing to point out is that they don't work for Facebook.  They work for a contractor called Cognizant, who has a $200 million deal with Facebook for  two years to hire and deploy these content moderators.  It sounds like a nightmare job.  Casey got once again, got a number of current and former moderators to talk to him about  what's going on there.  And it's just depressing as hell.  Conditions.  He reported first on the Phoenix site, which is how he got on-trend to the Tampa site.  He said conditions at the Phoenix site have not improved since I visited last week.  Some employees were sent home after an infestation of bed bugs was discovered in the office, the  second time that's happened.  Cognizant's statement, they also run the Phoenix office, was, well, bed bugs can be found in  virtually every place people tend to gather, including the workplace.  I don't think we've ever had, have we ever had bed bugs here?  No, no bed bugs here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my God.  I mean, the stories that he had, they described, this is Tampa.  Contractors told me that Cognizant had lured them away.  This is the thing that's really depressing for him.  Less demanding jobs by promising regular schedules, bonuses and career development.  None of that.  All of that they reneged on.  Contractors described a filthy workplace in which they regularly find pubic hair and other bodily  waste at their workstations.  Employees said managers laugh off or ignore sexual harassment and threats of violence.  The use of marijuana is so prevalent.  A manager joked at an all hands meeting he'd gotten a contact high walking in the door.  And you know what?  I don't blame them for getting high because what a crappy job.  He talked to one guy who saw a video.  It was asked to review a video of horrific animal abuse.  The guy who was a dog lover couldn't take it.  He flagged it.  Facebook said, no, no, that's okay.  We're going to let it through.  At which point that video got reshared and the poor moderator had to see it again and again  and again and again for $15 an hour, which I should point out is almost twice the minimum wage in  Florida.  They kept reposting it again and again, he said, pounding the table as he spoke.  It made me so angry I had to listen to it screams all day.  I don't know what there is to say about this.  I mean, this is part of the problem.  Facebook and all of Silicon Valley, Google too, tends to say, oh no, there's technological  solutions to obviously when you have a giant platform as we do, people are people.  Some people are going to misbehave.  There's technological solutions.  There's AI solutions.  But it seems like that they just hire more people.  30,000 people now work for Facebook in content moderation, which sounds like one of the worst  jobs I can imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's an episode of HBO's Chernobyl of the people whose job it is to go and just kill all  the irradiated pets.  Spoilers, I guess.  But one of the worst jobs I can imagine.  And this seems like the modern equivalent of that, basically, like having to live through  this sort of content.  And it's not like they can just skip it, right?  They're required to watch, I think, like 15 to 20 seconds of these videos just to make sure  that they're flagging it appropriately.  So this is a thankless job.  But it also goes to show like all these tech companies, they talk about the holy algorithm.  Right.  It could fix this eventually.  It's never not really going to happen anytime soon.  So right now it's all human help.  And they farm out this stuff to these contract companies, which just don't care, right?  They have a really low level of employee care.  And they're separated by Facebook and Google.  Yeah, you don't even really work for Facebook.

I can't I don't know if you can even really blame Facebook, although  what do they make it?  Fifteen billion dollars a quarter.

Start time: 2064.64
End time: 2135.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, I think you can blame them a little for for not putting the conditions in place  that even through a contractor that are livable, manageable conditions, these are horrible jobs.  They're doing horrible work.  But at least the workplace that they're in could be something that that is not disgusting.  And they could be being provided with competent psychiatric help, which it sounds like they're  not.  I mean, there's just any number of opportunities that Facebook has to make this situation better  through its contractor.  And it's it's not it's not Facebook's fault per se.  It's not cognizant's fault per se.  It's that the scale of the content problem is so vast.  That they really need to double down and triple down on on the resources they're throwing at  this.  And I hope that they are.  It sounds like the person they have now in charge of this at Facebook is looking to do  some earnest improvements over the situation.  And I really hope he's effective.  But it's complicated.  It's very complicated.  And you see in this one line in here that one of the people that Casey Newton interviews  says, I asked him what he thought needed to change.  He says, I think Facebook needs to shut down.

Transcript:  I don't know if it's possible.  I do know that a lot of people have already been down this road in the academic landscape  and have evaluated what happens when we're given the benefit of quasi anonymity and the  reach that we're given in these platforms and what happens when you try to moderate  that.  And it's just it's all levels of complexity happening at the same time.  So it sort of feeds into the best and the worst of human nature.  And it's hard.  So I think it kind of brings up this quote that Tim Cook said this week or last week  about if you build a chaos factory, you can't not be responsible for the chaos or however  he said it.  Yeah, that's a good point.  Yeah.  Yeah, you have to be responsible for this.  Facebook has to be responsible for the chaos that's been unleashed.  And they're certainly benefiting from it.  They have enough resources.  You know, this is this is their opportunity to step up and really make something good  happen here.  Or better than as bad as it is.

Transcript:  Well, so much good comes of these platforms.  That's true, too.  We can't ignore that.  So much good.  It's just that there's a lot of complications that arise out of it.  And people are the collateral damage.  And we need to do something about that.  Facebook needs to do something about that.  Regulations, perhaps, need to do something about that.  It's something very complicated that needs to be unwoven and figured out at a level that  has not been solved before.  As you guys have talked about, it's the biggest company.  It's the it represents a kind of a country.  So we need to be thinking on that scale with the solutions.

Start time: 2278.97

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's something I think Twitter is learning, too.  It's certainly not as if Twitter doesn't have its share of trolls and bots and all kinds of  disinformation and nuttiness that happens on that platform.  It's just the nature of having that kind of scale and reach and people using it to good  advantages and bad advantages.  So they need to be doing something to moderate that, for sure.

Start time: 2307.08
End time: 2347.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Taking responsibility definitely seems like the good first step.  And I think for the past years, even that much, even getting that far, seemed impossible  because these companies just wouldn't listen to a lot of the complaints or would say like,  oh, yeah, we have algorithms dealing with this or something like that.  So at least now it seems more like Facebook, Twitter, Facebook, at least, is looking a little  more at like what it's doing.  I'm sure I'm thinking like that whole Zuckerberg 50 state reunion or 50 state tour.  I don't know.  Maybe it was about a potential presidential run, but it also seemed like what did we do?  How did Facebook affect the 2016 election?  How did we break this democracy or how did we basically help to break it?

But I think that tour alone showed a certain amount of responsibilities.  Maybe I have this thing that has so greatly influenced this country.  I should go see how that's happened with these sorts of things.  These contract farms basically seem like these are labor practices that we've been talking about  for years.  Oh, yeah.  All sorts of things, even before tech.  And it's just the basics that we can't get down.  And it's a problem inherent in America, too.  Like we just don't.  We don't treat our workers that well.  And certainly everybody's looking at their bottom line and they wanted the cheapest,  easiest solution.  That's kind of a bigger thing we need to work through as a society  to really fix it for all these tech companies, too.  I don't want to.

It was just the nerds gathering to build their little Z80 machines.  It wasn't important.  It was fun.  It was cool.  It was a hobby.  It was the toy store.  But now as technology is directly woven into the fabric of everything we do,  these bigger issues have emerged.  When you're typing in a checkbook program in BASIC, none of this comes up.

It was just exciting.  But I think over the past decade, tech has won, certainly in certain respects,  in terms of being the dominant culture, being the dominant business culture,  pervading consumer lives.  We all revolve our lives around tech now in so many ways,  even if people don't think about that.  And yeah, now is the time to stop and think about the human cost to all that.  That's why I like the tech humanist angle.  It's certainly great.  But yeah, these companies need to think a lot harder in general.

Transcript:  I think there's still a lot of fun to be had around that stuff.  I do think that people like Devendra who have the philosophy background  and a lot of other folks who are bringing the liberal arts discussions into tech  are bringing a lot of value because a lot of what happened with the  playing around with the toys of tech, I think sort of disambiguated it.  It sort of divorced it from the reality of what happens at scale with this stuff.  And I think that's part of why we're facing these consequences now is that  we've looked at technology as, eh, it's just fun.  And then it's taken on scale that has impacted our lives in very real ways.  So it takes people coming in with that philosophy background, with the ethics  backgrounds, with the rigor of looking at the human condition across society and culture  and saying, how do we make this where it actually does have the potential to use the powers of  emerging technologies of automation and the scale of AI and all of that to actually make  human life better, to solve things like climate catastrophe through the powers of AI.  And I think that all is still possible and we can harness that.

I had a caller.  What was it?  We called the radio show yesterday saying, I'm working for an association.  We need software to keep track of our associates and the accounts.  And I said, I don't know, but you know where I know you can go.  And I was able to give a nice little plug for our sponsor, Capterra.  Don't call me if you need business software.  Don't Google if you need business software.  There's a directory online that has every business program out there  organized into 700 specific categories.  Obvious stuff like email marketing, CMS, IT service, SEO, workflow management,  direct line of business stuff like veterinary office management or yoga studio management.  Every program, modern software.  So if you're suffering with something written for Windows 95,  you can move to something that really suits, that works well,  that doesn't require you use Internet Explorer 8 or Vista.  It's at Capterra, capterra.com slash twit.  And what I love is Capterra.  We've been kind of counting down over the last few months.  They're getting very close now to 1 million reviews.  They get about a thousand new reviews every single day.  Actual software users, they're very careful.  They vet the reviews.  So when you look for software in Capterra, here's dry cleaning.  Software to run a dry cleaning establishment.  First, you're going to find every program that does that.  You can then narrow it down by ratings, by how it works,  whether it's on premises or on your hard drive or in the cloud.  And how many, how many, does it handle bookkeeping?  What does it do?  Narrow it down, set up a comparison chart side by side,  and then read the reviews because the reviews are so valuable.  With 30,000 fresh reviews every month,  you know that there's going to be somebody who's reviewed Starchup.  Starchup, what a good name for dry cleaning software.  Starchup, and it is going to say, that's actually, look at that five star reviews.

Capterra believes software can make the world a better place  because it can help every organization  become a more efficient, effective version of itself.  Capterra is software selection simplified.  And if you need software for your business, capterra.com slash twit,  C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A, capterra.com slash twit.  Thank you, Capterra, for making a great site with really useful stuff.  And thank you for using that URL and letting them know you heard it here.  capterra.com slash twit, software selection, simplified.  Josh Hawley, Senator from...  Is he Idaho?  Where is Josh from?  Missouri.  Has finally presented a legislation that will rid Facebook, Google, and Twitter  of suspected political bias by stripping away the protections  all internet service providers have from the section 230  of the Communications Decency Act.  Section 230 says that internet publishers distribute...  Anything that distributes content supplied by users, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook,  is not liable for that content.  Hawley wants them to be liable because he thinks they're biased against conservatives.  That, by the way, is obviously a red herring.  But it's terrifying to think that 230 could be eliminated.  There are those, including the EFF, who say you eliminate section 230.  If you make platforms responsible for the content on those platforms,  you eliminate the internet.  Nobody's ever said Ma Bell should be responsible for the content of phone calls.  That would be impossible.  Section 230 says that internet providers,  online services, are like the phone company.  Hawley wants to change all that.  I don't think it has a chance, but it is being introduced in the Senate,  which means it has a decent chance of at least getting through the Senate.  Not a good idea.  And I think as much as we talk about how scary Facebook is and how...  What a dumpster fire Twitter has become.  Nobody wants 230 to be overturned.  Mike Masnick has a really good piece, as usual, on Tech Dirt.  Let me see if I can find that.  I bookmarked it.  I bookmarked it.  He says, once more with feeling,  there's no legal distinction between a platform and a publisher.  And I want to mention this because I have fallen prey to this notion that  Facebook, for instance, can't decide if it's a platform or a publisher.  A platform would not be responsible.  A publisher would like a magazine would.  Section 230 says that any online platform, any internet platform, is protected.  There's no need to distinguish between platform or publisher.  In fact, there is no special distinction for platforms.  It makes no difference, Masnick writes.  How an internet company refers to itself,  all that matters is they meet the legal definition of an interactive computer service,  which if they're online, the answer is generally yes, to be protected.  So I want to apologize for maybe causing more confusion about that than necessary.  There is no distinction.  They are protected by 230 and the assault has begun.  It's actually in Europe, I think.  Tell me, Nate, I can't...  This new European Intellectual Property Act did pass, right?  But each nation has to implement it.

Obviously, none of you care.  You're just blithely going along with your day.  How about this?  This is just going to add fuel to the fire.  The knitting site Ravelry announced just earlier today that they are going to ban...  Ravelry is a site my mom uses Ravelry where you can get knitting designs.  She, you know, you could share, you could say a forum where you can share, you know, knitting stories.  They're going to ban users that show Trump support because they say that's support for white supremacy.  We cannot...  Let's go to the site statement just to show it.  New policy.  Do not post in support of Trump or his administration.  We're banning support of Donald Trump and his administration on Ravelry.  Posts, projects, patterns, profiles.  No more Make America Great knitted hats.  We're not going to delete your project, but we could ban you.  We want to provide a space that's inclusive of all.  And we feel that that's not doing it.  What do you say?  This just is fuel to the Josh Hawley fire.

Start time: 3173.12
End time: 3247.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because this is such a...  Ravelry is a huge publisher of content, I guess.  I don't know.  It is funny how I feel like the conservative argument always is like, you know,  free speech, everyone's free to do what they want.  But like once, yeah, once a conservative voice is kind of squashed in a way,  or limited, like it's instantly censorship.  I don't know.  It just seems confusing.  This seems like a big step, though.  I'm surprised a knitting site of all places is the first to kind of make this leap,  because it's something people have been calling for on Twitter for a while.  I think I wonder if this is a response to like all the more recent reports of,  you know, the immigrant detention centers in Texas,  and the horrid conditions there, and the things kids have to live through.  You know, under this administration, like it's terrific.  It's not great.  I could, I think it's not that controversial to describe it as like a racist policy against  a certain group of people.  There was a whole hubbub last week around calling them concentration camps.  And what else would you call them?  I don't know.  But yeah, this seems like a controversial move,  but I want to see what happens after this, if other people follow suit.

Start time: 3249.83
End time: 3330.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they say in their statement, we cannot provide a space that it's inclusive of all,  and also allow support for open white supremacy.  And then they go on to note, we're not endorsing Democrats nor banning Republicans.  We're definitely not banning conservative politics, etc., etc.  But it seems to me that's not going to be understood that way.  I think this is, I'm personally, you know, on a very personal politics level in support of this  idea, and I'm all for it.  And of course, it's a private corporation, a private forum, so they can do this.  And I think that there's this whole intolerance idea that goes beyond this discussion.  But yeah, you don't have to tolerate intolerance.  That's not part of allowing for open exchange of ideas.  But even having said that, I guess what I'm getting back to is they're not going to convince  people who feel attacked by this decision that they're not banning conservative politics,  and they're not endorsing Democrats or banning Republicans.  So it's going to be tricky, I think, to get the nuance across here,  that it's really just about keeping that support of open white supremacy out of their platform.  They have every right to do this.

Start time: 3333.06
End time: 3345.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Who is the one who took things so far that you can't even negotiate or have a conversation  about what their beliefs are?  And I think for me personally, it is certainly the Trump administration  and kind of what they're doing to this country.  So yeah, it's hard to have a conversation with somebody who supports Trump and then,  yeah, I couldn't really consider them friends because of what they support, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think what I see happening or what I would see happening,  you asked if it happened on Twitter, if this kind of decision happened on Twitter.  I think you would see an awful lot of people who would conflate that decision  with an attack on conservative politics.  I think that's really unfortunate.  I think to your point that there's a lack of nuance and there's a lack of  willingness to see the differences of opinion and just kind of I assume that everything that  falls into one camp, so to speak, is all bad or all good.  It's way too lacking in nuance in the discussions that we're having.  It's a shame, but I think it's a really, really respectable effort on Ravelry's part to say  this is specifically that we don't want to allow support of an administration that is  support for white supremacy.  We want to call out that that's not about blankets, banning of conservative politics,  and so on.  It's just I don't really buy that that's how that's going to be received when it comes down to it.

What's amazing to me, and I guess you can't say it started with President Trump,  but it is certainly a big part of it is due to President Trump who has essentially used  Twitter as a way to make announcements, is that more and more companies, politicians,  people in general are using Twitter to make announcements.  It's become the place you announce this stuff, which is kind of shocking to me because I always  think of Twitter as a place you do offhanded stuff instead of making major presidential  proclamations.

Transcript:  I think the other angle to this is that Trump, as much as he likes to hate on a lot of media,  he knows the power of the media.  He knows media.  I think that the use of Twitter and the immediacy of Twitter gives him, he knows that he's going  to get straight into the papers, straight onto the websites and the blogs, unfiltered.  And that's kind of what he wants, I think.

Transcript:  Right now, I think our biggest threat is climate change.  We need to be thinking about a bunch of different dimensions of threat at the same time.  We need to be thinking about the threat of disintermediation of jobs from intelligent  automation over the next few decades.  What does that look like?  It's not the jobs that we have to worry about.  It's the economic consequences of that and the socioeconomic fallout.  And then what it means to our identities.  But even while that's happening, we've got climate catastrophe happening in the background.  There's this whole national, global kind of identity politics happening.  When I say identity politics, I mean on a national level.  Nations trying to figure out where they fit on this global ecosystem scale.  So I think there's just a lot that's happening all at once.  When we have the opportunity to use the exponential power of technology to help us solve an awful  lot of those problems, we could be using AI and other forms of emerging technology to  be addressing climate change issues in immediate ways if we were to put our resources that way.  If we were to put our priorities in line that way.  I think it just comes down to that.  To all of it.  To kind of getting some consensus in place and getting some resources aligned  that we're going to solve these problems.  We're going to use what tools we have and solve the problems.

Did we cover, I can't remember if we covered this last week.  I thought this was one of the best stories of the week.  Let's see.  This is the 23rd.  No, I think this happened on Monday.  The website Genius using some real genius.  So this is the Lyric site.  Used to be Rap Genius.  I love this site.  It's a great site.  They're not thrilled because Google now, if you search for lyrics,  will deliver the entire lyric in its search results, meaning you no longer have to go  to Rap Genius.  Okay, that's fine.  If maybe Google's getting it from the artist or they hired 30,000 people to write down  lyrics or maybe they even licensed it from the publishing company.  But Rap Genius thought, I don't know where they're getting these lyrics.  So what if we did something kind of funny?  We used straight quotes and smart quotes in combination, in a unique combination.  In fact, I'll show you the video.  This is an Alicia Kara song.  And in the lyrics of Alicia Kara's song, Not Today, they put a combination of straight  quotes and smart quotes that if you just take the smart quotes.  Okay, now that was Rap Genius.  Now they're showing the Google results.  Interesting, exactly the same pattern.  If you take the straight quotes and smart quotes and say the straight quotes are dots  and the smart quotes are dashes, it spells out red handed in Morse code.

Start time: 4185.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what a little bit bothers me because this conflates the two.  Because two or three lines from an article with a link back to the article, that's  snippets, drives traffic more than it would kill traffic.  It's not stealing the content of the article.  On the other hand, if in the search results, if you search for Alicia Cara lyrics, and  let's what was the name of the song again?  I have to search for the song so that I can get the actual result.  But if you search for Alicia Cara, not today lyrics, you'll get the whole lyric.  Let me do it here just to just to prove this.  Not today lyric.  You won't get a link to Rap Genius.  You'll in the search results, not get a snippet.  But you'll get the whole thing, thereby bypassing entirely traffic.  Now, the second link, by the way, is to Genius.  And Google has incidentally run a grep script now to remove all smart quotes from all search  results.  I bet you Google's not the only one.  This is a technique the map makers of old used to do.  They put fake streets in and stuff because Rand McNally was sure that Thomas Guides was  stealing their maps.  So they put in little Easter eggs.  And if the Easter eggs showed up in the other guy's map, they'd say, gotcha, red handed.

Transcript:  Somebody once did this with a EULA many, many years ago as a way of showing that nobody  actually reads a EULA.  And it was some PC repair site in the US, I think, and said, halfway down the EULA,  if you're reading this and you've actually got this far down in the EULA, then call this  number or something and you'll get a thousand dollars or something like that.  And someone did it.  Someone did it.

Start time: 4290.63
End time: 4330.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.  But if you copied and pasted that EULA, you were deeply regretful later on.  So Google, in their defense, says, well, we didn't do it.  We hired somebody called Lyric Find.  They did it.  Which is very much like Facebook saying, we're not responsible for those contractors.  They did it.  Lyric Find is also disputing the allegations.  They say, we have a whole content team devoted to compiling song lyrics from numerous sources,  which can include them getting directly from the artist, the songwriter, as well as other websites.  Well, maybe they aren't denying it.

Start time: 4332.08
End time: 4343.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they said they offered to remove lyrics that Genius said were stolen,  but Genius didn't respond.  And then they said, despite that, our team is currently investigating the content in our database  and removing any lyrics that seem to have originated from Genius.

Transcript:  You know that little paintbrush and word, just use that from now on.  Oh, that's hysterical.  Paste and match style.  There's the fix.  All this time we thought we had to pay somebody.  It's a silly story because, I mean, it's just a he said, she said.  By the way, Tom Petty, or the publisher of Tom Petty's music,  Wixen, they also publish Rage Against the Machine and Weezer's music,  is suing Pandora for using lyrics without any license.  Pandora shows lyrics behind beneath the songs on some mobile and desktop apps.  It's done that for 10 years using a Lyric Finder, by the way, for the rights.  It's all going to come down to Lyric Finder anyway.  Wixen had sued Spotify over the same thing.  This comes at a time that Apple has announced that they're going to start showing lyrics on Apple TV  when you listen to music on Apple TV and Apple Music.  But I bet you Apple is probably licensing it.  I would be my guess.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Atlassian.  Actually, our show today brought to you by our IT team.  If you are in business these days, you know you owe it all to the IT team.  Atlassian is a collaboration software company that powers IT teams all over the world.  IT in a cloud environment, in the cloud world we live in, is at the center of everything.  They have to plan and execute better and faster than ever.  Today's apps are more complex than ever.  Incidents require open, agile, and smart coordination between operations  and your software developers.  Expectations are high.  The stakes are high.  You got to perform.  You cannot fall short inside of business critical workflow.  That's why we use Atlassian tools.  Jira, for instance.  That's how we keep track of who's doing what, what projects they're working on,  the status of the projects.  I think a lot of people know Jira, but think of it as a tool for agile development teams.  Yeah, it's that, but it's so much more.  We also use Confluence to document everything that happens.  To me, that's almost the most important part.  If you're doing something, you got to document so that people who follow after know what you did,  know how to replicate the solution, that kind of thing.  Atlassian is great because you don't have to ever leave the tools to get the job done.  That's why I think our team likes it.  It's not just for developers.  Atlassian offers an affordable, reliable suite of tools for teams of all kinds and all sizes,  from DevOps to agile, from IT apps to ops to ITSM to whatever's next for your team.  If you've got code, you need Bitbucket.  Atlassian forms a backbone of effective cross-team project planning, organization,  and communication.  If you've got ops, this is something, you know, back in the day, we could have used this,  Ops Genie and Status Page.  Not only so you can detect incidents, but so you can coordinate your response efforts.  Most importantly, again, communicate with customers, stakeholders, the boss,  about what's being done and how it's happening.  It all integrates seamlessly, so you never have to leave the platform.  Our team loves Atlassian.  You will too.  The tools for your IT team are easy and free to try.  Head to Atlassian.com.  And find out which Atlassian offering is right for your team.

So some person who doesn't work for CNET.  Anyway, I am now following Kate O on the Twitter.  Apple.  We haven't talked about Apple yet.  There's a couple of things on Apple.  Not a whole lot.  Apple's recalling a number of 15-inch MacBook Pros from the year 2015 over FireRisk.  These are the MacBook Pros everybody still uses.  The ones before the bad keyboard and the touch bar.  Sure.

Start time: 5091.72
End time: 5093.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5093.98
End time: 5176.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  FireRisk.  Yeah.  We don't want to.  But we have a ton of these.  That's all I would use for a long time.  Apparently, the batteries.  Actually, this is kudos to Apple.  You get a brand new battery for your five-year-old laptop.  Four-year-old laptop.  Laptops sold between September 2015 and February 2017.  There is a little tool on the Apple recall site.  You can enter your serial number and find out.  I was kind of hoping initially they'd just give me a new one,  but apparently there are no new ones.  So, you just get a new battery.  That's not much of a story.  Let's see.  Apple says if we had to, we could make our phones outside of China.  If we had to, they're right now exploring a shift of anywhere from 15% to 30% of its capacity  to somewhere else in Southeast Asia.  This is according to a report from Nikkei Asia Review.  A fundamental restructuring of Apple's supply chain.  This has to do, of course, with tariffs.  But also, I think some concern over products made in China, right?  After the Huawei.  Dvinder, what's the status with the Huawei ban?  Are we still…

Start time: 5176.16
End time: 5187.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't fully checked in on it, but it does seem like it's an ongoing thing.  Huawei is pretending they haven't done anything wrong,  and they're kind of standing firm there, and things are getting worse.

Start time: 5187.68
End time: 5192.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Washington is pretending they have.  We don't have evidence on either side, to be honest with you.

Start time: 5193.04
End time: 5222.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle.  I think there is some valid suspicion around any of the companies that are directly tied  to the Chinese government.  I'm surprised Apple is making this move now, I guess just when tariffs are a potential thing,  or around the trade war, and not the behavior of the Chinese government and what they're doing  with some of their population as well.  There's a lot of things to be concerned about with what China is doing right now, too.

Start time: 5223.36
End time: 5228.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5230.20
End time: 5261.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did look when this story surfaced, I was looking up what the latest information is about what it  would cost Apple if they were to make the iPhone, for example, in the US, which isn't on the table,  but just out of sheer speculation.  And the latest that I saw was if they got the raw materials for about $600  and could manufacture, the cost of the manufacturer wouldn't significantly go up,  but the overall price they speculate would come to around $2,000 at retail.

Start time: 5264.92
End time: 5266.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, that's a non-starter.

Start time: 5267.34
End time: 5300.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the key issue they're saying is not so much the cost of the materials, it's that if you've  ever seen the way that Chinese factories have really, or the process has come to sophistication  in China, we're not set up for that. We would be looking at an entirely new set of skills,  an entirely new set of competencies for manufacturing facilities here that we don't have.  And it's going to happen, Foxconn is setting up a facility in, what is it, Wisconsin?  Well, maybe.

Start time: 5316.62
End time: 5334.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's crazy. I think everybody's just hoping the trade war will blow over and we can go back to  business as usual. We are so interdependent on one another, not just the US and China,  but everybody in the world to say, oh, this part of the world, you can't make stuff for us.  It's just impossible. I think it's just impossible.

A lot of the technology that they're using is Huawei, but they don't know whether they're  going to have to just rip all that out and replace it with something else.  We've got no clarity even on when a decision about it is going to be made, thanks to our  super organized government right now.  What is going on over there?  Find a way.

Transcript:  Maybe Ellen could do a good job. She'd have a button she could push that the  member of parliament would just disappear.  Poor, I feel so bad for Matthew Miller of ZDNF. Great guy. We had him on the Tech News Weekly  on Thursday talking about this. He woke up a week ago, 1130 at night. His oldest daughter shook  his shoulder to wake him up from a deep sleep. She says, Daddy, daddy, your Twitter account has  been hacked. He writes, it turns out it was much worse than that. He had an alert on his phone  saying the SIM card for your number has been changed. If this change is not authorized,  call 611. Well, he writes, seeing as how T-Mobile took away my cell service, I couldn't call 611,  so that was worthless. He had a Google Fi SIM and he called T-Mobile and they said, yeah,  somebody called, you called, you called and said, change my SIM.  The you that called was not him. It was of course a hacker. The representative said, well,  we can't really tell who's who over the phone. So as long as some key information is provided,  we can authorize a swap. So they authorized the swap. Now without his password, without Matthew's  Google password, the bad guys were able to take over Google, his Gmail, Twitter. And then once having  taken over Gmail, they were able to reset his accounts. They got into his bank account, bought  $25,000 worth of Bitcoin. It was a nightmare. I think he's pretty much dug out now, but imagine,  and the most notable point on this is do not, do not, do not rely on SMS for authentication.  And if you're forced to, as many of us are, my bank will only take SMS, make sure that you  call your carrier and some will allow a PIN number, T-Mobile will,  and set that up so that somebody without the PIN number cannot do this.

I don't know what the security question  was, but clearly it wasn't very secure. Wow. Good advice to everybody, actually in his ZDNet column  on how to lock down your accounts. Certainly put a PIN number. I use Google Fi and Google  Fi automatically does actually a very, you'd expect Google to get this right. And they did  the very secure PIN number that's changed every time you log into your Google account.  Terrifying. By the way, at the end he says, if anyone has tips on how I can get my Google  and Twitter accounts back, I'd appreciate it. So I guess he's still, he's still out of luck.

Transcript:  I have a YubiKey on my keychain. Carry with me at all times.  Everything that I can, I have on that YubiKey. And if you can, and Google will allow you to turn  this off, Twitter will not. Turn off SMS. Twitter still has SMS authentication as a fallback and  always has it. There's nothing you can do about it. You can say, I want to use a YubiKey, but  they'll still use SMS if you say, oh, I can't find my YubiKey. I hope this is an example that  maybe some of these companies pay attention to. Oh, I was doing Apple stuff. I'm sorry. Let's see.  It's not that much to say. Best Buy is now going to be an authorized Apple repair.  1000 plus Best Buy stores across the nation. Apple certified repairs. This is something Apple  started doing. It's funny, for a long time there were Apple VARs and resellers and Apple  authorized repair centers. And then eventually once Apple opened the retail stores, they kind  of closed all these down. They disappeared. And it was a real loss, I thought, because Apple,  for a lot of reasons, it's nice to have a shade tree mechanic. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like this story though, because I like the idea of an ecosystem play.  I liked when I was at Adobe Summit in March and heard Hubert Jolly, who was then the CEO  at Best Buy, talking about this total tech support package they had rolled out. It's a $200  program a year that they will support all the tech, all the gadgets in your home, even if they  didn't sell it to you. That's a pretty interesting play, I thought, to offer into a subscription  household tech support service. It's neat to think of them figuring out a way to partner with Apple  on this and kind of entrench that further, offer value back to Apple buyers, offer value back to  Best Buy. It seems like a pretty smart way to add value across that whole ecosystem.

Start time: 5923.70
End time: 5944.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I think the only problem is that people historically have not really trusted  Best Buy's technicians. That's the Geek Squad, right?  That's the Geek Squad. So there's good and bad. And I've heard a lot of bad stories, a lot of  new things about them upselling unnecessary gear. But there are very good Geek Squad people too.

Transcript:  That's the problem. It's hit or miss. You might get somebody great. You might not. I agree with  you though. We desperately need something like this, Kate, because I was a half an hour late  to the show because I spent an extra half hour after the radio show helping an 80-year-old woman  who had a Macintosh that was loaded with malware, adware, all sorts of stuff. And there was nowhere  she could go. Where are you going to go for something like that? Yeah. It seems really

Transcript:  encouraging. The example that Huber Jolly gave at Adobe Summit was you deal with something like  trying to watch a show on Netflix and maybe you're dealing with the Netflix service itself on top of  a Roku, on top of your internet service provider, on top of whatever. There's so many layers of  complexity that the average household is set up with. And that's not even taking into account  all of the internet of things, kind of smart home automation stuff. So there's just a ton of  complexity that people are adding into their households and without anyone who necessarily

End time: 6035.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  has the expertise to troubleshoot all this stuff. Yeah. I mean, that's a holistic, it would be nice  to take a holistic approach. Of course, Apple's response to this is, well, it would all be fine  if you just only buy Apple stuff, right? And you need an Apple TV. What's this Roku? You need an  Apple TV. You need an app. Oh, but you don't make a router. Hmm. You need, but if you just bought all  Apple stuff, then you'd know who to call, but that's not practical. The Best Buy thing, I'm

Start time: 6035.96
End time: 6051.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  surprised too that it's taken so long for even them to do this because they've had Geek Squad for so  long. An all-inclusive annual package would just kind of make sense. I think there was a tech  support startup that somebody, I forget who it was. Oh, there are quite a few. But somebody who would

Transcript:  just send a person to your house. Yeah. In fact, we had them as an advertiser early on. I want to  Geeks on Call or something like that. I can't remember the name, but yeah, there've been a few  attempts at this. It seems to be a low margin business. And the real problem is training.  And this is where I would hope Apple would come to the Best Buy Geek Squad folks or bring them to  Cupertino or something and really give them some training. Apple used to do really good training  with its geniuses. I think they've slowed down on that. My experience with, has been that the  Apple geniuses are not as genius as they used to be. They're Apple subgeniuses. But I think  that's an opportunity. The problem is that somebody who's that smart and that good can make a lot more

Start time: 6100.02
End time: 6150.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  money than they can at the Geek Squad. Yeah. Well, then they can at the genius bar too, probably.  It just says in this story that I read about this that there's now, because of this, there's  Apple certified repairs courtesy of 7,600 newly Apple certified technicians. So that's a wonderful  volume to add into the landscape. So it has been frustrating to be in this gap between where  genius bars existed and where you can now get some kind of support at maybe Best Buy.  But yeah, there does seem to need to be some kind of service offering out there. And I think this  idea from Best Buy is a solid one. I look forward to seeing how it plays out for them.

I see him from time to time.  I'm curious, David, if you're listening, I'd love to know how you get good quality  people. I mean, they've been doing this since 95 and a very good reputation. But it must be  difficult to get and retain good technicians. I don't know. I don't know. It's an expensive thing.  That's why I remember Dell used to have this great tech support. Really great. I remember going down  to Austin to visit the call center and these guys were super smart, but it was not cost effective.  I don't know what the answer is to that, but clearly we need it.

I'm starting to, I'm going to let leave you guys to tell me if I'm starting  to think like the Washington Post has it out for technology companies. They did a piece, I thought  it was a good piece, maybe a little slanted about the iPhone and how he left it overnight. Was it  Jeffrey Fowler left it overnight and then contacted 5,000 different sites. They didn't mention he put  a lot of different apps on it and so forth. Now he's doing a privacy experiment with Google's  Chrome. 11,000, now he calls them tracker cookies in a single week and Firefox was glad to talk  about this because he says Firefox does not and is better. But is, so what do you think, Nate? Is  this a little, is a little slanted against Chrome? I mean, cookies are not the end of the world  despite what you might think if you go wandering around the web these days. Well, I don't know what

Start time: 6538.28
End time: 6593.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  his methodology was, but it wouldn't surprise me to be perfectly honest. Like a lot of the problem  is these things, you know, it's these background, background processes that we generally always  turn them on and leave them on. But what we don't do is monitor what they're doing in the background  overnight. I think that was part of his point. I mean, on Apple, I would, I would be, I was a little  more surprised at the numbers because Apple tends to be a little more conservative over what apps  are allowed to do what in the background with Google, though. I always think, why is anybody  surprised? You know, it's a most of Google's products don't cost you anything. I mean, I'm  excluding obviously like phones in the Google home, but I mean, in terms of its web, its web  products, you're not paying for them really. So 11,000, I don't know, it doesn't sound like a massive  number to me. I mean, rather, it doesn't sound like a surprising number. Yeah, it's credible. Yeah.

Start time: 6593.44
End time: 6618.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So he calls them tracker cookies. He said they would be auto, they're automatically blocked  by Firefox, but cookies by themselves are not a bad thing. It's how a website knows you're you.  When you go back to the website, there's a lot of cookies that you want, I think try, and if you  don't believe me, go into Google, go into Chrome and turn off cookies. You can, you can do that in  any browser. Say, I don't want you to save any cookies and see what your web experience is like

Start time: 6618.24
End time: 6691.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's not fun. But you don't have that sign in data for like the sites, the handful of sites you  actually use, but that's, it's not going to be 11,000. Right. I think what, what Jeff is doing  is kind of interesting because it kind of goes to like, um, we're talking, we complain now about  Chrome being a memory hog, about being all these sorts of things. When it first came out, it was  the fast competitor to even Firefox and to an Explorer now become the dominant browser. Yeah.  What is weighing Chrome down? Uh, cookies don't take up much disk space. They don't really  hinder your system that much, but this is another, this is another sign of bloat that kind of worries  me. Um, and another reason why we should probably take a closer look at Firefox. Um, but even like  Microsoft with their next edge, they're also going to be, uh, blocking certain types of cookies. They  have a really understandable security system that they're going to be producing with that browser.  And I think that's going to be an important thing moving forward because people are caring  more about privacy now. So this seems useful. This is not just like antique Google. I think this is,  it's kind of a wake up call to like, you know, all of us who have been using Chrome for so long,  to remind us of the cost of using Chrome basically. And maybe, maybe there's a reason to

Start time: 6691.42
End time: 6814.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  use another browser, really consider one. He said, uh, I watched Etna and weirdly the federal student  aid website set cookies for Facebook and Google. In other words, they told Facebook and Google  that, that he was on the insurance site or the loan services login page. So I don't know if that's  an oversight from Etna and the FSA site, or if it's a convenience because they use Google sign on  and Facebook sign on, it's not completely clear. He sounds like the whole problem. Maybe it is  pixel tracking. And he points out that Google did change their policy, uh, that you're, as soon as  you use Gmail at any time, you're automatically now logged into Google constantly. Whenever you  use Chrome, you're, you're, you're in Google. So Google does know where you're going at this point.  Um, I, I, yeah, I want to know more about the methodology. Cookies are part of the internet,  the modern internet and not a bad thing. Tracking cookies. Maybe I, I've been using brave of late.  I don't know. Do you guys familiar with brave? Do you, do you know it? Do you like it?  I've never really looked at that. Yeah. Yeah. Brave is a privacy based version of Chromium.  So it's Chrome, but for instance, they have settings in the brave browser to turn off all  that single sign on stuff from LinkedIn, Facebook, Google, and Twitter. Uh, and that means no tracking  information will be sent back to those sites because you don't even have to be using it to,  cause that that's going to ping those sites every time you go there. Um, you know, brave,  brave seems to do a pretty good job. There are other privacy focused browsers like Vivaldi,  opera, both of which are based on Chromium and Microsoft's doing its version of edge based on  Chromium. And I think Microsoft's also saying, yeah, we're not going to do all that stuff that  that Google's doing right now. I, I am not a fan of Firefox. I just can't, it's just an aesthetic  thing to me. But maybe, maybe what do you use? Kate? I switched to Firefox. Uh, you know,

Start time: 6814.64
End time: 6923.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been back and forth over the years to different browsers. And in this last year,  I saw, um, a woman who was one of the leaders at Firefox speaking about security and data privacy  and she sold me. So, uh, I switched and it is an aesthetic difference. You're right. It does kind  of change the way things are rounded and the default fonts and, you know, everything is just  a little different. Um, but I think, you know, it is important to your point that we understand  that cookies themselves are not the bad, you know, they're not the evil that were, that sounds like  we're talking about here. Cookies are an important part of personalizing content and making it  convenient and easy for all of us to do what we do in the contemporary usage of the web. But I  remember, you know, about a dozen years ago, whenever you would sign up to, whenever you were  doing something that required a new tool or a new, um, like you were adding some functionality to a  website, it was always like, Oh, it's just one line of JavaScript that you add to the checkout  page or something like that. Like one line of JavaScript. It's like one cookie. And after you  do this for a number of years, you've got another line of JavaScript and another cookie. And it's  just, we've accumulated a lot of this craft. So I think it's a good, it's a good awareness campaign  to, to bring our attention to it. We're all being tracked all the time. There's so much of a data  trail that we're all generating and everything that we do. It's good to be aware of that.  And at the same time, you know, I don't think it's good to panic about that. I also think  all you got to do is, is go to Europe and use a browser. Nate knows like the moment you try to  hit any website, you're being prompted. Do you accept these cookies? It's the whole GDPR  implementation is a real user experience, like nuisance. And that's a failure. It's not ideal.

Start time: 6923.28
End time: 6936.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's clearly a failure because it's becomes then it becomes background noise. Every site uses  cookies. Every site warns you. They use cookies. The first thing you do when you go to a new site  is you click that banner, which is an annoying extra click and it solves nothing.

Start time: 6937.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's not. I mean, we've got to the point now, honestly, where  ads are the least annoying things on the web in Europe. I would, I would take, I would take  pop-ups any day over what we have to put up with in Europe. I don't trust any web browser either.  I mean, I use, I use Safari because I trust Apple slightly more than I trust any of the others. I  don't use any Google products whatsoever. Really? Yeah. The only one I use is Google search. I use  Google search in a, in a private window, but that's the only one I don't use anything else.  All right. Because I don't trust them. I think, I think more people should be massively distrustful  of a lot of these companies, to be honest. So anything that raises awareness is good.

Transcript:  One thing I will agree, I think the problem with Jeffrey's article is written for a general  audience. And so it doesn't tell me the specifics that I'd like to know. It sounds like, I don't  know if all 11,000 of those tracking cookies, so-called tracking cookies were third party  cookies. The third party cookies are a problem. And that's the case when Aetna is setting a  cookie for Facebook, a third party. And every browser except Chrome lets you turn that off.  No brow. In fact, most browsers default is block third party cookies. Don't allow a site that you're  visiting to set a cookie for another site like Facebook when you're visiting it. And that's really  most of the tracking. So I, I don't know if Jeffrey's saying, yeah, I had 11,000 third party  cookies set. If that's the case, that's appalling. And I guess I should do my own research, but,  but in every browser, including Safari, Firefox, Edge, everything, but Chrome, as far as I could  tell, you can block third party cookies. And in most cases that's default and should be default.

Transcript:  Cause that's the one that's the tracking cookie. There's even a tweet and I, I tweeted it. I  retweeted it most recently on my account, but there's a tweet from the pin board account,  which, oh, this is such a good article. Go ahead. Yeah. So he points out that the Washington,  well, it's not the article that, that I think you're about to reference, but he points out  that this Washington Post article about the web Google's web browser contains itself. Oh yeah.  A bunch of, of, uh, ad cruft and, and including from the Washington Post and it doesn't contain  disclosure, which he goes on through a nice tweet thread to sort of pack, unpack that and,  and what that really means. But I think that the overall kind of gist of, of this from,  from the big picture perspective is you can't cause panic about this. It's not, it's not a,  a crisis when cookies are set, but if we're going to talk about  cruft and you know, a bunch of junk being set in browsers, then we have to be really candid about  where these are being set, what they're being set for. And I think you're right, Leo, that,  you know, we got to understand the difference between first and third party cookies. We got  to understand why we got to understand what they're accomplishing for us. And, and none of,  none of this is happening in this article or in the GDPR or in anything that's happening.

Transcript:  And when I see, when I see at the beginning of the article, a video of some guy walking down  the street being followed by cookies, I guess, I feel like that's a little sensationalistic. Yes,  the Washington Post is setting cookies too. And in fact, in his previous article about his iPhone  phoning home, he does mention it in the article. Among those apps was Washington Post own app that  did in fact do exactly the same thing. So yeah, I don't know. I don't, yeah, use Firefox if you  feel better about Firefox. I like Brave. I use Brave for the most part on the Mac. I use Safari  because I feel like it. Do you think, do you guys think that Apple is now becoming the de facto  protector of privacy for some people? Like do people trust, what do you think? Do you think

Transcript:  Apple is the trustworthy company in this? I look at it the other way around. I look at who is the  least untrustworthy. Good. And I have, that's very British of you. Yeah. Well, so let me, let me walk  back slightly on this because maybe two years ago I did an audit of all my data, partly out of  privacy concerns, partly out of pure economics. And I had, I had subscriptions I was paying for,  for Google Drive, for Dropbox, for iCloud, for Evernote, for pocket, for like loads and loads  of things. And I thought, well, a lot of this, probably like 90% of this I'm getting from,  from Apple's own apps and iCloud and I can unify there. And that includes email, that includes,  you know, maps and a bunch of other stuff, storage. And I sort of thought, well, if I'm going to give,  I don't want any large company having all of my data. But if I'm going to let any one company have  all my data, I'd rather it be a company that doesn't technically need it. Apple's, Apple wants me  locked into its ecosystem for another whole load of reasons, which is to make sure I keep buying  iMacs and iPhones and iPads and stuff. But it doesn't need it to sell that data, or rather to  use that data to sell me other things or to market to me or things like that. So look at the  business model then. I always look at the business model. It's why I was, you know,  in the very beginning of the show today, I was talking about Facebook, like the fundamental of  that of using cryptocurrency isn't what bothers me. It's taking a step back and asking, why did  this idea come up in the first place? What isn't it doing that it wants to do that this helps it do?  And I think the same is true when it comes to who has your data and who you trust. And I think that  I'd rather it be a company that just wants to sell me products and rather than,

Transcript:  you know, use my data for something else. I think that's a good litmus test. What do they make their  money on? And if they make their money on advertising, and in particular, if their  advertising is based on what they know about you, then just consider that they're going to collect  that information. That's their business model. Apple has another business model, which may also  involve exploiting you and extracting money from you. But who doesn't? I mean, that's my job too,  right? How can I get more money out of you, the listener? I think about that at night, all night  long. How can I extract more money? But first, a word with Wasabi, hot cloud storage. What a great  name. Wasabi is that hot stuff you have with your sushi. This is the hot cloud storage, which is  about the hottest topic in the world today is moving to the cloud by 2025. In six years,  80% of enterprises will have literally shut down their traditional data centers. It's 10% right now  moving to the cloud for cost savings, operational efficiencies, a transformative way of scaling  your business. By then it's estimated there will be 163 zettabytes in the cloud. That's 21 zeros,  163 zettabytes in the cloud. But it's important when you put stuff in the cloud,  I know this is a concern for anybody looking at cloud, that your data be safe, that it be secure.  And I've got something that is actually arguably more secure than your own on-premises. I know it  is. Wasabi was started by these two guys, Jeff Flowers and David Friend, good friends of mine.  I've known David for years. They figured out and patented a revolutionary way of writing data on  disks sequentially, not in blocks, which made it more efficient and faster. That's what Wasabi is  based on. This is enterprise-grade cloud storage that with this patented technology is 80% cheaper  than Amazon S3, 80% less expensive and up to six times faster and as secure as you can get, 11 nines  of durability. It's really remarkable. I'll tell you, there's some of the things that they do that  mean you will not be like that Florida city that just paid $600,000 in ransomware fees  because you can designate some data as immutable. It can't be changed by ransomware or fungible  fingered employees or anything. Immutable. That's brilliant. There's no charge for egress,  no charge for API access. It uses the S3 API, so you already know how to use it.  HIPAA FINRA CJIS compliant. Look, I know the boss has sent you off to research cloud storage  solutions and you're going to, of course you're going to come back with the big three names.  You're going to have Amazon and Microsoft and Google on there. I just want you to add a fourth  name, Wasabi. Try it yourself. W-A-S-A-B-I.com. Click the free trial link, offer code TWIT,  unlimited storage for a month so you can slam stuff up there. They also have, if you want to  migrate a ton of data, you can migrate up to a petabyte of time with the Wasabi ball, which is  so cool. This is the solution you've been looking for. 80% more affordable, six times faster,  11 nines of durability, no charge for API access, no charge for egress.  You just got to try it. Wasabi, W-A-S-A-B-I.com. Oh, don't forget the offer code TWIT for unlimited  storage. Wasabi, W-A-S-A-B-I.com. Macha, I hope I know I'm pronouncing his name completely wrong,  even though he has an entire website devoted to how to pronounce his name. Macha Kicilewski,  he created Pinboard, which I use religiously, and he's become actually a great blogger. His  Idle Words blog talks this week about what he calls the new wilderness. He's talking about a  kind of privacy we don't really think about. He calls it ambient privacy, that there is a value  in having our everyday interactions with one another remain outside the reach of monitoring,  and that the small details of our daily lives should pass by unremembered. Not every conversation  needs to be a deposition. He's pointing out that in this modern world, it's not the case  that every single thing you do is being tracked and recorded.  I think, Kate, you must have done your homework for this show and read that article, it sounds like.  Yeah.  I'm impressed. These guys have been around a while, they don't read anything we talk about.

You'll have to read the  piece, it's a very good piece, to understand why he links the two.  But I think that is a pre-, he says, and I agree with this, a shared sense of reality. An agreement  on common facts is a prerequisite for self-government. And that is something, for whatever reason,  this goes back to Ravelry and Twitter, for whatever reason, that seems to be the case,  that we no longer have a shared sense of reality, that we're living in our own fractured worlds.  A really good piece from Maché.

Start time: 7628.94
End time: 7690.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a really good piece. I think there's a really important piece of this where  the idea of moving through the world, he does this, draws this parallel with nature and  regulation and regulating natural spaces. And I think that parallel is more than just  an analogy that he uses here. I think there's a really important meaningful dimension that  can seep through that. There's something about moving through the world and experiencing the  world as a place, as a series of places, and what that means that I think is a really important  part of understanding fundamental human nature, our embodied experience of the world. I wrote  about it in my last book, Pixels in Place. There's so much that we experience about our embodied  surroundings in physical space. And it's a really important parallel that he draws there.  And I think I would just add to the encouragement that people read this piece because it's very,  very well thought out.

Start time: 7691.26
End time: 7727.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Idolwords.com. And there's another hopeful thing about that analogy because he says we were able  to preserve our public spaces and our environment with regulation, that it is possible to regulate  and that regulation can make a big difference as it has in the air in London, for instance,  as it has with the ozone layer. And I think that's important. It's conceivable that there can be  regulations that can make this a better place, that we shouldn't turn our back on the notion  that maybe it is possible to fix this with regulation.

End time: 7791.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, as much as we rag on GDPR, it's not the best solution.  It's a start.  It's certainly a start towards regulating privacy in a way. But it's also like this article,  the idea of ambient privacy, I guess, it reminds me of just hanging out with friends and family  now and how a lot of people just can't even take in their experiences without recording them or  documenting them in some way. And I think that for me is the thing that I kind of lose.  I am sad that we've come to this point as a society where we definitely want to Instagram  or Snapchat our meals. Doing it quickly is one thing, but I know a lot of people who will spend  several minutes before they even start eating to make sure they have the right lighting,  the right perfect pose for it. And that to me seems deeply sad. We have forgotten just how to  eat because we have to document it before we eat. But that's true of any vacation spot or anything,  too. I see so many people rather than absorb their surroundings or what they're looking at,  working hard just to take photos, take videos, and maybe missing out on the experience.

Start time: 7793.06
End time: 7853.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And you know what's really funny about that, too, is it's a really good point,  the distinction you make between just capturing it quickly as a photo of your food versus  staging the lighting and making sure it's all perfectly plated and all that.  I came across research, it was actually Four Pixels in Place, that talked about the difference  between the way we experience things like our meals when we take photos of them or say a concert  that we may capture with photos or video. I think people tend to rail against that and think that  we're missing out on being present in the experience. But it turns out there's some  studies that suggest that we actually remember those experiences more by choosing to frame them  in some sort of digital capture like that. So there's a really interesting nuance of human  experience that comes across that it's like a new modality of how we experience the world.  But I think to your point, you can certainly go too far.  Let's just eat, folks. Please.

If you see me on the street, Devendra and I walk right by that's because I don't have my glasses on.  Yes. My special glasses.  Philips lighting group is now called Signify, by the way, because Philips is too easy to remember.  Signify makes Hue brand lights and they've announced a new kind of lights called TrueLiFi.  Transmit data using light waves at the speeds of up to 150 megabits. Now, of course, you don't  have LiFi on your laptop, so you'd have to get a special LiFi plug-in.  And if you're transmitting from place to place, from LiFi to LiFi, 250 megabits.  This is not the first time we've heard of it. Devendra, you probably saw the demos at CES a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  laptop? I'm presenting here. You can retrofit it into existing Philips Hue lights. They have a  little retrofit or you can buy new light bulbs. I don't know what the cost is. It's got to be expensive.  But one of the markets for this is places where you can't have radio frequency. Like,  there's no Wi-Fi in a lot of hospitals, right? Because it can interfere with pacemakers and  stuff. So Wi-Fi might be the solution there. So I thought we started with a weird light bulb story,  maybe an alternative. And I do have to mention that town in Florida that has decided, the city  council voted, this is a little town called Riviera Beach. They've been shut down, just like Baltimore  was a couple of weeks ago, by ransomware. They've decided to pay the ransom, $600,000. This is a town  of 35,000 people. And they said, we asked security experts, they said we should just pay.  Yeah. That doesn't seem like a good idea.

I think around when the WannaCry stuff was happening, it kind of revealed, oh man,  all these organizations, hospitals in the UK, right? Were not fully updated and then had to  deal with all these issues. So yeah, it stinks. I'm not a fan of paying the people keeping your  data hostage, but I don't know what else people need to do. Again, we could say the R word,  it's regulation. You got to regulate better updates and better IT support. I don't know.

Transcript:  Certainly for cities. Baltimore, ironically, the Baltimore ransom guy only wanted $76,000.  But to their credit, Baltimore did not pay. The FBI always says do not pay  because there's no guarantee you're going to get your money back. We were talking in security now  about a ransomware as a service company. And by the way, we should point out that a lot of these  ransomware is not coming from accomplished hackers. They're just using existing ransomware  platforms. This company is retiring. They're retiring because what was the name of the company?  I'm going to try to remember because they made $2 billion in a couple of years. And so they said,  well, I think we're going to stop. We never got caught. Does anybody ever get caught for ransomware?  There's occasional arrests, but it doesn't seem like it seems like this is a low risk crime.
