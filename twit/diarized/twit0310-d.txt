And I didn't know how to find this guy  because I wanted to kind of check with him. Is it OK if I run your letter from 1975?  Never could find him. He emailed me on Tuesday and said, wow, Bites back.  Thanks for using my letter. You can use everything I wrote.  That's so cool.  What's his name?  Carl Helmers.  Oh, yeah. Carl Helmers.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Speaking of, speaking of the wow, sounds like Carmageddon is happening somewhere in there.  Speaking of music and the Beatles, Spotify launched this week  in the U.S. Any Spotify users? I got my invite. Any of you using it? Jenny,  Denise, what do you think, Jenny? How do you like Spotify?

Start time: 317.88
End time: 324.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm digging it, by the way. Sorry. That's probably me. There are copters and planes overhead.  Carmageddon is still underway here in Los Angeles.

Start time: 324.76
End time: 333.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I was preempted. The Los Angeles radio station that I'm on preempted me yesterday  for wall to wall coverage of nothing. Right. Nothing happened.

Start time: 333.90
End time: 351.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think one of our friends on Boing Boing made it up there to the 405 with a police escort  and sent back a bunch of pictures. He just basically described walking along a completely  empty, huge freeway and said, this is like the most boring, dull thing I've ever been this excited

Start time: 352.36
End time: 362.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about. Freeway ramp with cops. I have my whole life, though, had a fantasy of of them shutting  down freeways and getting to bicycle on freeways because they're so smooth and nice.

Start time: 363.06
End time: 373.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I heard of people scooting up there with skateboards and bikes illicitly, and I'm afraid I  didn't have the cojones to do that. They would arrest you if you did. That's kind of how it works.

Start time: 374.84
End time: 377.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. It is Southern California, Leo. We love our skateboarders.

Start time: 377.82
End time: 426.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I love I love I love Jenny's Carmel Giddin posting. That's so much more fun. I wish it were  Carmel Giddin. So we should explain for those those tiny percentage of the audience who is not  plugged into Los Angeles news. Los Angeles has become the New York of the media world now.  Everything if it happens in Los Angeles, like it's it's global news. They they closed a freeway,  the 405 for 53. Well, they were going to close at 53 hours for a bridge demolition.  They reopened. I think they reopened early. Yes, they did 15 hours early, as I understand it.  And L.A. is such a car culture that just terror reigned in the city that this was going to everybody  was just going to die because you couldn't drive on the 405 on a Saturday. You mean I have to use

Start time: 427.00
End time: 437.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sepulveda Boulevard? And then it was supposed to be a disaster, too. They actually called  Eric Estrada out of retirement to give public service announcements. The chips guy, the chips

Start time: 437.38
End time: 454.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  guy. Yeah. All right. It's just classic. You may remember me from chips. Don't drive. He was like,  that was one good looking guy. Is he is he still good looking? He holds up well. Did he? Oh,  he does hold up well. Oh, good. So needless to say, it's over now. There are helicopters overhead.

Start time: 454.80
End time: 475.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was way over covered because it's L.A. And if you go to the markets locally, I just did my Sunday  grocery shopping and I saw signs for Rainier Cherries, Carmageddon special, two hours a pound  was in like the local Japanese market where I go to get my mushrooms and my my melons and things.

Start time: 475.22
End time: 481.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It reminds me of Y2K, to be honest. Yeah. A big, much to do about nothing. Well, I think the media

Start time: 481.74
End time: 520.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  had too much advance notice. We've been hearing about this for weeks, right? So they were all  built up. I was in what was a much more Carmageddon-esque situation on an impromptu basis  recently out on the 91 freeway, another big artery where there was a U-Haul by the side of the road in  a parking lot and it had something mysterious about it. The bomb squad was called out. The freeway  was blocked for about five miles. And I did see now this freeway was full of cars blocked. I did  see a skateboarder get out and it was a nice downhill slope. And he just completely coasted,  you know, past all the traffic. I don't know how he got back to his car. Only in L.A. Only in L.A.

Start time: 520.90
End time: 546.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that. Only in L.A. I wish I lived in L.A. Well, where it was sunny and nice. But you know,  you were talking about Spotify and it just occurred to me if you don't have an invite,  you can go to clout.com, clout.com, clout.com, clout.com, clout.com, clout.com, clout.com,  and there's an area on that site called Perks that will let you get onto Spotify in the U.S.  without somebody inviting you. And I only know that because one of my writers at Byte posted that.

Start time: 546.78
End time: 568.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not such a closed invite that you can't. O'Malley had something like 20,000 invites that  he was giving away. So what do you think, Jenny? I mean, I've been using RDO, Rhapsody, Napster,  and Mog in the U.S. for years. Is it so different? For me, it's a toss up between RDO and Spotify.

Start time: 568.86
End time: 603.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I was a long time iTunes devotee despite the fact that iTunes had so many limitations and  I don't think I'm ever going back. Yeah. From iTunes or? Yeah. I think it's either going to be  RDO or Spotify. Spotify has some kludgy UI issues that annoy me. But one thing that I like is that  the catalog is really, really deep. I tend to go for obscurities and I'm impressed. All of the  vinyl intelligence tests that I ran by it, it passed. Yeah, that's actually of interest.

Start time: 603.48
End time: 629.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They claim 18 million songs, right? It's huge. That seems awfully large. I like,  and I think this is key, and RDO does this, but I think Spotify does it very well. This is the  desktop client, by the way. It immediately, if you log into your Facebook account, populates  your Facebook friends and their playlists. And while it's just limited to Facebook, which I  think is a negative, it is kind of nice that I could see all of this music suggestion stuff just

Start time: 629.86
End time: 663.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  kind of instantly. It's instantly superior to what iTunes tried to do with ping. I think. Oh,  gosh, yeah. That's so true. One of the more conspicuous failures in terms of Apple launches,  it just never really got better. And in my opinion, it kept getting worse the longer it was out there.  But Spotify, the fact that it integrates with something as popular as Facebook,  I'm not a Facebook user, but you're at least tapping into an established platform where there's  a really large user base that's already used to prolifically sharing. It'd be nice if it did

Start time: 663.38
End time: 668.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  support Twitter, Google+, some other social networks. I haven't linked mine up to Facebook

Start time: 668.34
End time: 676.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yet. What do you get from that? I mean, do you actually get music suggestions or do you  see people's Facebook status updates? No, no, you don't get status updates. So here it is.

Start time: 676.96
End time: 729.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's on the right, Denise, of the screen right now. And so these are Facebook friends who have  Spotify, only friends who have Spotify. And so let me click on somebody like Cedric Ingram,  who's French, so he's had Spotify for some time. It immediately pop populates it with his public  playlists. That's all. Not Facebook updates, not not crap, just the music that he has published.  Don McAllister, he's from the UK and has some pretty bad taste. But he but now I know he loves  ZZ Top. Well-dressed man. OK, actually, but I'll show you one other thing that really impresses me  about Spotify. I'll pick a song, any song, double click it. It starts playing immediately,  actually. Love that. That's kind of stunning that it's immediate. I don't know how they do it,  but that by itself is a huge leap ahead of other music systems. It's true. Also, the the memory

Start time: 729.94
End time: 740.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  footprint. If you're on a tablet, if you're on something like a MacBook Air, a netbook,  you're not talking about an app that's going to hog so much of the spare memory that you have.

Start time: 741.74
End time: 774.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. What do you think, Denise? You like it? Well, like I said, I hadn't looked it up to  Facebook yet. So when I logged in, there just wasn't much there. Maybe I'm just you know,  there are just too many good options out there for us now. And I'm a couple years past being  blown away by this, which I probably would have been if they'd come a bit earlier to the US.  But now, you know, I mean, they're just with the cloud services out there. And I have not  abandoned iTunes, although it's not my go to. You know, I do like it's just so bad. Yeah,

Start time: 775.18
End time: 782.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's an embarrassment to Apple. Yeah, I do. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Certainly iTunes plus paying

Start time: 783.18
End time: 794.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is an embarrassment to Apple. There's no questions about that. And what's interesting about Spotify  is it's this unlimited stream. It's basically ad free. If you spring for the five bucks, right.

Start time: 794.80
End time: 808.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's like, you guys just said, they're not going to limit the free one even, which they do  right. They said not for this year. Yeah. So in Europe, you can only listen to 20, I think 20.  I can't remember what it is 20 songs a day or something like that. Yeah, but here they haven't

Start time: 808.96
End time: 833.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  put any kind of a cap on it, which is really exciting. And, and what you said about finding,  you know, really un listened to or unplayed on the radio songs. We had Jacob Lopez, who is in his  mid 20s. And he said, Finally, I can listen to zombie none the skeletons. Oh, finally. I said,  finally. That's amazing. Oh, yeah. So I'm the skeletons and it's courtesy of Spotify.

Start time: 835.38
End time: 867.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Artists are going to raise this point, which is that it's very hard to make any money from Spotify.  I've heard that. Yeah. And it doesn't it doesn't it's basically promotional value only. Yeah.  So are we ripping off artists by supporting services like this? Should we be buying music  from iTunes or Amazon? Wouldn't that be a better way to support an artist you really like? Because  it's so easy for 10 bucks a month, I can listen to all the zombie Nia want. And they get zombie,  pardon me. And they get and they get pennies. I mean, they literally they get they get almost

Start time: 867.80
End time: 887.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  nothing. Well, Spotify is tightly integrated with the record labels, right? They are the driving  force behind having this service out there. It's their bid to compete in the modern digital world.  And I think they'd probably argue to the artists that it's the equivalent of radio airplay these

Start time: 887.78
End time: 892.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  days. Exactly. Because radio is not doing any good anymore. Right. So you got to do something. How do

Start time: 892.50
End time: 910.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we promote this? Yeah, I mean, that's aspirational. It's so nice to say, you know, let's be for the  artists and we don't care. But oh, yeah, we know how much the record labels love the artists.  Yeah, exactly. That's exactly the point. I think there was an exciting announcement.

Start time: 911.06
End time: 970.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a great infographic, which we talked about a few twits ago about how much money this  is from information is beautiful.net. How much money artists earn online for a solo artist to earn  a monthly minimum wage in the US, which they estimate to be about 1160 bucks, they have to  sell 143 self pressed CDs, 155 CDs on CD baby 1161 record deal, CDs, you know,  album downloads from say iTunes, 1229, mp3 downloads, the dot is growing. Here's how much  Wow, you have to have 849,000 plays on Rhapsody. You have to have 1.5 million plays on last FM.  There's no room for the spot. Spotify, at least this is the deal that they had. I don't know if  this is the deal going forward. 4 million plays per month to earn a minimum wage.

Start time: 972.22
End time: 980.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but Leo, I mean, you remember this, you and I wrote a book together and certainly,  my latest book just came out you. This is very similar to what authors face.

Start time: 984.00
End time: 992.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember, you and I figured it out. What is this per hour? No, it was like we were working for  10 cents an hour to create that book. And the reason you do a book, at least in the

Start time: 993.46
End time: 1009.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  computer industry is more of is that promotional thing. It raises your name and then you could do  speaking engagements and you can, you know, you could get on All Things Considered or whatever.  I mean, it helps your profile. You don't do it for the money. No, you don't write a book.  So maybe you do Spotify for the profile, not for the money.

Start time: 1009.62
End time: 1027.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're an artist, I mean, you'd be real psyched to be on if you're Zambina,  for instance, I've never heard their names. Zambina is really happy that we've now mentioned them  three times on this show. Exactly. They've got to be psyched.  And they're on Spotify. Right. Were it not for Spotify, none of us would have the name Zambina

Start time: 1083.84
End time: 1141.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I just like to add one more thing. The dilemma that you're talking about is a little  bit like what we blogs go through when new and elegant apps like Flipboard come out.  Flipboard is something that I've spent many an evening on the couch sort of flipping through.  And it's I've just found out that Boing Boing and our Flickr pool are going to be featured in a  really nice way at the sort of front door of the app. And we love that. But we see no revenue from  it. These ads, you know, we're talking to them and they have our consent to do what they're doing for  the time being. But the idea that they're presenting this and they're presumably eventually  they're going to be adding their own ads in and giving us whatever terms they feel like after  they've built up their user base. You know, it feels like on the one hand, you know, we always  want more users. We always want new audiences to know about us and be exposed to our content.  But on the other hand, it kind of feels like we're being taken for a ride.

Start time: 1142.60
End time: 1174.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I totally agree with that thinking. I mean, that is how it feels for people. It's like,  you know, when my book was picked up, this was the Wozniak biography and it was picked up by  the Kindle. I mean, I don't see any money from that. And I was just had a bad deal. I mean,  you should have royalties for the Kindle sales. Yeah, okay. But even if I had a deal, I mean,  you know how this works. The agent takes it, the publisher takes it, everybody takes it. It takes  forever to get your money back on the advance. In the end, you get pennies. And yet Flipboard is such

Start time: 1174.98
End time: 1182.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a really generative, wonderful idea that makes content so palatable. That's a great way to read

Start time: 1182.60
End time: 1200.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boing Boing. I love it. I love the way it looks. It is to internet content what Spotify is to music.  Spotify is so much and audio, even with the difficulties that they have, even with the UI  problems that those two apps have, they're so much better than anything else that's out there in a

Start time: 1200.18
End time: 1222.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  big way. Yeah, and yet there are other apps that do this like Zite, who, you know, people are suing  them because they're not reaching out as Flipboard has. I think Flipboard realized they had to reach  out to the content creators. So you're satisfied from a point of view of Boing Boing, you're  satisfied that they're going to take care of you or? I think that's being a little too naive and a

Start time: 1222.64
End time: 1234.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  little too optimistic. We're happy to be featured. We like what they're doing with our content right  now. And I think I'm safe in saying that we have kind of a wait and see attitude, but that we're

Start time: 1235.02
End time: 1243.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  impressed with what a nice looking platform it is. And you can, by the way, I think Flipboard does  give you away as a content creator to block it. Oh, sure. But we chose not to do that.

Start time: 1244.30
End time: 1266.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, who would want to do that? So everything that we release is released under a Creative Commons  license that permits non-commercial reuse with attribution. And for the time being, they're not  selling ads against our content. So it's not a violation. Plus, we're talking with them and  they have our consent. But it'll be interesting to see how they businessify what they do. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and I share your concern. I mean, they're not doing it with podcasts at this point,  but I'd have the same problem if. But that's why we embed our ads. So we knit them so tightly into  the content that you can't get rid of them. It's like watermarking. Yeah. If you want the show,  you're going to get the ad. Speaking of which, let's take a break and come back. We're going to,  you know, I want to talk about Netflix because that's really raised a furor.  And with their what some say is a price increase. I might, I might dispute that,  but let's talk about it in just a second. Before we do, though, I do want to talk about  our friends at Citrix who make a great product for the IT professional. If you're doing support,  software support, IT support, maybe just mom and dad, grandma and grandpa support,  you got to know about GoToAssist Express. I've been using it since they were called Expert City,  which was 10 years ago during the tech TV days. This is the greatest thing ever. And Citrix,  you know, they know how to do remote access, 128 bit SSL, it's cross platform Mac or PC. And  they've added features that support pros need. Unattended support, really important, very easy  for your supportee. You can't, you don't want to spend time supporting the support tool.  So all you have to do is send them a link in an email. If you're in a chat, you give them a link.  This is what I did to my mom. She clicks the link. It's a Java stub, very quick to load. You say,  mom, just click allow. When you see the allow, she says, and then I'm in and I'm fixing her computer.  And she loves it because she could see the mouse move around. I could chat with her. I could explain  what I'm doing. It is the way to speed things up. Eight sessions at once. Pros will like that  because you can start a scan or an install and move along so you don't have to wait for it to  finish. It gives you an assay of the operating system, all the software running in the background,  including security software. You can share your screen with them as well as look at their screen.  I could just go on and on. But you know, the best thing to do is try it free. Just go to  gotoassist.com. You have 30 days absolutely free to try this and all of the great features.  Citrix has really put together the best remote support app. I know there are other choices out  there, but there's no reason not to try this. It's free. And I'm accept that. I should warn you,  you're going to get hooked. It's the best. Go to assist express, go to assist.com slash twit.  You thank them for supporting twit. And you see I knitted that so carefully into the body of it  that nobody will be able to extricate it. We also are Creative Commons attribution share alike  noncommercial. I think that's the right way to do content. I'm curious about Flipboard. Do you see

Transcript:  No. So you're doing it on faith basically that it's going to build business. Yeah. I mean,  I think with things like that that come into the marketplace and look attractive or look interesting,  we sometimes like to cautiously trade forward and see what happens with that. And then if it,  you know, if some time goes by the product matures and we're not getting anything out of it or it's  it's, you know, potentially leeching traffic away or leeching revenue away, then we opt out.

So this week Netflix basically announced, well, I don't know if they, you could say it was  a price increase. I mean, there's no question if you have a Netflix account that includes discs,  you're going to pay more for the same service. But you could also say they split streaming from  discs. Streaming will still be 799. Disks will be what they were. Any Netflix users in the group?  Yes, of course. Yeah, of course. Oh, you too, Jenny. Okay.

You know, that you definitely have a Netflix account so  you can download those movies for them. And I think one thing that people have to remember  and they so often forget is these companies aren't into it for the users, their final obligation at  the end of the day is to their stockholders. And if they can raise prices, they will raise prices  to what the market will bear. It's still a good deal. I guess.

It's not in their interest that people do this. They want  you to watch video on demand. So I'm convinced that they're not putting any more bandwidth in  because they don't want this to happen. Yeah. So I went to I went to a DSL provider. It won't be  as fast burst, but at least it will be consistent. And I'll be able to watch my movies. I just I  think that the movie industry doesn't like DVDs because it's a piracy. They never have. They want  they want you to watch streaming. The cable companies want you to watch video on demand.  They don't want you to watch streaming because you're buying bits at wholesale. You've got all  these interests fighting against each other. And the only people who really are the victims  are us.

And after they'd finished their show, there's this one guy, like this Australian guy sitting  on the corner, heckling Ice Tea. Ice Tea's a really serious guy, right? So this guy is sitting on the  corner, heckling him, threatening him. Goes on for like 20 minutes and everybody on the bus is  just kind of looking at Ice Tea, wondering if he's going to do anything. He's just kind of  sitting there like that. And then right around the 20 minute mark, he just quietly gets off the bus,  walks up to the dude, clocks him in the face, breaks his jaw, and then walks back on the tour bus  and sits right back down and does absolutely nothing. Everybody was like,  yeah, that's Ice Tea. And that elephant? That elephant is like Ice Tea.

Transcript:  I use the animated GIF thing just honestly, it is an interesting experiment to see how,  it's like looking at an organism and seeing how the blood flows. And animated GIFs are something  that's, it's like, it's sticky, it's very shareable, people get really worked up about it,  and you can see how interesting content flows.

Transcript:  Yeah.  What they're talking about, will this work? Will this last? Will it have sustaining power?  It's way, way, way too early to know. With Twitter, I remember in the first  six months of being on board, I was, I don't know, first 500, first 800 users on Twitter,  I thought it was totally worthless, totally annoying, and I let my account go dormant for  another six months when I came back and saw that this had evolved into something really interesting.  So I was exactly the same.  Exactly the same.

Start time: 2592.48
End time: 2599.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Part of what makes a network great is the ease  with which the sort of social connections can evolve and mutate over time. And I think  they've got enough of all of those three things going for them. Lord knows they got the user base.

Transcript:  Yeah. I would add a fourth at this beginning part, and that is the fact that there's so little,  or if any, content being pushed in there that's coming from somewhere else that's not native to  Google+. That's what FriendFeed did wrong. It's what Pounce did wrong. It is all native content.  It's actually made me rethink. Mike Elgin's got his social media Google Plus diet that he's on  where he's just switched exclusively to that medium, and I could see doing that. But what  it's done for me is made me rethink how I use Twitter and Facebook, which are basically the  only other things I use. And right before the show today, I clicked that setting in Facebook that  takes my Twitter stream out of it. People have asked me to do it before, and it's too time  consuming to post multiple places and more efficient to do it this way, but it's just awful.

Start time: 2673.10
End time: 2741.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe the right way to do this, I don't know about Facebook, the right way to do this is to have  Twitter be this kind of automated stream. It's a dial tone. It's a nervous system of stuff  that can be aggregated, collated, searched, put into Flipboard, and then have the real,  true engagement happen on Google Plus. Facebook, that's where you kind of hang out with your family  because I can't get my family to use Google Plus. You should call Vic. Call Vic and give him that  idea, Leah. That's a good idea. When Google Plus launched, we had Vic and Bradley on this  week in Google. We talked a lot. They've been very open, and that's another thing I think Google's  done right is they've really participated with the community over Google Plus. And now there are at  least 10 million. We know there's 10 million because Larry Page in the earnings call this  week said, yes, we've got 10 million people in Google Plus. We have a billion shares a day  in Google Plus. Wow. That's amazing. And he posted, by the way, notes from his earning call in his  Google Plus stream. Crazy. It is crazy. They're eating their own dog food, as they say. It's

Transcript:  for advertising on Facebook. That's right. Come watch me on Google Plus. They banned that ad.  They've also turned off, I've been told, the porting of Facebook. The only way you get your  Facebook stuff into Google Plus was to go to Yahoo first with your Facebook contacts and then from  Yahoo into Google Plus. And apparently they've turned that off as well. I can't verify that,  but I've been told that they've turned that off as well. So it's very interesting. What I heard is

Transcript:  to make sure that Google Plus works. It's not just Google Plus. The bonus structure at Google  this year is tied to Google's success in social for every single person at Google.

Transcript:  at work. So my question is for Google Plus, does it have to be necessary for some percentage of  Facebook people to just dump Facebook and switch over? I don't think it's going to happen.  Because I don't think it's going to happen either. I think Twitter continues. Facebook continues.  It's just one more. So you've got LinkedIn for your professional network. You've got Twitter.  You've got Facebook. And then now you've got a lot. That's an awful lot. It's awful. A lot of me is  there really room at the table for a fourth? I mean, right now it's all exciting, but I'd like  to see it in six months and see what really happens with the bulk of users. Or is it just  a self-selecting small group while checking it out, excited about the animated GIFs, et cetera?

Transcript:  In six months, let's see, Vic. We also might assume that Google has a few other tricks up  their sleeve, right? I mean, there may be more to come. That's right. For instance, go ahead.

Start time: 2903.48
End time: 2943.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, go ahead, Leah. No, you go ahead. Well, I was just going to say, I think over the next  six months, I could see my professional network on Google Plus doing much more. And maybe that's  because of the industry I pay attention to. So I might be more scared if I were LinkedIn,  which I've never really used or found a use for at all. Basically a resume posting service.  Right. With more of the family and people who are not in the technology world, old friends  staying on Facebook, but gradually I think moving over to Google Plus too and using it in parallel  because of the way that Google Plus brings people in once you add them to a circle and

Start time: 2944.78
End time: 2963.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  also because of the buzz it's getting. You know what I like most about Google Plus so far? No  stupid games. Yeah. No Farmville. Do you think they'll put games on there? I don't think they're  going to do games. You know, they might, but just the fact that it works and I don't have to go  through so many layers of crap to get to where I want. I agree with you. Yeah, I agree with you.

Start time: 2963.36

She left jail at  1230 in the morning and the and the reporters like follow the car via helicopter. They're following  the car to a parking lot at her attorney's and then they can't figure out where she went. But a  private jet left from the executive airport. And so the helicopters are swarming there. Maybe that's  it. It went to Colorado where parents live. No, it's a bunch of golfers. It was like,  really? This is the most important thing in the world. I guess what? You just got trolled.  You suck me in, Jenny. No, I would like to talk about the other big scandal that's on the other  side of the pond. The Rupert Murdoch scandal, scandal, a big address. Scamble. Yeah, how they  got rid of that newspaper after years. Rebecca. What's her name? Rebecca Brooks got arrested  today. She I don't know if she'll be able to testify in parliament on Tuesday.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit before we do, though, I want to talk about the secret  behind exceptional websites are good friends at Squarespace.com hosting plus software giving you  the best possible experience. If you're ready to set up your your own Boing Boing, your own animated  gift forum, this is a great place to go. It's not you know, there are other choices like Tumblr and  WordPress and type pad, but there is no better hosting out there and no better content management  system than Squarespace. So if you really want to do the best and let me tell you the best use  Squarespace, look at the example sites, you'll see so many well known names, businesses, restaurants,  nonprofits, photographers too, because Squarespace gives you great looking sites that are unique,  that don't look like anybody else's site. They do that because you start with 60 plus designer  templates that you can completely customize with drag and drop point and click.

We do a ham show called Ham Nation and they kind of convinced me  that I really should get my ham license. Here's the picture of Leo and the examiners.  Okay. They're not dorks. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. But you know what's interesting? I fit right in.  Ham was the original social network. It is. It still is. It really was.  You know what surprised me is I thought, oh, this is probably a hobby that's kind of dying out  because after all, we have the internet and cell phones now. We don't really need to carry a five  watt radio in our back pocket. But there were 10 or 15 people taking the test. Ham is still growing.  There are a lot of amateurs and many of them are in our audience, which I didn't know.  So I'm looking forward to it. The new studio will have, I'm really excited, a radio corner.  So we're going to have a great ham setup so people can come from out of town and broadcast.  Because I guess you can do that. If I have a license, you can use my gear and broadcast on it.  But then we're going to set up really nice. Bob Hyland, Gordon West are going to set up a  beautiful setup there. But then we're next to it. We're going to have a 1940s Collins AM radio  transmitter glowing, glowing, glowing. We're going to have an old 50s console with a big knobs.  We're going to have a turntables, cart machines. It's going to be a little old radio station set up  in there. Just that's cool. A museum of analog technology. And maybe you'll see some of these

Transcript:  they're nerds, right? But we're nerds, baby. Are you nerds or are you geeks? Well, not only that,  but what I'm getting at is like social networks, they own your content. With ham radio, there's  none of that. It sort of passes out there into the ether, but you own it. It really is a DIY  social network and it's something that predates a lot of us here. Thank you for acknowledging that.

The founder of Twitter  is being interviewed by somebody from the New York Times and God, I can't think of her name. She's the  the real liberal columnist that always used to take down Bush so hard. But anyway, she was  interviewing him and said, tell me why on God's earth would I ever use Twitter if I was in trouble,  how would this help me? And he said, well, you could type in help.  Four or five characters help. Help. People have done that. It actually has happened. Remember,

My point earlier was more to the fact that if the communication networks  that we rely on for regular access to services such as Twitter, if they fail, like they would  after a catastrophic earthquake or a tsunami or a big hurricane, that's where the hams really,  really become valuable. When phone lines, cellular networks and internet are gone,

Hey, let's talk.  Let's put Denise Howell to work a little bit here. Attorney, counselor, judge finds this is  a little scary. HTC guilty of infringing two Apple patents. Does this mean Android is in trouble?  Does this, are they going to get an adjunction against HTC that keeps HTC from shipping phones

Start time: 3699.96
End time: 3791.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to the U.S.? Well, this is just one of the bigger pieces of how Android's in trouble, right?  Because Android is just sort of a Swiss cheese of these patent and licensing issues. Because at  bottom it's this open source endeavor based on Linux. Right. And so everybody now that it's  spreading and what's our other story here today, five hundred and fifty thousand Android activations  per day. Yeah. Spreading is right. Like a wildfire spread. Yeah. So, you know, everyone wants to and  can try and get a piece of that pie. And so we see it coming at them from all fronts. We've got Oracle,  we've got Microsoft, we've got Apple, you know, and not just going after Google with Android,  but this one, you know, Apple versus HTC. And Neil Ipatella, as he has wanted to do,  has yet another definitive post unpacking this international trade commission ruling and basically,  you know, throwing a bit of water on all the panicky coverage of it. It was an adverse decision  against HTC finding that two of the ten patents asserted had been infringed. But this guy is just  the first stopping point in the ITC's decision making process. It then goes to the full six  member panel. And so there's still a long ways to go in this. But I really encourage people to go  and read Neil Ipatella's post if they're fascinated by the details of all this.

I mean, I guess they're going to have to have functionality  that doesn't rely on Android as in its current iteration, right, that they actually have somehow  coded around this, which, you know, again, another piece of this being an open source  operating system, I guess you can do to some extent. This makes me so mad. I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a system of the two patents. The first is two patent 5946647 describes a system of data  detectors that can parse data, recognize known structures and take action upon them.  Patent 6343260 three is a patent that describes a modular system that enables different types  of data to be processed in real time. The point being these aren't trash can clicking an icon.  These are fundamental underlying technologies that everybody does that everybody uses. Everybody

Start time: 3919.34
End time: 3966.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ruling on whether this is original or not? I think that they're just looking at the patent  and looking at the question of is it infringed? I am not a patent lawyer. And you actually on  All About Android earlier this week had Matt McCarion, who's been on Twill a number of times.  He writes the litigating Apple blog and hasn't yet delved into this too deeply. But you know,  I encourage people to listen closely to what folks like Matt and Neely are unpacking about all this  for the actual administrative details. But my understanding just as a lawyer who practices in  the IP area is they're going to be more closely concerned with the actual infringement involved

Start time: 3966.40
End time: 3975.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in this narrow case. So they don't have to think about though, what is the impact on the market?  Is this going to throw everything in turmoil? They don't have to think about end users who will have

End time: 4017.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right? I mean, in the end, it all comes down to what's licensed and what's not, right? I mean,  that's what all these. So ultimately, maybe this is resolved. Apple says, fine, you could sell your  phone. Just pay us. Exactly. Yeah. So, you know, but could that on the head? It's how much it's  worth to them and how much they think they can push this without having to pay through the nose  for the licensing involved in again, because it's all this sort of strange, brought together  from multiple sources, underlying technology, there's a lot of opportunity to debate what's

Start time: 4017.20

Transcript:  Android out of business. Yeah. Well, they'd probably rather have the licensing fees. I mean,  how did Microsoft get so rich was licensing DOS all those years. I mean, it's all you get. You  have just a steady stream of income. That's true. From licensing. That's what lawyers do.

No, no, but I mean, I do. I love it. It's great. It's I would, if you've made me go back to iPhone,  I'd cry. Yeah. And it just makes me sad to see a company. Well, I mean, I guess this is what  happens. Denise, you're a lawyer. It seems to me that I would just like them to make a better iPhone  and not worry so much about what Android's doing. Right. They do. They have these patents not just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  just makes me it saddens me. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It hurts open source software because what does  the unintended consequence, maybe it is the intended consequence, is that people then start  using proprietary solutions because at least they know, you know, it's not encumbered,  that they know who to pay a license fee to. And it makes people scared about Linux and other  open source software because, oh my God, who's going to sue me if I use this? Yeah. But look at

That company that owns the patent on the in-app purchasing and everybody  I know who runs, say, you know, an iOS app company has gotten a cease and desist letter. And load sis  has even sued the New York Times company now. Apple, if they're smart, will indemnify these  companies. I think that's what Apple's saying they'll do, but they haven't. They haven't yet  indemnified them. And Apple's too busy, you know, suing everybody else, suing HTC and Microsoft,  or rather Oracle is suing Google over to Java.

I want to talk to you a little bit about a great column in the Wall Street Journal  by Ben Rooney, Women and Children First, Technology and Moral Panic. He's actually  quoting Genevieve Bell, Director of Intel's Interaction and Experience Research. Well,  I want to talk about that in just a little bit. The moral panic that society always goes through  when there's new technology and who is it that suffers first? It's the women and children.  But before we do that, I do want to talk a little bit about audible.com, my favorite place  for audio entertainment. I know you're listening to a tweet right now or watching it,  but there are times when maybe you don't want this blather about technology. You'd like to  listen to a great piece of literature or enjoy a sci-fi novel or perhaps get ahead on the Game of  Thrones. Maybe you want to read Clash of Kings before next fall. That's where audible comes in  handy. There are, you know, nowadays we're so busy, who has time to read anymore? But there are plenty  of times when you could read if you could just, you know, listen. You couldn't hold a book, but  you could in the car or at the gym cleaning house, walking the dog. I listened to audible books in  all those times. In fact, I sometimes I'll walk the dog three or four times a day just so I can  catch up on my audible reading. This is that book I was talking about. Actually, I'm feeling  luckily it's not Paul Adams. It's Douglas Edwards and the Confessions of Google Employee Number 59.  It's next on my reading list. There's some great Google books if you want to know more about Google  at audible.com. And here's how you can get two of them for free. You go to audible.com slash  twit to you'll sign up for the platinum plan. That's the two book a month subscription.  And the first month is free. Your first two books are free and you can cancel it anytime. Oh, nothing.  But you get to keep those books forever. This is one of the things I really like about audible  is every book you've ever listened to audible is in your audible library. And you can listen to it  at any time. I use the audible app on Android. There's one on iPhone that lets you literally  browse through your library of books and listen to them and see this new feature. I love this  send wirelessly to Kindle. You can send audio books. I just said Solaris to my Kindle. How about  that? So you can read the book and listen to the book plays on the iPhone, iPod, iPad,  zoom, pretty much all of the media players, of course, your computer as well.  Even on my Sonos, which is great. When nobody's home, I will make the audible books resound  throughout the house. So my Sonos system audible.com slash twit to pick two books.  Gina's got a couple of books on here.

So, you  know, it's like plan your your journey, you know, deal with, you know, criticism. Don't stay too  long at the top is the final lesson in the book. So it's a business book. That's it's a business  book and it's an adventure book. And it's I wrote it for her to and if you look on Amazon, I don't  even think my name's on there for some reason. It's a typo.

I don't know if you  read it in the in the Wall Street Journal, but it's the issue of the word of moral panic.  Genevieve Bell says we have had moral panic over new technologies pretty much as long as we've had  technology since the since fire in the wheel and and it's always she said played out in the bodies  of children and women. She says look at the pushback about electrifying homes in the US.  She said if you electrify homes, people said you'll make women and children vulnerable.
