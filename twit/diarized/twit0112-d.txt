Transcript:  this is tWiGT.  This is tWiGT.  This Week in Tech, episode 112 for September 9th, 2007.  All I Need.  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Audible.com.  For your free audiobook, visit Audible.com slash twit.  It's time for tWiGT, and ladies and gentlemen, let's start with a man who's been missing  in action and we have surely missed him, Mr. John C. Dvorak.  I've always been here.  Oh, that's right.  But hello.  It's right.  It's not a show without John.  Oh, I know.  We took the week off.  What am I thinking?  Everybody was missing in action last week.  What am I thinking?  Thank you, John.  It's good to see you again.  Dvorak.org slash blog.  And he's got a shrimp on the barbie.  What is for dinner a little later on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, nobody's invited, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John is not a man to mince words.  Let's also say hi to Will Harris from Will.  Where is Will?  And eventually from this new TV channel that he's starting, but from right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so close.  I can almost feel it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So close.  W-I-L Harris dot co dot UK.  One L. Is that commonly how it's done in the UK is with one L?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  You only get three letters in a high school table, right, in the arcades.  So when I was little, I always used to just put in like W-I-L. That was my name for the  high school table on Street Fighter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My real name is Leopold Josephus, but I could only get Leo on the arcade.  So that was it.  Well, there you go.  We're in the same boat.  No, I'm just kidding.  Actually, Leo is perfect for that.  And we're going to welcome a brand new member of the Twitch panel, one I hope we'll see  a lot of in the future because I think he does a great site.  Mike Masnick is the head honcho at Tech Dirt, T-E-C-H-D-I-R-T, TechDirt.com, which I was  stunned Mike to learn has been around since 1997.  What have you been?  Where have you been?  Oh, he just fell off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently you stunned him.  I stunned him.  Stunned him up the underwear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He started talking and boom, he's gone.  Let's get him back on the phone here.  Since 1997, I never heard.  Had you guys ever heard of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have actually.  I look at it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a great site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do too.  I've been looking at it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And now he doesn't want to talk to us anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's got the little web alert down the bottom.  Loads of people have got embedded web alerts on their site.  What's that?  What is it?  He did the Morgan Web Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Well, I think that's because she's with FM.  Oh, and he's with FM as well.  He's probably with FM and FM probably makes them do that.  No, they probably pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they probably do.  It's probably part of the contract.  That you have to do a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's quite strange.  It's crazy.  Why not?  Different websites and you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everywhere you go, there's Morgan Web's face.  Yeah, with their crazy haircuts.  Kind of weird.  I love Morgan.  She's a great person.  We're getting redirected to voicemail now with Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he'll get back.  He's obviously lost his connection.  Clearly.  Let's look at this week's news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's really one story and one story only.  And in fact, Steve Jobs did a particularly crappy job of managing the news this week.  Wednesday Apple had its big announcement.  New iPods.  I mean, this is a big story.  The iPod Touch, which everybody wanted, an iPhone without the phone.  They announced a 160 gigabyte iPod Classic and a whole line of new Nanos.  Yeah, it's those short squatty ones.  Although when you see them in person, it kind of makes sense because it had to have that  big screen because it plays video.  $150 video player.  And all of this great important news for Apple was completely overshadowed by the fact that  he decided to cut 200 bucks off the price of the iPhone.  And every newspaper, every TV pundit, every talk show pundit is going on and on about  Steve Jobs and all the Apple fans upset.  Is it a big deal?  What happened here, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mean the fact that he cut the price just to prove that there are more suckers in the  world than he even knew about?  I don't think he was trying to prove that.  I thought, I'm sure that's the only reason he would do that because let's face it, this  price cut came way too soon.  It came like what?  Two months.  Two months.  Was it that long?  Whatever the case was, he rolls out this price cut pretty close to immediate just to mock  the fanboys.  That's the only reason he did it.  That's not why he did it.  In fact, I think he-  Oh, that's why he did it.  And I think you're one of them, aren't you, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm one.  I got it.  First of all, this isn't unheard of.  We've seen price drops, big price drops.  Hey, every time you buy something, it's going to drop.  Is this an unprecedented drop, do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I've never seen anything like-  A third off in two months?  I've never seen anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much did the razor cost when it first came out?  $500, $600?  I don't know.  I never got one.  It didn't stay at that price for very long.  Part of the problem is it's obfuscated by the subsidies the cell phone companies pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The razor was never really sold.  It was a bundled product, so I don't think this applies.  But let's back up and see what really happened here.  Obviously, what happened was they overhyped the product to an extreme.  So everybody who wanted one wanted one immediately.  So they must have sold pretty much to everyone who wanted one of these phones right off the  bat within the first couple days.  And then there must have been zero follow-up sales because there was no ramp whatsoever.  So they just must have looked at these numbers and just freaked out and dropped the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think what was really telling was that in the USA Today interview that Jobs did,  which had the famous quote of, well, that's technology.  What do you say to all these people?  Well, that's technology.  They said, are your estimates, what are your estimates still on the iPhone?  And he said, well, we're still estimating that we're going to ship $10 million in the  first year.  And so if you're still estimating that after a price cut of a third, you're going to hit  your original target, then they can't have been on track to hit that target in the first  place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They must have been well behind.  I'm going to be the dissenting party here.  And you guys can yell at me all you want here.  But it seems to me, first of all, they had to cut the price because they had an iPod  touch at the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Before you go on with your little story, Leo, didn't you actually stand in line to get one  of these things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's ours.  But I didn't do it because I'm a fanboy.  I want to make this very clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just want to get it straight so people out there know that you're kind of engaged in  the process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I did it because I had to review it on the radio show the next day and they didn't offer  any review units.  And I...  Well, what am I going to do?  The review units came out last week.  Am I going to wait two months to review this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could have called your buddy David Pogan.  He would have showed you his.  Yeah, he's in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think I really needed to have one.  Okay, I'm just saying.  I'm just pointing it out.  And I will point out that on the radio show, I've consistently told people, wait, don't  buy.  Glad I gave that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're the reason they had to cut the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I just, I mean, I think a lot of people, including my daughter and a lot of savvy buyers  said, I'm going to wait until the price comes down and or a second generation comes out.  However, I don't think that, I don't think there's that much of a furor about it.  I think this is being manufactured by the press.  Everybody I've talked to said, hey, I'm an early adopter.  That's the price you pay.  I wanted the iPhone before anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think, I mean, I read the latest cringely column on PBS and he makes a brilliant point,  which is that, you know, who's to say that, you know, the controversy isn't manufactured  by Apple?  I mean, Jobs knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cringely is completely wrong on this because this is the, this is Steve Jobs worst case  scenario.  They announced all these great new products and all anybody wants to talk about is a $200  price drop.  This is a worst case scenario.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lots and lots and lots of people thinking, oh yeah, that iPhone that looked fantastic.  No, you know what?  It gets a lot of people saying, it gets a lot of people saying, I'm going to wait and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  see if Apple drops the price.  It's bad for business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a, it was, you know, Will, I think you're dead wrong and Leo's dead right on this one.  You can't, you can't pull this kind of a stunt and then not screw up sales in the future.  Cause now anytime they bring out an overpriced product, which is almost every time Apple  releases anything, no one's going to buy it because they're going to expect a price cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got, we have Mike Maznik back on the line and Mike might have to be the deciding vote  on this.  So Mike, let me just fill you in on what you missed.  So apparently both John C. Dvorak and Will Harris are of the opinion that Apple overcharged  for this phone, that the price drop after two months of $200 is unprecedented.  We all agree it's a screw up on Apple's part because it is distracted the media from the  more important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Will doesn't think it's a screw up.  Let's get that straight.  He thinks it's a plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will thinks it's some sort of strategic plan.  I'm saying it's, it's what happens.  It's normal.  Okay.  Maybe it's a little bit soon and a little bit precipitous, but look, this happens in  technology and mostly I'm saying I don't see a lot of iPhone customers who are unhappy.  I think the early adopters, most of them, they're getting that a hundred dollar credit.  Most of them are satisfied by that and they understand, look, you buy something like this,  you understand you're going to pay a premium price.  You buy the newest cell phone of any kind.  You know you're paying more than it's going to be in six months.  That's the deal.  So Mike, the pressure's on you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the tie breaking position?  Well, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, Mike, before you explain this, let me re-explain what Leo just explained.  What Leo is saying is that Will and I think that people are going to be upset about this  claim is that the people who bought the phone at the ridiculous over price that it came  out at are happy as clams because they're idiot fan boys who don't give a crap about  anything Apple does as long as it's an Apple product, they'll buy it at whatever price.  That's pretty much accurate.  That's pretty much the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They knew they were overpaying for it and that's the price you pay to be the first in  your block to have an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think people know that prices go down but I don't think anyone expected them.  There were two things that people didn't expect.  One was that people didn't expect it to go down this quickly because this is faster than  most new products get price drops.  And secondly, usually you only do that price drop when you have something else, when you've  brought out the next generation of that product or some kind of advance.  In this case, there really wasn't.  I agree that there are certainly some people who are still excited to have gotten the iPhone  at full price on June 29th or whatever but there are a lot of people who aren't happy  and I think that it definitely will make some people think twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pogue is pissed off.  Pogue says it should be a $200 price rebate immediately.  I'm calling American Express by the way.  American Express is coming out golden on this.  They don't normally give you price guarantees on cell phones.  I wonder why.  But in this case, they say they're going to honor it.  They'll give us the $200 and I bought it with an Amex card so I'm going to get that $200  back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  I mean, I think we'll...  Oh, wait a minute, Leo.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, stop, stop.  It's not that I don't want the money, John.  I'm not saying I don't want the money.  I'm just saying people should understand when you're an early adopter you're going to pay  more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but early adopter by two months?  Well, all right.  That is a little quick.  All right, but actually here's where you need to break the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it is in a tie actually.  I'm outnumbered, but here's where you can help me a little bit, Mike.  These two guys seem to think it's because the iPhone ain't selling.  I'm thinking it's just because they had to rationalize their pricing to match the other  iPods and because they'd like to kick butt this Christmas.  Is the iPhone not selling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really tough to tell.  I mean, right?  There was the report that came out this week saying that it was the highest selling smartphone  in July.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the best selling smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  Yeah.  If you think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  I mean, you can raise certainly a lot of questions about that.  Does that really mean anything?  Well, it's just better selling better than others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Remember that the expectations for selling millions of units a month were not coming from  Apple.  They were coming from analysts, kind of cockeyed analysts.  I don't think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  What analysts said that they're going to sell 10 million in the first year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Apple said they would sell 10 million in the first year.  That was fairly conservative and I think they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're going to sell a million a month to do that.  No, you're right.  I'm pretty sure they could sell a lot less than a million a month and still be the best  selling smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, plus it's hard to sell now that you've got the iPod touch because a lot of the reason  people might go to the iPhone is kind of obviated now by this touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that's one of the reasons that people were more annoyed.  It's not necessarily like the $200 premium.  It's that a lot of people bought it because they wanted the awesome touchscreen iPod with  the swishy interface and whatever.  They're probably more annoyed that now they can get a 16 gigabyte version for $200 less  than they paid and still have all the things that they really want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you call that a swishy interface?  Is that what the word was?  I'm just...  Yeah.  Swishy.  That means something else in the UK.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You swish everything out of the way.  Left and right you swish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Mike, what do you think?  Do you think Apple's not selling iPhones as fast as they thought and they need to lower  the price to pump it up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's really tough to tell exactly.  I think that that would make a lot of sense.  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're all just guessing here.  Nobody's going to hold you to it.  You could say something different next week.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We all do it.  We all do.  No, I think, yeah.  I mean, I think there's a good chance that they weren't selling quite as many as they  hoped and they began to see that once the early adopter crowd had gone through, how  a $600 phone.  I think actually, in some ways, it's a little bit creative because when you look at it,  I mean, okay, they just dropped $200 off the price, but it's still a pretty expensive phone  compared to what else you can get out there from subsidized things from carriers.  So it's still fairly expensive, but now suddenly it looks cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, how many people are now going to just get a regular phone and get the iPod Touch  because who needs the iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do people want to carry two devices?  Right?  I mean, and then it goes back to that.  Some people really like having just the single device.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People have been carrying two devices for some time, apparently.  Well, yeah.  I mean, I got my utility belt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Leo looks like a guy in the army.  My pants are always sagging because all the crap hanging off of them.  In fact, that's one of the reasons I really like the iPhone is that it really did finally  kind of combine everything into one device for the first time somewhat successfully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a benefit for a lot of people and I think there definitely will be some people out there  who see it that way.  I mean, you still got to convince them that it's worth using AT&T service, but it's a  different story altogether.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of a shame though in a way that this whole thing is distracted from some really  interesting things on this iPod Touch has Wi-Fi and you'll be able to automatically buy.  Look, the Zunes had Wi-Fi for a long time and all you've been able to do is squirt with  it all of a sudden now with Apple says, oh yeah, we can do Wi-Fi and you'll be able to  buy songs at Starbucks.  I think that's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that just kills the Zune in its own game, doesn't it?  It's like, ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did the Zune need killing?  No, no.  I don't think it's intended to kill the Zune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you guys are harsh on the Zune.  Microsoft came out and said that they will and it's not out of the realm of possibility,  and I did blog this by the way, that they will bring out an iPhone or a Zune phone.  Wouldn't that be something?  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, six months too late with extras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And somebody brought up in Cranky Geeks and said, you know, you can drop it in the toilet  and because it's brown, you'll never find it in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see the very funny parody on YouTube of the Zune phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have that on the blog too.  It's a fantastic video.  Blinking 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got a dial.  With a dial, yeah.  You take a picture and a little Polaroid comes out the side.  What do you think of these fat nanos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't seen one, so I have no comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they look worse in pictures than they do in person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're actually pretty cool.  I think the thing that people don't appreciate in the pictures is that they're super thin  and the super thin cancels out like the fatness.  Yeah, I agree.  Blimey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  Blimey.  These little cheap $150 iPods play video.  Yeah.  I think for instance for you, because you're going to start doing IPTV.  Doesn't that kind of make your mouth water a little bit?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I love that.  Anything that gets more video to more people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can have a video player in your pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm digging that.  Definitely.  Definitely.  I mean, I think a lot of people like the Nano because it's particularly thin.  It fits in your pocket.  And I'm not sure how well these new ones are going to fit.  I wouldn't ever want to go jogging with a fat Nano.  Right.  And I think that's where they make a lot of...  They should have called it the fatty.  It's not the...  To call it the iPod Nano is a bit of a misnomer, isn't it?  It's not a Nano.  No, it's a fatty.  It should be the iPod Squat or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they could have made it cute.  iSquat.  iSquat.  Maybe that's a new one.  Mike, we don't know you that well.  Where do you come down on this whole thing?  Are you an iPod user?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to admit, actually, I did just get one of the old iPod Nanos about two months  ago.  Before that, I actually did not even have an iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you howling, I want my money back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no.  I'm pretty happy with the iPod Nano I got rather than the fat one there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of my position is that people are used to this.  You go out and you buy...  I mean, it happens to me...  In fact, it happens so often to me that it's considered a law of nature now that as soon  as I buy something, it'll be discontinued.  It's just normal.  It's what happens in technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's a guy on Washington Post, Steven, Steven Perlstein, who calls everyone a whiny  techie and says they should get a life.  I'm not going that far.  A bit of advice for all those who rushed out to be the first with an iPhone and are now  belly aching.  Get a life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe I will go that far.  It's kind of my attitude.  It's like, dudes, you knew what you were doing.  You were overpaying for a very sexy device.  You got your two months of fame and glory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I can't complain because over here, I've still got many more months of fame and  glory to come because we still don't have it.  So it's worth the $200 tax just for the conversation stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, wait a minute.  That may explain something.  What's that?  It just may be this whole thing may just be about the jobs telling Americans to screw  themselves while they give a better deal to the Europeans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A good point.  So is this a horrendous miscalculation on the part of Steve Jobs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  He had to do it.  I don't think it's horrendous, but I think it's a bad call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In retrospect, the smart thing that it would have been an offer this coupon on stage that  would have defused the whole thing.  How about you, Mike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think?  That definitely would have made a difference.  I mean, I think it's a mistake, but I don't think it's a horrendous one.  I certainly don't think it's one that'll really harm Apple in the long term.  I mean, do you really think that people are going to stop buying the next latest and greatest

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thing that he becomes a little slower to do so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, they're going to have to deal with people throwing it in his face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to be a personal problem for him.  And then I really do think that they missed a lot of publicity they would have normally  gotten for these.  I think these new devices are good, and I think they missed a lot of publicity on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true that certainly the iPod Touch actually really didn't get very much publicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You almost don't know it exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this good for Starbucks just out of curiosity?  They've been historically now, they've been coming on strong as a music vendor.  They only sell what, half a dozen CDs, but they're very, very strong.  Is this going to make a difference in their bottom line?  They're going to be selling songs in their bottom line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably.  They're smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tell you what, if the opportunity is buying the songs that play in my local Starbucks,  I'll give that a pass.  That's because you're young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When will you get to be our age?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Paul McCartney, I'll go with him.  Yeah, I like that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was with the Beatles, you know.  I love that stuff.  It's good.  So, I like the stats that they gave us.  What did they say?  The average Starbucks customer visits a Starbucks 18 times a month?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're opening.  How many stores do they say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, go buy your own damn coffee.  For a day.  For a day.  For a day.  This can't continue.  This has got to be a, this is a, somebody, we're going to look back on this 50 years  from now, well, we won't, but somebody's going to look back on this 50 years from now and  go, man, that was a weird fad.  Will will.  We'll still be around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember that Dvorak guy?  Nobody will remember us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John, did you see talking about it 50 years ago?  Someone posted a YouTube video of you in like 1987 reviewing some like bizarre Apple II  or something.  On Computer Chronicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On Computer Chronicles.  Yeah, original IBM PS2.  Yeah.  I was like, geez, I was five when you were doing that.  I was five.  Yeah, you know, you get, it's like, it's like riding a bike.  I was five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was five.  Palm kills the folio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it ever alive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That one's never alive.  We can joke about the Zune being dead, but yeah, the folio was dead on arrival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the folio.  I thought that was going to be a neat little product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you just like everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.  I just thought it would be a nice intermediate device for emailing and web surfing.  A little bit better than say the Nokia 800, which is, you know, touch and doesn't have  a real keyboard, but not a full laptop.  It was only going to be 500 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think this is like indicative of the increasing power of N-Gadget to dictate the  news agenda?  I mean, Jesus, between like the Apple stock and the iPhone seem sim-free.  And this, it's like, you know, are those guys ruling the tech industry now?  We should have gotten Ryan Block on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said he could only do it for 20 minutes and I poo-pooed that.  But now is the time when I really, we shouldn't really ask him.  Is he the kingmaker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're owned by AOL, so, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How powerful can they be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How powerful can they be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, you know, two weeks ago they write this massive editorial slagging off Palm saying  they're heading in completely the wrong direction.  You know, the folio is a joke.  Not only does Palm respond like the next day on their corporate blog, you know, they then  take all their suggestions and run with them the next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ed Colligan writes a...  Probably because the suggestions were good, by the way.  Well, Ed says we shouldn't be doing two platforms.  He agreed with N-Gadget.  He said we're going to focus on Palm 6 on Cobalt and we're going to let the...  Because it was Linux based.  I don't know.  I like it.  I thought it would have been cool.  The hackers would have loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it looked like the...  I don't, you know, I...  The Cyan 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've never liked that form factor ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's what, the mini laptop thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just useless.  You know, what is a laptop?  The worst case scenario for, or the best case scenario, I guess, for a laptop is 2.2 pounds.  You get one of those little Toshibas.  It's got a full-size keyboard.  It's got a big screen.  You can take it on an airplane.  It's got a lot of battery life.  You can go all over the place with it.  What is this thing saving you?  What, a pound maybe?  You know, and it's unusable.  It looks stupid and you have to be, you know, have to have a magnifying glass to read the  screen.  I mean, this has been...  This started with the Toshiba Libreta.  Oh, yeah.  And it went through the Gateway Handbook and a slew of other machines that have tried this  form factor.  None of them have been successful in any Western country.  They apparently are quasi-successful in Japan.  Thus, they get reintroduced over and over again because, golly, if the Japanese like  it, we must.  And they always fail.  So I'm surprised even...  You know, it was dead on arrival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  End of lecture.  You really just kind of killed that, man.  That's...  You know, forget Ryan Blocking and Gadget.  I think Dvorak's killed the folio.  Wow.  All right.  You're right.  That was a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you think the Scion Series 5 was one of the greatest portable computers ever made?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's where my nostalgia comes from is I love the Scions.  It was a little smaller than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the Pop-out keyboard, that was just heaven, wasn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still want...  Where's my Sinclair X100?  Oh, you don't want that.  Come on, really?  No, come on.  You know what I do have though in my collection?  I have the first Sinclair pocket calculator, electronic calculator.  Really?  I got them started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to Boing Boing, my favorite news source, not.  But I do love Boing Boing.  But actually, they're quoting the Financial Times, apparently China's military hacked  into the Pentagon three months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  If that's actually true, which I question, China's got some explaining to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got some explaining to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on, this goes on all the time.  I'm sure they try.  I mean, it's just like the big elephant in the room.  Everybody is spying on everybody else.  Everybody is hacking everybody else.  Just nobody wants to talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pentagon acknowledged shutting down part of a computer system serving the office of the  Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates.  Oops.  But it didn't say who it believed was behind the attack.  But current and former officials have told the Financial Times, and internal investigations  The incursion came from the People's Liberation Army.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm looking at an old video from probably the early 60s that was filmed in China.  Yeah.  And I never knew this, but you know the Chinese flag's got that big yellow star and then four  little stars.  Does anybody here know what the stars stand for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  And I should know.  I was a Chinese major.  You should know, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And this kind of goes back in history, and it's weird because there's no real documentation  for it, but this guy explained it as it was explained to him in this crazy old black and  white thing, which is actually available on YouTube.  I was going to blog it, but it's an hour long.  I didn't think it was something people should be watching.  Anyway, the big yellow star stands for the Chinese Communist Party.  And then the first three stars stand for the peasants, the intelligentsia, and the people.  And the fourth star is the...  Probably the party.  No, the party is the big star.  The fourth star, which is the interesting one, the fourth star stands for capitalists  who are sympathetic to the party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's bizarre.  That can't be true.  I know.  That's what I thought.  It's like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what came up in the conversation.  Anyway, check it out.  If people, you can send us email and we'll get this straight because nobody...  You won't see an explanation for it, for these stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe President Bush asked Ho Jin Dao that when he met with him in Australia.  This was in the 60s.  Oh, all right.  I doubt President Bush has seen that video.  Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, that's the woman that Bush gave a little massage  to, you might remember, raised reports of Chinese infiltration of German government  computers with Wen Jiabao, China's premier.  And the foreign ministry said, the government is opposed to and forbids any criminal acts  undermining computer systems, including hacking.  Hacking is a global issue and China is frequently a victim.  We didn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't do it.  The Bart Simpson alibi, isn't it?  I didn't do it.  Nobody saw me do it.  You can't prove anything.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I didn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Sony's rootkit.  Sony, another rootkit story.  Did you cover this at all, Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, apart from to say that, you know, Jesus, can't those guys just get a grip?  I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  DeVarag.org slash blog covered it.  Of course they did.  And in fact, there's an update on the record rootkit.  So this new rootkit was on some security thing that they made.  It was on a dongle.  Thumb drive dongle.  Yeah, a USB key thing.  So that maybe you could say, well, all right, it's a security device.  But when you put it on a CD.  So now in a New York Times interview, Rick Rubin, who is the co-head of Columbia Records,  which is owned by Sony, said, I don't know if this is a slip, if it's a mistake.  He said that the rootkit recorded information about whoever played the record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think he knew.  I mean, he wasn't.  He was just made a mistake.  Yeah.  I mean, he's not savvy enough.  You don't think they said.  The context for that was that he was pissed off because he had produced the Neil Diamond  album that had come out the week before the whole rootkit thing broke on Columbia, which  is Sony.  And it was one of the CDs that had it.  And it killed the sales for that particular CD because it got pulled from the shelf.  Oh, is that what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, I thought it was Neil Diamond that killed it.  It was just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He said, and trust me, I have no idea, but he said it was the best opening week for a  Neil Diamond album ever.  It had come in number four on the Billboard charts or something.  And then the whole rootkit thing came and it got pulled from the shelves.  And so I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, but maybe they hate Neil Diamond or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's possible.  I don't think he actually had any insight or knowledge into what the rootkit actually  did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you're probably right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's probably just some dumb exact.  I'm sorry.  This begs the question.  What is wrong with Sony?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know what you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You hate Sony.  We know that.  No, I do not hate Sony.  I love Sony.  I think it's one of the greatest companies in the history of Western civilization.  It's just that they're mismanaged.  I hate the management.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty obvious.  I don't think it could get any worse for Sony.  Is there any good news for Sony at all?  I don't even buy.  You know, Sony's got some good video cameras and I'm looking at now these solid state video  cameras.  I think it's kind of intriguing and they make a good one, but it records onto a magic stick  and I'm not going to buy anything.  I'm not going to buy anything that doesn't record onto a standard.  More proprietary.  It's not called a magic stick.  That's what I call it.  What is it called?  The memory stick.  The memory stick.  Didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They used to call it that.  Copy protection is called magic gate.  That's why I'm confused.  Some people like to call it a magic stick.  But I mean, talking about a crazy mismanagement, what do you think about this whole Netscape  for Raw?  What happened at Netscape?  Well, you know, the Calacanis social news digger like on netscape.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, which sure pissed off Kevin, I remember.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's been canned.  They're ditching it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoops.  Now that Jason's gone, let's just get rid of that.  That wasn't working out so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was embarrassing because you'd see like, it wasn't digs, it was something else.  I forgot what it was called.  It was always like two and three.  I mean, the numbers, it made it look like nobody's looking at the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember when Jason put this out, he was trumpeting, you know, we have more users than  any other website.  You know, there are millions of uniques a day or whatever it is.  But what they forgot to point out is that's because these are all people who haven't figured  out how to change their homepage.  Right, let alone post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it was kind of sad because, you know, in the last few months, you kind of got the  impression that people were starting to get used to it and people were using it.  I mean, initially, it was like, you know, one vote, two votes on the page, but they  were up to a few hundred.  There were some really intelligent comment threads on there.  Like I really quite liked it.  And you know, six months into the experiment or whatever, it was starting to get there  and it seems like they killed it off just as it was starting to get some real traction,  which I think is quite sad.  That would make sense.  You know, I mean, I mean, it did seem like they were doing well.  Let's kill it.  Yeah, well, that was just it.  It really seemed like it was going somewhere.  And now they've they've killed it and we'll never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think they said I think they said they were going to move it to some other  destination, but they never said where.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Take it out the back somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bury it.  Another Verizon Fios install gone bad.  This is from Mike's Techdirt.com.  Apparently, technicians started a fire at a customer's house when installing the Fios  service.  Verizon says we didn't do it.  Started a fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Verizon.  They keep claiming that it's not fire because there's only smoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this happens a lot.  And when there's smoke, there's fire.  It's a known fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Well, it's apparently happened a few times.  What are they doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are they doing? Are they are they melting the glass?  Are they blowing the fiber in the basement?  What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have I have no idea.  I mean, there are questions about the, I guess, competency or skill level  of the people that they have installed in these things.  But I mean, you know, it's it's it's really not just Verizon either.  I mean, certainly there have been reports of fire started by other installers for  other companies, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that makes me feel much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's good.  Right.  But I mean, I think it just it should raise questions about about all of these  things that you know, how well trained the installers are.  I mean, these people come in and they do some pretty, pretty serious wiring stuff  in houses all the time.  And when you hear multiple reports of of smoke or fire, depending on your position

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  on it, I think it's pretty worrisome.  I don't want any smoking in my basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or firing or firing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Smoking or firing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let's bring let's skip to the top bogus news story of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The biggest ladies and gentlemen, I need a little the biggest bogus news story of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the day. Skin signals betray a gamer's move, according to new scientists.  Now, that's not to say that there's not something to this, but the kicker is, you  know, let me read this.  The Budapest, of course, this is a problem.  University of Technology and Economics.  Interesting combination have discovered that a gamer's button presses can be  predicted two seconds before they make them.  Yeah, you think it's never worked in radio, Leo.  Two seconds is a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One thousand one, one thousand two.  Yeah, you're right. That's an awful long time.  All they need is half a second, frankly.  They're saying if you look at the graph, that there's a spike in the galvanic skin  response and you start perspiring right before you're going to click the mouse.  And so what's the application?  Oh, you can make a game no one could ever beat.  Well, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's useful. Well, you could just disable the guy's mouse thing just for a  split seconds.  I'm crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the Budapest Science and Technology or Economics and Technology Department  has come up with the ultimate practical joke.  Thank you very much. We'll remind you, April Fools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, obviously, the economics angle is if it's a game that nobody can ever beat,  you're just going to be putting in your quarters forever.  And so it's like the ultimate money spiller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How are you doing on Bioshock right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? I haven't really played it.  My Xbox has been on the blink.  Oh, you've got the three red rings.  I hate to I hate to be the harbinger of potential death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your Xbox crapped out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's not it's not looking so healthy right now.  I haven't had the three red rings per se, but every time I put a disk in, it  freezes.  That's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's not good.  No, Bioshock is such a good game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, this whole thing, this whole Xbox fiasco with these units failing left  and right, you know, I don't think it's discussed enough.  I mean, who are the people that were making these products from Microsoft or  who designed the box?  I mean, there seems to be something seriously wrong.  If they had the failure rate they're having.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that they haven't been able to fix it.  Right. They're still making them the same way.  How old is your Xbox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I guess about maybe 18 months now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you have an early one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a day one Xbox that never had a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had I have a well, mine has no problem either.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a friend who was talking to me earlier and he lives in them out on the  West Coast and he had to take he had to send his back and he took it to the DHL  depot and I mean, it's only in this sort of like little town and the guy at the DHL  depot said it was the third one he'd sent back that day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I wasn't going to play any Xbox games until Halo 3 came out just to make  sure that they didn't have it.  But Bioshock took me off guard.  It's really good.  It's really cool.  Another good story from the Tech Dirt Files.  A woman in China chopped her husband's hand off.  Blimey!  As he sat at the computer at an Internet cafe, she felt he wasn't paying enough attention to her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, that's the way to get the attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, apparently, according to you, Mike, the guy says he only noticed when the pointer on his screen  stopped moving and he felt some numbness in his hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently, it was quite a shock.  Yeah, you know, you read that story and it got reported all over the place and there isn't part of  you that wonders like how true that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think these stories coming out of China are all made up, but I love it.  I think the Chinese news, is it from Xinhua?  Is it from a legitimate news agency or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was posted all over.  I don't know. Again, I forget which one I linked to.  I think I linked to like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You linked to Computer Weekly.com.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think, you know, I mean, the New York Post had it.  But again, I don't know.  Do you trust the New York Post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that there's somebody in China who was working at Weekly World News and now that  got laid off and is now working for the Chinese news agency.  Because it happens almost every three or four months, we get some story like that.  Just a little bit strange.  I just love that, though.  I mean, you can't resist a story like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is. It's impossible not to do something with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'd be honest with you, I can't be sure that I would have noticed myself.  I could have been playing Bioshock and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the thing that I was wondering, which isn't explained in the article, is what she  used to chop off his hand.  Well, a cleaver, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where did you find that in a cyber cafe?  She brought it with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Walked down to the cyber cafe with the cleaver, found her husband and whacked  off his hand and he didn't notice at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then he didn't notice.  Well, maybe it was a very sharp cleaver.  So the good news is the bees...  Well, I don't know if it's good news.  It's good news for cell phone users, but the bees aren't leaving because of cell phones.  They now think the bees are leaving because of a virus that came to us from Australia.  I guess there's nothing more to say about that.  That's...  That's even the fact that I'm even saying this is just bizarre.  That's not great.  Well, yeah, you know, it's not good for honey, but it is good for cell phone users.  You don't have to feel guilty because there was some speculation that the reason the bees  were disappearing was that the cell phone...  I don't know who made that up.  Apparently, they made it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It wasn't...  I think there was a misinterpretation of a study.  Like a study came out that kind of brought that up as a possibility.  Right.  And the press kind of ran with it as, oh, yeah, that's exactly what happened.  And then even the guys who wrote the study were like, wait, wait, wait, that's not actually  what we said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were just saying that could have been, but it turned out to be a virus.  So...  Right.  Fear not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about this Steve Fossett thing?  That's kind of...  Which is crazy.  It's gone out to Amazon's mechanical turk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the deal is aviator Steve Fossett is missing and his good friend Richard Branson, who has  a little bit of money.  He first went to Google and said, is there any way we can use up to date satellite photos  from Google to search for him?  Up to date?  Well, that's where the first thing I thought was, wait a minute, Google Maps, you know,  Google Earth, it's ancient.  But apparently there are more up to date, you know, almost daily satellite images they  could use.  And now they're using the turk...  They're using the people on the turk to scan these images.  Is that what's going on?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, my favorite part of the story is they've already found 50 other missing, you know,  things.  This should be a full time job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody should always be going through these pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nevada is like filled with it.  And the problem with Nevada, my wife was raised there and she mentions this to me, is that  you crash land in Nevada and you're just out for a minute or two.  The coyotes, the buzzards and all the rest of the wool, you know, it's not wool so much,  but there's other animals out there that just carry your carcass off and you're just eating,  you're gone.  So apparently they are...  So I thought I'd liven things up with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.  You're dead.  You're history.  Well, apparently they think they've they might have found them.  At least they're going out.  The most recent, as we record this on a Sunday afternoon, the most recent story about 15  minutes ago is that crews are going out to yet another possible location.  That's an interesting use of technology.  When James Kim went missing, they tried to use these kinds of Google Earth thing.  It wasn't very successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Fossett was loaded with technology himself, but apparently, you know, that didn't do much  good.  Right.  Well, yeah.  Devices and radios and GPS and everything else.  But I guess if you crash, the technology breaks, you know, a smoke bomb would have been more  useful.  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's interesting how many, you're right, how many crashed planes they've discovered.  It's kind of incredible.  So, I guess if you want to participate, you can go to mturk.com and join the search.  There's no money reward, but you can participate in it.  I guess.  Well, so you have you tried this?  Well, are you just scanning through these satellite images, I guess?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, for the most part, you feel like a bit like you're in SETI or something.  Yeah.  Like you're looking for the needle in a haystack without much hope.  But.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got any more up tempo stories for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I got to pick things up before I do the article commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what about Apple trying to slash TV to 99 cents?  Yeah, I like that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope they do it.  You know, it seems NBC was, we didn't talk about this, I think, because it happened while  we were on hiatus.  But this stupidity of NBC just boggles the mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The court.  Yeah, I guess the whole thing may have been overblown by both parties.  That's just how it shakes up.  But I think they're right.  Ninety nine cents should be the price.  And the price for music should be 50 cents while you're at it or lower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There have been studies that say people buy more music.  Go ahead, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say lower on both accounts.  Right.  I mean, you look at look at all of MP3, whether or not you know, you agree about the  legality of it.  People are willing to buy music when it's super, super cheap.  And the dollar profit begins to get, you know, kind of expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess the question is, you know, obviously, if you're going to cut it in half, you've  got a double sales.  If you cut it by 20, you got increased sales 20 times.  I mean, can they do that?  How what is the right number?  There is a study.  I remember seeing a study, we interviewed him on the TV show out of Canada, that the  right price was a nickel for a song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it.  You know, curiously, a nickel was that what I'm sorry, the nickel was the old licensee  price that you'd pay if you wanted to go to Capital and put together one of those crazy  albums that they sell on television.  All the great songs of the 60s and you have a bunch of different songs on it.  The nickel was what you'd be paying for each one of those tracks as a licensing fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you had 20 tracks, you pay a buck.  Right.  And you make whatever else.  That's interesting.  And how much of that nickel went to Frankie Valley in the four seasons is the question.  What do you think?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Frankie's still touring, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what the price is.  Probably more than a nickel now, but that's what it used to be some time ago.  So here's a new story.  It's kind of a beat.  It's interesting that Nikon's finally countered Canon with a full frame digital  single lens reflex camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Canon's really been making hay with the fact that their pickup is 35 millimeters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that and everything, the fact that they're just, they're way ahead of the  curve when it came to competing in that market.  Even before they came up with the full frame, they were killing everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, Nikon's going to do a full frame.  It'll be very expensive initially.  Five grand.  Yeah.  Is it, is the issue CMOS versus CCD?  Is that the problem or are they all?  Not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, that's it.  I think as far as I can tell, the Nikon one is a CCD.  Oh, interesting.  So that's, and Canon's using CMOS's.  So, right.  They're still the only ones that.  Now I talked to you, I just had a meeting with Kodak the other day and about this  issue, cause Kodak's going to move to some, some CMOS sensors.  I think everybody's moving that way.  Aren't they?  Well, there, there, there's, you know, they're both, there's an advantage to both  technologies, but the, uh, they're not moving as fast as all the CMOS people  had predicted, that's for sure.  Right.  In fact, I have one number of bets with people in the industry about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It happened because the CMOS production got better and they were able to produce  bigger chips, higher quality, get rid of some of the defects.  Is that what was going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's still noise is the real issue with CMOS.  You have to have a lot of processing power on the, in the package to, to  kill the noise that CMOS produces.  I see.  But what's cool about CMOS as opposed to CCDs is that, you know, there's always  this issue with the lag time and CMOS never really had a lag time.  That's how the, the Canon could kind of jump ahead of everybody else because it  didn't have, CCD is a charge coupled device.  It has to be charged.  So you had to give it a jolt of electricity before it could actually  suck in the data with CMOS.  You don't have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had no idea.  Fascinating.  That is upbeat.  Thank you for lifting our spirits, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's another, here's another upbeat, feel good, little friendly, warm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This could be the feel good to it.  Cause you know, the last two, it was really the depressing to it.  So this  I wasn't here.  I wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Sony, Sony online entertainment, Austin studio presented the local  habitat for humanity with $10,000 to end poverty housing in the area.  And guess how they raised it?  How?  Funds were raised as part of an in-game event for Star Wars Galaxies, MMO,  and a video game.  Does anybody play that?  Well, all these in Texas and whoever were allowed to demolish abandoned or  unoccupied houses and buildings in the real world, in the game world,  in the game world.  Oh, how funny.  And then like, I guess maybe like for every building they demolished,  they paid a dollar and then that went to the local housing association.  I was amazed that 10,000 people are playing Star Wars Galaxies.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  They're still there.  Well, maybe that attracted them.  The fact that they could tear the old place down.  Maybe it was just vengeance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sony has wreaked on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go to Tatooine and tear the place down.  Well, I thank audible.com for supporting our show and in fact, our entire network,  a-u-d-i-b-l-e dot com slash twit.  That's where you can go.  If you're not an audible member yet, join there because you'll get a credit for a  free book.  And even if you decide not to stick around, there'll be no charge for that  free book.  Any now, confessions of an economic hitman, John, I have to say is still the  number one recommendation we've made.  That actually made it onto the audible charts because of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, people probably tell their friends too, because it's really an outstanding,  it's especially good to listen to while you're driving around.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to recommend, I'm finally coming to the end of something that I've been  reading for on audible for about, I don't know, six or seven years.  It's the Aubrey Maturon series.  There are 20 books, 20 books each about eight hours.  That's a lot of hours.  160 hours of listening to this 18th century sailing novels, but they're so  good and I'm so sad I didn't want to end it.  So I kept the last three, but I finally broke down and I'm reading them.  I highly recommend them.  The guy they have reading these is so good.  He just puts you right there.  You could smell the salt air, taste the hard tack.  You can feel the floggings and have the rum just warm you up.  It's just great.  You got to start at the beginning, which is Master and Commander, and you might  have seen the movie Master and Commander.  That's what's based on these.  But really, any of you ever read these?  You should read them, Will, because you're from Britain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, by the way, Leo, that Nikon camera is CMOS.  I'm just reading the article now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's what happened.  So they went to CMOS.  That's what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what happened.  No, I've been reading, Bringing Down the House by Beth Mesrick.  Yes.  Tell us about that.  It was fantastic.  It's about these MIT students who basically run like a card  counting ring in Vegas.  They do it for years and make millions.  And the guy has told this story basically because they got away with it and nobody  knew that they'd done it and they'd taken Vegas for millions and they wanted  somebody to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They would train people.  They would select you, carefully select you and train you in their methods.  And it was a team, so they never got caught because of the way they swapped off.  Right.  Very clever.  That's a wonderful book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there was a 60 minutes program on these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bringing Down the House.  That is a great suggestion.  Is that on Audible?  I hope it is.  Probably.  Everything is.  Let me just search.  There are 35,000 books.  No, it's not.  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no.  I thought I'd got a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you look and see before you recommended it?  I do.  It's a wonder.  You know how this is our book segment anyway.  This is our book segment and it is a fantastic book.  You know, there's another one similar idea, although not as successful,  called the You Demonic Pie.  Did you ever hear that one?  No.  Yeah, you should read it.  It's the same idea.  They built a shoe computer and it was actually crazy because people were  getting slightly electrocuted by the shoe computer.  Would you believe two shoe computers?  This is in the early 80s, so it was very early on and you'd use your toes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, I heard about this.  They busted these guys.  Yeah, you'd tap with your toe and you could do card counting.  It was a card counting computer.  Most good card counters just do it in their head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  But I mean, obviously with the shuffling that they, you know, they shuffle up 10  decks and shuffle up halfway through, it's very difficult, but this computer  could do it even with the multiple decks and so forth.  It's actually hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hysterical.  You know, I was visiting the back rooms of the Mirage once where they  were doing it.  I was just showing the security system.  Such security there.  Which is pretty cool because they have cameras everywhere and it's kind of funny.  But I was told by someone that they have, apparently there's a number of card  counting methodologies and now they have computers that the other side uses when  they're, if they suspect you as a card counter, they start putting your bets and  deal into the computer and they can figure out which methodology you're using.  And then if they can confirm it with your next two moves, they'll throw you out of  the place.  And they've got it to the point where now they can even find people who have  hybrid methodologies where they use a little bit of this guy's theory and a  little bit of that theory.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're doing this in their head.  I don't see why that should be illegal.  I could see not bringing in a computer or any assistant, but if you could do that  in your head, you should be allowed to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I know, but it's, but you're playing in a casino is a right, not a privilege.  So they can throw you out for any reason.  That just stinks.  It's not cheating.  Well, they're cheating you basically.  It's Vegas.  It's Vegas isn't a fair, is it?  Vegas, no, it's essentially, you know, Leo, yeah, it sounds right.  What would you say in terms of the libertarian perspective?  But the fact of the matter is if everybody could just card count, they would, they  would take the casinos for millions because it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what they're taking us for millions.  Well, that's what they already say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And how many people, how many people can actually card count effective in their  head?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's, it's, it's kind of almost a savant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some, apparently some techniques that you can use to make it easy.  I read beat the dealer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It didn't help me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got a better idea.  Just don't gamble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't read.  Yeah.  Don't read beat the dealer.  Then go to Vegas thinking you're going to win folks.  Cause you, it ain't going to happen.  Anyway, the book, the one book that we've mentioned here and we've mentioned for  now that they do have, I can tell you as the Aubrey Matron series, highly  recommended.  I cannot recommend it highly enough, but don't, you know, it's one of those  things you start reading and you just, you know, it's like candy.  You just got to another and another and other.  So give it a try at audible.com a UDIB le.com.  There's nothing like an audio book.  It just really is a great way to read.  I do all my reading pretty much now via audio and it's just, it's so wonderful.  A UDIB le.com slash twit.  And we really thank the folks at audible.com.  They they've continued on with us.  They're still with us and we like that.  All right.  I could tell that your pork is now almost done, John.  Actually chicken.  Chicken.  I hear the tapping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A little tapping of your fingers.  Well, there's no more news stories that I can see worth it.  There's nothing more to talk about.  We have been very slow in Newsweek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have.  Well, you know, it's good we took last week off because really, frankly, we  would have had nothing to talk about this week.  We have the the Apple announcement.  That's it.  I do really want to thank you, Mike Mazek for joining us and hope we haven't  scared you and hope you'll come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I'm sorry for disappearing at the beginning of the call.  No, that's all right.  We figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hope if he comes back with better broadband too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you sounded great at the beginning.  It's deteriorated.  I think net neutrality, by the way, there is a big story that we didn't talk about.  No, we didn't.  Did you see this?  The Department of Defense made a recommendation to the FCC that is  unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Like, and not just a recommendation.  They basically, someone said, I can't remember who, unfortunately, but someone  basically said their response was, was basically just saying what AT&T said.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's, it's, it's almost as if AT&T wrote the statement for them.  Yeah.  I'm trying to find the quote here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, we should talk about this next week.  I mean, you should get on Andrew Orlowski of the register.  We will.  Who, who of all people is very pro.  I mean, he's against net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I understand the, the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is he against, is he against legislation or is he against the whole concept of net neutrality?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, I can't, I don't understand what he's talking about, but he's, he's against  the, I think he's a little opposed.  Well, I'll get him on, but I know what the theory is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the free markets will, will, will overpower and so forth.  And if you're, if your ISP is blocking Google, well, just go somewhere else.  The problem is most people don't have that option, at least in the States.  We're lucky if we have two choices in broadband and if both of them are, you  know, big companies that block Google or ask Google for some backsheesh before  they get high speed internet to us.  I just think that's, you know, that's not going to work.  The market is not going to roll.  You've got Comcast, AT&T and Verizon all saying, yeah, we want money from Google.  And now the department of justice saying, yeah, what AT&T said, that's  real, that's exactly it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it justice or defense?  No, it's justice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's department of justice, antitrust division.  They say basically there should be no network neutrality regulations because  of course that's bad for internet innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was that before or after Gonzalez?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, good question.  It just came out.  So it's after Gonzalez, but he's not gone.  So it might well have been Gonzalez, who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it's his last screw you.  Could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said, Hey, you know, there's a long tradition of the, for instance, they  use as an example, the postal service, which charges extra for special delivery,  completely misunderstanding the point people are making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the tubes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Completely.  I mean, if nobody's saying, nobody's saying that an internet service provider  can't charge for bigger bandwidth.  They're saying that you cannot discriminate against a website like Skype and say,  Oh, well, we don't want Skype to have as much bandwidth as other guys.  And that's, they just completely misunderstood the issue.  It's all about Skype.  It's about Skype and Google and video.  Anyway, we'll, yeah, we'll talk more about that.  Maybe we'll get Andrew on the show.  I'd love to get Andrew on the show.  Actually, he's just, he's in San Francisco, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, he's in London now.  Oh, we moved back.  But yeah, but we'll can hook up with him and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah, you know, everybody in London, don't you?  Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fine.  We'll sort it out.  He says everybody, if you live in London, you thus must know everyone in London.  Of course, because London's such a small, small, small, small town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mike's site is tech dirt.com.  And it is really, I don't know how frankly you do it, Mike, because, uh, you  commentary on all of the news stories.  Very, I think very astute and right on.  And it seems like, uh, you do multiple postings every day.  It must be a more than a full-time job for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, pretty much.  But you know, if you, if you don't sleep, it's all sorts of  sleep is such a, such a, so overrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Here's the thing that stunned me.  You've been doing it since 1997.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Were you doing it as a blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, it started as a, as a blog in early 99, uh, 97.  It was an email newsletter.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Long, long time.  And now you've got this tech dirt insight community, which I think is a very  interesting idea where you're talking about mechanical turker earlier.  It's kind of the same idea where you, if you're an expert on something, you bid.  Well, actually some, what is this?  What is this music in the background?  Are you watching an old timey movie?  So if you're looking for analysis from experts, like say the Twitter panel, you  would, you would say, I want some information.  And then the Twitch would say, well, we, uh, we will, that'll cost you a million

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  dollars and then people will say, yes, see you later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I guess you've got quite a, I'm looking at the, uh, it just starts by itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's Bioshock.  Are you playing Bioshock?  Uh, I think it's a really good idea.  Is it doing well?  Mike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's been doing great.  It's, uh, been growing, growing very, very rapidly.  And it's been, uh, it's been really exciting, especially to see kind of, uh,  the analysis that's come out of the community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you can download, so there is free analysis so you can see what kinds  of things people are coming up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  We have, we have some samples on the site so you can check it out.  And then if you need analysis yourself, sign right up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it.  I need analysis, but it's going to cost me more.  That's for sure.  That's definitely for sure.  And it's, you're, you're, you're focusing on expert bloggers, but I guess that  really could be anybody, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, I mean, we're, we're, we're actually starting to open it up more and  more.  Initially it was, uh, we were using bloggers, um, you know, because we had a  really good sample of their writing and ability and their insight.  And, uh, there's been a lot more demand and people have been coming to us and  saying, look, you know, I've got all these published journal articles.  I'm an expert.  We're like, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm an expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  I am honest.  That's how I got started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent.  John, John was an expert in wine when he got started.  I don't mean whining.  I mean, why I transfer from wine to whining, whine to whining.  But, you know, in those days you didn't have to know anything to be a computer  expert because there was, you know, there was like two computers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you had a computer, there's more stories, by the way, people in the late  seventies who just, you know, for some reason for the Christmas or something,  they got an apple too for their Christmas present.  The next thing you know, they're ahead of the computer department at some company  because they at least had one.  Exactly.  In those days, you didn't have to know anything.  I know that that tell you that same story.  Yeah, I had the apple too.  So they put me in charge of all the computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now look at me.  I'm a dot com billionaire.  John C.  Dvorak's blog is at dvorak.org.blog since.  Slash blog.  Slash blog.  When did you start doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  About almost five years ago.  Look at that.  If I had started when you started blogging, I'd be a rich man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I started in 2001 and I just kept, I never got anywhere with it.  I just kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's because you never pushed it and you didn't do multiple postings and you  were very passive.  You weren't a real blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm not a real blogger.  I'm a phony blogger.  And of course, Will's blog.  Where is Will?  Is it Will with one L because it could fit on the arcade game dot at willharris.co.uk.  And when is your new company starting?  Any minute now, right?  Any minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hopefully a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any day now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thank you all for joining me.  Get it done.  You know, nowadays anybody who has an iPhone can be an expert.  Well, exactly.  So there you go.  Thank you all for joining us.  We'll see you next week.  Another tweet is in the can.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I should have paid attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what I'm going to do.  Too much work.  The problem is there's no limit.  My server's completely collapsed.  So here's the deal.  I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have the hell of a time.  What, what, what blue screens like?  Forget it.  I'm killing you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Eh, eh  it  baby  do and the tweet.  All right.  Doing the  tweet, baby.  Doing the  tweet.  All right.  Doing the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  tweet, baby.  Doing the  tweet.  All right.  Doing the  tweet,  baby.  Let's go round.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Round the  board.
