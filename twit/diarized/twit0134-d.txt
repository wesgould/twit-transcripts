Formerly of the Gilmore Gang, now of the Gang and the News Gang and of course of Gesture  Labs.  Steve, it's great to get you on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a great pleasure to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Gang has always been a must listen in the podcast world because you have some of  the best people on.  In fact, I'm stealing one of your regulars right now.  Mr. Dave Weiner, the man who makes this all possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well Dave's not a regular.  He invented podcasts as you recall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you appear on the Gang occasionally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but I'd like to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, could you have a word Steve about that?  I'll talk to Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know him.  Actually, Steve and I have never met.  This is the first time we've met except for a dinner at which Jason Calacanis held forth  and we never got to say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were at opposite ends of the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Calacanis was in the middle.  Dave Weiner is the man who makes this possible because of course he created RSS and bowed  to the requests of He Who Shall Not Be Named to add enclosures to it.  And there you go.  There you have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that all of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Adam Curry.  You're talking about Adam Curry?  Adam Curry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, who bet?  I don't think it was quite that way.  That might be somebody else's version of the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Again, this is why.  I'll tell you this much.  We could have both these guys on at the same time if somebody would just orchestrate it.  I could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want to do it?  Would you mind Dave?  I said no.  No, I don't want to do it.  Okay, see there you go.  That's why.  He doesn't want to do it?  Does not want to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  I'm like the straight talk express here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you a McCain supporter Dave?  He doesn't seem that way on Twitter.  No.  You've spoken on Twitter about your support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm supporting Obama.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's fun to follow you on Twitter because you can watch during all the events, the debates  and so forth as Dave basically starts losing it and spitting at Hillary.  It's really fun.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I'm going to leave now.  It's really quite entertaining.  You can talk about me without me here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no.  You have to stay here.  Also, John C. Dvorak, you hear his voice in the background.  He is at Dvorak.org slash blog.  Don't need to tell you that.  Yeah, you do.  Well, actually, I do.  You're right.  It's part of the deal, isn't it?  If I don't say it, I'll say it.  He'll say it.  Somebody.  Who is this guy?  You know, I've never heard of John C. Dvorak.  No, no, I'm talking about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who am I?  I know.  I know who you are.  I don't know who I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just the I'm the I'm your humble interlocutor interlocutor.  Is that a word?  Will Harris is from Britain.  He would know.  Is that a word?  And Will Harris is falling asleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there's an interlocutor monster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interlocutor nest monster.  Will, are you there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not a thing.  I had myself on mute.  It's quite exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will Harris from channel flip dot TV dot com.  I do that every time I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Close enough for jazz is my older tutu to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a big, a big, big big panel today and absolutely nothing to talk about.  So that's the kind of twit I like.  I will bring up a couple of stories and let you guys hash it out.  Have you been following the WikiLeaks story?  Anybody?  Yeah I have.  Going once.  WikiLeaks.org is a site, a Wiki site where people put, I don't know, stuff.  Leaks.  Leaks.  They call themselves a global defender of sources and press freedom.  And you can read amazing stuff there.  And it was shut down by a judge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah it was shut down in the United States and had to go to Sweden where they actually  have some tolerance for true freedom of speech whereas in this country we apparently don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A Swiss bank and its Cayman Island subsidiaries were able to get a summary judgment shutting  it down.  They asked Dynadot, which is the hosting company, to disable the WikiLeaks.org address.  Of course as you said John, they immediately moved it overseas and that solved that problem.  The good news is Friday a federal judge overturned that summary judgment.  But of course if this is going to continue to go to trial it was just a summary judgment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems you- Trial for what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it's a lawsuit.  You gotta go to trial, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean what was the lawsuit over?  That they revealed some confidential-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, publishing information that's proprietary information.  Which of course is a proprietary point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's what, here's what, here I'll read you the complaint.  The bank is bank Julius Baer and Company.  They claim that WikiLeaks displayed confidential, personally identifiable account information  of its customers as part of the revelation, the revelatory documents.  Which just seems like a reasonable thing for them to say, hey, you know, this is privacy  issues, this isn't just about us.  Of course one of the effective customers might have been a certain Ken Lay, former chief  executive officer of Enron.  In this case no targeted individuals were identified and so the lawyers for the bank  said you know, you have no right to release this information.  I think Judge White, if I'm Judge White and I hear that I'd probably say, yeah, let's  shut it down until we figure out what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although surely a more proportionate response would have been, okay, take those documents  offline.  There's no reason to shut down the entire thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a lot of other stuff on WikiLeaks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's absolutely tons of stuff and it seems ridiculous that you shut down an  entire website for one offending or allegedly offending webpage.  And so it just seemed like the lower court judge just didn't have much of a handle on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this, which was...  Maybe he didn't understand that you could have them pull down those documents without  pulling down the whole site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you'd think that these people would think to check first maybe.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, it seems to me that the courts, how long have computers been around anyway  that nobody seems to understand?  These guys are really old.  I mean, no, seriously, I mean, you know, we've had, you know, this whole thing started in  the 30s and then we had the personal computer revolution that started over 30 years ago  in the 70s and these guys still don't have a clue about anything.  And I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean, it was quite interesting to see that, you know, the judge in the case sort  of quite rightly posited and this sort of goes to like the thing of the internet.  Judge White said, maybe the reality of the world we live in is that when this genie gets  out of the bottle, that's it.  Well, it is.  If this stuff goes online, then you can take it down off WikiLeaks, but it's already in  50 other places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was his argument for the summary judgment, though.  But of course, you're right.  I mean, he was right more than he realized.  Steve, is WikiLeaks, I mean, do you think WikiLeaks is something worth defending?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, on its face, as John says, I mean, come on.  I mean, this is one on one, you know, rights of the individual to learn as much about what's  going on as possible in order to protect his family and his friends against attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is, there is no assurance on WikiLeaks that, I mean, anybody could post anything  here, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, now you're talking about whether we should ban Wikis, which of course I'm totally  in favor of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  Are you being facetious?  Of course.  We'll get to Jimmy Wales' personal troubles a little later on, but I mean, obviously WikiLeaks  is a good thing.  Dave, do you have an opinion on this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, seriously, I had a case where a lawyer that used to work for me threatened to sue  me for defamation if I didn't take down a bunch of things.  You know, I had very openly been writing about the problems that I've been having with this  guy.  And that's what I learned about defamation law.  And it can affect everybody, not just this one site.  And I would be surprised if there were a lot of people that are listening to this podcast  right now who haven't been threatened some way legally and have taken stuff offline as  a result.  That's the thing that I learned in that process.  I wouldn't take it offline.  And I said, you know, you're going to have to sue me, you're going to have to take me  to court.  And I learned about how all this stuff works.  And in California, there are pretty good protections against it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he did not sue you or he did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And was it a slap?  Did they treat it as a slap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the, yeah, no, never that part of it.  Never, none of it ever came to trial.  We settled.  Right.  It was a, you know, it's like every legal situation, probably with this WikiLeaks situation  as well.  Once you get the lawyers involved with it, then basically it starts turning into a mugging  almost immediately without any honor whatsoever.  You know, I mean, what are you going to do?  So I don't know.  I suppose people running WikiLeaks might want to avoid the trial.  I guess they taking it out of the country was a pretty good idea.  But yeah, our country doesn't have great protections for the first amendment for free speech.  It's kind of, it kind of sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, just to play devil's advocate, what about people who, I mean, if you were a customer  of this bank had nothing to do with anything except that you were a customer of the bank  and your private information is being put up on WikiLeaks, doesn't it seem like you  ought to have some recourse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your recourse is not for WikiLeaks though, is it?  It's with the bank.  It's not WikiLeaks that's actively gone and taken your information or being-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're the ones publishing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, how do you unring the bell?  I mean, once it's out, it's out.  So you just give up?  What's the recourse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your recourse is to go back to your bank and whatever recourse there is in American law  for disclosure of private information, that's what you need to do legally towards the bank.  I think the problem that this identifies is that most public sort of institutions, banks  or governments or whatever are increasingly bad at protecting consumer information in  an age where governments and institutions want to know more and more about it.  They seem to be getting worse and worse, actually keeping that stuff confidential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's the real issue right there.  I mean, they want to talk about something interesting is there going to be a meltdown  in the identity system and I think it's kind of obvious that that's coming pretty soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, let's back up a second and talk again.  Since we've got Will on the line here.  Look what's been going on in the UK.  First a few months ago they'd lost a couple of hard disks with all kinds of data and then  just the other day they lost another.  Somebody sold a laptop on some auction site or something and there was like a hidden disk  in there that had confidential information from the auction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I learned so much about this when I had to take my Mac in for repairs and I needed to  get a new hard drive and they wouldn't let me take my old hard drive back even though  I had paid for a new one.  So I wrote that one up and I found out that all kinds of people have lost, they've had  phone calls from people, they refurbish these drives and they've gotten phone calls from  people saying, hey, I've got your hard drive here.  And Apple felt like they were doing me some great big favor by letting me have the drive  back that I had paid for.  This is a huge, I mean some identity thief organization is going to get clued in on this  one if they haven't already and start buying up these used drives.  They've got a gold mine of information on these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Simpson Garfinkel did a study some time ago at MIT in which they actually did that.  They bought drives on a variety of sources, eBay used drives.  I can't remember the...  You're kidding.  Yeah and the stat was something like 80% of them were completely intact, had all the private  information they were giving to the gals.  In fact one of the drives they bought was from an ATM machine.  Oh my God.  And had all the ATM transactions still on the drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's hold on one second with this discussion since Dave brought up the anecdote.  Dave, how come you didn't demand to get the drive back?  What was the deal with that?  Oh my God, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was okay.  This was at the height of Christmas season.  I was in the Apple store in Emeryville and the place is jam-full of people.  They got security guards.  They look like they have guns.  They certainly have mace.  I'm all the way in the back of the store.  What the hell am I going to do?  How am I going to...  I could stand there and put my hands on my hips and say, you know what, I'm not leaving  until you give me my hard drive back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you talk to the manager?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, it's policy.  You can't override policy.  I mean, she showed me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Were you informed in advance that you weren't going to get the original drive back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, that's what they say, okay?  Because they showed me down in the fine print that I can't even read, that they would never  have let me take the time to actually read, that I actually did say that they could keep  all the hardware.  Although it's very...  What?  Although actually that's their interpretation.  I scanned that into the computer, put it up on my website.  A few tens of thousands of people read it.  And there was a lot of debate as to whether or not I had actually given up that hard drive  legally.  You know, there was no way I was walking out of there with that drive.  And they called the cops, and the cops would have put me in jail, John.  Is that what you want to see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if that was there, I would.  You would have loved that.  I know, I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dave, we and the EFF would have come to your support.  We would have raised money.  And no matter how many months or years you had to spend in jail, we'd be there for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my God.  That's bull...  You'll have to say like four-letter words on this show.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can say them, but they won't appear on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know which one I'm thinking of, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's more than four letters, actually, but that's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The salient part is the four letters.  You can say bull.  That's bull.  Yeah, but that's not as much fun as bull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just bleep you.  It's okay.  We have a clean tag.  I don't know why.  I think it's because we expect children to listen to this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if that's...  I should have asked before.  Well, I'll tell you this.  At least people should know about this.  I didn't know about it.  I mean, I'd usually swap out my own heart, so I probably would never discover the situation  because it's not that hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, people should know about it.  That's exactly right.  And they should go in there prepared.  And I think that because I made such a stink about it...  The best advice I got when this happened and it worked really well is just send an email  to Steve Jobs.  And that's steve at apple.com.  And that is what got them off their feet.  Oh, really?  Absolutely.  They're pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think any Tom, Dick, and Harry can write to Steve Jobs and get the action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, absolutely.  They had no idea who I was.  It made no difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said, Mr. Weiner, we have your hard drive here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  I'm writing about this on my blog and they go, oh, well, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's nice.  He's a blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Talk about respect.  And I've been a Mac developer since 1983.  Could I get a little respect?  Could I have my hard drive back?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're right.  I mean, the point is wipe your drive before you bring it in for repairs, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, if they wanted to get it, that's not going to help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you can't do that, throw the damn computer out and buy a new one because the data on  that drive is worth, I mean, if you got your social security number, credit card numbers,  and a few bank account numbers on there, it's, you know, a thousand, two thousand dollar  computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's an interesting sort of practical point.  What's the best way to get that stuff off?  I mean, I'm looking in disk utility on Mac.  They have a secure wipe.  They have a secure wipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what?  You can talk to those guys over at Drive Savers over here in Tiburon and they'll tell you  that if the CIA or somebody wanted to get to that information, there's residual data  on there they can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, hammers, fireplaces, furnaces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, even Simpson Garfinkel, who knows about this stuff?  He himself said, look, you do a couple of erases and rewrites, erase rewrite.  That's plenty.  This notion the NSA spooks have some sort of magic magnetometer that can read the drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I decided, Leo?  I said, look, I've got all this data sitting here in my house, right?  So I just took the drive and I put it on the shelf, on a bookshelf in my house along with  all the other crap that I've got.  And that is no better or worse protection than my data has always had.  Right.  So, you know, that I'll accept that.  What I couldn't handle was this thing going back to some place in Dallas or wherever it  was.  Well, it's resouled on eBay without being wiped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awful.  No, not eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It goes back and for all I know, the drive I bought from them was refurbished.  Right.  There is no guarantee that you pay retail for one of these things that it's new.  You don't get a guarantee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, your company, your country, Will, has a I think it's the MI5.  Somebody has a protocol for destroying data that involves grinding the drive up, the  platters in the drive up and then storing it in a safe.  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was at a trade show.  I'm sorry, a couple years ago I went and saw I was at one of the big trade shows and they  had a company that specialized in this.  And they have this huge shredder.  Yeah.  And they just take the entire drive, platters and all, and chuck it into this thing and  it becomes powder.  And the guy says, hey, this is the only absolute positive way to get rid of the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, there is a way, there's a machine that's been demonstrated that will take shredded  documents, even if you use a cross-cut shredder, and in an automated fashion reassemble the  document.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's not going to do that to a powdered hard disk.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just love the idea of a powdered hard disk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know why you don't just hook it up to a BitTorrent and just overwrite everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.  Just put a bunch of, you know, Pauly Shore movies on it.  Nobody will want it.  Nobody will want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As one of the people on Twitter, Steve, the problem is if you could do that, then you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wouldn't need to take the drive in to be repaired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Detail there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you got a technical problem there.  That's why you get the big bucks, Dave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's pause with our fabulous panel for just a moment because I would like to mention our  sponsor.  Then we'll get back to the action.  Of course, we're sponsored by audible.com.  A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot com.  Audible dot com slash twit.  If you'd like to sign up for Audible, a great place to listen to your favorite books.  Great place to learn.  I find that, you know, I don't have time to read as much as I'd like.  I fall asleep when I try to read in bed.  But the good thing about audiobooks from audible.com is I can listen in the car when it probably  would behoove me not to fall asleep, when I'm working out, when I'm taking walks.  And so I get a lot more reading done thanks to audible.com.  I've been an Audible subscriber for eight years now.  Over 300 books in my audible list.  No, that's another great thing about audible.  Once you buy a book, it's in your library forever.  You can always re-download it, listen to it again.  It's just like a real library, only it's an audio library.  If you're an Orson Scott card fan, his newest is just out, read by his daughter, I think.  It's for, you know, it's a young, for youngsters.  It's a youth, a juvenile, as they called.  I guess this is an older book that is now out for the first time, read by Emily Janis Card.  I'm thinking this is daughter.  The story is about patients and a girl and a great way to get, I think, girls interested in science fiction.  My kids loved Ender's Game.  I read it over and over and over again.  This is a great story.  It's called Worms, W-Y-R-M-S dot com.  And not only will you get excited by audiobooks, but I think this is a good way to get your kids reading.  Let them listen to Worms.  Yeah, the book came out in 87, but this is a new edition of it that just came out.  Worms, W-Y-R-M-S. It's not a kids' story.  It's not a kids' story?  Jammer says it's not.  Is it an adults'...is it a story for adults'?  All right, well, I'll let my kids read it because I tell you what, I think they love Orson Scott Card.  It's the story of patients, the only daughter of the rightful hip-tark.  Anyway, that's our audible pick for the week.  W-Y-R-M-S from one of my favorite sci-fi guys, Orson Scott Card, who I would like to get on this show at some point.  He's really good.  If you want to join, get yourself a free book, go to audible.com slash twit, A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot com slash twit.  And we thank Audible so much for their support.  Now back to the Weiner Gang.  Anybody play Scrabulous on Facebook? Anybody play the online Scrabble?  None of you guys. You all have lives. I play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't realize that works. I was going to pop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's the deal. This is actually a really good example of mainstream companies just not getting it.  So it's these two Indian brothers, they're in their 20s, Rajat and Jayant Agarwala, who played Scrabble since childhood.  Their mom bought them a Scrabble game to help them develop vocabulary.  They played it since childhood. They loved it. They used to play online.  The site that they played on went pay. And they said, wait a minute, we could write our own Scrabble.  They did. They created a site, Scrabulous dot com.  Didn't attract the attention of Hasbro and Mattel, who own the rights worldwide to Scrabble, until they made a Facebook application.  It became one of the most popular Facebook applications.  It's on my, actually I had to take it off my page because so many people were challenging me to Scrabble games.  I had 10 games going at once. It's addictive. They don't make a lot of money on it.  They say they collect about $25,000 a month in online advertising, you know, contextual ads next to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not bad for just sitting around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It ain't bad. And of course they don't own the rights to Scrabble.  I thought when I started playing it, this is interesting. I wonder how they get away with this.  But the point is that Hasbro and Mattel never made a digital version of Scrabble.  They never licensed it. Now they're trying to get these guys to shut it down.  They went to Facebook saying, turn it off. And instead of making a deal with these guys, they said, no, we got to put them out of business.  The point being that I would bet you more 15 to 30 year olds are playing Scrabble now than ever before.  I bet you this. I bought a new Scrabble set just because I enjoyed it so much online.  I bet you this is fantastic for their business. Meanwhile, they're trying to shut them down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the same decision that the record companies made.  Exactly.  And interestingly, we're about to see when the iPhone SDK is released, where evidently Apple is going to turn this into a store for software.  So is this going to be the same thing all over again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to find that out on Thursday. Apple's having a get together at its headquarters in Cupertino.  We don't know yet what they're going to do.  It's rumored that they'll require all applications to be sold to the iTunes store, that they'll control it.  And since Steve did say how much he liked the Nokia S60 verification process, it kind of indicates he might be kind of going down that path.  I just saw a rumor today that said, well, free applications will be available widely. It's just if you want to charge for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that is the model for podcasts. They're all free and they go right through the iTunes system without being stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although it bugs me because people, I don't know about you, Steve, but a lot of people I talk to say, well, wait a minute.  It's in the store. You press subscribe. How much is this going to cost?  They see it in the store and they go, oh, it's not free. You have smarter listeners probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know who's listening, but you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hear this all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know who's listening to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we know. Actually, we have a pretty good idea. There's Joe over there in Fremont. We've got a guy in the Netherlands, I think, who listens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, you've got a quarter of a million listeners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, about almost 200,000. Yeah. A little less than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what do you think that the majority of those people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it would be more people in general, not just for, I don't know about ours, but because we're kind of niche-y, but I think in general more people listen to podcasts if there were other ways to get it.  What do you think, Dave? I mean, don't you think it's bad that iTunes and Apple kind of dominates this space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't care. What I care about is that I get good podcasts to listen to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They made it easy. I mean, they came along and they turned it around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't use their podcatcher. I use my own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, of course not, right. But unfortunately, most people use iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I think that's unfortunate. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there is no ecology for third party because Apple owns it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't agree with that. I think that there have been an incredible number of examples of markets where people said things like that only to find out that there actually was room for a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good. I hope that's true. I mean, I've seen so many like iPod or X go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's because they went, right, they didn't have to go away. It was a free product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where are the third party podcatchers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the iPod or X was, they bootstrapped it. I mean, Adam bootstrapped the original version of that code in order to get something that worked.  I mean, nobody was sitting around waiting for that to become a big company. They were glad that it was there and everybody was glad when Apple started to support the idea themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we weren't 100% glad. I mean, I didn't like all the extra crap they threw into RSS when they could have used stuff that was already there.  That's annoying.  Just a simple phone call up front could have solved a lot of those problems, but I found out about it at the same time everybody else did.  I mean, they're not a great citizen in that regard. I love their products. They use their computers, but they could have done a better job there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking for Ray and August who developed iPod or X, they were terrified when iTunes started supporting podcasts and it did in fact put them out of business and they did not want to be put out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't say that it did in fact put them out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It did. Their sales just plummeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what you think, okay?  No, they told me that.  Well, cause and effect. I mean, all right, you don't know for a fact that it couldn't have been managed, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're right. I mean, somebody could come along to a third party podcatcher, but I don't see anybody doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could say that with any company that goes out of business, Dave.  There could be all sorts of reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying, right? You don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know, but I can suspect. It seemed to be pretty-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all I was saying. You can say I suspect and I wouldn't disagree with that.  Okay, I suspect.  But you know for a fact is like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't know for a fact. They were doing fine. Apple puts out iTunes. All of a sudden nobody buys their product anymore.  And it could have been because of the sunspots, but it kind of looks like it was iTunes.  In any event, I don't see anybody coming along saying, yeah, I see Yahoo getting out of the business.  Audio getting-  I took out the podcast for three weeks ago.  Oh, good. Where is it? Let me download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Flickrfan.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Flickrfan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, you didn't put it in the URL when you introduced me. It's scripting.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I just assumed everybody knew. You're right, Dave. Scripting.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  200,000 people listen to this podcast, Leo? I don't think they all know. I don't think any of them ever heard of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You and your laughing. Raise your hand if you've heard of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at them. Look at them all raising their hands all over the world.  They're all holding up their lighters.  They're in a bad mood today.  No, Dave's in a good mood. Dave's cheerful. He's positively cheerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now that you mention it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, you should be the authority on cheerfulness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Flickrfan. I'm looking at this. This is interesting. So what are you doing here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's quite a little story.  Basically, let's see. I went down to visit a friend of mine at a newspaper in South Carolina.  And I had a few minutes. He had to go to a meeting and I was sitting there in his office.  And he had this screensaver running and there were pictures from, you know, current events.  Sports stuff. World leaders. And, you know, so it turns out it's kind of obvious what he was doing.  He had the, his screensaver was pointed to a folder of AP Wire news photos.  And so I asked him to put together a feed for me. It had those pictures.  And I put it on my big screen TV in my den.  And every time anybody would come over, it's like they would just get drawn into this thing.  It's an amazing thing. So I called up some friends.  So I wanted to make this software publicly available to everybody.  And so I called up some friends of mine at Associated Press and asked them if they would give me a feed, you know, officially.  So that we could do this all legally and, you know, it would be high res. And they said yes.  So that's the bundle basically. It can also grab stuff off of your Flickr account,  your friends Flickr accounts and mix all that stuff in there.  And then as a result of this, a couple of weeks ago, we got another feed from Agence France Presse.  And yeah. And so like we were getting like maybe 20 pictures a day from AP.  We're getting about a thousand pictures a day from AFP.  And so that's, you know, AP is worldwide, but AFP is like even more worldwide.  And it's so that was the first step.  And the thought is, let's decide, let's define what a living room computer is and what it does, a networked living room computer.  And so the next thing after that is podcasting.  And I also, of course, had a podcasting client that I had written.  I wrote mine even before Adam Curry wrote his.  And so I understood how to do that. And I had one sitting around.  I distributed that to all of the users of Flickr fan and slowly we're going to connect all the dots.  And it's going to be different from Apple TV when it's done in that Apple TV is completely different philosophy.  And Apple TV is built on the idea of, you know, of making money off of each transaction.  This takes the podcasting view of things and says, we're not trying to do it quite that way.  There will be money flowing through here for sure.  It won't work if there isn't. But it's not going to be for the, you know, the content per se that you're going to be paying the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's the idea.  So it's a it's a picture catcher, but it also will have podcasting catching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. It has podcast catching and it has a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cool. Yeah, I'm confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's all right. Why are you confused?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure what is the for one. I don't know.  I just did the whole thing. It just I'm not getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, David, this is something maybe you want to address.  I think RSS in general confuses people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's not I'm not confused by the RSS.  I'm just trying to figure out what it is. Just like to show you just have a screensaver or things, a random podcast or I'm not getting it.  What puts it in the folder? No. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The screensaver stuff goes into a folder and syncs up and it's just a bunch of photos from Agents Press or France or whatever.  Oh, well, no. And then you point your Mac screensaver at the folder that it's managing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can you can subscribe to Doc Searle's photos version, which is great stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Docs has great photos. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So anything that has an RSS feed you can subscribe to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. So we understand that part. Now explain the podcasting part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, podcast your it just does the same thing only with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's like radio. It's like listening to the radio.  Interliving room. If it's an activity, you know, listening to news broadcasts or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm getting this echo. So it's very. Oh, I'm sorry. You're still getting an echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I just started getting it again. Yeah. I'm hearing it, too. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK. It's it's coming. I think it looks like it's coming from me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, let's get it. Let's just let's discuss this as on a practical basis,  which is when I'm hearing myself, by the way, I'm hearing you twice now.  How's that? Let me test it.  Now I'm still hearing it slightly. I have no idea what's going on.  It was you go back to the way it was. I didn't touch anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You sound great, Leo. So if you could like interpret for us, that would be great.  Yeah, I apologize. I'm not sure where the echo is coming from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, Dave, how do I get my podcast into the stream?  That's what I'm wondering. Into your stream?  No, to the stream is this is whatever this cloud is. People would subscribe to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can't do this. I can't. You can't hear it at all.  Well, no, I can hear it, but it's like reverberating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, hold on. Let me let me look at why it's worsening. It's worsening.  Oh, yeah. All right. Is it is it better now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Talk. Hello. Hello. No, it's good. It's all fixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, well, it's coming. I know where it's coming from.  It's it is coming back to us on the phone channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's my fault. I knew it. It isn't your fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the box I'm using. For some reason, seems to be feeding.  All right. Let's let me try to answer John's question.  Go ahead and I'll fix it while you're talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The whole story I told about the pictures, that's a separate story from the podcatcher.  OK, the podcatcher works more or less the same way you would expect the podcatcher to work.  As you if you want to subscribe to this week in technology, you click on the link to say subscribe  and you enter the URL of their feed and you click submit and it reads the feed.  And now every time it does a scan, it'll check to see if there's a new podcast from Leo.  It's nothing fancy about the podcatcher.  It's it's pretty plain Jane.  That doesn't mean that it won't get fancy.  But right now it's the basic part catching functionality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, yeah, that's great. I mean, it's back only and it's not, you know, I mean, it's not widely known yet.  But I think we've helped a little bit here. Flickr fan dot org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I would just say one thing, which is that my bet is that what Dave's doing here is actually  creating the ability for people to use a server based environment to create RSS feeds for themselves  with enclosures attached, which there's that too. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me let me OK, let me let me rock that so I could create.  Oh, I'm sorry. Rock showed up. Yeah, that's a bad sign.  Next, I'll be comparing it to Nazis.  I'll get a bad neck. That's Heinlein's law.  So you're saying, Steve, that I would want to create my own RSS,  that everybody would want to create their own RSS feeds locally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, how do you create an RSS feed now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, right now you create content on the Web and generally whatever you're doing will have,  say, a WordPress blog will have an RSS feed. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you use WordPress as a RSS generator. Right. OK.  So what you do is you drop into a folder.  Suppose you just want to be able to assemble all your favorite political broadcasts for the day.  Right. OK.  I think you could do that with Dave's software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just put in a, in other words, kind of reverse the process, put in a folder and FlickrFan would broadcast it out,  would make an RSS feed out of it? Yeah.  Where would I serve that from? Locally? Wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or would I have to? Hold on a second.  Well, how's this different than OPML, which Dave invented?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. It's, well, they're formats, John.  So it's like, you know, people get confused between the application and the format.  You know, RSS, when people talk about RSS, you have to ask, you know, what are you talking about?  Are you talking about the reader that you use or the blogging tool that you use or the actual RSS feed,  which is almost never what people are talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In your mind, RSS is merely a specification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I have a pretty, you know, if I talk to people about it, I have to try to bring it to them on their terms.  You know, you say people have a hard time understanding it.  The best way I've found to just to explain it to people is to say that it's automated web surfing.  And that's something most people can understand is that, you know, when you're browsing around the web,  you're sort of, you know, you're doing it manually.  But if you sort of have a pattern to that, then you can teach the computer how to do that for you.  And then ideally, it would only find the new things.  Now, that's, I think, where a lot of the RSS readers today have fallen down because they're not very good at doing that.  But, you know, that's another story.  Can I just ask?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, this is something that I would love as the ultimate RSS application.  I have to say I've never used RSS much because I tend to like I want to go to a website and scan the headlines.  Right.  But what I would love is for an RSS service to pick out stuff that it thinks I would like based on things like, you know,  every blog has everything that is tagged like crazy now, every blog entry.  Is there any specification or any way of getting an RSS reader to bring you particularly tagged items?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I use? I think this is what you would like.  So both FeedHub and Aid RSS have, will look at your OPML and then create a feed for you of the most highly quote ranked stories in that.  Based on, I guess, how other people are linking to it.  It creates kind of a hot feed for you.  But FeedHub does this and I think Aid RSS does it a little bit better.  A-I-D-E-R-S-S.  Is that, I'm not sure if that's exactly what you're thinking.  What I do is I subscribe to a feed created by Aid RSS that's a meta feed of all of, from my OPML,  of highly ranked stories in that big pile of stories that I get every day.  Okay.  A-I-D-E-R-S-S dot com.  That'll be worth.  So it says it uses post rank, whatever the hell that is, to score, filter and track performance.  It's like a tech meme.  It's a meta feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This brings up an interesting issue.  Which is that if you do that Leo, and there's so many things that are tagged as Will says,  how can we come on the show today and you say right off the outset, we got nothing.  I got 18,000 pieces of nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's too much of nothing.  Too much nothing.  It's a man-filled ill of ease.  That's a Bob Dylan quote.  I like it. Say it again.  Too much of nothing makes a man-filled ill of ease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As usual, Dylan always has the limo just.  So to get back to original discussion, you feel like it is an open playing field for somebody  who really understands RSS, Dave, and can create these useful tools for people.  Well, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, the reason why I feel that way is that nobody has yet made a...  Perfect tool.  No, I was going to say a podcast player that really, really works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about Google Reader works pretty well? I mean, it's web-based, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem because podcasts have to be on your iPod.  They have to be on your iPod, right? Or whatever.  And the iPod is not a very good podcast player.  The iPod was designed to play music, and music, if you think about it, is very different from a podcast.  A podcast is something that you listen to once and then that's it.  If you listen to a podcast that plays music, you buy a song for 99 cents, and if it threw it out after one listen, you'd be pretty upset.  But they'd love it.  Yeah, they would dig it, right.  But the thing is, if you started with the assumption that this handheld thing that you're going to carry around with you  is specifically for the purpose of listening to podcasts, you would design it very differently from the way iTunes works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very, very differently.  What would you do? How would it look?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, to begin with, the podcatcher would be built into the device itself,  and it would have Wi-Fi capabilities, and it would not have to tether with a desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I guess if you had an iPod Touch and Apple opened the SDK, you could write such a thing because of the Wi-Fi built to the touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, what do you want to bet that they don't open the SDK for that right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a lot of F's in that one. Plus, it ought to cost a little bit less than an iPod Touch costs, too.  I mean, think about it. What would the basic components of that be?  And also, I would say one of the important features is that it doesn't come from Apple because we'd love to see some competition here.  There's another one that I consider a basic requirement for this is that it has to be possible for me to put my own software on there.  And because if you end up beholden to one company and provide all the software, we know where that goes.  And there's this third thing, is that you have to be able to record a podcast on it as well as listen to one.  We've been on all good platforms, and John, we all probably go back far enough to remember the Apple II and the IBM PC and the early days of the Mac.  The thing that makes a platform successful is the fact that you can use the platform itself to create software for the platform.  Well, you can't use an iPod to create software for the iPod, which would be basically music or podcasts.  So those three things, it needs to be able to get the podcast without having to tether up to anything.  And it's totally technically possible and not very expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know what you're suggesting here, not to interrupt your stream of consciousness.  No, that's okay.  But what you're suggesting here is essentially a real use for what has been a floundering subcategory of kind of palm-based small computers, pocket computers, whatever you want to call them, the ones that have been usurped by the phone.  You know, these little things that run, you know what I'm talking about.  PDAs.  PDAs, there's the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to go too far back.  Go listen to the, you know, you work for Adam now, right?  So Adam and I were doing a series of podcasts in the fall of 2004 called Trade Secrets.  And this is what we were talking about is, well, what would podcatchers look like?  You know, we were hoping, you know, a year or two down the road.  Well, here we are like four years later and, you know, nobody wants to, well, that's right.  And if you want to understand why, well, don't depend on iPod or X to do it.  It's a big business, right?  To make this hardware, you would need to have like the kind of money that Pod Show raised originally would have been a good amount of money to create one of these things.  Well, Pod Show went in a different, I would say not a very productive direction.  I think it would have been much more courageous to have said, let's just go make this thing really work.  And nobody's done it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of running, the idea of making a dedicated podcast player kind of runs against the traditional thinking consumer electronics right now,  which is that people want more converged devices, not less converged devices.  They want a phone that can do music and music player that can do Wi-Fi and Internet.  And actually what people want is eventually, you know, five years down the line, one device that is just phone, mobile Internet, music.  Yeah, you get one device with a lot of mediocre stuff in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, don't we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they necessarily want to extend devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish you wouldn't focus on that part of it because there was no requirement that it be a standalone device and only do this.  But in order to, I mean, I'm a software designer and developer, in order to actually understand these things, you need to sort of like zero in on what the feature set has to be minimally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, of course, any general purpose laptop can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. That's true. And that's one of the reasons why I wanted to make a podcatcher and get that all right.  You know, first and user tested and make sure that everybody's happy with it before we even think about what the next steps are going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Steve, you were saying you were saying that this though, it becomes you serve it yourself.  I mean, you're saying that I would run a server on my system that is serving my own RSS feeds kind of or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. What I'm saying is that if you look at what's going on, this so-called on demand software as a service revolution, it's all the data is stored in the cloud.  It's cloud computing.  So the ability to be able to create RSS feeds, not in your system, not under your requiring your knowledge of programming, et cetera, et cetera, is, I think, a very valuable asset that will proliferate.  If you look at things like Twitter and Facebook and just all of these platforms, which are basically offloaded from your hard drive to the network services that you can configure more or less granularly, hopefully more and more as time goes on.  This becomes a console, sort of a dashboard that people are going to want to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about something like FriendFeed, which is an aggregation of my feeds that I can follow somebody else's FriendFeed.com. This just went public last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. But I don't think FriendFeed supports enclosures, for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it kind of does. If you subscribe to somebody's feed, you'll see their images, but then you do click to get the full image on Flickr.  So, yeah, you're right. It would be nice if it included the actual data files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just want to push back a little bit on something that Dave's saying, and not Dave specifically, but just the notion that these, the sort of panacea of if we can just all get together, you know, the Rodney King approach to software development.  I just don't, I don't buy it. I think that what happens is, is that things like what Dave's doing, what he calls the first step, I think is the step.  I don't see a player coming along, you know, and somehow by player I mean software or hardware manufacturer coming along and suddenly usurping Apple.  I mean, these guys are brilliant at design. They may not be better than the imaginary better system that has never been created, but they're the best ones out there.  And they're going to continue to be the best ones out there. And they have tremendous market force. And, you know, the real battle, I think, is to, is to uncrate the, you know, the SDKs little by little to the point where we can do what we want to.  What Dave wants to do in not having to be tethered to the machine, to the laptop, and to go straight to the device over Wi-Fi, that is what we want.  But how we get there, I don't think that we get there by trying to create an ad hoc, you know, revolutionary group of hardware manufacturers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me beg to, let me give you a counterexample, okay? And maybe you're right. I'm not saying that that's not right, Steve. And I use an iPod and I've bought everything.  I, you know, I've tried everything and what I take with me is an iPod. So I'm pretty flexible about it. I'm not, like, religious about not using Apple stuff. I'll use it if it's the best thing out there to use.  But we've had an interesting thing happen over the last few days relative to Twitter and Pounce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just going to bring that up because Pounce is including the full fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah. Well, no, no, no, no. Pounce, there's, they both have APIs, right? And for a long time, Pounce didn't have an API. Then they came out with a pretty limited API, right?  And sometime in the last two or three days, I never got an email from anybody saying you need to go look at this. It just sort of happened to stumble across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think on Friday they released it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now all of a sudden they've leapfrogged Twitter and they're giving us all this new capability that I have been asking for openly, you know, I call it payloads.  And I've been asking for it because I've been doing all this development around Twitter to send photographs over Twitter, to send podcasts over Twitter.  You know, we have Twitter as a voicemail system, basically.  I think you're the one that broke Twitter.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. It all, really. All right.  No, he did. That's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He broke Twitter.  All right. Well, maybe when Steve says that, I'll agree.  Okay, Steve says that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, good. But what was I going to say? Yeah, so, okay, so now I read on Fred Wilson's blog.  And Fred is the VC that, you know, put the money into, or at least the lead investor in Twitter, says sometimes, and of course I kind of understood this, that sometimes when the competitor does something, then you have to do it, right?  And so if we can put this stalking, this, you know, sort of thing that Apple has to go catch out in front of them, then we'll get what we want out of Apple.  Apple won't give us what we want just because they're guys.  Right. But companies, you know, I've always, I learned this when I was running a software company and I watched lots of people run technology companies, and the people you listen to the best are your competitors.  You don't listen to users. You like to say that you do, but you don't, you listen to your competitors.  And so that's what, that's the, it's in that spirit, Steve, that I say we need somebody other than Apple to do this, because you'll sit around waiting forever for Apple to, maybe for all I know, they may have it,  and that may be the thing they're going to announce on Thursday, you know, and then I would be one happy camper if that happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seems unlikely. So what did, tell us a little bit about what Pounce did that you think is so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's two-way. I mean, it basically, there are two things. First of all, you can now post to Pounce in addition to being able to read stuff through the API.  But you can also post content. So you could say, for example, you wanted to distribute this week in technology to everybody who subscribed to you on Pounce.  We could give you a programmatic way to do that. You could drop the MP3 into a folder and it would automatically just, you know, lift it up there and you wouldn't have to do another thing.  So we like that a lot. And, you know, in Twitter you can do that, but you have to put the URL into the actual message itself.  And people say they like that, but I don't think that I don't like it. And I'm a techie, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's already pushback about all the hashtags, all the crap that's in the Twitter post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we ought to start taking the crap out. They call that in, I heard Paul Saffo, the first guy I heard say this, he said, we need to pave the cow paths.  That's how technology works at its best. You know, in other words, figure out where the cows are going.  And then a few generations later, that's where I-80 goes, right, John? Where we live in the East Bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, except I prefer to have the cows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell me about it. I can see John's house right now, I think, from my window here.  Are you in a car?  No, I'm in my study upstairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, let me get my 30-06.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought you were going to put the Confederate flag out the window.  Well, it's interesting. I mean, it sounds like people are making motions in this direction.  I think we're seeing a real evolution in how people use RSS and how people publicize. I love it that people are exposing APIs like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're in an incredible time of movement. Things are really, really, really moving now. I mean, it's like Steve, you know, Steve's very psyched, right, Steve?  Yeah, I just completely disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to listen very carefully. He disagrees, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, this isn't my show or I would be unstoppable.  Go ahead. Please.  Trust me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got a cup of coffee. I'll sit back. I'll relax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, all right. So this thing about pounce. Now, I've been polling people this afternoon about who's going to win Ohio because I talk about this other thing that we can't talk about, like it's called the election.  You could talk about it. Hell yeah.  So this other thing, the election in Ohio seems to be worth coming down to. So I've asked, you know, who's going to win Ohio? Who do you think is going to win Ohio on this call?  Obama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know. It's Hillary's still got the poll numbers, right?  Uh-huh.  It's going to be a tough one. I'm predicting a tie in a win in Texas for Obama, a tie in Ohio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. And DeVorek, you're not going to answer, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I like to bet on these things. And this one to me is not, is a toss-up.  Unpredictable.  So I'm not making any sort of...  There's no Vegas line, is that what you're saying?  There's no line on this. Yeah. Pick them is the term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Will, do you consider this to be relevant to your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Ohio for Clinton, but Texas for Obama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. So, all right. So it's three to one Hillary.  So now the second poll that I ginned up was Twitter versus Pounce one year from now.  Which one will be the winner?  Twitter.  That's what I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's not, because it's not about API. Look, the functionality has been there for Pounce for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but it is about API. It's about the fact that what Dave's doing, whether he wants to say so or not,  is he's just trying to get Twitter to do what he's been wanting to get it to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he kind of intimated that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, he intimated it, but is he really going to be developing on Pounce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not what I want, Steve. What I want is a two-party system.  I want at least a two-party system.  And so, you asked what we think is going to happen versus what we want to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys are talking about technology, and I think you're missing the social side of this,  which is, I mean, why is Facebook successful right now? Because everybody's there.  It's not going to be successful forever, but at some point somebody will come along.  I think that's why people are on Twitter.  That's totally correct.  I would hate to, I don't want to be on Twitter. I far prefer Pounce. I far prefer Jaiku.  Twitter is a piece of junk. It's down half the time, but it's where everybody is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the reason it's down half the time is because it's where everybody is.  Well, we could argue that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you saying it's impossible to design something like this that would work, that would scale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eventually, if they get 300 million from Microsoft, suddenly it will work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. It's not scaling very well right now. But neither is Pounce, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You reminded me of what Yogi Berra said, you know, nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the community on Twitter. I dislike the functionality on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You dislike the name, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was another issue, but I got over that.  Did you get a settlement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This would be said for elegance and simplicity, right? Twitter just does...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter is simple without being elegant.  That's just what it is. But I think most people would prefer Twitter, most people prefer Twitter.  They would just like it to work.  No.  I eventually gave up using it because I had one of these desktop clients and it seemed like every other message I was posting was just going into Twitter.  Just like going into the ether.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. For most of last week, nothing I posted was seen anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's just look at it. There's a fork in the road for Twitter here, okay?  If Twitter doesn't implement the payload functionality, then there will be applications that develop on Pounce that will be unique to Pounce.  If they do implement the payload functionality, then Pounce has got a problem.  Can you explain to the audience what you're talking about?  Okay. I have an iPhone.  If I go down to... I'm taking a walk and I see some beautiful flowers or something on it.  I take a picture of that.  Then I say I want to email this picture to Flickr, which is a basic feature that Flickr has.  I do that and I type in the title for it.  I say beautiful flowers.  That goes up to Flickr.  Now I've got a script that's sitting on one of my servers, which anybody can use.  It's called Twittergram.com.  What it's doing is watching my Flickr account.  When a picture shows up there, it then sends a link to that picture to Twitter.  Everybody that subscribed to me on Twitter now sees that picture.  It's a very simple idea.  Twitter works great for short text messages.  Why not send pictures over Twitter too?  That's what I want to do.  Enough other people want to do it.  It makes sense that you want to do it.  Does Twitter do that or does Twitter not do that?  That's the fundamental question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pounce does do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Pounce does it beautifully.  Twitter does it in a very ugly way.  I can throw the URL into the message.  For right now, everybody's willing to live with that.  But when you see how beautifully it works on Pounce, you might say,  oh, wow, I would like to have that.  That's very elegant.  I would like to have that in Twitter.  That's what I say when I saw it.  I put a post up yesterday.  It's on Techmeme right now.  I just noticed.  Basically, you can illustrate the benefit from a user's standpoint very graphically.  Pretty versus ugly.  Pretty counts in software.  It really does.  Do you have to compromise the simplicity of Twitter to do this?  Yeah, a little bit.  You have to give up a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where do you have to compromise?  I said a little bit.  I didn't say a very little bit.  How do you compromise a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little bit.  Now it gets a little bit more complicated.  Now there's a little icon on every...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why do you want to save Twitter?  If you've got Pounce, why not just go to Pounce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not my decision.  You see, I don't give a bleep whether Twitter gets saved or Pounce is the winner.  It doesn't matter to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, most users, though, who are not engulfed in all of this as you are,  are just going to choose.  They're going to go.  Right now, they're choosing Twitter for reasons I'm not sure I fully understand.  I guess because that's where everybody is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess.  I mean, of course that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some people use Blogger and some people use LiveJournal, right?  Why did some people choose to use LiveJournal when Blogger does everything everybody would want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's different because Blogger is not as much about community.  Twitter and Pounce are all about community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I beg to differ.  LiveJournal is very much about community.  That was the differentiator.  That's what made it different.  Why didn't everybody go from Blogger to LiveJournal?  Because some people like this mix of features better than that mix of features.  See, they can go to this.  So why is everybody on Twitter?  Because it's the only actual...  Because it was finished.  It's it.  Pounce had too many problems.  It was invite only.  And they're not directly comparable, Leo.  I mean, they don't look the same, right?  The Pounce message is a big thing.  The Twitter thing is a little thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We already have a payload in text.  It's called the blog world.  Why do we need to reduplicate that in one packet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're in favor of 140 characters, period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not that I'm in favor of it.  It's, you know, am I in favor of these things they call paintings?  You know, it seems kind of limiting that it's only in two dimensions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can I interrupt for a second?  Yes.  I want to apologize to the audience because under most circumstances,  I'd be in here into this debate, having these guys wrap it up,  or let's move on to the next topic.  But there's a weak spot here, and I want to just mention it,  and I want to apologize in advance.  I actually like listening to this kind of weird discussion,  so I'm kind of enjoying the banter,  and you guys can all turn the podcast off if you don't.  Thank you, John.  I'm not going to do anything about it.  Thank you for saying that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and I appreciate you telling everybody to stop listening.  No, I'm letting it go, too, because I think it's as fascinating.  I think it's actually a very important conversation.  Yeah, we need to adopt supervision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, Leo, I'm going to ask them,  I can tell them that maybe they should stop listening,  but not until they go to audible.com. Does that help?  Yeah, stick around for the commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's going to be the best part of the show today.  No, this is fascinating stuff,  and I think it really comes, it's very important stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's interesting to me because there are these,  these are seminal software systems out there that are jockeying  for all kinds of positions that are not generally well known by the public.  I mean, they're known by all the insiders, and yeah, there's a lot of people,  but it's still, if you looked at true market share...  It's not mass market, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not even close, not even in the bulk part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know, until John Dvorak starts saying that it's absolutely bullish,  it's not going to take off anyway.  So, you know, we're just waiting for you, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why you want to have Steve around, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think John said Twitter was bull to begin with.  I think John is already on record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, because I mean, I didn't see that.  I saw the blogging is bull, and I saw the podcasting is bull to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I didn't want to go, I'll tell you what the thing is with Twitter.  I've had too many guys who have found very interesting and practical uses  for the product for generating messages to a group of people  that may be just subscribing to the one feed.  And I've seen other use, and generally speaking,  people who just get on Twitter and they blab about the fact that they're at a stoplight,  or they want to show off the fact that they got a new cell phone that's got a keyboard,  and they talk about it, or they say stupid things that are just like,  Oh, I watched the movie last night, it sucked, and things like that.  That to me is just a bunch of hot air that is not necessary,  that shouldn't even be in the cloud.  But there are a lot of other actual practical uses that people are developing  for some of these systems that are actually quite fascinating,  whether the shooting a million photographs and having them distributed over pounds  is one of them, I'm not sure, but I can see where it could come in handy  in the case of an emergency, or if you had an emergency crew,  or if it was a police department that wanted to, you know,  it had a bunch of guys with little cameras and you could coordinate this information,  it was used as information.  Yeah, I'm not going to, I mean, I think there's part of it's bullshit,  and part of it's really pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, part of it is surely like, for me, what I find, I think, slightly not annoying,  but curious, is that there are so many degrees of doing almost the same thing  in a slightly different way, going from everything from like, you've got a blog,  which is kind of more like the whole payload thing, it's more long form,  then you've got like a Tumblog, which is kind of like shorter,  but it seems to be more like a Poundstream,  but the Poundstream has got a little bit of like calendar on there as well.  And then from the Poundstream, you can sort of go on to like Twitter,  which is kind of mostly just text anyway, but then from Twitter, you've got text messages,  and it seems like there's these, and then at the other end as well, you've got Facebook,  which is basically the same friends feed, and with all the applications,  you've got adding your photos and all that kind of thing,  and it seems like 10 different ways to do basically the same thing.  I don't think they are though.  Do you really need to use all those different things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter is made for personality spamming in a way that nothing else is.  My question is, why is Twitter so sticky?  There's something sticky about Twitter that maybe it's just me,  but I find it very difficult not to log into Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's one of the biggest puzzles out there.  Twitter is something different for everybody who uses it.  That's one of the things you see almost off the bat.  Depending on who you follow or?  And how many people you follow versus how many people follow you.  Like, okay, I was surprised to find out you don't have 65,000 followers, Leo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but that's what it says.  It briefly said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You basically have what, like 7,000 followers?  Something like that.  And how many people do you follow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just 200.  I'm unlike Scoble who has 11,000 followers and followed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's unthinkable to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know what you would do.  That would make it useless if you ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty much. I agree.  I generally try to keep it about 10 percent.  So I subscribe, follow 10 percent of the people who follow me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just add people.  When somebody says something interesting or responds, I just add them.  That's how it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's a very different thing from an RSS reader where you don't add people  quite so easily as you would in Twitter.  Twitter is a lot like an RSS reader more than it is like a blog, I think.  If you follow the right people, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I found it a great resource for stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I found this fascinating is that I saw a guy who had like 500 followers  and was following nobody.  Zero.  So for him, Twitter is a completely different animal.  It's the Clinton campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Hillary is not following anybody.  Barack is following everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it was somebody you know that does that.  It's not. It was a person.  I don't want to say who it is because I don't want to make that an issue.  So if you ask those two people what Twitter is, you get a very different answer.  And people have all these debates about what Twitter is.  A lot of people think that it's a chat room, but it's totally not a chat room.  It behaves very differently.  So that's why I like it because it's this fascinating thing that changes a lot all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't stop using it. It bugs the hell out of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing that I think is really sticky about it is that there are these layers of concentric circles  that overlap each other. It's like a big Venn diagram.  And you may be thinking you're talking to a small group, but the people that you're talking to  are talking to a whole bunch of other small groups.  And then all of a sudden Scoble pops in and then you're talking to 7,000 or Leo LaPorte does.  And it just expands in ways that are very much like those waves that people do at the ballpark.  I mean, this is... we don't understand what is really going on here yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can tell you this much is that if fascism ever takes over this country,  it's going to be using one of these mechanisms to befuddle the public with false information, disinformation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's very insightful, John. That's very insightful.  You were talking before about government using it.  And sort of the boring use that everybody talks about is,  oh, the fire department will be using this to get information about where there's a fire.  But this is a messiah attack on Obama.  Well, can I just say the point I was trying to make is that it will be used for governance.  It will be used for people who use this kind of technology are going to run circles around the people who don't.  So they'll get elected. And then this will be a whole other thing.  It will be the meeting place for...  What do you mean, will? That's what's happening right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think Obama's building followers on Twitter and that's a significant number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steve thinks it's just not so sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you follow Obama's Twitter feed, somebody or a bot follows you back within about a minute.  Right. Instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's using the same bot that Scoble is, no doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And how do you harvest these $100 contributions that are all spur of the moment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and you know, it's funny. As soon as somebody contributes to Obama,  and I've done this and I know you have, Dave, you post it.  And there is a certain mentality.  And I'll tell you, in some way, whether it's significant, I don't know.  I mean, it's not exactly a mass phenomenon, but there is definitely an Obama wave on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Is that more to do with the technology or to do with the demographic of the people who are really adopters of that technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How would you know? I have no idea.  Ask the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's observable.  I think Obama's been very successful with his own kind of social network.  Here's my.obama or whatever it is, which seems to have an awful lot of people on it.  This is probably just an extension of it, really.  For his sort of online contributions.  I mean, you can also get Obama in all kinds of, you know, they've been very good at widgetizing him on the web, you know, which I think is pretty impressive for a campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A widgetized presidency. I like it.  You guys are making me sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see what my inbox looks like right now.  OK, I've got one guy subscribed to me on FriendFeed, one guy on Pounce wants to be my friend on Pounce.  Another guy is following me on Twitter.  Two more guys are following me on Twitixer, FriendFeed, Twitter.  That's all I get, an email anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, let me play a little bit, play the devil's advocate.  It's just it's all personality spam.  It's a big old echo chamber.  Is it really any value in the conversations that are going on in this 140 character world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only if you find value in the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Because people don't read blog posts anymore.  OK, and they don't listen to podcasts.  We lost almost everybody.  You know, the 200,000 people listen to your podcast, they download it.  They're gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're way, way gone.  But, but, but 140 characters, that's within the realm of possibility.  So you might be able to get an idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would say that blogs are passe, you know, blogosphere is in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not that it's passe, it's just that you're only going to get skimmers for the most part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And heaven forbid we actually have some thoughtful content out there instead of these 140 characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I try, I try, man, I try, but I get flamed no matter what I say.  Actually, OK, now I'm going to back off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I do think that Twitter is the doorway to the more thoughtful character.  I very frequently will follow a Twitter post to something more thoughtful.  And I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John Dvorak says that these 140 characters are a vast waste of time.  That means it is now officially important.  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a watershed.  And I have, I should point out that both, I've posted, and I know some others have posted already on Twitter and Pounce that we're having this conversation.  There are a thousand people watching us on video right now and listening live.  So...  Just a coincidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that a lot? Is that more than usually would be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, not a lot more than usually would be.  I noticed that there is a lag in, somehow, there's not an instantaneous response, which I would have thought there would have been when you post this stuff.  There is a lag of some time. I don't think people are constantly monitoring.  I thought, I do, I thought everybody else did, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The mechanics of the at sign in Twitter are also very interesting.  Somewhat obtuse to understand, even if you stare at the screen all day like I do and try and figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's the least of it. And then all of a sudden you get these hashtags.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't even know what those mean. What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm following, you know, I'm streaming live via Quick. Follow me now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is that? Well, the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jesus, the spam on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How about, you know, that's another thing when the spam, when the real spam machines get into full play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter is spam free. You don't follow somebody who spams. You just leave them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. You block it and they're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's, that's what, at some point...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What happens, what happens in one of these systems when some nefarious person or government or something similar gets a hold of the insight and starts posting for Dave Weiner?  Or there's a panic situation in some city and somebody gets a hold of the feed.  It's like, you know, in those, in those banana republics where they always say,  the first thing you want to do is you want to take over the broadcasting station.  Take over the Twitter.  Take over the radio stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody impersonating Robert Scoble with his little NG95. You know, there are multiple failover channels on the Internet.  Exactly. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be Philip Seymour Hoffman basically.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would love to see Hoffman play Scoble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he could get the laugh down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He'll get the laugh down. If he could do Capote, he could do Scoble's laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's go to who plays who in the movies. Who plays Julio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This could not get any more inside baseball.  I think Colin Farrell.  Plays who in the podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's interesting, I just, I do want to point this out that while about a thousand people now are, it is going up fairly rapidly on the, on the, on the stream.  There's also a conversation going on in Twitter.  They're responding to us on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what? Who cares?  Well, at the end of the day, do I have an extra five bucks in my pocket?  No.  No, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It may, it may.  That's what I, that's what my kind of my original premise is in some ways this may just be a big echo chamber and who the hell cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would people ever pay to follow other people on Twitter?  No.  Geez.  Who cares?  Would there ever be a reason to do it?  I need help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For 140 characters?  You want people to pay?  That's.  Maybe that's the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe that's the best part of Twitter of all is that there is no way for it to monetize and it's too short.  Yeah.  You can't monetize it.  There's not enough content.  They used to say that with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Moving, moving on, although I don't know what else there is to talk about.  I thought this was kind of an interesting conversation.  Anybody want to get a last word in before I bring up Microsoft's $1.35 billion fine?  It's the sole European.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let us know when you're finished with that one.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm closing on.  I want to know what you mean by that.  What do they get fined for?  For being Microsoft or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The European Union has now leveled another fine, a $1.35 billion fine against Microsoft on Wednesday for anti-competitive actions, whatever, you know, for being Microsoft.  You hit it on the nail on the head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, when are we going to see Google get fined for this outrageous privacy violations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which ones are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm just, this is my, you know, come over and listen to my show sometime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have a link you'd prepare to share with us?  No.  Okay.  Microsoft's now got more than $2.3 billion in fines to the EU.  Chump change for them.  That's a good point.  That's a good point.  Should just pay it and move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what they have to do.  There's no, yeah, that's what they should do.  That's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not that chumpy in terms of change.  And if I was a Microsoft, I mean, the fine they just got the $1.35 billion was because they were still failing to comply with the order that the EU laid down, you know, however many years ago.  If I was a Microsoft shareholder, I'd be like, who are Microsoft's lawyers that they cannot decode and comply with a legal order?  I mean, they've just thrown one and a half, you know, whatever is one and a half.  Yeah, it's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know what my thinking is, is that they, Microsoft was told to like, you know, open the kimono as it were and show, you know, how to interconnect with the dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which they have done.  They published 135 page document.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've got some of it done, but it's not, it wasn't all done.  I think why it took so long is because Microsoft had to go in and clean up the code.  I honestly believe that they-  They're embarrassed by the comments.  If they went in and they actually just blew this stuff out and people looked at it, they'd go, oh my God, this is a miracle.  This stuff even works.  John, I have big news for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Starry Dynamo on Twitter says, tell the guy with the attitude, I'll spot him a $5 bill.  We found a way to make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've just made your $5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, the talk is cheap.  I want to see the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I want you to read this internal memo that's being released now.  These emails from Microsoft about the Vista capable issue.  Dell now and Intel both are, we're hearing that Microsoft made vast changes to Vista and Dell's pissed off at them because when they first released it, because it broke everything.  They, Intel is pissed off.  Everybody's pissed off at Microsoft.  And now the smoking gun is these internal emails in which Microsoft clearly shows these guys are goofballs.  They really, they're completely out of control.  Nothing that you haven't said for years, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, the guy with the attitude, that's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's him.  John C. Dvorak, mail your $5 to Dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now that this is all coming out, now they're cutting the price so that more people get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get the virus that is Vista.  Do you think that'll work?  No.  I'm not sure even why they're cutting the price.  I don't understand the point of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google apps for domains.  Sounds like an act of desperation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But after all, if Google is stealing all our personal information, do we really want to go to Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, there is a good question on the eve of Mix next week.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, are you guys all, Ted Bitter or did anybody go to Ted?  Oh, a bunch of bitter people here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm not bitter because I, there's no way I'd be invited.  So I'm not upset about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. Weiner, you must have been to Ted once or twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I've never been to Ted.  If they invited me, I might go, but they've never invited me.  $6,000 if they don't invite you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They would have to take care of the $6,000.  Is there anybody on the call who was invited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Subscribes me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the Mox theory.  No, nobody here was invited.  John, have you ever been invited to Ted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but you know, I know Chris enough I probably could get it going.  Chris Anderson, who runs the program now.  Yeah, he used to run the Mac magazine, Mac Attic and some other stuff.  He's the editor-in-chief at One.  He's a nice, really nice guy.  You know, it's one of those things is that what am I going to go to this thing for?  It's over covered by the people who do go.  It's just a bunch of guys that are, you know, I don't know.  These things, I don't like going to anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm with you. I'm with you.  I don't go to conferences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  South by Southwest, anybody going there?  Nope.  Sounds like a Hitchcock movie.  It does.  You guys, we are the most unconnected bunch of pundits I've ever heard of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would anybody listen to this show?  We don't know nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've already established they're not listening.  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We do not suffer this group as a whole, generally speaking, from groupthink because of that phenomenon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amen. Amen. Right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Say it, brother. Sing it.  All right. Well, I'm going to wrap this up.  I think this is a very interesting conversation.  And for those of you who are still listening, you can wake up now.  The show is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should do a radio show. You know that, Leo?  I really should.  You know, if we...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might want to talk about that.  If we did this on the radio, it wouldn't be on the radio the following week.  So, newsgang.net.  You know, I've gone to newsgang.net now.  Is that right? Newsgang.net?  Uh-huh.  It looks more like a feed.  There you go.  What are you doing with this here, Steve Gilmore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Click on media. You can find the shows.  And it's a secret, but I'll tell you the next time you invite me on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.  The group mind is very powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of a tumble-loggy kind of thing with a bunch of different channels,  and I don't know exactly what you're up to, but it's fascinating.  It's another thing to be confused about.  I love being confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Leo, you can come on Newsgang Live someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would love to. I would love to.  Of course, there's The Gang Cast.  There's Newsgang Live.  And it's all... Is the best place to go, newsgang.net, or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you'll find it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all there.  Steve, I'm really glad we get you on.  I would love to get you on some more and talk some more.  I'd appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been an admirer for a long time.  It's great to be with John Dvorak, who keeps the notion of cranky alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, John is an anodyne of refreshment in a world gone flaxed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the thing that most people don't know is that he and Dave Weiner are good friends.  No.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love John.  We were neighbors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We shop at the same store.  I run into him more in the store than I do in the industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we could safely say everybody who's ever on this show is good friends.  Not with each other.  No comment.  No comment.  Let's see, Dave, what should we plug for you?  You have some scripting news, of course.  Scripting.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Scripting.com.  It is payload rich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got tons of payloads of ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a must read.  It is a must read and always interesting.  Thank you.  And I really do appreciate you're spending some time with us and you can catch Dave on,  you catch all of us on Twitter except for Dvorak.  Will, you don't do much Twittering anymore.

Transcript:  And of course, ChannelFlip.com.  This is IPTV Network.  It's the revision three of Britain.  I wouldn't go that far yet.  Only better.  Did you see the pictures of the drunk Kevin Rose at Future of Web Applications in Miami?  Valley Way.  He's all over Valley Way.  It's who we thought.  Kevin.  In fact, he even Twittered, I'm never or I guess he pounced.  I can't remember what she did.  Twittered or pounced.  He said, I'm never drinking again.  Well, that'll be the day.  Right.  John C. Dvorak.  I don't need to tell you where to find him.  Dvorak.org slash blog and Cranky Geeks.  I got a lot of good feedback on appearing on Cranky Geeks.  I might have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a we got a lot of good feedback.  I thought it was one of our better shows except for the fact that some people thought you and Adam were going to have a fist fight.  I kept watching the show.  I couldn't find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Yeah.  No, I thought we were getting along quite well together.  Yeah.  I mean, I do hate him, but I didn't think it's show.  You don't hate him.  No, it was very nice.  Afterwards, he said, when you're going to come to work for Pod Show, we can give you wife leaving money.  And I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He didn't say that.  My hand to God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way.  And my wife appreciated that when I told her, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure she would.  She probably said, well, then go to work.  But I'm also a tech five dot pod show dot com if you want to compete against these other guys.  But I'm looking at the news gang thing and I see the elusive, you know, somebody I'll get the PayPal account information for next time I'm on Twitch and these which won't probably be next week, but the week after.  And then you can send the five bucks.  We'll see.  We'll see.  You don't have a PayPal account.  You can just anybody.  I don't have the number handy.  I just said, I have to go to Leo a Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll take it for John.  I'll never see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wouldn't trust him with that.  I'll hold it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Billy, can I get the money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The door.  I said I sent you a check in December, John.  What's it got to do with these people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to get some extra money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think this is what Dave means about a payload for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A pay good exit line right there.  A load.
