Transcript:  Yeah, I got a new Mac Mini in July this year and I somehow twisted Stephen Hecket's arm  So he actually upgraded my RAM for me, which is something I was gonna be following YouTube videos to do myself  But I don't feel like I need a Mac Pro because my Mac Mini is  Pretty darn powerful. It does everything I needed to do and the application which theoretically would use the most RAM is screen flow  And that crashes when it's over to gigabyte fell anyway  so for me the Mac Pro is a beautiful to look at machine and  It could be in an art gallery because that's about as useful as it will be to me and it's actually less expensive than a massive

Transcript:  Oh, and if you want the nano coating another thousand dollars, but be careful  If you buy the nano coating you have to use the included special cloth to clean it  So, you know and I don't think those are that's that cloth is available in stores

Start time: 368.88
End time: 404.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The cloth is one of those things that makes me  Worry a little bit because people always buy like these really beautiful lovely brand new MacBook Pros  And then they go and they buy the cheapest possible bag or case to put it in  It's like you just spent five thousand dollars on a laptop and you are quibbling over whether you spend fifty or seventy five bucks  On a backpack for it like just spend the more money to get the right equipment to protect it  And I mean if you are using the special coating, I'm sure it's very fancy  I don't know why this cloth is so special like nobody seems to really know that I  Can't think it would hurt to just do what Apple suggests to in this case

Start time: 407.33
End time: 438.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that might fall under the line of  Imagination you just tell people they need a special cloth and they get it and anybody who's spending six grand on a monitor  Could really give a hoot or any about protection because once you're throwing that kind of money around  I mean are you even cleaning your own monitors? Aren't you paying somebody?  Do you have somebody to do it some special myself?  It'd be a better investment for me to pay somebody ten grand to camp outside uncle Leo's business to rob  Twits of a fifty two thousand dollar machine that it would be to spend I am not

Transcript:  Redelivered next week. I don't know anybody who's bought one yet, but I do know a number of reviewers have I justine got hers  Again a loaner from Apple and did a lovely unboxing effect. She just tweeted today. She's been using her  She she did the unboxing she shot it with  Three red cameras so she has an 8k video and she just tweeted  Editing the three. Let me show you this Karsten instead. We saw the unboxing before but this is her tweet of all of the  64 cores  Maxed out and look at it. It's about one frame every few seconds is oh my god  So this is a good to me a good reason not to edit an 8k  Marquez Brownlee got one as well Jonathan Morrison. I think Jonathan shot his  Unboxing video with an Alexa area Alexa camera, which is a very high-end cinema camera for movies  Vince Flore who will actually use it. I think Vincent LaFleur is one of the best photographers ever does a lot of aerial photography  When I interviewed him a few a couple of years ago  I asked him come on you shot the drone footage for Apple's TV screen savers and he would neither confirm nor deny  Which tells me he did it so he's obviously doing some high-end stuff for Apple he  His review is a text review. This is the Mac Pro is actually fun to work on  It feels like it works with you not against you. Yeah. Well, hmm

Transcript:  So, I mean I assumed that this is amazing last weekend. I rented  the  Panasonic  SH1 or s1h and it shoots in 6k and it's nice video. Yes. It's I I got it from  Lens rentals because I wanted to see before I bought if I dropped another foreground on camera and it's phenomenal in the dark  It is the best low-light camera I've ever had in my hands  I've never had a red or anything crazy, but the file size was ungodly and I'm used to shooting on my Canon EOS are in  Um  Prores 10-bit and that was that's manageable. But once you get up to 6k and 8k, I just don't have room to store it  So unless you're really making movies or doing high-end professional work, I don't know if you need this this computer  I'm over here balling on a budget with my rise and chips and I  Rendered my 6k just fine. I mean I went out I made a sandwich  I came back my four minutes of video was done. I went out I watched the movie  I came back my half hour of edits were done  So I mean I get that this machine is all world but to get it to be all world  It's sixty thousand dollars because there's no way in the world. I'm blowing 52 G's and not getting that nano megabyte  Trinitron screen there's no way in the world. I'm gonna be on a regular screen

I'll mute him mute him out  I'm gonna show you this video from spazzy labs  Where he did a Ryzen to compete with the Mac Pro and he believes he got actually faster performance  This is a hackintosh and of course no serious filmmaker music maker  Photographer is gonna use a hackintosh because you know one update and the whole thing goes away  But he it does look pretty it does look pretty and he was able to throw those rise and chips in a way  I feel like Apple because they're sticking with Intel  Is a little behind the curve because AMD's Risons have you know, they're gonna have a 64 core rising later this year in 2020  so

Start time: 688.90
End time: 709.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's I don't know. I like I said, I'm not I'm not doing 8k and I've never even  Edited anything a K but 6k with that Panasonic was a huge file and I was still living the dream editing stuff  So I get like for professionals before that amount of money. I'm like you better be making yeah movies from the future  I assume I just Dean is coming back from 2022

Transcript:  A lot of your favorite youtubers are up scaling 1080 to 2k or 4k just for YouTube and it still looks great  Like you hear people talk about that all the time  And of course they downscale their 4k to 1080 just because it makes the 1080 look so much more vibrant  So I mean again if you're a professional and you got the money to go, let's let's get it movies aren't 8k

End time: 886.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, how much content are you ever gonna be consuming in it?  I mean the amount that is ever out there is going to it's gonna be very little and  Effectively, I mean most the time you're not going to be looking at something that is going to be doing that expensive screen justice  This is also I feel that 8k television. It's like, okay sure. I  Guess I could have a TV that has this option  But really is the stuff that I'm going to be watching every other day going to be available in that quality  Probably not an HD TV is just fine a lot of pressure on NHK the Japanese

Transcript:  Broadcaster from the Japanese government  They're pushing hard 8k Olympics in Tokyo this summer and they'll be shooting in an 8k and  Broadcasting it I guess only in Japan will you be able to see it?  I think there are some 8k televisions will see 8k TVs at CES. I  Remember the first 4k I saw years ago at CES and I thought wow

Start time: 909.00
End time: 938.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is like looking through a window and so we don't get yelled at by people later on  The the benefit of shooting an 8k or 6k or 4k is the fact that you can crop in I shot  a cast from a show and there were eight people on set  That's why I rented the S1H and I can zoom in on each individual person  And have met like a full 1080 from a 6k  So again, even though things aren't always displayed in a K  The reason you shoot with a case or good crop to cut in for those reasons and we fully understand that I'm gonna be

Start time: 938.98
End time: 985.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not just when we go in a game when we go to CES. I'm gonna shoot it on my Sony  A7 which is a still camera, but it shoots 4k video  And I'll shoot 4k video my editors told me this is what we want you to do  Shoot 4k video single camera  Wide angle and then we can crop in because that means that 4k is for 1080p screens so we can crop in we can zoom  It'll be like you have four cameras  And if you do it wide you'll be able to get a lot of the scene and we can go wide and then go close  And all of that stuff  So there's definitely advantages to that and I'm not knocking the Mac Pro and I'm not knocking somebody shooting an 8k  Mostly I'm pointing out that this is a computer for the 1% of the 1%  This is a very this is a small market and even we do video production every day

Start time: 985.46
End time: 1011.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I wouldn't dream of spending that much money on it. And the people that are really gonna love this or the guys doing  Marvel CGI, you know like back in the day when they when they did the matrix and it took them like 400 computers and like  a team of 82 people to do the graphics like I assume something like this is  What those people are salivating over having a cluster on wheels these machines rolling around doing all the dirty work for him

Start time: 1011.32
End time: 1045.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So again, there seems to be it there's always been in the gadget world in the tech world kind of this  How how high-end can you make it? How how fast can you make it?  For you know, if money were no object and clearly that's what Apple is doing. But  do you think  It was Mary does it forward does is the advantage of Apple making this that it will then  Forward everything else Apple does  Like in two years, we'll get better max because of this. I

Start time: 1046.86
End time: 1069.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  think it's entirely possible that we'll get those better max in two years, but also I  feel that Apple lost a lot of their pro market or at least a lot of people thought about leaving because  They the computers just weren't there there was nothing that could do this stuff for those professionals who are out there doing  You know graphics for films and things like that, you know CGI and things but haven't they lost those

Start time: 1069.62
End time: 1089.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean maybe but maybe some people are still hanging in there with with their pre trash cans their cheese graters  They're all cheese graters. I don't know  But I do know that this is one of those things that I think is as much a design challenge  And a what can we do right with this kind of thing?  Right and I've seen quite a few people complaining on Twitter that this is not something that's really affordable for the masses  And I don't think it's designed to be that I think it is one of those  Let's try doing a Mac where people can take parts out and put parts in are these to go still gonna bring it to the genius  bar, right  Because you paid fifty two thousand dollars for a computer  Oh, you're gonna take it somewhere and expect somebody else  out remove the dust and put it back in for you

Start time: 1136.48
End time: 1176.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Definitely not opening this up myself, even though it does open open beautifully  You know, it's not you know in a way I think  I don't mean to bang it's a bang on Apple because I applaud the fact that they said well  What if that you know cost or no object? What's the best thing we could do and I think that that's great. I just wonder  What's the value to the rest of us and the rest of us in this case is 99.99 percent of Macintosh and computer users  So maybe there's some value in that they're  Pushing the limits and that will someday get something like that or maybe I don't know  Maybe not you already have a Mac mini that was the most affordable Mac and it does everything you want it to do

Start time: 1178.02
End time: 1191.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I can produce video on that. It's I wouldn't say that I'm producing high-end video  I'm certainly not producing things in 4k  But it's doing everything I need is do and it will be able to do more in the future as my needs increase, right?

Start time: 1193.32
End time: 1215.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are also a lot of accessories in the Apple Store  Specifically for this Mac Pro and as one might imagine  They're expensive including a  thousand-dollar  Webcam from Logitech because of course if you have a monitor capable of doing 8k video you need a 4k webcam

And then yeah, yeah  So she disconnected the camera  And that's all you see in the story from cnn many other  Uh local radio tv shows  What they neglected to mention and I think ring was ring which is an amazon company was quick to point out  is  That and there by the way, there was a podcast where they were in real time hacking ring  cameras  Uh, that was last week as well  But what's happening is a lot of people are buying these and they're either not changing the default password  Or more likely they're using a password that's been exposed in a breach from other sites  So this is a very common and terrible habit we all have of reusing passwords  But if you use the same let's say you use this password to log on to your marriott  Your bonvoy account remember marriott was hacked half a billion records were exfiltrated including email addresses and passwords  That hacker now says well, let's search around. We'll try to find the camera  You can use showdan or something like that to search for these cameras  And then well, i've i've got some login credentials let's log in and bingo he's in  Because you reuse the password  So the advice that is never it doesn't seem like is ever given on these stories  And I just think I just pass this along and anybody watching knows this but if because you're a geek  But if you would tell your friends and family  The key these are safe to use  You don't reuse your passwords anywhere. This is a side effect and put and turn on two-factor authentication  And then this is not going to happen to you

Transcript:  I am uh, personally a very anti-ring  person given the I don't know i've been really following all the reporting that  carolyn haskins who's now at um  uh bus feed news and  A lot of other people I think it like giz and motherboard and whatnot and cnet have been reporting on ring and um  how their cameras have been kind of utilized by local police  and the ways that the webcam streams and video from their doorbells, um,  are often able to kind of be  Used by police forces without so much as a warrant and that kind of skews me out. So I don't have one

Let us map amazon's sprawling home surveillance network  If you join the app the neighbor app that ring  lets you use neighbors app  You can  gizmodo went through the data from the app  65,000 posts  Many of which have location information in them and they were able to with just a little you know  a little data research  They were able to pinpoint all the ring cameras  and uh  Now you I don't think gizmodo has access to the video from the cameras, but we know the police do  and so this this map shows you how what a what a very granular  and complete a video record police could make  From these cameras, they don't have to be in every house

Transcript:  But yeah, and um caroline recently published motherboard just published a series a three-part series from caroline  That was fantastic kind of tracking how  ring's association with police  Um has evolved from like the days when they were on shark tank pitching their product years ago until now  Which is really interesting to look at as well  But I think that it's just a really ethically complicated technology at the moment, which um, so I personally have  some hesitations about using it, although I feel like as  Someone who has an amazon alexa in my house. I can't really complain at this point

End time: 3470.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's getting ready for the rant. He's signaling his his willingness to go out on a limb here. He's charging up  I have a little bit of a soft spot for ring because uh, they were an early sponsor before  Amazon bought them. We did a lot of ads for ring. I used a ring, uh video doorbell for years  I have since replaced that with google's nest  Hello  But not for any security reasons, so I don't think nest is any different fact nest may be worse. It does face recognition  And uh invites you to identify the people who come to your door so that your nest home  Hub max can announce them  You know, oh lee says at the front door it even plays a jolly little christmas jingle  So what could be possibly be wrong with that except that?  You know potentially google's collecting face recognition data for everybody who comes to my front door  uh, uh, I don't is is the ring quantifiably worse than any other  camera system

Start time: 3472.48
End time: 3543.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, how many of these camera systems come from  A vendor that you don't necessarily know a lot about I know people have a tendency to cheap out on stuff like that  That's much more risky. Yeah  If you buy something from some unknown brand that just ships from  Directly from china and you don't it doesn't even have a specific app that they recommend that you use with it  You could use this app or that app or whatever  You know, you have no idea what these companies are actually doing with your data because  It doesn't tally up and that's something i'm hoping that apple's home kit camera integration is going to help fix  With these things because at the very least there's you know, some standard involved there for security  um, I don't know how you know good this is but I mean we've had  Issues with home security stuff for years  If you remember the old-fashioned baby monitors you could switch a channel on a two-way radio and talk directly to them  And those have been used, you know to freak kids out and you know to bully people in the past  You know back in the 90s  So this is not a necessarily a new problem. It's just a more technologically advanced problem, which has greater implications

Start time: 3544.18
End time: 3566.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but so in which case you would want to buy from a company like let's say amazon or google  Or netgear. These are big well-known companies. They're not fly-by-night brands. They're doing auto updating  uh  Is it let me ask you this paris  Is it your sense that it's the deal that they did with the local police that makes ring so much worse than everybody else?

Start time: 3567.94
End time: 3646.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, i'm probably not the most knowledgeable in the comparison between ring and some other  um all the other companies in this field, but I think that  the part to me that  I've found a little concerning is the way that it is portrayed as something that is benign  And simply a like measure of safety, you know, you can connect this neighbors app, but you know, keep your neighborhood safe. Meanwhile, um  this sort of technology is in the background being used by  local police forces and different groups that  to kind of surveil a neighborhood and can lead then to situations where like let's say  They hear from someone that uh, they're looking for like some 17 year old kid wearing a sweatshirt in a neighborhood  And they turn on all the ring cameras and then they happen to get some other  Person just because it looks kind of the same on this camera  And then it's my camera's fault that someone gets gunned down in the street  Like I don't want to be have any sort of part in that but has that happened  Not to our knowledge, but I I don't I don't want to give uh, I I would rather not have  Uh technology that i'm installing in front of my home being used by the police state to surveil  um the surrounding area and people who are not consenting to being so weird because uh,

I really like to be able to see who's at my front door  Before I answer it it shows up on a screen  On my house  When i'm not home, I could see when a package has been left. I could check it  I like that feature  Isn't that improving my security?  Security

Start time: 3682.70
End time: 3705.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And i'll tell you I think it depends on where you live because in some places adding something like this to your house could make  You a target. Um, you know because you're demonstrating that you have the money to spend on stuff like this  And if you've got the money to spend on something like that, then surely you have something worth protecting, but i'll have video of them robbing me blind  So except they stole everything on the way out including the cameras you weren't paying for the cloud

Start time: 3733.02
End time: 3780.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I I get that but again somebody's picking and choosing on what's deemed important what doesn't so i'm just going to say that  From the jump when a girl is kidnapped in a car  She screamed for help and they get the camera and they got the car model  That was a great story that somebody's door cam heard that was screaming and she saved her life  somebody else  The neighbor was cheating on his wife. So he went to his neighbor and said hey  Was there a car coming into the driveway? They checked the camera. He caught his she caught her husband cheating  So, I mean there's all kinds of things going on with these cameras and what they're doing  The fact that the police could go into certain ones do certain things we are surveilling ourselves and so for security for our security  For security what so you're saying you won't want to see who's at your door  Yeah, you know what as an older person, you know what you do you get up you look through the

I can see who that is  And if it's a ups guy I could say leave the package and once he leaves the package  I can't keep an eye on the package. All of those things are to my benefit. I don't see a problem with that  I feel like I honestly feel like this is because  Amazon and the ring there's not doing anything worse than any other doorbell camera and I feel like this is there is some  Subtext targeting amazon on all this i'll be honest with you

Start time: 3830.06
End time: 3840.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't because amazon is the one that is actively like reaching out to police  like  To police stations forming partnerships with the police. It's a neighborhood watch program

This is america. I feel I read carolyn's articles. I've read the other articles and I feel like there's a lot of  innuendo  Like this doesn't sound right. This doesn't seem good  but what i'd like to see is an example  of police turning on those cameras without the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Knowledge or awareness of the homeowner. Police can get your ring doorbell footage without a warrant report says this is a ours technica article  Okay  Yeah, how do they get it?  Last week that ring is tapping directly into real-time 911 dispatch data  Which it then uses to curate crime news for its um, of course they're tapping into 911 data. That's their data  it has access to  um  the sort of data and then it uses an api call to pull the address of  or gps coordinates of the call  and then um  Where is this? Hold on  Where's the part that says the warrant staff?

Start time: 3981.06

Transcript:  So what i'm reading in the gizmodo article is it says that the police can request data and it sends a notification to people using the neighbor app  So that's a separate app not just which you have to opt into yes, um, and then people can choose to decline  um  Now personally, I would very much like to see that flipped  It should be a I have to manually go in and say yes share this data with the police. Thank you  Yeah, um instead of no, I don't want to share my data with the police that feels like the the wrong way around  I'm assuming guilt rather than innocence, but it also doesn't tell the police who refused  Amazon has said but it's not refusing to cooperate. That's just not volunteering information. There's a difference says and it continues to say

Start time: 4024.12
End time: 4061.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that  Ring users must volunteer to share their footage in response to a police request  Uh that police can go to ring and request footage customers can choose to opt out or decline any request  And law enforcement agencies have no visibility into which customers have received a request and which have opted out or declined  The big concern that I see is that once they get the video  They're not there. There's no restrictions on what they can do with it  They don't you know, there's no deletion time frame and so forth  But it's not like they're just saying well, let's turn on leo's camera and see what's on his front porch that's not happening

Start time: 4145.36
End time: 4152.02

Start time: 4152.90
End time: 4172.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the better solution is if somebody tries to set a password that's you know in I have I've been pawned  They have an api for this where you can submit a username and password and it will go. Yeah. No  Chrome now does this is an invalid combination by the way change everywhere else you're using this password  You know take a bit of responsibility on as a company as well to educate your users

Start time: 4172.82
End time: 4414.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google is doing that technology too that that was just added the latest version of chrome  It says that that that password that you're using is bad. That's why we we really encourage a password manager  It's and and you know generate a new password every single time  Let's take a break, but I do want to talk about the worst thing  And I think far worse than anything  Amazon's done with the ring cameras that's coming up in just a second  But first let's talk about how to use a better browser. Yes chrome is fine  In fact, a lot of us have used chrome for years because that's the standard on the web  Wouldn't it be nice if I could get all the benefits of chrome all the features of the chrome browser without the google?  Privacy, you know invasions. Well, you can  And it's called brave brave is a better  Browser a next generation browser. It's based on the chromium code base  So every time google pushes an update to chrome, you'll get an update to brave you'll get all the latest stuff, but they've taken out  the bad stuff  It's focused created by a team the brave team focused on privacy  And by the way, when you take out ads you take out extra javascript you get a faster browser up to six times faster than the competitors  You get a safer browser you use less data  It blocks trackers. In fact, all you have to do is go in the brave browser go to the the settings  It's a fabulous browse through all of the amazing things you can do all the trackers you can block  you can  Cross-site upgrade all your connections to https  It use you can still use all your chrome plugins, but there's so many I no longer use  I don't need you block origin. I don't need https everywhere. I don't need no script. I can turn off scripts  I can block all device recognition. I can block cookies cross-site cookies all cookies  I can oh this one. I didn't turn it off yet, but i'm gonna turn off facebook logins and embedded posts  Oh, I these are off by default allow twitter embedded tweets. These are all surveillance  Techniques allow linkedin embedded posts. Those are turned off on mine. I use start page instead of google as my search  I just think brave is fantastic  And it and it is so good for people who care about privacy, but don't want to give up compatibility  It's easy to set up you just one click you can switch browsers efficiently copy all your bookmarks over  Brave sync means all of your bookmarks will automatically get copied over you're going to save battery life reduce data costs on mobile  Mac windows linux android ios wherever you are. There is a brave browser  I make it my default everywhere. I'm using it right now  The one thing I always feel guilty about because we're an ad supported network when I go to a site like imore.com  Or verge or whatever. I i'm blocking ads  So i'm taking money out of their mouth and I want to keep using those sites  Braves kind of come up with a great solution for this. They call them bat tokens basic attention  Tokens and it's a way you can still give publishers back their fair share of web revenue without seeing intrusive security risking  Ads you can buy bat tokens with cash or and I like this idea and you don't have to do any of this  But you can opt into brave's privacy respecting ads  These are ads that don't show up on the browser page but show up as notifications  You can click them or not  But as you see these ads you'll earn bat tokens and then you can give them to the sites that you visit  As a way of paying them without having to see their ads  Yesterday was about big tech today is about us brave  That's the best browser faster more secure  And they are really doing a great job at brave brave.com slash twitter  I know you probably just want to google brave and download it do me a favor go to brave.com  That way you're gonna let them know you saw it here  1.0 just came out their big  Uh out of beta release and it's it's just it's just fantastic brave.com  twit

Transcript:  uh  This one to me  Was more of a shock than the ring doorbell thing  Although and I will point out I don't use the ring doorbell anymore. I use the the nest home doorbell  But as I also pointed out that could even be worse just because they don't have the neighbors app  doesn't mean  and and part of the problem is  That when law enforcement comes to a company like google or amazon and says  One hopes with a warrant we want this information. They have no way to say no, right?  So this is one. I think I wish google had fought  There was a fire bug in uh in milwaukee, wisconsin  Set a number of uh fires through 2018 and 2019  $50,000 in property damage killed a couple of dogs  The bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms went to google and said we want  every user device  Within uh 29 000 square meters  Of those fires that have location history turned on. Yeah. Well during a total of nine hours  So they collected  If you've got location history turned on which is on by default if you're using google maps if you're using many google services it's on  They collected  1500 names of people who were around when these fires were set  the ultimate fishing expedition and then apparently, um  Google so google looks through its sensor vault database  It provides that information the police then look through the list decide which devices are of interest and ask for  Subscriber information name email address when they sign up to google services, which services they used  a lot of information  so  Initially the police get anonymized  Data and then the police apparently have the opportunity to ask for unanonymized  Data in fact in this case according, uh to forbes investigators asked for information on six users and google provided it  So a very nice handy tool makes police job easier  It also makes every innocent person within what was it 30 000 square meters?  uh a suspect  What do you think?

Um, and  You know, they they think maybe they're safe because they've got passwords and stuff and then it turns out that no some  Company can just hand their data over to the police without them saying yes or no because they agree to  340 pages of terms and conditions that they just swipe swipe swipe tap done

I guess there's not much you could say about it  um, but it's just interesting that they think that oh, we're just going to track all these phones like  I guess every criminals are taking selfies while they're setting buildings on fire or shooting people  And that they need their phone to go get the information from them and mind you there are criminals or kids are  Posting stuff on instagram smoke weed playing with guns. I get that but I mean in general just to be oh  We're just going to search all the devices. It's I don't know  I don't like it. I don't like it one bit

Google is precisely tracking  I think anybody listening to our shows knows that  Two it shows the unconstitutional nature of reverse location search warrants  Because they inherently invade the privacy of numerous people who everyone agrees are unconnected to the crime being investigated  For the mere possibility it may help identify a suspect the police liken it to a camera recording in a bank robbery  It records everybody in the bank most of whom are victims innocent victims  But it helps the police figure out who the robbers are

Transcript:  um, yeah, I guess the  The I don't know message here is that  Google if you're using google maps or whatever, it's probably tracking this information  You should go in turn off location services on that or at least the live location data  Um, because I mean in addition to this I feel like this uh data i've seen  It's often kind of the center of a lot of controversy. There was god. I feel like a reddit  Post on our relationships my favorite drama filled subreddit that was something to the effect of google maps data  Is ruining my trust in my marriage was the headline and it was  a woman who um  Her husband she'd always thought he'd been faithful goes a lot of work trips. She  He lost his phone  So she was trying to look at his google location data to see where it went and saw that  Every time he went on a trip out of state for work.

Isn't it that a lot of our sponsors this week are about privacy?  About security a lot of our stories are about privacy and privacy invasion  I guess there's something going on here express vpn is my choice for a vpn. They're trustworthy  They are audited by an independent third party who verifies their privacy policy  Verifies that their trusted server technology saves nothing  So that you're never logged nobody's nobody's recording your visit your use of express vpn.

Start time: 6371.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 6391.44
End time: 6426.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a couple of open standards that are already out there w3c standards  There is the indy web which has a variety of systems for integrating between  independent platforms, uh, such as web mentions where I can  Reply to something somebody else has posted on my website and it sends their website a notification to say hi  This is you know relevant to you and to this post  So i'm very curious as to why he thinks that his small independent team of five open source architects and engineers and designers  Are going to do better than people have been working on literally for the last decade of the open web

Start time: 6427.34
End time: 6518.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly controls why no not control get get get get the president off his back  It gets if if it's a decentralized system, then twitter is no longer responsible for the content on twitter  And so everybody who's been complaining that twitternet needs to do a better job  patrolling and policing  Uh the the people on the right who say twitter blocks conservative thought the people on the left who say twitter allows neo-nazis  both will be shut up because  jack can say  It's not my fault  And in fact, I have to point out an activity pub mastodon specifically there are specific nazi  uh  Servers this is a federated system. So anybody could set up a server and there are nazi servers  There are servers for escorts for prostitution  Um, and nobody's responsible for it. You don't have to follow it. You don't have to see it  But because nobody's responsible for it  Uh anything goes and I think that that's the real reason for this dave whiner  Who created rss and has been very active in all of this. In fact, uh, I remember dave  has been  Lobbying twitter for some time to open up tweeted. I'd like to see twitter do this in a different way  You already have the bugs and scaling issues solved for a global notification network  Let's add a few apis and create a new universe  In other words, let the the hub the core be the existing twitter servers, but create an api so people  Can create their own apps create their own instances create their own, uh twitters in effect

Start time: 6519.64
End time: 6578.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, this is exactly what twitter has been doing the opposite of for the last couple of years  They've been shutting down their apis. They've not been letting developers access people  They've removed rss feeds from twitter accounts  And they've done everything basically to try and break  Decentralization as far as twitter goes and this is causing more problems if they want to start with  Decentralization, then they need to bring back the things that they've taken away  And actually help developers because that's the only way that they're going to be able to  Decentralize themselves and if they need to fix their harassment and abuse problems  Which I think we can all agree that they do  Then they probably need to be looking at what other systems are already out there for handling this because guess what?  This is not the first place on the internet that has had this problem and is dealing with this problem  They may be dealing with it a larger scale, but that doesn't mean it's  Necessary to reinvent the wheel every time you run into the same problem. You know what this

Start time: 6579.42
End time: 6597.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Reminds me you don't agree with me about control  But I I think that has something to do with that and if twitter wants to fix something  Give me 15 seconds to spell check myself when i'm typing angrily real quick and I post something  Fix that for me before you go bring in your own team. I just centralized what's going on

He's been lobbying hard for it as have  uh the head of the fbi and other law enforcement agencies  This is the quote from uh cathcart and chudnowski. It's simply impossible  To create such a back door for one purpose at law enforcement and not expect others to try and open it  You do this people's private messages would be less secure and the real winners would be anyone seeking to take advantage of that weakened security  This is not something we are prepared to do in other words  They're saying no  I don't know if they'll get to say no

This is from  nola.com  It's kind of scary this happened on friday new orleans officials  Sought to contain a cyber attack against its network. It started in the early morning  uh  So what happened? Uh  It appears to start at 5 a.m  City officials first noted quote suspicious activity on their network  Employees got to work around 8 a.m. At 11 a.m  Announcements over the city hall public address system saying turn off your computer turn off your computer unplug your computer  The uh the  Folks at the city hall said this is the advice we got from our federal and state partners  That's the way our security team has been trained to respond city technology officials  Then went from floor to floor to confirm all systems were offline  Now the headline says ransomware, but it's but they're also saying  that the city systems  No data has been lost. No passwords were compromised  An influx of suspicious emails mean the city systems would be kept offline  Uh indefinitely so what it sounds like is they got flooded by phishing attempts  But no city employees fell for it  They had cyber training last fall  And so it's not clear if ransomware was installed or had begun to encrypt anything with the city is saying we didn't lose anything  This has been of course a hot spot for ransomware lately is city governments school systems  Uh often they have insurance often. They're desperate to get back online, which means they're much more likely to pay the bitcoin ransom  to ransomware attackers, we don't know anything more than that, but  yet another uh  Ransomware hit pretty amazing

Um, you know, obviously it's usually a person rather than  um a system, you know somebody falling for a phishing attempt or something, but  you know, there there would have to be a  Series of errors.

I mean it's less about  I think what you traditionally think of as a guide to influencers. There's no like lists of top people on youtube or  instagram and it's instead about  One kind of the nebulous concept that is an influencer, you know, it's both  we use this word to both refer to uh, like  Mega celebrities and teens the thousand followers as well as you kind of use it as an insult and as some people's life goals  to be an influencer and digs into that as well as the um  kind of secret history of influencers, which I  When I was first assigned this piece normally weird guides have like, you know a big intro piece  They have a history of the thing and future and I was like guys, please don't make a write a history  It's not gonna be interesting  It's like 10 years like I really don't want to you know  Just write about who is on instagram and then I started looking into it and I was like wait like the history of  Influencers actually goes back to the 90s as far as early like web blogs early message boards and whatnot  people were kind of trolling these early web message boards to find influential posters and to pay them to seed their  No kidding  Feed their accounts with kind of ads for brands. So what not it's one thing to be somebody people listen to

Transcript:  For recommendations and that's been going on as long as the world has been going on  What's made them influencers is that the advertisers are now seeking them out and saying if you would mention our product  We will give you ten thousand dollars. That's that's really the definition and that these people are

Start time: 8214.34
End time: 8245.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unique in that they are different than celebrities or um, even like one-off firewall sensations  There are people who have come to prominence  Through some means of like technology on the internet or online somehow by kind of organically posting and sharing  and ever to be an influencer you have to have  in some way the respect or the respect of your peers or someone has to value your expertise on something to consider you influential and  People are advertisers and brands are paying attention to that and there's big money in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so the thing that I found absolutely fascinating about this because I had totally forgotten but um  Trying to find that when I was trying to find this kind of history to influencers. I was looking back to okay  When were kind of the first big mainstream instances of companies?  Kind of engaging in influencer marketing and one of them was this uh,  Company, I think his mind comet was the early name of it who?  They had this network that they pair with bloggers or find out influential people on friendster or message boards and  Pay them to post eventually this turned into a company called  Pay per post and they partnered with a lot of prominent web bloggers and people online generally were  Furious. Oh, yeah, I cannot even  under emphasize how oh I was  Shocked and upset. Yeah, everyone was at the mere idea  That anyone could even be paid by a company to post anything or speak about advertising and then  Something that i've been thinking about a lot actually during this episode of twitter is that one of the biggest scandals during this time was at  2006 was um  a bunch of like influential tech bloggers at the time  reported that  Shocking. Oh my god  google of all place or no is  Microsoft somebody had sent microsoft had sent them a new acer laptop  And said you could review them you could not it's just free and this was apparently the biggest scandal of the year  Everyone was outraged at the idea that microsoft would send bloggers a free  Multi-thousand-dollar laptop. It was the most unethical thing they'd ever heard of and I was like today  I mean that doesn't even make us batten

Start time: 8357.80
End time: 8379.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they're right a check for I mean today is considered like a mark of being  I don't know like a blogger or something if you get sent a product by a company to review  Regardless of whether or not you need to return it  um, you know, it's considered it's considered like a  Sign that you are a real blogger. Those youtube stars who got the you know, fifty thousand dollar

Transcript:  Mac pros and did those videos  That's a huge sign of status and i'm gonna guess not one of them said anything bad about it  Yeah, not one of them. Those aren't reviews anymore. Those are  paid posts  And honestly, I think you you may say we tolerate it now paris  But most people when they use the word influencer that is a pejorative. That is a negative term. You're an influencer  right, but

We'll send it back and for the most part the stuff we review  I buy because I don't want to but you know what? It doesn't matter.

Transcript:  and it it doesn't because the thing is the way the system works now, especially with um  YouTube like this light per se is made by aperture and before even was for sale  All the youtubers reviewed the same light  So you see 30 different people reviewing the light and if it's a good product  It's going to make people buy it and that's just the way that it works  The new wave of influence is so different and sometimes subtle and sometimes overbearing but it works  The number one I email I get about being on this show  Is when randomly like right now we talk about influence and I I would mention how I make money off of instagram selling accounts  People always want to know how I do it  And what the procedure is and I usually tell them and I'll just say it right here really quick  So next time somebody asks me I can say take out the episode

Transcript:  Well  Yeah, it's that's that's the way I look at it because again you could pay for systems that do a lot of automation for you  And you're getting a lot of bots  but you know that's  Also not useful because when a person comes and looks at it and they see that there's so many fake accounts  There's no engagement that doesn't help you either  and of course you have to expect some kind of drop off once people realize that they're following a  Mom-and-pop cooking channel or something after six months.

Start time: 9133.22
End time: 9203.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there anything that's on your mind these days the only thing I want to rant about is what I was saying earlier  um  people  Have the power  to record things that are important  And it seems like when something bad you'll see the comments everybody wants to talk about something bad  You post something good people don't really have anything to say so even in your own world  Just take the time to actually talk to your kids record conversations. Talk to your parents record those conversations  I I watched a video of the interview I do with my dad and he passed away seven years ago. I watched it so much  Once every couple years it just makes me feel good. It makes my daughter feel good watching it  About when he first went to prom and his first job and when he joined the military  And have it so like that's important to me  So I know like once a year I say it and some people like oh man you keep harping on it  But I feel like people need to do it and it's important and at this time of the year  It's a great time to say it because everybody's around family and friends and everybody's generally happy  You know with the new year and christmas, so that's not a rant of negativity. It's a rant of positivity record and share these moments  So you have them instead of just sharing cat videos all the time. What is it? What is it the young say word?
