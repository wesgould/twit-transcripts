In other words like real accounting and then everybody does non gap numbers which are phony accounting.  And why they look better.  They look better because we're leaving out things like stock options and executive compensation.  But that's part of your business.  Yeah.  I don't understand why they're even allowed to do non gap.  But OK.  Oh I didn't see this.  Apparently you're wearing your kitty cat whiskers today.  Are you wearing your invisible kitty cat whiskers.  Is that.

But in the first episode like there was a joke that one of these companies is spending so much resources so many resources to like put big moustaches on people.  That's real.

Transcript:  Oh.  As Donald Trump gets closer to winning the GOP nomination he's realizing something.  This is in case you're not following Hillary's Snapchat.  Which I am but I you know the problem is I don't I unlike the kids today don't do it often enough.  Do you see are you not see is are you not seeing my laptop is that.  There we go.  And he's realizing something.  And then.  Hat that says make Trump presidential.  Wow.  This is this is this is if they show this on the television ad I think people would be actually upset a little bit right.  But you can get away with it on Snapchat.

Start time: 517.36
End time: 535.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah well I think that that's really the point is that they're trying to be cutting edge and hip with the kids again you know the voting segment the 18 to 22 voting segment that's really just starting might be their first election or they might not have voted in the midterms or what have you.  They identify with Snapchat because that's where they all are.  That's where the kids are.

Start time: 535.28
End time: 543.84

End time: 586.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's also there's it's just such a cheap thing to throw an intern at a new technology give them some baseline rules and hope they don't write the most offensive thing ever.  I still think my favorite promotion from this election year was when Rand Paul was still in the race for about 15 minutes and he had a webcam blocker that had his name on it that you could put on your laptop screen and hide your webcam at all times you know making it he was really writing the coattails of the snow nest exposure stuff and letting you letting you as a citizen know that follow Rand Paul all the way to your digital security future.  I'm not sure if that would have necessarily worked out the way that he had planned but I did not invest in the $10 Rand Paul web blocker not even for poops and giggles.

Start time: 588.04
End time: 589.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Transcript:  I don't know if FBI director James Comey released a little piece of tape to put over your camera with his name on it.  I would use that.  He apparently does that.  Yeah.

Start time: 597.98
End time: 599.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's that might be see through though in his case.

Start time: 601.04
End time: 662.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's an FBI approved filter.  Oh man I don't know.  I don't know where to start.  I feel like the financial news is the least interesting news and yet it is kind of the big story.  Apple stock tumbled quite a bit because Apple kind of did what they said they would do last quarter which is not grow very much.  The iPhone flat the Mac flat iPad continues to drop.  Actually the iPhone dropped quarter to quarter didn't it.  But somebody was telling me I think so was my mom who's in her 80s said oh yeah I don't want to buy any more Apple stock they're going out of business.  And I said no mom they made 10 billion dollars in profit in three months.  They made almost 3 billion dollars you know more than 3 billion almost a billion dollars a week.  So they're not going out of business anytime soon.  But you'd think it if you read the headlines like oh it's the end of the world.  Sell your Apple stock.  They're not growing as fast but no one can continue to grow.

Start time: 663.52
End time: 722.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean it's the whole quarterly growth obsession is going to be hard for Apple when they haven't done something really significant to get developing nations to really care in markets where they're just being flooded with really good Android devices that are just cheap.  You can get a flagship Android phone really great screens really great cameras everything you might need in China and India for so much lower.  That's going to just really that's going to be the thing that blocks iPhones development until I don't know if the five SE is going to be the thing that really kicks that into gear and says OK here's something affordable and flagship level from Apple.  But between that and the lack of things that really target that everybody can afford it market in the way that the iPod did in the way that the iPhone originally did you know the watch is not necessarily something that's driving that sort of I'm a lower end consumer and I'm going to get on board with Apple.

Start time: 722.30
End time: 725.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But I never wanted that market.  They've always wanted the high margin market.

Start time: 726.24
End time: 765.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I mean the high margin is you get people in with the phone and you get them stuck in that ecosystem but that's not necessarily a growth sector if you can't find other additional things.  And right now what is that for Apple beyond the car.  And how long until we see something official from Apple beyond just poaching employees from Tesla and vice versa.  It's you know that's the question I think that's going to be asked by these quarterly growth obsessive stockholders.  So I'm really curious what the next step is to placate that kind of crowd because they're starting to get sour if people are making these big complaints and selling stock even if that's sort of a stupid short sighted thing for a company that's making tons of money.  That question is going to continue to be asked.

Start time: 766.40
End time: 819.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah I think it's I mean the combination of the stagnant not necessarily even stagnant just not a record quarter for Apple in combination with what people perceive as not really any kind of innovation coming through on Apple's next product.  Line I agree I don't necessarily think that Apple has either really thought about or has ever been very good at getting the lower end market.  I mean everybody remembers the 5C they thought that that was going to sell like crazy in China and it turns out no everybody just wanted a rose gold iPhone in China because they're all about using the iPhone as a status symbol.  I still think I'm I'm pegging the fact that they are going to come out with a really really great touch screen laptop and that's going to be their next sort of innovation as it were although you know touch screen laptops are already out on the market.  It's the same kind of process you know Apple sort of waits does it the best and then all of a sudden that's the status symbol that people are looking for.

Start time: 820.40
End time: 827.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't know if the pro though that feels like the iPad pro right there idea of what a touch screen laptop would be like.

Start time: 828.14
End time: 886.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Here's what I think the real takeaway and I don't see a lot of coverage of this from their first quarter results which they reported this week.  Services so this is a graph of Apple's revenue from services that's Apple pay Apple care Apple music iCloud massive jump to six billion dollars in revenue highest ever.  In fact they made more in services.  Like two thirds of their I mean came from services not from hardware and I think what you're actually seeing and this is going to be an interesting transition for Apple to make is they're changing they even said this in the last quarter we're changing from a hardware company to a services company.  And now there's traditionally not very good at services which may be a problem but is that how they're responding to this issue of having saturated the world with that everybody who wants Apple hardware has bought it nobody's buying new Apple hardware.  Well that's all right we'll make it up in services.

Start time: 886.98
End time: 935.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not necessarily trumpeting that in a big way I also wonder how much of that money is honestly from people who forgot to cancel their Apple music.  I'm not sure I wouldn't get caught by it because I'm like I don't need a seventh one of these services.  But yeah that's that is a really good question that's going to keep on expanding with everything that they put out and that's going to be as people are locked into the Apple ecosystem if they do come out with a touch screen computer.  That doesn't have an atrocious keyboard the current MacBook that's one of my biggest issues with it then that could be the direction we go but they've got to really speak up because I know it ours technical that's just we just never talk about that and that's really just not something that people are excited to talk about about.  Oh these little micro transaction things you know they're the money's there but that's just not a sexy thing to talk about.  I don't know.

Start time: 936.24
End time: 961.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems inevitable they would all grow to just because more people are getting iPhones and stuff so yeah maybe now you have to pay more for iCloud maybe you need that storage for your backup you know maybe oh you got a new Apple TV and you're buying more stuff and renting more stuff like it seems like with the proliferation of their ecosystem people actually investing in it will increase.  So I'd be interested to know what was the thing that led to that big jump though was it the new Apple TV.  I don't know.

Start time: 962.76
End time: 1048.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Doubt very much it was an Apple TV and I think that's sold like crazy.  I love it but it wasn't that.  Yeah I really think that this shows that you know the thinking and we do a Mac podcast and we talk about this like on Mac break but I've been thinking about it since the last Mac break.  The Apple you know are the kind of conventional wisdom which we talked about here we certainly talked about a Mac break is that Apple needs to find the next iPhone right.  What is the next hardware breakthrough is that the Apple car they are spending money and building a VR division they've hired some very good virtual reality people is it going to be VR and I think maybe Apple's thinking to itself.  Well this is where we double down on our success in hardware by we've got you know we've been building lock in and an ecosystem for decades now we get to double down on it and make money on the ecosystem.  So as long as we don't need to make a cheap iPhone as long as we have the they sold 50 million iPhones.  Yeah in a quarter it's not like they don't sell iPhones they don't have hundreds of millions of users and if we get each of them to pay $10 a month for Apple Music.  That's a pretty good business that's not a business to be ignored and that's a that's almost an annuity on the continuing kind of stable success of a hardware business.  What about that what about recasting maybe the problem Sam is that ours technical still thinks Apple's a hardware company maybe you're maybe your guys maybe start to thinking about maybe it's not just a hardware company anymore.

Start time: 1048.82
End time: 1122.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well we're also thinking about the fact that there's Samsung has truly responded they are in terms of what they put out in terms of products and services their touch wiz isn't as bad their flagship phones are.  Getting features knocked out that Apple is not responding to so that's going to continue to dominate the headlines as companies like that HTC has a good phone now the 10 coming out next month and we were shocked it was actually a few days before.  The hardware landed in Ron Amadeus hands he's our main Android guy he had said don't wait for the HTC one and then he called me after 20 minutes with it and said forget that don't buy the other one it's so just to say that the flagship competition is huge there.  That means Apple does have to kind of look at some of its other product lines some of its other it has to it has to find excitement.  It has to it has to bring that out we know that's something that that the other Steve has not really knocked out of the park in terms of evangelizing he's not getting us excited about the fact that health kit is on all of our phones he's not evangelizing in the same way so that's it's all about the message that Apple chooses to put out ultimately that's.

Start time: 1123.48
End time: 1161.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  An interesting thing happened to Android last year which was the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 which was an unfortunate chip and I think the reason the S6 suffered in a lot of other phones in the US based on this chip this chip was a hot chip HTC and Samsung both had to down clock it in order for it to be reliable in their phones and a lot of people had a bad Android experience in 2015.  I agree with you by the way Sam I carry an S7 that's my my go to phone and I really like it the HTC 10 will also be using this new 820 which seems to have solved all the problems the 810 had.

Start time: 1162.58
End time: 1167.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah yeah it's a it's a good cool chip it's more battery efficient all of our batteries have been pretty damn solid.

Start time: 1167.16
End time: 1226.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I don't get that lag either I mean there was a real lag in the 810 it was very disappointing so that just that just shows you the difference to me what Apple makes is they make their own chips they make their own hardware they completely control this tightly they lock you into services.  Even Tim Cook in the in the earnings call said this he says our team executed extremely well in the face of strong macro economic headwinds see he's blaming like exchange rates and things like that.  We're very happy with the continued strong growth in revenue from services thanks to the incredible strength of the Apple ecosystem and our growing base of over 1 billion active devices I feel like Apple saying.  We don't we don't have we don't have to worry about the Qualcomm or or Samsung because we make it all and we own the ecosystem and as long as we have a billion active devices and keep it at a billion active devices we've got.  A way ahead that makes us a lot of money.

Start time: 1227.58
End time: 1281.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's a different Apple very much so yeah I mean I don't think anybody was worried about them making money it's more about you know oh my god and they grow sales are dropping yeah yeah so that growth is slowing down and that's I mean that's also just a symptom of Apple being so freaking successful for what 7 years now like for so long like it's inevitable that this would happen.  And yeah we should probably talk about like the ideas or what we're hearing from my phone rumors at some point but it I wouldn't be surprised if we don't even get like a major refresh this year just based on everything we're hearing like it seems like more the upgrades are set for next year so what does that mean for Apple if you go a whole year.  With another seven it's the eight right there or whatever comes out in twenty seven or like I wouldn't be surprised if it's like a six X or something like that like another six they're not they're not tied to the tick tock right I mean they don't have to do that they don't have to do it but that would be a lot.

Start time: 1282.50

Transcript:  It's hard because what are you going to put in a phone nowadays that's going to be the next big thing in a phone you know Samsung with Samsung pay I think showed that they have some they do have some legs in face of Apple pay the Samsung pay actually works quite well.  Every time I use it the guy says use it the airport because you know it works with swipe machines and they're still surprisingly a lot of swipe machines out there I thought they'd be all gone by now.  And I use it the airport guys know I've never seen that it works just like the ad.  And that shows you something that as Samsung's marketing is getting through people are aware of Samsung they're going to survive that eight ten problem that really was I think a big problem for all Android devices last year.  Maybe Apple should be worried on hardware I don't know I maybe there maybe there maybe Android has an Android achieve parody.  I think in terms of devices yeah like readers are as fast Apple owned that for a while.  Yeah.

Start time: 1336.48
End time: 1358.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The cameras are getting up there getting up there I think yes seven is arguably better much better yeah what we've seen from the 10 probably not so much.  Yeah the seven is pretty darn good so yeah it's more like I also think like on the whole on the mobile market there's just like not much that's exciting.  It's evolutionary now it's evolution so quickly yeah yeah.

Start time: 1359.12

Transcript:  Thank you know what I was going to say is the other thing is Samsung is burdened by still having some legacy products and still remaining on edited and focused I mean Samsung still has a TV business.  Yeah and they're still trying to sell TVs in 2016 which to me seems hilarious I know I don't know very many people who are buying TVs especially on a global scale at this point they also still I think are relatively unedited in terms of their product line.  I think that they try to do a lot at once and I think also when Samsung tastes success like something off of the seven they're more likely to expand and do more things rather than edit down and I think that Apple has been able to sort of curb that by not chasing after every single market as it develops.

Transcript:  It's over for big screens nobody.  I would say no I would say that HDR at the very least has a much better stream room effect than 3D or 4K.  That's the kind of thing where that's sort of that's going to take some time as the content gets rolled out and people don't have that content lined up yet.  But I'm not and I also am not going to be the guy who goes oh this is going to be the thing that makes TVs big as I was one of the eight people who thought 3D TV was cool so you were wrong.  You were so wrong.  That being said HDR it's catching in an interesting way whether there's going to be content and a real consumer drive for it is a whole nother thing but I don't count it out just yet.  No I agree.  Defender HDR.  I agree.

And the light like the brightness they can get in certain instances to just look so much better.  I have a plasma right now and that was kind of the thing you want to get for good black levels.  But it seems like Vizio has pretty much made it there.  The only problem with these TVs is that there is no TV tuner which is a weird choice.  Like they say when we asked to clarify about that they're like well we don't really call them TVs.  They're monitors.  They're calling them monitors.

Like there's no there's no more over the air antenna for this.  So that's inevitable right.  Or something.

So they made the human real and everything else in the movie.  I mean practically everything else in the movie.  The environments.  Yeah.  There's a good YouTube video.  I showed this a couple of weeks ago on the stream where you can see the green screen  and how much of you know Mowgli's like theirs they make a muddy like a little muddy  valley with green screen everywhere and he has to slog through the mud.  And just because you can't get you know you can't do computer simulated mud this  doesn't really work I guess.  I don't know.  But most most of it was CGI and really so well done.  The thing I really loved I just was using the gear VR.  There's a trail or you can see it on YouTube too if you have cardboard.  There's a you can be in King Louie's you know palace as where Mowgli would be and  look around while Christopher Walken is talking to you.  It's a really amazing experience.  Really good example of where immersive filmmaking might have somewhere to go.  I guess when you're making a CGI movie you get the 3D thing for free right because  you're making a model so you can look around.  Yeah here's the this is the so you can see how little real stuff they shut the whole  thing in L.A.  And by the way that puppet is really really realistic.

We'll have more in just a moment.  Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.  Now see when you're young like Lauren.  And you know you're starting out in life.  It's the last thing you want to do.  You probably don't even have a lot of extra money is put money into retirement.  Believe me the money you put down in retirement is worth so much more than the money you're going to put it in 20 years.  It starts growing now.  So it's really important to start saving for your future.  You probably also want to save for down payment on a house and maybe you know you're going to have kids someday save for college long term savings.  It's important.  But the question is where do you put it.  You put a savings account.  Because that's like it's going to you're going to lose money.  They pay so little interest.  OK.  You're going to invest right.  Are you going to hire an investment advisor.  You know they charge between one and three percent of the money they manage every year.  That's how much more you'd have to make just to break even.  And that is not easy.  So let a computer do it.  Wealthfront computers only charge you one quarter of one percent a year.  That's nothing.  And no commissions no hidden fees.  And by the way they do a better job because unlike an advisor who might check your account every few months.  Wealthfront is checking your account every minute constantly monitoring it rebalancing.  They do something called tax loss harvesting.  That's the idea is to maximize your return and minimize your tax.  That's based on modern portfolio theory.  And what they do with just a few questions they adjust their investments according to your personal risk tolerance.  They keep you diversified.  They keep you tax efficient.  And you know exactly what they're doing because you can view and track all your accounts in one place.  In fact you can even put your non Wealthfront bank and brokerage accounts into the interface so you'll see everything.  How all your money is doing.  Now I want you to go to Wealthfront.com and read about it.  Actually go to Wealthfront.com slash twit so they know where you heard about it.  Obviously you're not going to invest until you read about it.  Find out how it all works.  You should also take advantage of a couple of free things they'll give you.  You can answer the few questions about risk tolerance and time frame and they'll generate a portfolio that's free.  You can see what they would invest in for you.  They'll also look at your existing portfolio if you want.  And you'll find out where you're wasting money on additional fees and services and whether it's fully diversified how its risk level is and all of that stuff.  This works so well.  Well front has been growing like crazy.  They now manage almost three billion dollars in client assets.  And it's because they've got the best software the best people.  And it's very affordable.  Less than one quarter one percent.  Tell you what I got a better deal.  You can start with as little as five hundred dollars and the first fifteen thousand dollars you put in will be free of charge forever.  That's zero percent a year.  Wealthfront.com slash twit.  Great returns low cost.  They're doing it right.  And it's time whether you're investing for your first year in the marketplace or your last.  This is the time to do it.  Wealthfront.com.  Slash twit.  So we got we recalled Sam I think his picture was deteriorating.  It's better now.  Sam Moskovitz is here.  There's no it's in Moskovich.

I meant Twitter said the Twitter is making a mistake because they're not paying enough attention to black Twitter.  He said that's really where all the growth and excitement is as African-Americans using Twitter.  And he says there's nobody black on the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah.  Holy cow.  We'll talk about that a bit because she also.  Well we can talk about it now.  She did.  She's brilliant at marketing.  Released the video.  It's an hour long.  It's almost a documentary as much as a video album.  Right.  And released it of course as the show before Game of Thrones.  Not a bad place to have.  I cannot see it on demand now though.  I think you had to watch it then.  It was a limited time.

Start time: 2540.68
End time: 2549.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She had it one.  It was a one day only for the video version and then you had to go to title exclusively for streaming.  I believe it's for sale on iTunes though.  Is that correct.  Isn't that weird.

Start time: 2549.86
End time: 2563.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So her husband Jay-Z owns title and title is another one of those streaming.  Services is not a lot to distinguish it except for their exclusives.  And because it's owned by somebody in the music business they seem to do.

Start time: 2563.74
End time: 2576.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And also that their app is garbage.  Is it that bad.  Everybody at Ars Technica struggled to get and maintain the stream across many different devices.  So perhaps there's a sweet spot where titles just great.

Start time: 2614.06
End time: 2633.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's probably a combo of both but the problem is you know it doesn't matter if you can have you know a lossless stream of Prince's 1999 if it skips and pauses.  And that's my problem is that I always have to look up and question whether or not my Internet is working because for some reason the stream will just stop.  That's very frustrating.

Start time: 2659.52
End time: 2673.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The sad thing is that only somebody with her clout in the industry could do this and it so it doesn't benefit up and coming artists.  It shows maybe a path for once you've made it but it doesn't really show the future of the music industry.  It just shows.  I disagree.

Transcript:  I think the idea of a video album is a very attainable thing.  It doesn't cost a lot to get even your smartphone should probably have a pretty decent camera.  But nobody's going to watch it.  I think that's the why not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It may push kids who are making music now over the next five six years to really experiment with video albums and even virtual reality albums.  Who knows what's to come.  I think it's unlocking not only that as a form but also I think for Beyonce as a woman and a person of color to come forward and say I'm going to make something top to bottom and control it.  And I think that really matters.  I think that makes an impression on between that and the access to cheap technology to make that and record that sort of stuff.  That will have an effect down the line.  That does splash down.  Also I did look up the amount per play.  Google Play actually pays the most at 70 three hundredths of a penny per play title right next to its 70 hundreds of a penny beats is 30 hundreds of a penny.  Three tens of a penny.  And then Rhapsody Apple Music Spotify something called Deezer is a thing that is big.

Start time: 2742.36
End time: 2770.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  These are big something called Deezer something called Deezer.  Deezer is awesome.  Deezer was another one of the CD quality streaming services.  Right. And it's French French but owned now by title or no.  Who bought Deezer or is it the other way around.  No Deezer bought Stitcher.  Sorry. It's hard.  It's hard to keep track of all this.  Yeah. Yeah. So Deezer is separate.  So but you said Google plays number one and then who's second Deezer title.

Start time: 2771.12
End time: 2783.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No Google Play and title are right next to each other.  They essentially pay the same.  A tiny bit more for Google Play and then beats way the chart.  I would show it to you but I don't know that it would pick up on the screen is is yeah.  Three three tenths of a penny.

Start time: 2783.46
End time: 2789.50

Start time: 2790.28
End time: 2799.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well it's unclear. I find that it's unclear to figure out exactly what's going on.  I don't know if it's a bug in their Web app if it's something with the server.

Start time: 2799.84
End time: 2810.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Except I will say that the Apple music experience is infuriating on several levels  to the point where I have often yelled at my phone because I just want to be able to  play music that I already own that I already put on my phone and I don't have to and I  don't want to log into the Internet to do that.  Right.

Start time: 2830.02
End time: 2845.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The way that in with the local library is insane.

Transcript:  And you know Apple Music definitely when we were just talking about Apple being a  services company there's a reason why we don't talk about it and one is that Apple  Music launched like a plopping something or other and never really gained up.  I can't think of any really mind share.  I can't think of anyone I know who says oh yeah Apple Music.

Start time: 2895.72
End time: 2908.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Transcript:  Yeah well so it's interesting because Apple Music has I think two things in terms  of mind share one of them is beats one if you're a hip cool kid radio all the  yeah the hot British clubhouse beats there there for you.  But the second one actually is the other album that dropped with unfortunately I  think a little bit less fanfare because Lemonade is Drake's views from the six  which they have an exclusive on and beats one has an exclusive on Drake Apple  Music Apple Music has an exclusive on Drake's views from the six and that has  done actually incredibly well and it had really great I believe very strong  digital download sales.

Start time: 2968.06
End time: 3002.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's to me the real problem.  Ultimately I've mentioned this before is the record industry decides who survives  and who doesn't because they just squeeze and I believe that streaming music  services that will survive will be ones that are affiliated with large companies  like Amazon Google and Apple because they don't have to make money.  There there there add ons for companies that make money in other ways as well.  And independents like Deezer and title and even Spotify I think are going to  struggle Pandora is struggling.  Pandora says they're launching a streaming music service as if that's going  to somehow save them.

Start time: 3043.68
End time: 3089.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's from views from the six.  Yeah.  Well it's done incredibly well in terms of sales.  I don't know if they have any initial numbers out.  But of course this is I guess his little tiny triumph because of course hotline  bling got totally screwed by Billboard charts because they did release it as an  official Apple exclusive.  He put his video on there.  Everybody was streaming it.  But the problem is is that Billboard doesn't count streaming right from Apple or  Apple Music.  So as a result he ended up missing out on the week that he was supposed to get his  first number one hit on Billboard.  And then the next week Adele came out with her new album and he just got totally  owned.  So maybe this maybe this is the word Drake for Drake.

And the conversation about the line Becky with the good hair and a lot of people immediately  jumping to the one you know there's a person her name's Becky who is it just missing.  And then right over their heads about what is really being talked about.  And I thought that it was really interesting to see the Twitter verse essentially stand  up and say you guys are missing the point.  There's a lot of cultural conversation that you may have missed.  How interesting Twitter with the assist.  Yeah. And it kind of lined up with the SNL skit from a while back of white people freaking  out because they realized Beyonce was black.  But it was truly this interesting conversation about about standards of beauty and how black  women are and aren't attached to them.  It was very political.

But but yeah it was absolutely something that that this because of the limited nature and  the streaming exclusivity there was a drive there was a passion for people to find out.  And then on top of that the story of this this idea of who is Becky go Becky's kind of  the concept. Let's talk about it.  Let's have a whole social media world to talk about that.  I think that is such a cool thing about pop music now that would not have happened in  the mid 90s when Destiny's Child was having to like attach to white clef Jean for anyone  to even care that they existed.

And the idea that he has this website that can say hey here's some you know here's some  things you can follow.  Here's you know some parts of the conversation that you may have seen or may have missed  or you need some context for.  That's all visibility in my opinion and I think that that's really powerful.  You know because people are having conversations on Twitter about everything every day.  If you had you know somebody that was like oh I have you know today and Doc's in  Twitter dot com and it's just you know pictures of Doc's ins you'd be like oh yeah.  Yeah.

Transcript:  And what's it kind of lends itself to.  I mean Facebook can't do that because Facebook you follow you don't follow you follow  your friends you follow celebrities but you wouldn't say oh I would like to get more  diversity in my Facebook stream and they'll go out.

Start time: 3508.10
End time: 3516.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No that's that's the exact opposite of the Facebook philosophy.  Facebook wants very much for your news feed to reflect your values and to amplify because

Start time: 3517.02
End time: 3519.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  they learn more about you and monetize you for that.  Yeah.

Start time: 3520.18
End time: 3528.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And sure enough they are as we said at the top of the show they are killing it money  wise so clearly it's making money to keep our world view nice and bubbled.

Start time: 3528.24
End time: 3541.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well that's very interesting.  So Twitter is the anti bubble and Facebook potentially potentially and Twitter because  Twitter does not monetize you based on your followers and following or does it.

Start time: 3542.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And also I mean we're saying this as Twitter as it is now but as we've seen a lot of the  trends of what Twitter is moving towards in terms of its features are kind of slowly  stripping this away.  You know us like begrudging like media people who are all you know sitting around and  worried about what's going to happen once we get an algorithmic feed.  But that's really you know where it's moving towards.  That's that whole philosophical conversation about is this good for Twitter which is not  entirely linked but it certainly plays a part in the fact that you know Twitter has been  spending a lot of time trying to make these features to try and get more people on it.  And maybe for some reason you know there's a disconnect between what people envision  Twitter is and what Twitter wants Twitter to be over time.

Start time: 3592.12
End time: 3615.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm glad we had this little conversation because I think that it's opened my eyes a  little bit and I hope that Twitter you know it's clear Twitter has value.  But when we were before the show started I said that's how I found out Prince died.  It was and what's interesting is I was looking at new social because I wanted to see  alternatives to Twitter and there's an open source.  You know it was based on status net.  Can you social.  It's just a bunch of geeks.  Nothing's going on.

Start time: 3615.76

Transcript:  It is a bubble for sure.  You know it's not a it's not a racially determined bubble.  It's more like I don't know.  I don't know what.  It's a geekily.

Transcript:  But I was also racially determined.

Start time: 3633.66
End time: 3652.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah I guess unfortunately it is.  But so I was looking at it and I thought well I want to compare this to Twitter and I  opened up a window on Twitter and I saw Prince had died and I closed immediately close  social I haven't been back.  It's like Twitter is where it's happening where stuff happens right.

Start time: 3652.34
End time: 3694.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's really where the people are the stuff is going to happen and that's going  to depend country by country.  I mean you go to Japan it's completely different social networks.  So yeah it's so it's what people have not given up on Twitter yet but Snapchat may very  well for a particular audience that could be a shift that really happens in the next two  to three years in terms of that audience could really gravitate as friends tell friends tell  friends and they kind of flocked the way that Snapchat sort of groups together by these  friend groups and has these sort of specific city wide geolocation feeds.  You know but for now Twitter still has the foothold.  Twitter still is a way for a broad spectrum of ages and voices to speak out very quickly

Start time: 3695.40
End time: 3727.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  and speak to one another and communicate with each other which is huge.  Yeah I had for a long time I kind of had this notion oh the better social networks are the  smaller ones because they get so unruly when they get big.  But I have to really rethink that.  I think that the real value of Twitter is how unruly it is and how out of control it is  and how unfiltered it is and it would be a shame if they started filtering it.  You know that that would be a mistake that the curated feed or the generated feed.  Are they doing that now?  No not yet.

Start time: 3728.22

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks ladies and gentlemen if you are a freelancer or you do your own invoices you know that that's not the reason you got in business.  I didn't get in business to do my books.  No unless your business is accounting and then you're doing somebody else's books.  I bet you even people who have accounting businesses hate doing invoices.  No one likes doing invoices but I found out something about invoices when I was doing it.  If you don't send them out you do not get paid.  This is not a good situation.  So let's you know let's really face it if you're focused on what you're doing what you love and I was you also have to do the bills at the end of the month.  You got to send them out and that's when FreshBooks came along.  I was so happy.  This is back in 2004 when I was going to Toronto every week every month for a week to do shows.  I kept putting off invoicing them which meant I didn't get reimbursed for my expenses.  I didn't get paid.  Well it had to be in Canadian dollars.  I had to do the conversion was just a pain.  Then I found FreshBooks and I loved it.  It saved my life.  It made it easy to send invoices.  Professional looking good invoices that actually get you paid faster because on every email invoice there's a button that says here pay Leo right now.  And you know what it turns out your clients don't like paying the bills any more than you like sending them out.  So make it easy for them.  You get paid on average five days faster.  That makes a big difference.  They also have some new features that they didn't have.  I would have loved this versus project deposits that you can invoice for a payment up front while you're kicking off a project.  That way it doesn't come out of your pocket and you have to wait for reimbursement.  You get lots of information.  The reports are great.  Your accountant will love that when tax time comes along and you can even see whether or not an accountant has even looked at the invoice you emailed let alone paid.  And if they haven't paid they handle this automatically with these nice little polite reminders that get less polite over time.  They make sure you get paid.  It's just a part of what FreshBooks can do.  If you work in people's homes you can present use the FreshBooks app on your iPhone to present them with an estimate.  Present them with the invoice.  They even have an EMV chip card enabled reader that you pop in there and you get paid before you leave.  Stuff like that is awesome.  FreshBooks find out about it by getting it free for the next 30 days at FreshBooks.com slash twit.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  Do not get into the accounting business unless you love it.  And even if you do you're going to love them doing the invoices and the reporting and all that.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  Try it free for 30 days and don't forget to say I heard about it on twit when they ask you.  One thing on Twitter Michael O'Donnell is posting great pictures on Twitter.  Thank you Michael.

Start time: 4124.12
End time: 4126.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those of us who had the Apple watch basically.  So not everyone.

Start time: 4126.86
End time: 4161.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Not everybody.  I agree by the way.  I agree totally with your take on it Devendra.  You said the best thing I can say about the Apple watch is I still wear it but I  don't wouldn't necessarily recommend it.  But if it's one of those things that you you know you get something and I've always  said this I don't feel like it's changed the world but I see enough people still  wearing them.  Not me but enough people you say I still can't recommend the Apple watch.  It's a device for a particular lifestyle of digital addiction by its very nature  and price is not just for everyone but it's you wouldn't it's not an outright  failure.  They've they've sold a ton of them.

Start time: 4162.76
End time: 4177.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They sold a bunch like I think the fact that they sold more than you know the  iPhone did in its first year.  That's interesting especially because the Apple watch this is a device for a  limited market right.  It's only for people who have iPhones.  I agree.  So you know that's the fact.

Start time: 4177.30
End time: 4181.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And even a subset of that market it's not everybody who has an iPhone would what  would love an Apple watch.

Start time: 4181.81
End time: 4211.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  So like for you know for a new device that's targeted at such a subset of users to  to sell that much.  You know I don't think it's a failure but I do think like everyone is right to  complain that it's not as useful as it could be because there's you know there are  a lot of things they could do to make the next version better.  I just really like it.  It's it's my lifeline during the workday because it's great.  It's you know I'm on the subway I can see updates I can see a lot of things  without pulling my phone out of my pocket.  But yeah I'm a very weird edge case for you know computer usage.

Start time: 4212.00
End time: 4235.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Apple does not reveal sales but we think people figured out with clever like slice  right.  You know actual deliveries and stuff that they've sold around 12 million.  But what's really interesting they have more than half of the wearables market  share.  Now that's gone down.  They finished Q1 according to strategy analytics with a 52.4 percent market  share down from 63 percent last quarter.

Start time: 4235.62
End time: 4274.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it's not surprising that they can get up on the wearable market share when  the wearable share as Devenger just kind of said is sort of an edge case.  It hasn't been this leading thing where people have been just going out in droves  to get smartwatches.  I see a lot of Fitbits though right.  Absolutely.  Fitbits are the perfect price spot.  You know Apple really wanted to.  It's kind of funny that Microsoft thought they might have a good idea by releasing  their own fitness band but they completely balled it on the fact that it's the price  stupid.  Like if they could have gotten that down to one hundred dollars and have it really  limited and then have some step ups.  I mean gosh this is the company that made like five different versions of the X  box.  You think they could have done the same thing with the band.

Start time: 4275.40
End time: 4283.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's funny they had the same issue with the band as they did with the phone  right.  It was several years too late and it was too expensive and nobody nobody needed  that from Microsoft at that point.  Right.

Start time: 4283.84
End time: 4301.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even though it's a good product but if you just don't have an entryway to it you're  not going to you're not going to beat Fitbit.  You're not going to beat that ninety nine dollar thing that combines your watch and  some very basic tracking and then hooks you into wanting to get oh well I'm going to  need the heart rate monitor.  I'll go and get the hundred forty one dollar one next year and all that sort of  thing.

Start time: 4301.56
End time: 4311.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I actually wear a Fitbit blaze and I love it.  That's two hundred bucks though.  That's getting in.  No far from it.  I got the exactly.  Yeah.  It's like my eighth Fitbit.  Yeah.

Start time: 4312.64
End time: 4319.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 4320.00
End time: 4333.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And five day battery life.  And you know because they have such good battery life the blaze monitors my heart  rate all the time not just when I say monitor it.  So I know what my resting heart rate was which would the Apple watch never was able  to tell me.  It gives me some notifications.  My phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I have always.  I have a specially censored shirt that contacts my physician anytime I go into  fibrillation.  Very good.  No no but yeah.  Actually in some ways it's really interesting that this whole quantified self  movement got so much attention and really does so little.  It's really at best you know a pedometer plus heart rate monitor which we've had  for decades.

Start time: 4376.00
End time: 4382.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the heart rate monitor isn't even super necessary right.  A lot of people just want the step counting and that's pretty much it.  Maybe some tracking.

Start time: 4383.40
End time: 4399.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You for a five buck device you put on your belt buckle you could have to step  tracking.  I don't know what it is about this category.  It's maybe VR is going to be kind of like this too which had immense promise and  everybody got excited about it.  And but it just doesn't make any progress.

Start time: 4399.78
End time: 4464.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think that I think that VR is coming from it from a different angle though.  I mean OK if you think about it.  I.  This sounds very weird but I like to think of the quantified self movement a  little bit like Pinterest which is not only grabbed early adopters but it's  grabbed like this segment of like women like 30s in the Midwest who just love  you know tracking sleep or they're using it as their step counter to get through  the day.  Like you know my mom doesn't care about VR but she loves talking about her fit  bit and she loves like plugging it in and like looking at her data and feeling  fancy about herself.  And I think that that's like really important.  You know it's first it's really attracted this like segment of people that  normally don't hop on to tech trends in quite the same way.  And I think that that's the really important and signifying piece of the  fitbit.  That said I don't own a fitbit and I received an Apple watch as a very  thoughtful gift.  I'm not wearing it today but you do wear it.  Yeah yeah I try to wear it.  It's got to match the bow.  When I know that my wrist isn't going to be really sweaty.  Right.  Which it's not good.

Start time: 4464.88
End time: 4574.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I'm going to say about the quantified self movement is that having the  phone changes everything.  We as super geeks are very likely to get some sort of crazy body tracking device  and then run to our computers install all the drivers get all the software deal  with all the quirks of how the crappy interface shows everything with a phone.  Boom.  You've just got a little bit of Bluetooth and that's that's kind of the secret  for getting that penetration which is sort of what I think Apple thought would  happen with the watch that you have this life assistant device that you're always  using.  The watch is going to play so nicely with that.  And when that price comes down when they can get the watch to see or whatever  put the letter C in there and make it a cheaper one and make it you know really  limited but still sort of hook in and look cute.  I think that's going to be the beginning because once you really factor in oh I  have this assistant sort of thing that really plays well with the thing that I  could not live without then that's what starts driving.  So it's not that the Apple watch certainly isn't a failure and it has room to  grow.  And I think it was Apple was in a really interesting position when they launched  it which is that hey remember our first iPod got way better.  Hey remember our first iPhone got way better.  And that meant that people who bought into it weren't going to go oh gosh I need  to wait.  They go you know what I'm ready I'm ready for that first Apple thing.  It's not going to be garbage.  The next one will be better.  And that's the you know our technique had its own wish list.  You know we want some speed.  We want some better wireless connectivity to like 5G networks.  There's a wish list there but it's still the promise is there.  The look is pretty good.  The size is not too huge.  You know just getting that price down and sweeten those features up and that  next edition may really turn things around at the very least as a cool looking  Fitbit like thing that's cheap if not you know an utter Apple like status symbol.  It remains right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But Mac users were a huge minority back then too.  Like it was it was a very different computing environment you know back in those days.  So you know Apple is still not dominant in.

Start time: 4603.72
End time: 4635.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's it's what's interesting to me too is that I think the biggest upgrade for me would  wouldn't be a hardware upgrade or anything just like make Siri work make Siri work better.  Siri is this thing Apple's been selling us for years and it still has trouble.  It's actually getting worse.  In hearing me.  Yeah I feel like it's getting worse and I feel like for a watch just like nice voice  commands if I hold my wrist up and I tell it something if it happened instantly that  would be a really fantastic way to sell the Apple watch and you wouldn't even need new  hardware for that really.  You just make Siri work better.

Start time: 4636.62
End time: 4661.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think Apple's challenged by it kind of painted itself into a corner by saying we're  going to we're going to have a closed ecosystem and we're going to respect your privacy.  We're not going to collect data.  And by doing all this they've really limited their ability to make that watch be everything  it could be.  You know Siri would be better if they would collect more data about you.  The watch would be better if it worked with more things.

It was partially there for Android.  It was partially there for the iPhone early on.  So they're kind of like the underlying technology people to I pay attention to just to see  what could happen in the future.

Transcript:  I'm just looking right now.  There was the New York Times had a piece in January as word was buzzing about Alexa especially  ahead of Amazon's big Super Bowl ad.  Their report card pointed to Google Lady which is what I like to call him or her at doing  the best 3.1 out of 4.  I guess they like to go with a GPA rating for human comparison.  Siri close behind at 2.9.  I they have a longer thing that breaks down different sort of.

Start time: 4755.68
End time: 4757.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This is based on they gave them things to do.

Start time: 4758.54
End time: 4771.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah they just asked them all sort of the same sort of questions.  Alexa tanked.  I mean that was only in January though.  I can't even imagine what four months and different company acquisitions can do for each  of these products.  That's just going to continue to be ramping up for a while.

Start time: 4771.94
End time: 4800.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Maybe the difference has more to do with venue and expectations than actual capabilities  because I would rank the Echo much much higher.  But probably you're right in kind of in an objective environment it doesn't do as much  as Siri does.  But because it's my house and I'm talking to it and in certain constrained things it  does very well it feels like it's more successful in Siri.  Yeah.  Even if it may not be truthfully as smart as Alexa knows that you're asking very specific

Start time: 4800.24
End time: 4846.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right.  Home use things you know it's all smart machine processing of language is all about trying  to guess what the situation is that it needs to be listening for.  So something like Alexa can limit its kind of expected vocabulary in a very particular  way especially if it's latched into your Amazon account and they're just mining all of that  data compared to Siri necessarily being there for your calendar and for your music and for  making a Steve Jobs joke and making you know asking the meaning of life and all that sort  of stuff.  So I do find I would love to see just someone spend an entire year using that much  vocabulary and seeing what runs up because any sort of test even this New York Times thing  looks pretty relatively anecdotal.  You know it's like 16 tasks were tested.  Right.

Start time: 4847.48
End time: 4911.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's also that the problem with the difference between Alexa and Siri is that I  find that Siri is also more like palpably consumptive.  You know when you have an echo plugged in all the time in your house you don't necessarily  think about the battery.  But for me when I'm on my phone and when I know that I'm going to be using it for a really  long time I might not be able to charge it.  I put that sucker into low power mode and then Siri don't do nothing.  She's basically effectively done at that point because she's no longer actively listening to  me.  I would have to you know think to ask her a question.  There's nothing there that like might possibly be worth using from a hands free perspective  because I'm so concerned that not specifically Siri but the other things that are tied to that  high power or the screen refresh whatever you want to call the active the active background  refresh that that whole kit and caboodle that gets basically cut off during low power mode.  Like I don't want that on my phone all the time.  And so as a result I think that I purposefully handicap my own AI capabilities where I  believe if I had an echo I wouldn't think about it that way at all.

Transcript:  I mean it is worth bringing up these issues like I really love the EFF and everything they  talk about when it comes to consumer rights because yeah when when these things happen like  when if we if we just sit by and accept everything that gets shoved at us like you know I feel like  the world would be a worse place.  So yeah it's worth paying attention and pay attention.  I agree.

Transcript:  But that's very far off.  I don't feel has come out and said that very specifically.  They're very big on it in spite of the fact that Cortana is really low on the recognition level  as I found in my Windows use it's awful.  But you know they really talk as if they're going to somehow.  My guess is they want to acquire like as many companies as possible just so they can sound good  because they want.  They I think HoloLens has really unlocked something for Microsoft because it's a working  product because it's the promise of connect actually fulfilled in terms of scanning a room  and making hand gestures a real thing and they know voice is going to solve that puzzle for the  eventual HoloLens consumer version the kind of thing where you could actually wear a not giant  thing see virtual stuff in your field of view.  You're going to need speech for that to really work for the average consumer.  So I do think the next year and a half two years of all of these big companies battling for voice  Leo I think you're dead on voice is going to be this unifying thing across and it's going to need to  work across all different languages and maybe Microsoft will be last place in English but first  place in all the other countries.  Maybe that'll be fine.  We'll have to see.

It'll it'll change like we'll be using computers like they do in the movie Her which is I think my  favorite example in terms of like that sort of futuristic hands free no keyboards like just do  what I'm telling you.

I could ask it what the weather is or I could ask it while I'm typing an email or something I could  say you know Cortana launch this app and then that'll happen without me having to like go down the  start menu and find everything.  So I think that's sort of like assistive capability is there but most people don't use Cortana that  way and it's there.  It works.  It works pretty well.  It's just like not something everyone's aware of or actually uses.

Yeah I mean Poncho is all about bad jokes and again but it's one of those things where  it's like I think for me like a passive that's why I didn't I don't use chat bots because  for me a passive SMS experience in Poncho or for example digit which is another app  that I use that texts me my checking balance every day.  I can look at it and I don't feel the need to respond.  I can just glance at it and I think that the point is I'm not trying to have a conversation  and I think the issue with chat bots is when you are trying to have a conversation with  them whether it's you know the on through Skype or through Facebook's em or what have  you you sort of start to bump up against those very real borders of natural language how  you're supposed to get an idea across.  And that's not the point right.  You want to be able to just fluently speak to an artificial intelligence and then  understand what you're saying and then do it.

Transcript:  Audible.com.  You know when I first started doing ads people were saying you shouldn't do ads for Audible  because they're so expensive.  And I'm like I'm not going to do ads for Audible.  I don't care.  You know what?  I love Audible.  I've been Audible listener since the year 2000 because I had a horrendous commute.  I spent two to four hours a day in the car and Audible kept me out of road rage.  We'll do the same for you.  And by the way and this is you know I think back I got back into music because of Napster.  I got back into books because of Audible because it made it easy for me to read again.  I turned to Audible and I was like I'm going to read it again.  It made it easy for me to read again.  It turns out I had hours every day where I could read and I just wasn't able to hold  a book.  So Audible is those times when you want to read a book but you can't hold a book at  the gym in the car doing the dishes, walking the dog.  There's plenty of time in your day when you could be listening and it is so enjoyable.  It's really great for those times where you would be otherwise bored out of your skull.  Fantastic.  There's 180,000 titles in every category.  You can read Phil Knight's new autobiography Shoe Dog.  He's the creator of Nike of course.  I mean I love reading biographies and autobiographies and I've read quite a few of them.  Steve Case's new book if you're interested in his story, The Third Wave and Entrepreneurs  Vision of the Future, one of the founders of AOL.  Actually I think the founder of AOL.  We're going to be interviewing Dan Lyons, the fake Steve Jobs, about his book working  at HubSpot called Disrupted, My Misadventure in the Startup Bubble.  We're going to interview him in a couple of weeks, not Monday but a week from Monday I  think.  The 9th.  So you might want to listen.  Dan's got such a great New England accent too.

Now you can cancel anytime in that first 30 days and pay nothing.  But you will keep the two books that you pick.  So pick two books that you really, really want to hear.  This is a great way to find out if audible is right for you.  I know maybe not everybody wants to listen to books.  I am a huge audible fan.  By the way, they also have the great courses.  I'm listening to college courses on every possible subject from physics to history.  Look at this 1066, the year that changed everything.  I love medieval history.  I'm listening to a lot of that.  This is early, early dark ages.  Anyway, it's hard to pick but do pick two.  You get them free audible.com slash twit and the number two.  I'm going to get that alien book.  I got two credits.

Transcript:  Bad news, rule 41.  You remember the Supreme Court a couple of weeks ago said it's okay for a judge to issue  a warrant even if the warrant isn't known to be in that district.  So here's the issue that the law enforcement has come to the Congress with in the Supreme  Court.  We got a problem.  There are people using Tor and other technologies to hide where they're located, but we still  want to listen in.  So the amendment to rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure, this would change  law enforcement's ability to engage in hacking and surveillance.  It's out of Congress or it's actually out of committee unless Congress specifically  changes the rules and they have till December 1st to do so, any judge in the United States  in any jurisdiction can be asked for a warrant to remotely access, search, seize and copy  data if the district where the media or information is located has been concealed through technological  means.  In other words, use Tor, use a VPN, law enforcement can go to the most backwards technology-hating  judge in the country.  They can find that and I bet you there is one judge, they already know who it is, who's  the guy they're going to go to.  It's like the judge in Tyler, Texas who gets all the patent lawsuits because he's known.

I just tell you, I hate computers with them blips and blouts.  No, no, he's from Maine.  He's from Maine.  I hate computers.  I don't know where he's from, but he's somewhere or she's somewhere and she hates it.  By the way, this is not just for American citizens.  You may say, oh, well, I don't have to worry about it because I'm not in the United States.  No.  Any computer user in the world, if you're using location protection technology, maybe  you're even unwittingly part of a botnet, you also are affected by this.  This isn't, according to the EFF, and I am quoting the EFF here, not a procedural update.  It significantly expands the hacking capabilities of the US government and there has been no  discussion or public debate by elected officials.  This is something the intelligence community wants and has gotten, and there's no legislation  involved.  So something you should be aware of.  And one of the things I really like about the EFF is you can go to eff.org slash action  and get involved right to your Congress critter and say, you know what, this is not okay.

And Peter Carr told him, criminals now have ready access to sophisticated anonymizing  technologies to conceal their identity while they engage in crime over the internet.  And the use of remote searches is often the only mechanism available to law enforcement  to identify and apprehend them.  But as Turton points out, actually later in this article, he's like, well, you know, if  you're going to go through all this stuff, maybe you guys should be looking at your warrant  process and how you guys are choosing whether or not you are going to hack someone because  it could be in violation of the fourth amendment very easily due to, and it could be an unlawful  search and seizure.

But fortunately, here's the, okay, so that was the bad news.  Here's the good news.  We've got the FISA courts and the FISC courts.  They are giving oversight.  They are paying attention.  They're making sure that law enforcement doesn't overstep its bounds because, you know, the  Patreon Act made this possible.  These are secret courts where law enforcement has to get the approval of a judge before  doing any of this.  And here's the good news.  1,457 requests made last year by the NSA and the FBI.

And then they approved it.  19 in 2014.  How about this one?  The FBI sent out 48,642 national security letters last year.  Those are the letters where they send it to Facebook or Google or Apple and say, give  us this information about this user.  Oh, by the way, not only can you not tell the user, you can't tell anybody you got this.  They send the letter to Blockbuster, say, what movies did Leo rent?  They sent a letter to Whole Foods saying, does anybody you know eat a lot of hummus?  We don't know because we can't tell.  Because they can't tell.  You tricked me.

By the way, Apple's warrant canary disappeared almost instantly.  So the idea is if they stop putting that in the transparency report, well, obviously they  have.  That's their way of saying without saying it, they have.  And Reddit, you're right.  They also had a warrant canary in their transparency report.  That disappeared.  So yeah, it's happening everywhere.  It's I mean, look, I'm not in favor of terrorism and I know there's criminals out there and  we've got to catch them.  I guess my position is, and I don't think I'm wrong on this and there's been a lot of evidence  this is the case, law enforcement has better tools than ever before to surveil us.  Really the pendulum has swung away from privacy.  And so you should be able to protect yourself to the whatever degree you can because they've  got the echo.  They've got your phone.  They've got all sorts of ways to keep an eye on you.  They have more.  What did they do before there were smartphones?  They still caught crooks, right?  Now they have even better ways and we don't have very many tools and we should be allowed  to.

There's I should have said I've got three bad news is one good news.  There's one more bad news.  Fingerprints.  Now, we've said for a long time that the protection against self-incrimination, the Fifth Amendment  of the Bill of Rights or whatever it is, I don't even know, the Fifth Amendment of the  Constitution says that you have a right against self-incrimination.  As a result, you cannot be compelled to give up a password.  I can't torture you.  Law enforcement can't beat you until you give us your password.  But for years, it's been held that law enforcement does that giving a fingerprint, for instance,  is not self-incrimination.  DNA evidence is not like it can take a hair and do DNA evidence without your permission.  Now, the real question is how about fingerprints?  Is a fingerprint like your password or is a fingerprint like your thumb, like giving  a fingerprint, fingerprint unlocking a phone?  Right now, there's a case in Glendale, California.  Police have a search warrant to compel the girlfriend of an alleged Armenian gang member  to press her finger against an iPhone that has been seized from the Glendale home.  The phone is protected by Apple's fingerprint identification.  And this is the first time, to my knowledge, that this has actually gone to court.  The prosecutors say, okay, you have to use your fingerprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So, you know, we've always said, and we've talked with legal authorities who said, you  know, it probably is the case that the fingerprint on your phone is not protected.  But we've never had, there's not been a court case.  This will be the first.  Some legal experts say there should be a higher bar for biometric data because in a way that  is self-incrimination.  It's not just the DNA you're getting from a hair or the fingerprint itself.  You're getting the phone and the contents thereof.  That is a lot more.

Start time: 6317.52
End time: 6330.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you're also requiring somebody to comply with that order.  It's not a situation where we, I don't think, unless I'm mistaken, feel free to correct  me, but I don't believe that we have the technology to take a fingerprint and then use it on.

Start time: 6332.40
End time: 6369.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  She has to put her finger on it, which requires consent.  That's a bodily action.  And, you know, she has to, she's compelled to like, she can keep her rights, you know,  She's not doing anything that is illegal or unlawful while she's in custody.  And they can't necessarily force her to.  But at the same time, this is the issue when you're talking about something that's encrypted  or locked.  You know, law enforcement can and will, you know, place somebody in solitary confinement  or hold them in contempt of court, you know, for months just to try to whittle them down  and to break their spirit and to get them to, you know, respond to do these things,  to unlock these things.

Start time: 6369.78
End time: 6393.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think you all know this, technologically speaking, if you don't enter your, if you  don't use your fingerprint on your iPhone after a period of time, you then have to enter  the passcode.  And the irony of this, by the way, is that you are protected from giving your passcode  up.  We know that for sure.  So it may be by the time this is moot, right?  When does that kick in?  I think after 24 or 48 hours, your fingerprint stops working after you enter your passcode.

Start time: 6394.84
End time: 6395.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or if you reboot the phone, too.

Start time: 6396.32
End time: 6438.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Reboot the phone, turn the phone off.  Some are suggesting Apple should put a button on there that says, all right, they need my  passcode now.  But I think if you could just delay for 48 hours, that's sufficient.  So it may be that this case is completely moot because, of course, this phone, they've  had this phone for a lot longer than 48 hours.  The director of privacy at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society, Albert Gadari,  says, no, I don't think this violates the Fifth Amendment.  Unlike disclosing passcodes, you're not compelled to speak or say what's in your mind to law  enforcement.  But put your finger here is not testimonial or self-incriminating.  See, I think it's because it's not getting your fingerprint alone.

Transcript:  So here's the good news.  I promise you good news at the end of this.  The House of Representatives, the United States Congress actually agreed on something unanimously.  Four hundred and nineteen to nothing.  And it's something pretty important.  So we've mentioned this before, but in case you didn't know, thanks to a 20 year old law  the Electronic Communications Act, pardon me, 30 year old law from 1986, email after  six months is considered abandoned and law enforcement does not need a warrant to look  at your email if it's more than six months old.  It's not yours anymore.  It's abandoned.  And law enforcement has taken advantage of this for years saying, oh, well, we'd like  to see Leo's email.  It's more than six months old, that kind of thing.  I guess, you know, it's interesting that the House agreed with such vigor that there should  be a warrant.  My thinking is there's probably some members of the House who don't want their old emails  to be seen.  Where are they hiding?  You know, they saw, they watched Dennis Hastert do the perp walk and they thought, you know,  maybe we should have a warrant for this stuff.  Four hundred.  This is a House that can't agree on anything.  Four hundred and nineteen to nothing.  They passed a bill requiring law enforcement to obtain a warrant to look through email  no matter how old it is.  This is, of course, still has to go to the Senate and the president has to sign it as,  I think I remember that from, I'm just a bill on Capitol Hill.  You don't remember that, do you?

But for average citizens like yourself and myself, probably won't help very much.  So it sounds really great.  Everyone's going to sound like they're technologically savvy and into our rights.  But nah, not so much.

Start time: 6635.24
End time: 6661.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Actually, you're absolutely right.  The bill originally had even stronger protections on privacy requiring law enforcement to notify  the person whose electronics communications are being accessed within 10 days.  This provision was removed in an amendment added by House Judiciary Committee Chairman,  the man with the best name in Congress, Bob Goodlatte of Virginia.  So no notification necessary.

Transcript:  I mean, the whole beauty of this sort of thing is that it gets people hooked into the ecosystem  of products, which keeps you in there.  That's the idea anyway, that you're in for five or 10 years because you buy all these  things that play nice and you're using the software that connects them all together.  I think all of these companies, everybody who's in the venture capital world of going,  oh, Internet of Things, all wants to be that baseline name, that name brand, so that if  this ever does catch on in a Fitbit sort of way, that people will go, oh, I want a Ziggsorg.  Everyone wants to be the Ziggsorg.  I personally can think of like 50 different stupid things if I just threw $2,000 at everything  required for motion sensors.  I shouldn't give them such a hard time.

Transcript:  That's what I was saying.  Their hardware has stunk over and over again.  So I have no faith in Google as a hardware company.  Just look at what's happened to Nest now that it's under the MCU and DropCam and everything.  Google has no clue what to do with hardware.  So maybe the new hardware group they're starting could help with that.  But even then, it's not a fundamental thing to that company.  They're all about the internet services.  They're not about building good gear and things that work together well.

But it's really easy, it's cheap, and it works, and it does one good function very well.  I think the issue is that if you're throwing a bunch of stuff at your router, the odds  of you finding something that really works for you are kind of limited.

Our show today brought to you by Carbonite Online Backup.  So important to back up regularly.  You know that, but what is a good backup?  Well, I can tell you a few things I look for.  It's got to be automatic, so I don't have to think about it.  Continuous would be nice.  So if I change a file, I'm writing that great American novel and I add a new character,  I want to have that be backed up.  I don't want to lose that, you know, in a hard drive failure.  And you know what?  Failures happen.  Most importantly, you got to back up off site.  So if there is a real disaster, a fire, a flood or somebody breaks in and steals all your stuff,  your data at least is safe.  You can replace that laptop, but all that work, all those baby pictures in the emails,  the tax records, your great American novel, you don't want to lose that.  I have a friend who's a novelist who, remember about 20 years ago,  there was a big fire in the Oakland Hills, a lot of houses burned.  Her house burned.  Her only copy of her novel burnt with it.  That doesn't have to happen anymore.  We've got backup and we've got Carbonite.  I want you to try it right now.  Go to carbonite.com.  Free trial awaits you.  Use our offer code TWIT and you'll get two free months when you buy.  Home or office, Mac or PC, off site backup, you don't have to worry about,  you don't have to think about, it's just there.  A million and a half homes trust and businesses trust Carbonite.  50 billion files restored, files that would have been lost forever.  Don't forget, use the offer code TWIT, two free bonus months if you decide to buy.  That trial does not require a credit card, it's free.  And for a limited time, up to 30% off.

Transcript:  Nintendo's whole thing has been, obviously, they had the greatest selling console of all  time with the Wii, and they're never going to be able to replicate that.  Nobody's going to be able to replicate that.  The Xbox 360 just went out of production development.  Ten years and up.  Yeah, huge life cycle, and that didn't even get close.  Didn't even get within spinning distance.  And keep in mind also, their hand-hold console business is serious.  Also, their hand-hold console business is still super good.  Nintendo's.  3DS is a perennial seller.  It does a really good job.  Technically, if they wanted to get out of the home console market and just focus on  handhelds and mobile, they could.  And a lot of people suggest that they might and should.  But I think that people were concerned that the new dawn of the Nintendo NX meant that  they were throwing out the Wii U as sort of a mulligan and that it really wasn't where  they were going for.  But at the same time, I think that the Wii U was initially supposed to be a novelty console  device.  And I wouldn't recommend buying one now.  I believe the last time I recommended buying one was right after Black Friday.

Transcript:  You all are of the generation, though, that grew up with Nintendo, with the Super Nintendo  NES or Mario and all of that stuff.  That's culturally important to you all, right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll buy every Nintendo console that ever comes out.  I've bought several generations of 3DSs, even the first one, which burned me because the  price was super high and then they like slashed it by 100 bucks.  You're right, Lauren, that their handheld business has been good.  I think for the past year, the 3DS just hasn't done as well as it used to, or at least for  their overall business.  So like the NX has a lot to prove for next year.  I actually would be interested.  There were some rumors that it would kind of combine a home console plus a handheld  type thing.  And I think they were almost there with the Wii U.  The Wii U's controller is a great way to game when you have the TV off or if somebody else  is using your TV.  Now, if that thing were truly portable and like would give you maybe reception all around  the house, or you could actually offload games and take it somewhere, that would be great  because Nintendo has such a great library of games.  And I don't know, I think that would be a really good evolution of both the Wii and  the 3DS type experience.

Start time: 7710.12
End time: 7737.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is the very end of their fiscal year.  So it seems like that was chosen very specifically as opposed to a Christmas or as opposed to  an even longer delay.  Yeah, you would want to get this out for Christmas, wouldn't you?  They're saying that they don't have enough software and everything they've delayed thus  far, as not that like they just released a Star Fox game after delaying it forever.  That was not delayed to make it better.  That review, it tanked on launch with a lot of bad reviews.  The sales are not as great as they hoped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to be out for both.  They're going to, they're delaying the launch for the Wii U version and having it come out  just sometime in 2017.  So we don't even know if that's going to launch with the Nintendo NX, which assumedly Nintendo's  never been the best at holding to these estimates, by the way.  So March 17 is anybody's guess.  Will they show this at E3?

Start time: 7762.17
End time: 7762.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yes.

Start time: 7762.70
End time: 7781.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they're not going to show a single bit of the NX at E3.  They made that clear, which was very surprising.  In fact, they're not showing anything except the Zelda game.  That's it.  Their E3 presence is going to be very limited, which actually speaks a lot to publishers  in general sort of shying away from thinking of E3 as a necessary thing.  Nintendo's been very big in the last couple of years.

Start time: 7781.72
End time: 7784.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So that's more bad word, bad news about E3 than it is a bad news about Nintendo.

Start time: 7784.70
End time: 7830.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's more bad news about E3.  Nintendo's been very good about controlling its image and its message through YouTube  presentations in which their executives play out as little as caricatures on themselves  and show off games.  That's done very well.  But that Mitomo did well, right?  Yes, it has 10 million.  Mitomo is killing it.  It is making money.  It's going to keep on making money.  And Nintendo was very clear that it's got two more high profile franchises coming by  this fall to smartphones.  It's going to be Fire Emblem, which is like a strategy quest series, and Animal Crossing,  which is what Mitomo should have been, which has a lot more life simulation, a lot more  customization, a lot of the stuff that I think is going to suit very well to smartphone use  in the way that Animal Crossing games did very well on the DS and the 3DS.

Start time: 7834.80
End time: 7929.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I mean, that's going to be, you know what?  Here's the thing.  That could happen in our lifetime, which is something I would have never said, because  the big piece of news that got buried in a lot of these reports is that Nintendo is changing  its corporate structure to a Western board style.  You're going to be seeing more executives from Nintendo of America having control in  the Japanese side of things.  You're going to see a lot more democracy.  You're not going to see the 100 years of Nintendo running things with a Japanese iron fist.  And I think as a result, this is not the generation where they're giving up hardware.  very much wants to control how everything is presented, what's played.  But I do see this maybe being the last hurrah in the beginning of them going, all right,  let's be a services company.  Let's make our, we can have, it's always been about controlling control.  They want, you know, with the Wii and the Wii U and the DS, even the GameCube to some  extent, they're all weird controllers.  They're very obsessed with that.  That's a very Miyamoto driven sort of thing, the creator of Super Mario.  And I see that really fading away as all these other hardware companies lead the charge on  interesting, interactive systems.  I do think that Nintendo NX, whatever its name is really going to be, is going to tie  into smartphones.  I think that they've been hinting at a weird controller.  I really do believe it's going to be about taking the smartphone that everyone has all  across the world, especially Japan, and just saying, we're going to have a standard controller,  but we're going to make sure your smartphone is tied into this because we want your eyeballs  all of the time.  So I see this being the beginning of the end of Nintendo hardware, and I think it's going  to do well.

I mean, you can get any theme that you want, but being a big Animal Crossing fan, as I  am, if anybody has viewed on my laptop, I have the town assistant, Isabelle, is prominently  featured.  Yeah, so I mean, I'm a big, as you can see, I'm a huge Nintendo fan.  And to the point where I made the decision to, I got this 3DS and I imported a faceplate  from Japan because I want to look like the coolest kid, you know, on my big wheel when  I'm riding around the red.  But I think it's really important highlighting two things.  One, the 3DS again, I mean, it's reaching a transition phase, but they're still putting  out great content for it and it's still selling very well.  And also, the interesting thing is about the joint.  Oh, they're so cute.

I think that the Wii U will exist sort of as this archive system that also works with  Wii games and that will still be a family console that people will continue to go to  if you have a busted Wii, you can get a Wii U and all that.  But it'll be interesting to see again whether or not the NX does have a thoughtful interaction  with smartphones because yeah, I think that it will.  And also, you're never going to see me once the Animal Crossing mobile game comes out.  I apologize in advance.

Transcript:  Well now we're getting to good stuff.  Some good source feedback.  I found out, I'm very interested in virtual reality, not so much as putting a screen to  my face, as much as being able to do new things with computer systems, whether that's games  or productivity.  I think hand tracking is one of the most incredible things.  I'm obsessed with it.  One of the big limitations with virtual reality is going around a big space.  As soon as you put a headset on and you feel immersed, you dream of a Skyrim or a Zelda  where you can wander in a landscape, which doesn't really work.  However, as you can see right there on the video, I found an alternate path, which was  putting a little motion tracked wand down the front of my pants or on a belt loop.  I didn't have a belt at that time, I apologize.  And then with the way that the tracker stations work for the Vive as opposed to Oculus, it  sees that, it sees my hip location and it can see if I am running in place, then it  knows where my hip is turned.  So as long as it has my hip alignment in place, then I can jog in place.  And you'll see here as I jog in place, it'll look like I'm moving.  My body doesn't get sick and I can turn my head and my arms and hands.  You'll see as I'm moving around, I'm going to do a little turnaround in the video.  What was really impressive was the feeling that I could run in place to move forward,  but I could shoot a gun left and right.  It had a very basic, this prototype had a very basic gun implement.  So I could imagine myself in Call of Duty running away from bad guys and still shooting  behind me or to my side.  It just, it's clearly not the best thing possible.  But for some guy to simply say, let's just stick the wand down my pants and see what  happens and have it be that convincing, really sets a good tone for sort of future implementations  of this sort of thing.  Now you're going to look silly if you run in place and you're going to look silly if

Transcript:  It's early days and the guy who made it admitted as much.  He said, this is way better than I expected considering it costs nothing.  So you could probably implement like a really cheap belt to pull it off.

End time: 8258.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Correct.  It's picking, it's the smart thing.  The lasers that are being rejected in your room are dumb.  The wand is sending all of that real time information via Bluetooth to your computer  recognizing your absolute position in the room and adjusting the game accordingly.  So I just thought it was very, very inventive and I really like excuses of putting things  down my pants.  I love it.

Transcript:  I'm wondering now.  Yeah, there's a lot.  I've been playing, I played a little Samsung gear VR Minecraft and that was actually surprisingly  fun.  Did you know, I know that Jason Clanthus, our producer told me about it and you said  you played it for how many hours?

Start time: 8280.22
End time: 8286.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I can only play it for about an hour and a half before the battery would die.  Okay.  So I played it in an hour and a half windows.

Transcript:  Now Leo, have you heard about the fact that someone has hacked this to work with the Vive  as well?  If you take your normal purchased Minecraft and hack the files just a little bit, you  can have Minecraft with the Vive which includes not only that relative head positioning but  also the ability to kind of look around, point in the distance to warp somewhere else.  It actually, in my opinion, fixes all the nausea issues that happen with the Gear VR  which simulates walking.  So if you're sitting down but you simulate turning, you can get sick.  The Vive version totally fixes that.  Nobody from Microsoft or Mojang has officially condoned or said, they've yet to say yay  or nay to it.  But it is so cool to get that feeling of, I actually had the guy who showed it to me  it, had me dig a hole underneath my feet and then feel trapped inside of it.  It was one of the most intense feelings I've ever had in VR.  I think mostly because of Minecraft being this comfortable thing.  I think the Gear VR version is a big deal because that is going to reach a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they've been demoing that.  Microsoft and Oculus have sort of teamed up and shown that off at events but they always  show it off with a bowl of ginger candy because it's the motion recreation with a controller,  with a joystick, just messes with the vestibular system in a way that the Vive's move your  own body around system does not.  I have to get this Vive.  True story.

Transcript:  I demoed the Minecraft for Windows 10 with the Oculus Rift and had a really great time  for 15 minutes and then ended up having to prop my body up against a tree outside of  the event and talk myself out of throwing up in front of all of the security guards.  It worked but I was a wreck.

I'm big fans of your work.  Leo, you're all right, I guess.  Okay.  Just I'm going to be watching Captain America and writing about that.  I've got a piece about the team who made the game Hover Junkers.  I've got a feature about that team.  It's a Vive game in which you are on a hovercraft and shoot at people as if it's the most intense  laser tag like game I've ever played in virtual reality.  And they're very great guys.  So that's in the works.  And otherwise, I'm just going to be apparently accepting date offers on Twitter.  Thanks again for having me on.

The last Captain America movie is really good.  Like even if you don't like the Marvel movies in general, like that one was really a good  action movie.  I don't know if you've seen it.
