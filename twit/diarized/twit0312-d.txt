Start time: 417.38
End time: 438.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  God knows they're doing that.  Apple now officially is the world's largest.  Underscore the word world, the world's largest smartphone vendor.  For a long time, they've dominated in the US, but never did that well worldwide.  Nokia was always the biggest.  Nokia is now, according to IDC, second place.

Start time: 438.84
End time: 442.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which has more to do with Nokia's falling than Apple.

Start time: 443.16
End time: 469.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think the reality is this actually happened a long time ago.  We just didn't see it because it really depends on how you count it.  Nokia is long known for having inflated numbers because they consider a smartphone  anything that runs Symbian.  So they have these really cheap, crappy phones that technically run Symbian,  Series 3 or Series 30 or whatever it's called now.  And they're not really smartphones.  No one in the US would ever mistake it for what we think of as a smartphone.

Start time: 470.00
End time: 473.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Hell, I bought an N8 and that's even not much of a smartphone.  Yeah.

Start time: 474.30
End time: 482.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The phones that they sell, they're not making them any money.  They've always had these inflated smartphone numbers.  They've just been slowly collapsing.  But get this.

Start time: 483.38
End time: 495.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Okay, I'm going to hide this graph.  It's too late.  You already saw.  Yeah, hold on.  Ryan's cheating.  Who's number three?  We got Apple, number one, Nokia, number two.  Who's the number three smartphone manufacturer worldwide?

Start time: 495.58
End time: 499.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I already know this because we talked about it on TNT.  So I just won't go ahead.  I won't say.

Start time: 499.40
End time: 501.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, that means Veronica is the only one who doesn't know.

Start time: 502.02
End time: 502.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm looking at the graph.

Start time: 503.96
End time: 506.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not looking at the graph.  I'm going to go with Samsung.

Start time: 506.76
End time: 531.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  If this were the newlywed game, Samsung has been pretty big for all be disqualified for cheating.  Samsung.  I just nailed it.  You just knew it.  You're right.  48.9% Apple.  No, I'm sorry.  Other.  Right.  Others.  Others the big one.  Others the big one.  18.5% Apple.  17.5% Samsung.  Actually, Nokia is number three.  I'm sorry.  Nokia is number three with 15%.

Start time: 532.71
End time: 538.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right after other.  And other you have to assume is a lot of the other Android.  A bunch of Androids.  Who are all just...  A million Android phones.  Yeah.

Start time: 539.12
End time: 539.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And HP.

Start time: 540.24
End time: 546.48

Transcript:  Will putting Windows Phone 7 on Nokia handsets, Ryan, save Nokia?

Start time: 548.90
End time: 550.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think there's any.  There's no silver bullet.  Right.

Start time: 551.06
End time: 556.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  A lot of analysts said that Nokia would be number one in a couple of years because of  Windows Phone.

Start time: 557.16
End time: 570.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I think that their problems are more institutional.  It's less to do with what's running on the phones.  I mean, yeah, they have problems there, but I think it's more cultural institutional.  They have a real leadership problem at the top.  Same thing with RIM.  They really need to cook clean house.

Start time: 570.98
End time: 582.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  RIM's in trouble too.  We'll see this actually.  Tom's going to talk about this in a second.  But Blackberry has a big event in Canada.  A user group meeting.  Might be the first time we see Blackberry 7.

Start time: 584.58
End time: 587.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're all really excited.  I can see everybody's jumping up and down.

Start time: 588.18
End time: 589.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think that's the hope is that all those Symbian system 30 users-  And they'll all just turn to Windows Phone 7.

Start time: 644.52
End time: 645.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it'll become a hit.

Start time: 646.02
End time: 660.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In this time between them getting to Windows Phone 7 and the last couple of years that  Apple's been making these huge gains in Europe, I don't think there's going to be any going back.

Transcript:  We had a TechCrunch event on Friday and we had Duarte.  He did a mobile event.  Yeah.  And so he took a lot of flak.  It felt a little bit bad for him because for whatever reason,  the audience was mainly pro iPhone and iOS.  And it's just like, I think at one point someone asked him on stage,  why does iOS look so much better than Android?  And he's the guy in charge of that.  And he's just, you know, he had the funny quote,  like, why are Sicilians more handsome than other gentlemen?

Start time: 901.01
End time: 913.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it looks good too.  But you do get all that fragmentation over the different flavors.  And you know, every device that comes out has their own kind of spin on it.  And so there's not really that cohesiveness that iOS has.  But you have more choice.

Transcript:  Well, I'll even admit one of my biggest problems with using Android tablets  is that I am so accustomed to iOS that I expect things to work in a certain way.  And that's my own fault.  That's no downside on Android.  That's just my experience.

Start time: 935.40
End time: 952.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's the problem with Android in general  is that you want things to work a certain way.  And if the Android experience works in a variety of different ways...  Then you get that problem there.  Sure, you've got choice and there's that whole open argument.  But it's...  As far as creatures of habit go,  we want things to work the way that they worked yesterday.

Transcript:  Well, and a lot of developers obviously started out with iOS  because it was popular before Android was.  And so a lot of them now try and take their applications and port that over to Android.  And it's just not easy to do.  Anyone you talk to will tell you it's not easy to do,  especially because it's just like there's all these different screen resolutions,  all these different screen sizes that you have to try and make pixel-perfect designs,  which you can do on iOS and you can't do that on Android.

They need to understand that yes, people need a little bit of help  kind of unifying all this stuff and making a great consistent user experience.  There are a thousand things that are wrong  that you could complain about with Apple's ecosystem,  but that's not one of them.  Very consistent, very good user experience.

And MG is like, well, how often do you blow something up and frame it?  I mean, for the most part, this is all stuff that sounds good on paper,  but no one's really going to have much of a different experience.

End time: 1144.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's what's interesting.  I don't think it will either.  I just don't think Apple will go for that yet.  All the devices that are out there right now, they talk about the battery life,  taking a major ding, and everyone I know who has one, the EVO and the other ones out there,  they just talk about how they disabled 4G most of the time because it's just not worth it.

Start time: 1145.02
End time: 1162.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's also about consistency of experience.  They want to be able to sell you a phone that you will get that speed on.  That's just not there yet.  So it will probably be chipsets that get a little bit less costly, a little bit more  power efficient, network gets a little bit better, and then they release one LTE phone  for both Verizon and...  Right.  That's kind of interesting.

End time: 1173.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  There's an example where, if you ask me, consistency could bite you because  in order to be consistent, we have to wait until everybody's got it.  That makes it better for less sophisticated users, but I like it.

Yeah, we've had that for a while.  But done right.  But done right.  Oh snap.  Yeah.  Damn.  It's less about the hardware for me and more about the software integrating.

When we come back, we're going to talk about the Airbnb rental that went so very bad.  I think it's actually Veronica EJ.  I think she's...  Yeah, you must be really upset.

We've all done it.  Let me tell you, if you're in support, you don't have time to get on the phone  and talk your clients and colleagues through it.  That's why GoToAssist Express from Citrix is such a great solution.  It lets you get in there and fix it yourself.  It's very easy for you, but more important, maybe, very easy for your supportees.  You don't want to have to be supporting the support tool.  All you do is you send them a link.  They click it.  It's Java.  So they press...  They have to get the little certificate.  It says allow and boom, you're in.  You're fixing the computer.  You can do eight sessions at once.  So you can start to scan on one and install on another, move to the next, move to the next.  Makes you much more efficient.  You can see what operating system are running.  That's important, by the way, not only because you can see what version of Windows,  but it also supports the Mac.  So it's cross-platform.  You can see what security software they're running.  It's so efficient that GoToAssistExpress users were surveyed and they said on average,  a 40% increase in their productivity.  That's like getting two more work days a week.  Whether you're in customer support, technical consulting, management, a software support guy,  computer guru, like this panel here, GoToAssistExpress.  It'll help you increase revenue, reduce travel time, reduce support time, service more clients.  And isn't that what we're all about?  Servicing more clients.  Go to try it right now.

Start time: 1520.48
End time: 1523.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 1524.10
End time: 1533.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They limit the amount of contact you can have with the renters until after the whole transaction has gone through.  So then at that point, you can do email addresses or phone calls, that kind of thing.

Start time: 1534.50
End time: 1538.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_12

Start time: 1551.56
End time: 1560.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 1573.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Start time: 1573.92
End time: 1581.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1585.18
End time: 1610.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little different though than eBay because with eBay,  when you have a high value thing that you're selling and you get a first time buyer,  somebody who's not good on eBay, right?  They don't have the reputation already.  You go through escrow, right?  They put the money in escrow.  You send them the thing.  Escrow releases and everybody's happy.  Right?  So there are protection mechanisms that way.  But there's no protection mechanism when it comes to the object in question is a residence and everything in it.  Well, to make a long story short, though,

Start time: 1611.00

Start time: 1644.66

We've been working with this person very closely to try to figure out how we can help her,  you know, get the person in custody, figure out how we can make her feel safe and secure.  But she later came back and said that after June 30th,  all her communication with the customer representatives at Airbnb stopped after she  posted her first blog post.

Start time: 1670.02

Start time: 1677.70
End time: 1681.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So this was the theories that, well, we want to shut this thing up because we got a funding round.

Start time: 1681.76
End time: 1721.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I guess one of the co-founders actually called her and talked to her a little bit and  was like, we'd really like you to take down this blog post.  We'd really like you to censor this.  They didn't say censor, but, you know, put it behind a wall.  Yeah, secure it, lock it down.  And she was like, no, I'm not going to do that.  And that's kind of how it's he said, she said now between Airbnb and this person, this anonymous,  quasi anonymous person.  She obviously doesn't want her real name out there because she doesn't want any kind of,  you know, more privacy invasion than she's already going through.  But they say they had a suspect in custody, yet she hasn't heard that from the SFPD either.  So on her end, everything is still as it was a month ago.

Start time: 1721.38
End time: 1728.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I don't want to get too into this, but as I understand it,  and I haven't really even followed it that closely, like there was stuff that happened  yesterday with Paul Graham of Y Combinator who was the funder,  is one of the original backers of Airbnb.

Start time: 1762.44
End time: 1780.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And by the way, a huge supporter of Airbnb.  Paul's been going around saying this is the next big thing.  This is going to be bigger than eBay.  It disrupts hotel change.  I'm starting to hate that word.  Yeah.  Well, it changes business.  No, I know what you mean.  Nice plug.  Well done.

Start time: 1780.35
End time: 1811.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just a...  No, but so, you know, it's another he said, she said thing.  I mean, it's just now like, you know, I guess Paul Graham wasn't so sure  of the validity of what Mike said the people from Airbnb had told him.  And he's saying, absolutely, that's what they told me.  And, you know, we went back and forth even.  And so, you know, now it's now it's a whole other thing.  He actually he just wrote another post that I'm looking at right now.  Another Airbnb victim tells his story.  There were meth pipes everywhere.  What?

Start time: 1811.74

Start time: 1815.36
End time: 1834.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, think about it.  It's the perfect like ruse.  You can rent a place for a short amount of time, basically do whatever you want,  and they can't track you.  So instead of having your regular meth house, you can kind of spread your...  I don't know.  Right.  It's not like you have to look somebody in the eye at the hotel before you go into the room.

Transcript:  And I've been looking into it for a trip that I'm taking with some of my girlfriends in the winter,  like out of the country.  It's the same thing.  I've been like, oh, Airbnb, this will be perfect.  We can rent a little cottage.  We can have a great time.  I'd have to deal with the hotels.  And now I'm like, I don't know.  Yeah.  Like even though I'm the one who's doing the renting, I still think it'd be okay to be a renter.

Start time: 1879.50
End time: 1894.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, hey, crazy is all over the place, right?  I mean, somebody who's out to screw you can be renting something out as well.  And maybe you get to Costa Rica and you can't get in.  The house doesn't exist or something like that.  That would be bad.  Yeah.

Start time: 1894.62
End time: 1897.30

Start time: 1897.44
End time: 1916.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like this is, you know, it looks very bad for Airbnb right now, but I think that,  you know, this will pass eventually.  It's very much a chicken and egg problem where it's just like they don't have,  they have so many first time users of this service.  And the ratings are different.  Their rating thing.  And they've already talked about things that they're going to change.  They're going to offer insurance now.  They're going to have other things.

Start time: 1917.00
End time: 1936.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and also like Craigslist, for example, one of the points that EJ made in her post was that  if I did this on Craigslist, I would be reminded time and time again that this is on my own.  Yeah.  Watch for fraud.  This is me watch for fraud.  Yes.  Do this on your own.  It's not, we take no responsibility for what happens.  She felt like she wasn't sufficiently warned through Airbnb.

Start time: 1937.14
End time: 1953.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's also slightly different too, because Craigslist is kind of like a standard for  classifieds, whereas Airbnb is actually marketplace.  And the marketplace aspect, the exchanging of money, the reputation system,  that creates different expectations.  Yeah, Airbnb absolutely needs to step up here, I think.  Yeah.

Start time: 1954.16
End time: 1995.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, one of the things I think that plays into this a little bit is, so for example,  the place that we rented last December in Paris, it worked out really well for us.  No kidding.  We were there for just a few days and everything was fine.  We never met the person that rented it out, but we had a lockbox key.  The key was where he said it would be and it was fine.  It was also pretty obvious that he didn't live there.  It was some sort of a sublet situation.  I've spent a lot of time trolling Airbnb because I do like,  oh, let's go to Berlin and what are my options there, that kind of thing.  So I've looked at a lot of apartments and you can kind of tell that a good amount of  them are not actually lived in by anybody.  It's some sort of extra, maybe it's something that somebody owns and they're trying to get,  pay their mortgage on.

Start time: 1995.88
End time: 1998.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there are legal situations around that in the United States.

Start time: 1998.44
End time: 2023.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That too.  Yeah, exactly.  A lot of landlords are really scared of Airbnb because they don't want people  subletting because that's usually not a kosher thing to do.  But I think that Airbnb is, they're well aware that for the most, well, not for the most part,  but a large amount of people are not actually renting out places where they live and their  coffees in the cabinet and their underwears in the dresser.

Start time: 2023.88

Start time: 2033.88
End time: 2057.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Apparently, they didn't secure them very well.  Is it kind of like a Zipcar or these?  I mean, right now, Zipcar.  It's more like the get around thing.  I'm just saying because Zipcar is so small and it's used by a small group of hipsters.  No one owns the car except Zipcar.  But I'm saying it works right now because it's a small group of kind of tight hipsters.  And so it's okay.  What?

Transcript:  It's used by people with bangs and beards.  Okay, I'll be honest.  No, but I mean, it's kind of like a Google+.  It's used by a small group of kind of have a certain socioeconomic level.  As soon as it becomes public, I wonder if Airbnb's model sustains, in other words.  Just in the same way as wonder if Zipcar's model sustains as soon as the, you know.

Start time: 2088.80
End time: 2128.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really think it does.  I mean, I think that if they get big enough, you know, if they keep growing,  what we've seen now.  The ratings help.  Yes, the ratings help.  They'll have other ideas that they're already trying to implement.  They had a thing that's actually pretty smart that they did before this.  Obviously, it didn't help here.  But they have a good Facebook connection where you can tell if like there's a second degree  connection that you know someone who's like rented this place before.  Like a sonar type of a thing.  It's like situation, yeah.  I mean, the fundamental issue is though you have to just, at the core level,  you have to believe that not everyone, you know,  someone's not going to be a jackass with your apartment.  Well, that's the problem.  Like that's not, people aren't evil, you know.  But people are evil.  She's also, E.J. has also said.  Right, we don't think people are evil.

Start time: 2128.88
End time: 2148.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She also said going back through the email correspondence that I had with this person,  these people, there was a funny name spelling.  Things were said that were weird.  And of course, in hindsight, that happens a lot where you go, gosh, I should have known,  I should have trusted my intuition that something was a little off here.  So she even says there was something off.  I just wanted to believe it was going to be fine.

Start time: 2149.34
End time: 2175.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I guess the real reason that Airbnb gets these big value, this billion dollar valuation,  is because people think it will compete with Travelocity and travel agents.  And it is.  Essentially compete against hotels.  Yeah.  And in fact, Airbnb really doesn't start taking off until hotels  start using it in addition to vacation rentals, right?  That's when, that's, I think what the model is.  You don't get to a billion dollars unless people book all their accounts.  You mean if hotels start parting their listings through here.

Transcript:  I just don't understand why Airbnb didn't take this really bad situation.  They should have been much more aggressive.  As a great opportunity for PR.  I mean, they could have handled it.  They screwed up for PR big time.  They could have, they could have made a big deal out of this and how they were going to  help this woman restore her, you know, her, not only her ransacked home, but you know,  her trust in the company.  And instead they did this sort of weasely, please take your block list down.  There was a great comment on it on one of the sites.

Start time: 2209.56
End time: 2232.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It may have even been one of the TechCrunch posts that was like,  they could have flipped this around because at the end of the day, when you go the extra step  to help a customer like this, they're going to remember it in a really good way.  And that's what's going to be out there.  But if you screw over a customer, they are going to blow that up three times what it  originally was and, and, and remember that forever.  And because of blogs and social media, that customer has a megaphone.  Amplified.

Start time: 2271.14
End time: 2298.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's like, in fact, I've think a lot of people reading the story thinking,  what an idiot didn't, I mean, of course this is going to happen.  What a surprise.  Right.  So it's going to happen.  So it's like, why, why, why are they not better prepared for this?  Right.  Well, and Airbnb clearly, I mean, that is the lesson, handle it badly.  They should have done the discovery channel home makeover and made a big deal out of it.  Exactly.  We are going to turn her house into a palace.  I think they did in the long run.  They rebuilt it.  Yeah.

Start time: 2299.22
End time: 2312.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Yeah.  Yeah.  And then trashing it and then expecting Airbnb to pick up the tax too.  So they're definitely in a really...  You have to be really careful with your exceptions.

Transcript:  There was also MG's colleague, Paul Carr, wrote up a really interesting article over  the weekend about the idea that because of the way this market is for services such as  this that are very dependent on ratings and social, and it's a competitive place right now.  If you're going to be successful and you're going to have a grand exit and you can make  a lot of money, you have to have a lot of users.  And when you start talking about users in the millions, you start thinking about those  users less as people and more as data.  And when that happens, this is not an evil company we're talking about.  This is just the way that you have to start thinking about your user base,  not so much as people, but as statistics.  And then you get into trouble when you're talking about someone's personal belongings.  Good point.  Because it isn't really, yeah.  Right.

Start time: 2368.70
End time: 2389.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But a good lesson, I mean, I think you would think that lesson to be well learned by anybody  in a startup these days is that social media can kill you, blogs can kill you,  be very aggressive and proactive when something like this happens.  It's cost you a lot less to do that.  We're going to take a break.  This is a great, this is like, I feel like we're at a great dinner party,  but we just don't have any food or beverages.

Transcript:  And I am Switzerland.  But first, let's talk about backup.  Backup done right with...  You know, I hear them saying it at home.  Carbonite.  Carbonite.com is online backup.  It's kind of a neat story.  The guy who started it, David Friend, got out of...  He was a Yale graduate.  I think went to graduate school at MIT.  Got out of school and built the ARP Synthesizer.  Had a great company.  ARP.  Remember ARP?  Every rock and roll band in the world used ARP.  And he just had a great life.  Retired.  Said, I'm done.  I'm going to take it easy.  One of those entrepreneurs who said, I'm happy.  And then his daughter, who's in college, calls him and says,  Daddy, I just lost my term paper.  I've got no backup.  And he thought, you know, there really has to be a better way  to do this.  And he got back in the game and created Carbonite.  An online backup service that backs up your data wherever you  are whenever you're online.  It uses 128-bit SSL, so it's safe to use at an open access  spot like students use at coffee shops and stuff or at home.  You can encrypt your data further using strong encryption.  So your privacy is guaranteed.  And the price is right.  I actually put it on.  It's funny.  It goes full circle because I put it on my daughter's computer  when she went to college so that I wouldn't get that call  that David got.  Unlimited online backup.  $59 per year per computer.  That's less than $5 a month for everything on your internal  drive.  And I mean, I'm telling you, you don't ever have to think about  how much data I have.  You just back it up.  And you can get to that data anytime.  So it's cloud storage too.  So you can go to your Carbonite account on a Mac or a PC.  There's your stuff.  They also have smartphone apps.  iPad, iPhone, Android, Blackberry even.  So you always can see your data.  It's cloud storage, unlimited cloud storage for $59 a year.  Compare that to Dropbox or anybody else.  You'll realize what a good deal that is.  It's also very easy to restore.  That's important.  And you can try it free for two weeks right now.  Go to carbonite.com and use twit as the offer code.  C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E carbonite.com offer code twit.  They've been a great supporter of twit.  David is a great friend.  David friend is a great friend.  It sounds a little strange, but it's true.  And I really appreciate their support  for everything we do here at twit.  And I strongly encourage you to check out  Carbonite for your backup needs.  Moving along to, let's see what else we got here going on.  Google+.  I hate, somebody sent me an email saying,  stop talking about Google+.  It's not public.  And yet there are what?  20 million people on it.  I mean, it might as well be public.  Is there anybody?  Let's ask our studio.  We've got 25 people in the studio.  How many of you are on Google+.  Everyone.  Yeah.  There's a few not.

Transcript:  Lawrence Hubbard, we asked on Google+, ironically.  Eileen Rivera, my producer, said, well,  what do you want to talk about on twit?  One of the things that Lawrence Hubbard on Google+, said is,  what are the pros and cons of opening up to the public?  It's still in the field test state.  This is kind of the Airbnb issue.  The Zipcar issue.  What happens if everybody's on Google+.  Is it suddenly Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber,  and a bunch of people you don't care about?

Start time: 2877.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Google could have opened this up right away.  They certainly have the infrastructure to be able to do that.  You bet.  I think that what they wanted to do was,  first of all, it's been good for Buzz.  Not Buzz the product, which sucks, but the other Buzz.  Industry Buzz.  Industry Buzz.

Transcript:  Two.  I don't know if I agree that they could have just like rolled it out instantly, right?  I mean, like Gmail is a pretty good example.  Like they have had really, really bad scaling issues.  I know that you, you know, I hear you complaining about this a lot.  And I totally feel it too.  I can't even use Gmail over the web anymore because it's so slow for me.  Really?  Yeah, it's just so slow.  Sometimes, not all the time.  I have that issue.  Almost all the time.  It's gotten a little better, but there was like a while where it was like unusable.  In the mornings.  Especially for Google, who's obsessed with speed.  Like they're so obsessed with speed.  It's really uncharacteristic.  I think, you know.  What just popped up for me.

Start time: 3012.16
End time: 3039.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had said, I met with them a little bit before it launched.  And the reason why they wanted to do the staggered rollout is also because they really did want  to iterate on the fly.  They knew this time that they wouldn't nail everything out of the box.  Even though they had been dog food, you know, internally dog food testing it.  They had done that with Wave and Wave was great internally.  But then when it was released, there were so many things that were wrong with it.  So they knew that as long as they could do this staggered rollout, still on a massive  scale, they would get a lot of good feedback on it.  And I think that they have.

Start time: 3040.03
End time: 3078.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  There's certain things that obviously need to be worked out.  Collapsible comments would be really nice.  It seems like the number one request.  And yeah, I want options on what notifications that I see.  If someone I don't know shares a post with me, I want to be able to toggle that notification  on or off.  I use Google Apps, which is made using Google Plus with Google Apps, unusable.  Now I have to use two browsers or I have to go incognito within Chrome.  It's like there are there are things that they probably knew would be an issue.  But now they see how many people it's affecting.  OK, you know, do 100 people have this problem or do a million people have this problem?  So that's that's all part of the learning experience right now is people commenting

Start time: 3122.53

Transcript:  You know, maybe Facebook does the same thing that they don't roll out features  to their entire user base instantly.  Even the biggest launches where they get everybody in the room and they, you know,  they they talk about how awesome it is that comes out over the course of weeks  and sometimes months before it hits the entire user base.  So I mean, it's I don't know.  It's not that unusual when you're talking about the scale of tens,  hundreds of millions of people.  You can't open.  You can't fling the doors wide open.  It's very I mean, I don't know.  I don't know if anybody's ever actually done that successfully.  Like had a buzz, my successful launch.

Start time: 3200.84

Start time: 3276.60
End time: 3318.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the circles and the ability to filter...  I wish I could filter the opposite way,  where I tried a little experiment where I tried to make a group of  a circle of sword and laser people,  and then I realized that was a bad idea,  because now there's a lot of people I don't know  showing up in my primary timeline.  Overall.  Yeah, I only added like 150 people, but that was a mistake.  It's not the way it should be used,  and I learned that lesson pretty quickly.  But I'm glad that people can filter me out  if they don't want to see me in certain circles,  you know, if they just want...  But that's the thing, like I don't just post tech stuff,  I post funny stuff or I post Game of Thrones stuff.  And it's hard to pick circles.  And I feel bad because I don't want to be  in a different area than people expect me to be in,  I still think the circles thing is going to break down really quickly.

Start time: 3318.70
End time: 3345.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's just people are just going to use it for friends.  You know, there's standard ones, there's friends,  coworkers, and family, and that's like it.  You know, maybe, and maybe people will use one of those,  like, or just like, because they make you drag everyone  at least into one circle to be able to see it.  I just, I don't think that that's going to scale.  I think it's a good idea at first,  and, you know, they make,  they have a really nice mechanism for doing it,  but then when you have to manage it, it's a huge pain.  I mean, no one's going to go back in and say like,  oh, well actually they're doing it.

Start time: 3345.22

End time: 3370.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  There's a lot of extensions on Chrome for Google+.  Including one that will see a GIF that you've seen before and block future.  I don't know, it must be doing some sort of image recognition,  and it will block it again from your stream in the future.  Isn't that clever?

It's always bothered me, and I don't know what the solution is.  Tumblr, they haven't figured it out either.  That's just a problem with something that a lot of people find interesting,  and then friendships overlap.  You start seeing the same stuff.  But that is how we learn.

That's how you know.  A thousand people say that Michael Jackson's dead.  That's how you see it.  Right.  That's how you know.  MG, you wrote an article about Google's new PageSpeed service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I haven't tried it yet, but yeah, they're apparently...  They want people to switch over to using...  How do you do this?  So you have to switch over to using Google's DNS servers.  And then when you do that, you basically grant them access to be able to look at  the way that your site is written, and they can reconfigure things to make it  as fast as possible in their view of how they can serve it up.

Start time: 3470.20

So we did the tool that estimates how much faster your site's going to be,  and we tried it on Gadget, and it was like 5% to 10% slower, I think.  Like it actually said red negative, like you lose speed by doing this.  So they actually have a test.  Well, at least they told you that.  Yeah, no, I know.  So they're honest.

Start time: 3675.16
End time: 3692.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  IBM, yeah, IBM.  One of the reasons IBM's still around is a players because they have so many patents.  Google acquired 1,000 patents.  And I don't know if this is that Google wants to become a patent troll.  It's like defensive.

Start time: 3692.58
End time: 3697.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Defensive, yeah.  I think they feel really threatened after the Nortel patent thing.

Start time: 3697.30
End time: 3747.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They felt threatened before it.  They still have less than 1,000 patents total.  Well, now they finally have over...  Really? That's all they have?  Yeah, yeah.  So they more than doubled their patents.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's why it was so vital that they really needed to win those 6,000 plus Nortel patents.  And I think Apple and Microsoft realized that and just swooped in there and screwed them.  Very interesting.  But yeah, Google's stance now is that there are plenty of patents out there, they say,  and they'll go after every one of them.  They're trying to get to the point where they reach mutual assured destruction,  where they just...  They stop getting sued by everyone.  It almost doesn't even matter what the patents are for.  Right.  Because yeah, they don't need to cancel each other out necessarily.  They just need to be able to sue other people if other people are going to sue them.  Or you're going to sue them.  Yeah, you're going to sue me for that.

If you know a lot about this space, nothing surprising in there.  But many of the terms that they use to describe patents are terms that are,  you know, mutually assured destruction, you know, weapons of...  Nuclear war.  Nuclear war, weapons of mass destruction.  I mean, it's, you know, it is very much Cold War-like.  It is the way you combat your opponents without actually attacking them.

Transcript:  Can we all conclude that software patents are a terrible idea?  Let's just get rid of them?  Or is there any justification?  Is there any...  You know, it's funny.  I got in a little battle with Neil Ipatel, who kind of believes in software patents.  I was a little surprised.  I don't think there's any justification for it.  Let's get rid of them.  Look at the wasted amount of money, time, innovation that's lost because of software patents.

Start time: 3802.74
End time: 3845.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think the problem with software patents is that  things are patented under the guise of software patents that are just conceptual.  And that's, I think, where...  I mean, there are two really big problems.  There's the conceptual patents that are just very broad  and they don't really make any sense as patents because patents are supposed to be non-obvious.  And then there are these, you know, this other class of patents,  which is just duplicating stuff that's already been patented.  So you have duplication and then you also have concept.  Patents are supposed to be about specific ideas and processes.  So if you're talking about like, you know,  there are infinite ways to add and subtract and divide numbers to get to a million.  So if you're talking about one specific way to do that,  that's very different from the concept of adding numbers until you get to a million.

Start time: 3851.62
End time: 3907.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they tried to do that and they only did, you know, they limited its success.  I think they reformed a bit of the patent office, how it works or whatever.  And there were some pluses in that, but overall the system is still the same.  And I mean, this thing, this keeps coming up and up, up over and over again.  It's like Google, this is the big story now because Google,  their mentality has always been like, oh, we don't really need to worry about the patent issue.  And so they're the guy who everyone is coming after.  And that's why this is a story now.  It's not just Android patents.  It's the other thing, you know, the MPEG LA stuff.  VPA, yeah.  What's talking about that?  Well, go ahead.  But it's, you know, like Microsoft back in the day,  even though they're now a big patent player, they used to have a similar mentality  where they didn't think that they needed to get all these patents  until everyone started coming after them.  And now they're one of the big players.  And this is going to force Google to be one of the big players in it.  And I think the problem might go away for a little bit once Google gets up to their level  where they can dissuade these other attacks from coming up.  But then it will keep coming up again when some other players up there.

Transcript:  And there's no domain expertise required.  It's not like the people who are reviewing software patents  have to be former software engineers.  I think you could probably solve like 80% of the problems  just by ensuring domain expertise of patent review.  It's just top to bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right now it's broken to the point where only, you know, the big players...  What's a little guy do at that point?  Yeah, exactly.

Transcript:  So MPEG LA is the company that owns the H.264 patent.  It's a consortium of a bunch of different companies.  They said, oh, we'll never charge royalties for small companies.  You know, there's a real risk.  I mean, we distribute stuff in H.264.  There's the real, very real risk that they could come along  and say to podcasters, for instance, hey, you know,  pay up because you're using H.264.  They said, oh, we'll never do that.  So Google suggested they purchased WebM, which is a codec,  and underlying that is VP8.  And they said, look, we're going to open source this.  We're going to buy this.  We're going to open source it.  We're going to say, we're going to, you know,  onto the company that developed VP8, we own them,  and we're going to give you perpetual royalty-free licenses  to the patents on VP8.  So everybody just use it.  It was their proposal to use it in HTML5.  Well, now MPEG LA has fired back, and they say, well,  turns out 12 companies have patents essential to the VP8  algorithm, and that, in fact, Google isn't going to be able  to either indemnify or give you royalty-free licenses.

Start time: 4028.10
End time: 4030.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4032.18
End time: 4034.96

Start time: 4034.98
End time: 4043.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, both Google and Mozilla.  So Mozilla is obviously the huge open source player.  Google less so that they're trying to say that they're  always open about everything.

Start time: 4043.70
End time: 4045.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But if they could both agree, for instance, to use WebM.

Start time: 4046.04
End time: 4058.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and Mozilla's always because one of the reasons  that Google says that they're doing this whole WebM thing  is because Mozilla would never get on board with H.264 fully  because they will not use something that's patent  encumbered at all.

Start time: 4059.10
End time: 4062.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So they did not build into the browser the ability  to play back H.264.

Start time: 4063.48
End time: 4067.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, and so they won't do that, and so HTML5 can't move  forward with using that.

Start time: 4067.90
End time: 4076.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  There is no, right now in HTML5, the bracket video  bracket doesn't call on anything because of this.  There's no support for anything.

Start time: 4077.34
End time: 4111.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so Google has said that they're going to support this  basically because Mozilla's supporting this, and they agree  with that stance that this is the right thing to do, that  they think that they can prove that this is the open source  way to do it.  The problem has been, and people have been saying this,  that no one's sure that these are fully patent protected.  And what happens, why would everyone switch over  to using that?  Of course, at the same time, on the opposite ends, Apple  and Microsoft and many others are the players who are a part  of the MPEG LA consortium, so they all have conflicting  interests here about this.  But it's another mucked up situation.

Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  When we come back, the biggest story, the story that  everybody on Google Plus wanted to talk about, AT&T has said,  oh, you know that unlimited plan that you guys have  grandfathered in?  Eh, not so fast.  We'll talk about throttling.  There's a few people who'd like to throttle AT&T right now.  Before I do, though, let me talk about FreshBooks,  freshbooks.com, if you'd like to follow along with me at home.  It's funny, I found out about FreshBooks myself.  I started using them seven years ago because I was still  a freelancer.  I was working up in Canada doing the TV shows up there.  And with Bill Rogers every month, I just hated making  invoices.  You launch Excel or Word or something, and you print it out  and you mail it to them, and you hope you remember to do it  at the end of the month.  And if you don't, you hope you remember to do it the next day.  It's a pain in the butt.  So she said, look, hey, there's this really cool site.  Amber.  Amber did, not you.  No.  Amber MacArthur did.  And she said, look, there's this really cool site.  It's very web 2.0.  It's called FreshBooks.  It's from Toronto.  Folks created it.  And I started using this, and it was just a lifesaver.  I put my logo on the page.  It sends out email invoices.  It'll also print.  I used to print for Rogers.  I would print and send an email invoice.  But now 2 million people have used FreshBooks.  It is so cool.  They've added some really nice features.  For instance, now with FreshBooks,  they have a Pay Me Now button right in the invoice.  I think a lot of times your clients want to pay you right  away, just as much as invoices are paying.  Paying the bills is a pain.  So now they just click the button,  and they can use a credit card or PayPal or authorized net.  There's 11 other payment gateways just to pay you right away.  You can even set up automatic payments, which is so cool.  Automatic invoicing, automatic payments.  So you both are kind of out of the loop.  It just happens for you.  This was nice for me because I worked in Canada.  It does all the currencies.  It does the currency translations automatically.  For an additional fee, they will print it out, stamp it,  and mail it for you, which I think is really great.  If you do time and hours, they have an iPhone app,  but there's also a web app that will keep track of your time  and hours, and then put it right in the bill.  So many nice features on this.  If you're still doing invoices the old way, by hand, check it out.  Here's the deal.  Go to freshbooks.com right now, and you can start for free.  Free for the first three clients.  Easily upgraded to 25 clients for about 20 bucks a month.  It's very affordable, but free for the first three.  Forever.  I mean, that's a really nice deal.  It'll only take you about a minute to set up an account,  and once you've got it, you are going to love it.  And by the way, they are giving away a birthday cake  to one of our audience members every week.  You don't have to be, it doesn't have to be your birthday  to get the birthday cake.  Just sign up and let them know you heard about it on Twitter.  Freshbooks.com.  Make billing and invoicing absolutely painless.  It's just great.  One of the first Web 2.0 sites I ever used,  and I still have a real soft spot for them.  They're just fantastic.  Free for the first three.  Freshbooks.com.  Thank them for their support of this week in tech.  I think you did this chart, didn't you, MG?  Is that your chart?  No.  This is from ours, Technica.  I love this.  They did a nice job of putting together all the costs of data  from all the different people.  It's Apple Insider that did this.  AppleInsider.com did this chart.  Unfortunately, AT&T is going to throttle the heaviest,  unlimited data users starting October 1st.  Do you have an unlimited plan, Sarah?  The people who wanted the most.  Did you grandfather?

Transcript:  Well, I do for my iPad, because I started on AT&T.  But what's funny about this story, I kind of have to chuckle,  is that I moved over from AT&T to Verizon,  because AT&T was downright unusable in our apartment  and many other places.  I decided, even though I know that data is overall going to be  a little bit slower on Verizon, I'm willing to take that hit,  because I want my tablet or my phone to be stable overall.  And to think that AT&T is going to throttle people who are heavy users.  And I'm totally in that 5% bracket.  I mean, if it means five hours of streaming music per month, that's me.  I just kind of have to laugh, because it's like, well, what else do they have?  If they're not going to be any faster data-wise.

Transcript:  Well, there's a lot of irate users. Let me just put it that way.  October 1st. They don't say what kind of throttling.  It says, starting October 1st, smartphone customers with unlimited data plans  may experience reduced speeds once their usage in a billing cycle reaches the level.  You can't even know this, by the way, that puts you among the top 5%  of heaviest data users. You don't even know that.  It would just happen. It's not like, oh, you've used four gigabytes.  You've used five gigabytes. No.  You just have to be in this magic top 5%.  I think that's annoying.

It's 20% or 18.5% improvement in page load time. And if you go there the second time,  so they are doing some caching, 23% improvement. So that's worth it.  Now it's free right now if you can get into the program.  I would do that. And we are already, by the way, this is PHP. We're doing  all that PHP caching and stuff. And we would do a lot of caching.

Transcript:  Topiary. He did it for the lulz. Ryan Massey on Google Plus suggested we  talk about the lulzsec story. British police arrested a teenager yesterday.  On July 27th, they said it's Topiary, who of course is the guy who has been  chatting with people on Twitter and other places.

Transcript:  He's a funny guy.  Lulzsec, they think, might have deliberately tricked the authorities into believing that  somebody else is the real Topiary. Are they that smart?  The, according to an article published on the Daily Tech website by Jason Mick,  the real Topiary is a 23-year-old Swedish hacker, not a teenager from Shetland.  He's got a chat log. Do you think there's just one Topiary or is it like that? It's like V.  Is it like that movie? What's that movie?  V for Vendetta.  Yeah, V for Vendetta.

Transcript:  I guess it's possible that Topiary is just one person physically living in Sweden or wherever,  but it makes more sense that it's a group of people because that's how this whole  anonymous Lulzsec organization, it's all founded on the idea that you can't just arrest somebody  and the whole thing's going to stop because there's too many of us and we're all working together  and you don't know who we are.

Actually, what you want is for everybody to think he's Topiary.  In some ways, yeah. If you're doing your reputation.

Transcript:  So HR 1981 passed the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday. It's the ISP data retention bill.  Of course, they use child pornography, as always, as the straw man.  You don't want this, right?  Oh, man.  Pass this bill, then.  You must be in favor of child pornography if you don't like this idea.  What it does is requires Internet service providers to keep 12-month logs of customer's names,  credit card information, and other identifying information so that law  enforcement can go to the ISP and say, hey, who did that when?  Now, admittedly, it could, you know, if you were a child pornographer,  if they wanted that information to be valuable, but there's lots of other things, including  piracy that this might be useful for.  Center for Democracy and Technology says, we don't see that this would  help in any way catch criminals involved in child pornography.  It's going to be a tiny percentage of the cases law enforcement uses.

But he gets up there and he's been on stage before at Disrupt and he is very knowledgeable.  And he asks the best questions usually because it's like, instead of all of us thinking amongst  each other and we're all speaking in circles, he thinks more like outside the box.

And they're coming from a high quality standpoint.  And they're just not really going to get into that game.  And they're almost more annoyed than anything else.  By how the quality of the gaming experience has been diminished  by all these developers putting out something that's kind of stupid.  Well, you look at numbers like this and you think,  OK, well, Nintendo has to at least admit that whether they think it's crap or not,  it's eating into their market.

So what I've been saying for years is, OK, they've got the biggest and arguably one of the best game  publishing houses in the world.  I mean, they build their entire hardware business around their franchises.  Just go make software.  If the gaming experience is so crap on phones, go put Mario Kart on some phones.

Transcript:  There you go, Tom Mera. Thank you.  TNT is on Twitter every Monday through Friday, 2.30 Pacific, 5.30 Eastern.  That would be 21.30 UTC at live.twit.tv.  It's a really good show. You guys should watch it.  I think somebody named Sierra Lane might appear on that show along with IAS Act.  So Twitter, I didn't know this because I had been using Google Plus,  has started injecting paid tweets into the stream.  That was the thing everybody said that will be the end of Twitter when they do it.

Start time: 5530.10
End time: 5539.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they're injecting tweets into the stream if you follow a brand.  Oh, so you have to follow them.  Right.  So if I'm following HP.  Wouldn't I see it anyway? I don't understand.

Start time: 5539.58
End time: 5547.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You would, but now they pin it basically to the top when you load a page for the first time  or if you reload it, you'll see it again.  Well, that's not so bad.  And then it gets pushed down.

Start time: 5547.36
End time: 5553.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  If I don't follow JetBlue in this example, I don't see this even if it's a paid tweet.  That's right.  That's nice because you're kind of opting in in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Okay. This is Twitter.  That's how you do it.  Square in the morning, Twitter in the afternoon.  I don't know if Google Plus is going to put them out of business,  but it seems like they've really been struggling to make a living.

Start time: 5587.46
End time: 5605.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're raising yet more money.  They'll be around for a long time.  But they do need to figure out how to make money.  And this is the most significant step forward yet to do that.  They keep trying these little things.  They have the promoted topics in the trending area.  They have it in the search.

Start time: 5605.22
End time: 5608.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you even going to see these promoted tweets now?  I guess you will.  No, not yet.  Because I didn't notice it either.  They are. It's only on Twitter.com right now.  They will pump it through there.  It may come out in the official client.

Start time: 5617.90

Start time: 5638.36
End time: 5646.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like a fine idea.  It's just, is that aggressive enough for them to actually make a legitimate amount of money?  How much would you pay for that?

Start time: 5647.14
End time: 5652.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At least in the beginning it will be because brands won't know any better.  They'll be like, oh, this sounds like a really great idea.  Here's $50,000 to have my tweet up there for 24 hours.

Start time: 5654.62
End time: 5664.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say they're measuring engagement though in an interesting way because they do more  than just click throughs.  It's also the number of retweets and the number of times it's favorited,  which is kind of an interesting metric.

Transcript:  I think the funny thing on Twitter is people will follow you on Twitter unless you start  posting things.  And then as soon as you start using Twitter, people get irate.  It's happened to me.  It just happened to President Obama.  So he posted because of course we've got this thing, the debt ceiling deadlock,  which could be pretty bad.  On Friday afternoon, he has 9 million followers.  He told them to tweet your congressman, your Republican congressman,  to promote a bipartisan solution to the deficit crisis.  And then he began tweeting out the Twitter handles of Republican congressmen state by state.  In one day, he lost 37,000 followers because nobody wants that.  That's noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way.  I think that whole thing is kind of silly though, like 37,000.  It's not a lot.  I mean, that's like, you can lose that on just any given day when Twitter shuts down  spam accounts.  That's like a third of a percent.  I just did the math on that.  It's a very, I don't know.  I would expect to lose more than that if I were doing something like that on my Twitter account.  You would, and you don't have 9 million followers.

Transcript:  I can't stop without mentioning this because we gave Apple such a hard time  over the location database.  Apple's iPhone was collecting information so they could build a skyhook-like service.  Same thing Google was doing.  Turns out Microsoft also has been doing the same thing in the Windows Phone 7,  gathering data from Wi-Fi connections along with the GPS information to create a database  so that you can use Wi-Fi instead of GPS.  But this is kind of funny.  Microsoft left the database open to everybody.  So apparently if you want to know where you've been or your boyfriend's been  or your husband's been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I think there's some aspects that are about this are different.  If I read it correctly it was that it only works if your phone was put into Wi-Fi hotspot mode  and then I guess only if they scanned it in their location database.  Declan McCullough was the guy who discovered this.  So it's definitely not the same.  It's not like you have a minute by minute, day by day tracking of where everyone is going.  It's just points in time under specific circumstances.  It's not good but it could be a lot worse.
