Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I oh well Google I oh was kind of the it should have been the biggest news of the week and it wasn't and  It really kind of I think a lot of let a lot of people down  There's actually a lot of significant stuff. It just they didn't really explain why the stuff mattered that good

Start time: 297.50
End time: 301.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 311.50
End time: 333.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'm in you know in Google's defense. That's a good point  I mean, you know you making if you're making big strides in artificial intelligence  Well that just kind of slips away if that's one of the things Sundar Pichai said  He says we're moving from a mobile first world by the way. I'm just catching up with mobile first. Yeah  We're moving from a mobile first world to a

Start time: 335.80
End time: 344.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  AI first world and that's kind of that's kind of interesting and well that was kind of the sell last year for Google I oh  I thought they said the same thing. Yeah, you're right

Start time: 344.34
End time: 344.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah

Start time: 344.82
End time: 384.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know one of the things that sticks out to me is if you look at the complaints before Sundar took over as CEO  about a year ago now a  lot of it was that you go to Google I oh and you see all these like  Really fun gee whiz kind of ideas that aren't necessarily fully realized that are costing a lot of money  Sundar came in CEO and kind of focused the company got rid of a lot of that sort of thing and  This is really what the company's focused on and so this is iterative stuff versus last year in this AI first idea  And they're and it's good progress like the cloud TPU  Set up these is basically these computer chips that will help their machine learning system the tensor  processing units

Start time: 388.62
End time: 399.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fascinating so these are these are inexpensive almost they look like almost like raspberry pies they got four  Processors on them big heavy-duty GPU stuff. This is no raspberry Pi 180

Start time: 400.22
End time: 409.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Teraflops yeah, and so this could give them an advantage in their cloud services versus Amazon  This could give them an advantage in building out their AI. They're also making available to third parties

Start time: 412.50
End time: 441.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Software so they've already open source tensor flow the software and these are hardware devices designed to run  Yeah, tensor flow at speed and if you you know, you're impressed with 180 teraflops  That's really not the point because the idea is they massively  Paralyzed parallelize them. Yeah, and these these racks are  multi petaflops  Per this is 11.5 petaflops of machine learning in this rack

Start time: 442.28
End time: 478.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so what I think the missing piece really was soon to our somebody else from Google saying hey  This is what the this is the here are the cool things will be able to build with this technology  Here's the stuff that you developers should come and help us build together regular people watching this consumers and enthusiasts  Here's what the future is gonna look like and and here's the vision right so  it's soon to ours Google doesn't do as good of a job at illustrating that vision in these keynotes as  As as you know, let's face it tech journalists would want rather have Sergey Brin

Start time: 478.98
End time: 484.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Parachuting in with Google goggles on even though that was a better show. It's a better show

Start time: 484.32
End time: 499.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's a meaningless exactly. Well, not even equally more so much more meaningless. Yeah, genuinely meaningless  Yeah, so it's it's it's less exciting, but this is probably one of the most significant things Google's now  I think I think that's really right. It's enabling right it

Start time: 501.58
End time: 524.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you're gonna get the name of that guy we talked about on the show for like an hour once was a Swiss or an  Austrian AI genius  I can't remember his name was a great name  Yeah, you're getting somebody but but he talked about how the theory is so far ahead of the practice because of exactly what you just said  Nate is that is that the power to do what they want to do isn't there?  So their theory is way ahead and this oh you're gonna show you're talking about you're gonna

Start time: 525.30
End time: 528.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

End time: 540.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, I can't tell if this is like he has an updated website since like 1996 or if it's like an ironic  Look this way like and kind of like a hipster Oh click on what's new? Yeah, what's new 12 May 2017?

Start time: 542.30
End time: 551.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 553.76
End time: 568.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, I mean, you know like here's this opportunity  Sell us on the future like tell us where this is all going and why building this together with you is so much better than  Putting your energies as a developer or maybe  consumer

Start time: 569.88
End time: 571.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Smartest thing would for them just to shut up

Start time: 573.00
End time: 615.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But see that this is this is what Google doesn't do Google doesn't shut up. They've apple shut up exactly  Google builds their products in front of you. Sometimes they fail  But they always are basically you get to see how the sausage is made apple  They they keep it secret and then when they have a fully realized product  Usually unless it's like a beta like Siri or Apple Maps, then they'll bring it out to you  This is actually something that mark and I have been talking about recently just just as friends but also on our buzzkill podcast  But it's like this is this is a difference between those  My plug buzzer. Yeah Facebook also, you know with their f8 developers conference  They're they're further behind on all this tech, but they showed some like, you know  Yeah camera apps and it got people excited

Start time: 615.20
End time: 623.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I kind of respect a company like Google where they're not gonna do the flash  They're just gonna do the and remember it's a developers conference and they're not gonna press

Start time: 623.96
End time: 631.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's a developers conference  But these keynotes have been so filled with consumer news that the expectation these days is that you're gonna have something flashy

Start time: 631.20
End time: 671.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was a little disappointed. We didn't see anything about Chromebook. We didn't see anything about a lot of consumer products  They didn't mention the pixel phones. They didn't mention they did mention Google Home and the assistant and the assistant now is on the iPhone  Which is really a stealth introduction to assistant to get iPhone users to understand, you know that Siri you've got that's crap  This is what a real assistant can do  I think hoping to woo some people over to Android but at least to get them to buy the Google Home  the other thing that  Maybe it's just me. I keep mentioning this everybody's kind of ho-hum. I think the fact that you can make free  Calls to the any phone in the US and Canada on your Google Home is kind of impressive

Start time: 672.36
End time: 683.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that amazes people our age. Maybe it's because we're old. Yeah. Yeah as we're saying we're there, you know, we're old enough  Fellow panelists were old enough that our parents would yell at us to get off the phone. Yeah, cuz it's long distance

Start time: 684.04
End time: 685.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's costing a lot of money

Start time: 685.94
End time: 688.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right see to me. That's not impressive at all. Is your cell phone does that? Yeah

Start time: 688.96
End time: 690.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have unlimited minutes exactly

Start time: 692.50
End time: 693.70

Start time: 693.94
End time: 705.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody wants to talk on the phone  Yeah  if I have to go to my phone to set up my speaker my speaker should know that my phone exists and it should be able to  Basically be a speaker phone like that doesn't seem I just you Millennials don't

Start time: 707.34
End time: 762.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can only call other echoes. Yeah this so in a couple of ways they scooped  I thought they sort of  You know scooped Amazon's big announcements the last few weeks because that was one announcement is free echo to echo calling big deal  Yeah, and they also have by the way some privacy issues because there's no way to block calls  So the fact that anybody who figures out how to get a hold of you on your echo can bug the hell out of you in  Your house. Yeah, no problem  But then remember Amazon has announced but not yet shipped this home the show what do they call it the show?  Yeah, the show has a screen on it. It's really just a tablet with an echo built into it  But Google says well we didn't do that because you got screens all over the house  So how about if you just can cast your calendar or your area to your TV or any others?  You know cast ready screen in your house  And of course most people have cast ready screens all over the place now, yeah, so I thought that was that was impressive

Start time: 762.94
End time: 796.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does make me wonder though if this is something that Megan Moroney brought up actually  And we were talking about earlier is is whether or not this puts pressure on Amazon to come out with a phone again  Because even so, you know Google has its apps on the iPhone and they of course have Android  but basically if you're using an iOS device or an Android device they have a presence on your phone and  The reason why this might be a little bit of a jump ahead for them in this in the smart speaker phone calling thing  Is because they they have access to your phone in ways that Amazon doesn't yet

Start time: 796.78
End time: 881.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and that's the other thing Google has to kind of think about is the creepy line, right Jeff?  I mean every time they announce something  There are gonna be a group of people privacy advocates say oh hell no  Yeah, I put it in Europe. Yeah, right  The Google lens is kind of funny they announced  This is an AI capability that reminds you a lot of Google goggles  Which and Amazon's fire phone seven years ago, right?  But I asked somebody at Google who was involved in integrating this into  Search and photos she said well, but this is AI, you know goggles was kind of pre-populated. We had to teach it  This is this is learning all the time. So for instance, I love this they took take a picture of a flower  This happens to me all the time. What is that flower and it will actually say oh, that's a milk and wine Lily  And it will even give you nearby florists. You can order it and buy it  That is cool. That's a business proposition for Google  But I think that's cool  If you have barcodes on the back of your router it will automatically configure, you know  Connect to it by just taking a picture of it  It'll can read it and my favorite one was they showed you know you using your phone and I'm not sure what app this is  Maybe it's just the camera app because that has lens built into it you turn on lens and then you point at different storefronts  And they'll tell you what the star rating is, you know, how much it costs you can make a reservation

Start time: 882.26
End time: 886.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many this is this is a are beyond what what Facebook can do because Google has all that data

Start time: 887.38
End time: 928.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and you know, I know Apple at some point Apple's gonna announce a are  This seems to me exactly what Apple might announce in the fall and I think they've scooped him a little bit  Here's a here's the example of they took a picture of a marquee at one of my favorite clubs in San Francisco  Bimbos 365 Club of the stone foxes are playing May 17th  So the lens is smart enough to know that that's a stone foxes offers you stone foxes music  Offers to add that to your calendar  Which is pretty impressive and shows you where you can buy tickets to that all from taking a picture of the marquee  Those things seem like the kinds of things that would be useful  Over and above a goggles. It's an entirely new

Transcript:  user interface with computer  Typing that they have conversation now they have sight and

Start time: 936.04
End time: 952.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yet you do know that most people will never never even know that exists in the yeah  Well, that's a good question  I mean that's the part of the problem with these keynotes is you don't know until you try it and none of this is available

Start time: 952.58
End time: 1000.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know  Not many other companies have  to just point  This data repository that Google has I mean basically if if if their  Systems are sophisticated enough and can learn quick enough  And maybe some day even teach themselves all the sort of images that people upload when they're at a place and they're tagging them  And they're uploading them to Google Maps or they're reviewing them or they're using them on Google image search  All of that should be feeding dated to say hey, yeah that you know that small diner in in Tucson  It might not be as popular as the you know place in San Francisco  But a couple you know dozen people have been there and here are some photos and like let's put this together  And help this camera recognize it if ever someone is there right so

Start time: 1002.18
End time: 1038.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Test towns on recode argues that this is Google's future  That this is the Google lens is an example of device independent  computing artificial intelligence and  She said and I think she's probably you know I think there's something to be said for this  even though this is nothing new it it tells us something that where Google's going and  That is part of a less device centric and more kind of user centric focus  I like that idea, and I think that that's I mean you still need a device you still need a camera

Start time: 1038.96
End time: 1043.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well I think to a certain extent Google's never cared about what device you use this is a new search

Start time: 1044.52
End time: 1052.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right is this a new so instead of typing in a search you just this is this is a new way of search  And that's Google's core business is search

Start time: 1055.16
End time: 1068.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it pulls pulls out all of Google's data, and it gathers more signals about the world it understands more about the world  It's utilitarian. I mean it's that or sharks swimming around your cereal bowl, which is a more useful

Start time: 1069.70
End time: 1088.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a magic leap demo. Yeah, I agree with you  I I think that maybe this all come into our lives in a more subtle fashion and  yes, it's not exciting when Google does a keynote about all these incremental improvements, but  If you know by the way none of these are available  We don't even know what they're gonna be like whether they'll live up to their promise etc etc etc

Start time: 1088.52
End time: 1103.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well the other thing they showed was going into the Home Depot and getting right to that widget you need finally you chose its hang  So where the tango if you had tango into it so you have this presence about your world that Google can add value to your world  That's a big deal

Start time: 1104.54
End time: 1142.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, tango is always about wave to you tango has always bothered me because it never felt like a very  interesting or  consumer-friendly  technology the first tango devices were big old tablets you know and  And and and now I guess they're gonna start making tango phones that are more normal  I think what they showed an LG phone that had tango enabled. Yeah, well, they still have like multiple cameras  It's a little bulkier than the average own. Yep. Yep. So I was unclear in the demo  They showed kind of two sides of it  They showed the gathering of data part where the computer is learning all these information points  Who does that is the store keeper do that?

Start time: 1143.64
End time: 1155.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Definitely not like they've tried to do these in-store mapping things forever and  They'll get like one or two retail partners  It's willing to go through it and all their stores while the other retailers like we're just trying to stay alive

Start time: 1155.44
End time: 1191.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have and by the way, you can't do it just once you got to do it every week because it's move stuff moves around  And changes right?  So what are they gonna drive a little tango cart around periodically map the store?  Then they showed the consumer facing side, which is kind of neat. It's like Google Maps inside a store  You could say where's the screwdrivers but I think most stores that's why Home Depot as a guy there in a in a in a  You know wearing a tool belt so he could say yeah, it's on aisle three. I  Don't know if that's not working yet. I think maybe it's solving a problem doesn't exist. Yeah tangos  always felt to me like a  technology in search of a

Start time: 1192.92
End time: 1223.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you add it together with that with that that  Data backed AR the image  Google constantly know where you are be able to take you to things  Is aware of your surroundings you can then then that provides the context then you can ask questions about your surroundings  We know which is the best widget  What did other people say about this omelet all those things could start to come out because it is aware of  Context Google is always looking for context so it can anticipate your needs now and it will have more context  Here's here's what I think is gonna happen. I think

Start time: 1224.50
End time: 1308.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We don't really care about what they announced consumers if we don't consumers even less  Yeah, doesn't matter because what is gonna happen almost without anybody noticing it is the assistance gonna get better and better  These technologies are gonna surface just because in the natural course of using your camera  It'll say oh you want to know what that flowers and what we will in a few years will happen is we'll look back and go  Wow, we've really made considerable progress  Look at speech recognition their error rate is now under five percent  It was eight and a half percent better than I do at my age. Yeah  Well, they in fact said that it's better than humans  So they said that about the image recognition. Oh image recognition is but I don't know how that could be but they I don't understand that at all  Yeah, so in a way, that's why I think Google should shut up  That there because by announcing this it's like, okay five percent  Nice there's not it's not inspiring or exciting  or even but if they just shut up and let it get better and better and better and  And put it on Apple, you know, give them a Google assistant now starts people Apple users starts to you know  This assistant really, you know, it does a pretty good job that  Gradually people start putting homes in their houses. I  Think that gradual is almost the best way to  Surprise people surprise me  Maybe you have less problems of scaring regulators, but oh my god, they're taking over the world. That's the big risk

Start time: 1310.50
End time: 1313.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then and that's that's a genuine concern because if if Google's approach is gonna work here, it's gonna rely on people

Start time: 1319.62
End time: 1359.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uploading and sharing basically all their photos essentially every time you use Google Lens  You're sending that photo that imagery that video whatever to Google and  That will leave a trail and you know  That is a repository of all of the things you've been looking at through your phone being sent to Google now  It'll help off that context in a store, but it also like you know bad. Do you think or you think that's a good thing?  It's a privacy trade-off and I think it's a question that we all need to ask ourselves  And I think that's a good thing  It's a privacy trade-off and I think it's a question that we all need to ask ourselves  But it you know, it could it could be a bad thing, right?

Start time: 1361.02
End time: 1369.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There is a risk of course that that because Apple does such a better job marketing that everybody else  I think people assume serious better than it is serious terrible

Start time: 1370.44
End time: 1375.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't you think I think people assume the opposite it is terrible. We all don't you swear in it?

Start time: 1375.96
End time: 1392.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're all pretty bad like being real about it. They're all very bad right now  But that I think that's because the pop culture idea of what AI should be. They're not Hal 9000  Exactly, they're not the Star Trek computer yet. They're not Hal 9000 whatever  But you know, I think they're where they're supposed to be at this point

Start time: 3574.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Well, there's always been you know, that sort of thing out there. These aren't new problems  They may might be amplified because more people are participating than ever before  But upending old power structures  You know of a select few people who had control of all the media  I think that's actually a good thing now the problem for our industry is that we can't make as much money off as we used to  Hopefully eventually new business models will be found but the the central idea that the internet has made the world the worst place  Off the bat. I disagree with it

Probably necessarily breeds trolls and bad behavior. So I agree with absolutely everything you said  But there's a price that comes with it if we're gonna be truly open  Yeah, and even if you're a closed network, even if you're Facebook  To be big what they feel they must tolerate alone with speech and I love free speech a  lot of it's really obnoxious and really horrible and and you know abuse of animals and abuse even of children as long as it's not  Celebratory they leave it there to be aware and we had live in an ugly world  And so that's part of the world and and so yeah, I don't know  That's why I'm thinking that maybe what ev really wants to do is to create a happy place

Stealing fire from selfish gatekeeper gods and bestowing it on mere mortals  All right, so the ability to have a voice. Yeah  quote what we tend to forget is  Zeus was so pissed at Prometheus.

It's an interesting thing because wanna cry  Is just another kind of ransomware  Yeah, it spread rapidly because it was able to take advantage of a exploit in windows smb. There's there  Samba messaging which is I call it samba. There's  Something message block a camera single message block their networking technology that allowed it to spread as a worm throughout the entire land  So if you got it on a laptop brought it into work the whole place would go down  unless  They were running windows 10 or they had patched windows 7  We're seeing now that almost 98 percent of the infections are windows 7 very few xp people got bit because there aren't very many xp  machines attached to the internet  and  Microsoft had patched in march  But a lot of businesses don't update their patches and now here's the kind of the double twist  Microsoft was really angry at the nsa  Saying it's your fault if you hadn't found this exploit if you just told us  If you just told us we wouldn't have had this problem  uh, the only reason they patched it is because  the nsa got hacked or  leaked and the shadow brokers published gigabytes of data about nsa exploits one of which was this smb exploit but now  There's a guy who's created a fix for wanna cry if you haven't rebooted  There is a fix for wanna cry  That is it's kind of microsoft. Give it to microsoft. Take it away another bug in microsoft windows  That so it turns out that the wanna cry guys were  You know, they were uh, efficient they used microsoft's own encryption technology to encrypt the hard drive. It turns out there's a flaw  In microsoft's encryption technology it keeps the two prime numbers the factors  in ram  And so a guy has written a program that goes through ram  Finds that if you haven't rebooted if you reboot it all bets are off  Finds the key and it will unlock your hard drive. I mentioned that  Carefully dan gudin writes about it and and I trust it only works for xp  Yeah  Yeah, it looks like it only works for xp. I'm not sure I think that maybe  Um  I don't know  This might be an older article and there might be more to say about it in any event. I just find it ironic  That it's something poorly written about microsoft's cryptographic application programming interface  api  Keeps those keys in memory, which is of course a stupid thing to do  and but  Maybe uh, you can fix your windows xp. Don't be fooled though. There are a lot of people out there who offer  Uh phony ransomware decryption tools there. There are some cases where they work, but in a lot of cases they don't  Uh eternal blue was the nsa exploit that that wanna cry took advantage of

Transcript:  The kill switch is funny so that's another story this isn't the kill switch but that's another story  Oh, sorry. I you know there is I saw one or two reports that some intelligence officials think that wanna cry

Start time: 5485.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Comes from north korea that it was actually a state-sponsored attack  Which makes sense because they've made very little money right most of these ransomwares don't make a lot of money  And they're not going to be able to do that  Which makes sense because they've made very little money right most of these ransomwares don't make a lot of money  And it was well written it was translated into more than a dozen languages  It had a very helpful link of what is bitcoin and how to buy bitcoin  And it had a kill switch, which is not something, you know, the typical macedonian hacker  Would build in would build in the kill switch worked that there was a very long obscure url  That didn't exist that wasn't registered as a domain  But wanna cry would go out would check the web to see if this domain existed if it did it would say okay  I've been terminated and would not encrypt your hard drive  So somebody was going through the code. He didn't even know what it would do  He just thought well, I should register this domain name  He created a website there and it stopped wanna cry because wanna cry said oh, there's a website. We've been turned off  then people who wanted to  retroactively use wanna cry probably not north korea, but just random  You know script kiddies a couple of them tried to overwrite they took the wanna cry source code and they'd  Use a hex editor to overwrite the domain name  And then now there's a ddos attack against the domain hoping that that will react  It's just it's uh, what a world I blame I blame ev williams and twitter  Thanks ev. Yeah, the new york times said actually the clues point to  North korea partly because some of the code is very similar to the code used  In the sony exploit which intelligence officials also believe  Came from north korea  Also a bangladesh bank attack last year in polish banks in february  American officials said they'd seen the same similarities. I don't know. I mean

It's mine. I got it wordpress.com  slash twit in fact i'm looking at my tweets  And here's the story right there from buzzfeed teresa may  Wants to irregular the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but  What it really means is that the tories who uh, you know, teresa may wrote the snoopers charter  She sponsored it when she was a member of parliament got it forced through when she became pm  M  and now it looks like the conservatives  If they win the election and the polls say that may will win a majority in next month's election probably they will have a mandate  to significantly extend internet regulation  All based on the idea i'm quoting buzzfeed that it's a government's duty to protect citizens  Just as much on the internet as it does in the real world  The proposals which apparently are all over the manifest  a manifesto  Involve all kinds of things legislation would be introduced for instance to protect the public from abuse  and offensive material online  Everyone would have a right to be forgotten the right to white material that was posted when they were under 18  Internet companies would be asked to help promote counter-extremism narratives  News  I don't know. I don't know what that means at all, but that's scary  There'd be new rules requiring companies to make it ever harder for people to access pornography and violent images  Content creators would have to justify their policies  To the government and by the way, even if labor won  It ain't so very different  So this is my fear when we talk about fake news and we talk about  You know how the democratization of the that the internet has brought us has brought a lot of negative voices to the four  I really worry when we say let's control them that this is the end result of it

Transcript:  I I agree and if you look at the the guardian is not helping things the guardian had a story  I think we might have mentioned briefly before that  that goes into the  Instructions for people who monitor  complaints on facebook and  And it's not frightening about facebook. It's afraid about mankind  What what we do and what we do in public and and so you put this kind of stuff out there and  The reflex is surely shut this down package this edit the world  But I don't want anybody to edit the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think there should be a distinction too between facebook versus, you know the uk's government facebook is a closed social network  It's a business. It's a place where you share things and they put ads next to those things and then they make money off of that, right?  What the uk's talking about is  Kind of taking a censorship approach  To the internet as a whole as it exists in its country and that's those are two totally different things. I mean now  for many people  Facebook is where they get most of their news and they communicate with friends and families  So in some senses for those specific folks  It might be their internet because that's the only part of the internet they're hanging out on  But it's not the internet right it is a business it is a is a closed space  You need a you need a password to get in and all that stuff. It's not public  versus the stuff that uh  The uk is talking about um, and like as you mentioned between the tories or the labor party  There's not much difference in the way that they're trying to approach  that  uh regulation which  In this instance amounts to censorship

Start time: 6281.64
End time: 6291.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to be a really interesting time in the uk because they had essentially ceded all of internet regulation to the eu  When they were part of it now that they're breaking they get to interesting

Transcript:  Right and and in the discussions around internet regulation when when britain was a part and they're still a part of the eu  but in those contexts  The uk would usually be more on the side of leniency like where the u.s was and germany would be on the far other end  um, so it's now we'll see  Has has the uk shifted a little bit are they swinging are they are they disassociating from like the u.s mentality?  And what will the u.s do now that donald trump seems to be a little more eager toward?

Start time: 6328.30

Transcript:  Toward regulation well even if we don't hear in the u.s  When a country like england a big big country like england does this it affects every company that works in oh, yeah, definitely  I mean, I guess google could change its search results in england and not here  They do that with the right to be forgotten in the eu, right?

Start time: 6347.42
End time: 6429.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. Yep. Yeah, but it's such a precedence. I think i think mark's really right it it it it uh,  Then it's a chase down  And part of the problem here is that we're concentrating constant. This is back to the end point  We're constantly concentrating on the bad  We're trying to play whack-a-mole with the bad. We're never going to get rid of 8chan and 4chan and the bad parts of reddit  um  So they're going to find a place to go  And if that's all we concentrate on  Then we got a problem. Whereas if we if we find ways to support the good and there's lots and lots of good as nate said earlier  then that's what we have to put our energy behind and  And part of the problem is that the manipulation works so well  That you do the bad stuff  The reports the historical also has a report coming out monday that the we help fund at nii the thing i'm running now  um news integrity initiative  and uh, you know, it's fascinating to see how quickly things rise from 8chan and 4chan up to bright bart up to the world  and media is still set up at a point where they  Swallow it and they give it promotion and that's the goal  And so that's the vision of the world that we see is a very tiny small number of people who do crappy stuff  Get huge  Amplification in media. So it's it's not the fault of the internet. It's as much as the media as anybody else  Yeah, and that's what we have to fix

Transcript:  If you look at these rules at facebook's  Was this leaked to the guardian? Yeah, it was leaked. Yeah. Yeah  Uh for well in the slide deck and I guess this is used for training. They call it the facebook files  Uh, it's it says that moderators often have just 10 seconds to make a decision  There's so much content that they have to review one document says facebook reviews more than six and a half million reports a week  on fake accounts alone  fake accounts alone  Uh, I would hate to be this would be a tough job and you'd have to work very quickly  And if you read the rules  You know, it's not immediately obvious  uh, no  For instance videos of violent death while marked as disturbing do not always have to be deleted  Because they can help create awareness of issues such as mental illness
