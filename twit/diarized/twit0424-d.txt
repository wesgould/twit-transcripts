Transcript:  Glass that's you know I like it it's nice not to have a scratched up face  although you know my iPhone 5 is pretty darn scratched up I guess we should  probably start the show talking about who of us has ordered their new 5s 5c  anything I'll start I ordered a 5s on I was well I stayed up late Thursday night  a 1201 Pacific time Friday morning which is basically Thursday night the Apple  Store is supposed to open up and allow me to buy of the 5s took till about 1204  I refreshed 400 times in those three minutes then I get through all the whole  thing I said 64 gigs I want the gold I'm on Verizon we're all good yep our data  plan is I'm like wait a second I have an unlimited data plan and I don't have  that option what what the heck I go to Twitter and I say what's what am I  missing am I just tired what's happening and everyone says I can't do that anymore  that's the end of that and I thought well that's ridiculous I mean what are  you telling me I'm not gonna get a new phone because I can't keep my limited  plan here's what you do you go to Verizon calm you log in you basically  go through the exact same process and then Verizon will try to trick you into  saying oh yes I'd like the 10 gigabyte per month for like 80 bucks or something  some stupid you know ridiculous so I'll pay 175 bucks a month type of a thing  where it's like what I pay $85 for unlimited data right now and then you  know you say a bunch of no's and yeses and finally it'll say all right you want  your unlimited plan fine all right do that but you have no option to do that  if you're a Verizon customer through Apple com store so by the time I figured  that out the freaking 5s gold 64 gig was like delayed two weeks happened really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you really want that did you did you ever really want this phone at all or would any of you guys who bought this thing if you weren't in this industry and it was incumbent upon you for your jobs would you have upgraded this phone that's a good question I mean it's impossible for me to know because I do need this for my job and Leo's paying me that $900 back but I bought every single iPhone I bought on release day until this this cycle this will be the very first time that I don't

Start time: 480.82
End time: 524.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  upgrade day one it may not upgrade at all and I'm really surprised I was trying to figure out why and it hit me that that every single iPhone up until this has had a major new aspect to it that I was really excited about in a for example what you know going to for you at the retina display which was huge for us it was fast fast enough to add Siri going to the five of course you got the bigger display and true 16 by 9 and then but then this it's like it's it's this vague promises of faster and slightly better  photography like I can't I can't point to anything that I'm that I'm jazzed about and especially like whatever excitement I had kind of got killed when I was seven came out and all of a sudden my phone felt shiny and new and so I can't believe it but this is the first time I'm going to sit one out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was lucky enough to have a loaner device from Apple here so I actually didn't need to pure so I have one here which is which is great so I think probably the biggest thing to get excited about here is the fingerprint scanner which for a lot of people really isn't anything to get that excited about I use a pin on my phone and it's very very very annoying to type that every time I turn the thing on it's also very annoying to type in your password whenever you buy anything through iTunes so not having to do those things is definitely a nice nice you know step forward yeah I think the performance improvements that we're looking to see in the new  the new CPU we won't really see until a little bit down the road when developers kind of get their head around the thing you know no bigger storage gold is nice but there aren't really that many people who are going to go out and buy a new phone just to get gold there's definitely a bit of malaise in the market right now I do think it is a nice step forward but but I can definitely see why why some people are kind of sitting this one out as it were but you know you keep hearing that and then gold is totally hard to come by so either

Start time: 583.00
End time: 599.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple deliberately kept it in short supply at stores to make it seem like it was selling like hotcakes which of course is a tactic that's done by lots of companies or really everyone underestimated how much everybody wanted to say I clearly have a new phone because it's champagne killers

Start time: 599.98
End time: 629.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people want to get it and that's the only reason in fact did you guys watch there was this video that some kind of like short documentary some guy made about the folks standing in line at the New York show and these are the real fanboys the guys that are standing in line for two weeks to get this gold phone and nobody was in line for two weeks oh yeah they were okay no the first guy on there yeah he said I you know one guy professional one guy standards two weeks you know they sell off their spot yeah exactly

Start time: 629.80
End time: 689.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  anyway the first thing these filmmakers ask these guys they held up a sign they said why not one of them could give a cogent answer as to why they were standing in line not just standing in line but upgrading this phone but you know what I don't know that there's something about there's something about the culture of standing in line for something being excited with everyone out I mean getting the first iPhone and standing in line was one of the most fun exciting experiences I've had and you and you do in this into this kind of like group think mentality and get excited  about it so it's like I don't want to harp on them for that but but I do think it's interesting like every single time they've done an upgrade and done a release they've they've released pre-order information I think all the way since the 3gs this is the first time that they haven't announced how many pre-orders that they took for the for the 5c did you guys did you guys hear about that yeah yeah yeah because go ahead Tim I think I think it's great that they finally are going to stop doing this because ultimately you know they're setting the bar for themselves higher each time at some point they weren't going to get over that bar and ultimately you

Start time: 689.70
End time: 739.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  know that's investors you know seem to be taking any opportunity that they can to knock Apple and of course not beating your own numbers from before is one good way to do it but of course this time they had two new phones that are launching so in a lot of ways they're kind of splitting their excitement across these two devices so you can almost expect those numbers to go down but you know we don't see numbers from Microsoft we don't see numbers from Amazon so I think it makes sense for Apple to kind of step away from this and I would be surprised if we see them stepping back into it again going forward but I wanted to talk about the the the line waiter thing you know that guy stood  in line for a long time to be first at the New York line he wanted a gold iPhone he showed up front and they said they don't have any gold iPhones at the store he was the number one in line and was told that they didn't have any gold iPhones they didn't tell him that two weeks before he got in line just said no this is all for not.

Transcript:  Yeah we don't even have what you're waiting here for.  Yeah it's just sort of a cruel joke.

Start time: 745.06
End time: 768.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know that definitely points to the sort of shortages that Apple had for their gold phones there's speculation maybe they shipped a lot of them overseas where the expectation is that gold will be a lot more popular than here in the US certainly they didn't have a lot of gold to go around and I was there at the New York store that morning and it was pretty crazy I think it's the most people they've had waiting in line in the history of iPhone launches so you know that's definitely a good sign for Apple anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do we think that we're going to hear a here are the combined sales between the 5C and then the opening weekend for the 5S come tomorrow morning because historically Apple releases something like this in a press release Monday after the iPhone to say best selling iPhone yet again like you mentioned Brian we never got that for the 5C but around this time last year when we got the iPad fourth gen and then the iPad mini Apple did the same thing where they didn't really tell us how well they  mini specifically did but they said combined our new iPad lineup has these really really impressive numbers this way even if the 5C was a joke which I'm sure it's sold perfectly fine but it seems like the 5S is going to have some really strong numbers combined it's going to look great.

Start time: 816.92
End time: 905.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well first of all yes I do I could totally see them do that but but I'd love to pick Tim's brain on this is to me I don't understand why they decided to go with this 5C I mean I guess I understand why why didn't they just keep the original five available if that's what they wanted to do or keep previous generations available but instead what they did was they positioned it as a cheaper version of it and and it looks cheap and they even they even there what do they say unapologetically plastic.  I understand the desire to do this whenever a brand establishes dominance as a as a high end brand for example we'll say Cadillac Cadillac for you know for almost 100 years was synonymous with what you have to be rich in order to buy a Cadillac and then at some point you you top out on your market and you start to get really tempted to cash in your brand to to cheaper levels and so they started making cheap Cadillacs to where now it's like Cadillac doesn't mean anything because anyone can afford a Cadillac and all of a sudden they're not special anymore  in this case it seems like the 5C is lose lose it's not significantly better than the 5 it looks different from it and it's it's it's it looks like a play school toy and and it's allegedly cheap but it's not even that cheap because when you buy it subsidizes $99 in which case you end up spending almost $1,000 for it anyway it's as though they they they did nothing but cash in their brand value they reduced the image of the iPhone and it looks to me like they got nothing out of it except for a short-term payday

Start time: 905.82
End time: 1084.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm kind of pissed about it keep in mind that Apple never said this was a cheap phone in fact Apple's been very pointedly saying that we never tried to make a cheap phone now this is just a different iPhone so the whole idea of a cheap iPhone was something that that ultimately was created by the media something that we were all expecting to see and something that Apple ultimately didn't deliver whether that's good or bad you know some people are are optimistic about the phone some people you're obviously a little bit more pessimistic about it and I can totally understand that I mean as far as I'm concerned that this is definitely just a margins game the the iPhone 5 in its original configuration was now  that cheap device to manufacturers a very complicated chip chassis with you know custom pieces of glass had to be slotted in to fit in the back in the chamfered edges and all that stuff I mean it looks really nice but if you're talking about trying to get your margins up that's a very difficult thing to do molding a piece of polycarbonate drilling some holes in the bottom is a much easier thing to do if you're wanting to you know simplify the manufacturing process in theory this is a device that they could get cheaper down the road if they want to and maybe that's the way that they want to go but it's also a good way for them to differentiate last year's model which is ultimately what the 5c  is from this year's model even further you know at at I think that adding gold helps out in that regard but it's even better to basically discontinue the old one to make it look radically different and that could be appointed to them going forward  and having very different looking models each year some people were a bit disappointed by the S evolution phones looking exactly like the non S versions and people of course always want to show off they had the latest and greatest device and if your phone looks exactly like last year's phone then that's not a good way to do that so perhaps this is a pointer to Apple moving forward having more  drastic revisions each year and they basically kind of pushed the the five out of the market to kind of jump start that trend going forward there's a lot of different reasons that they could go for it I think ultimately you should you know check out the five see it does feel nicer than you might think it does despite being plastic but ultimately it is a cheaper looking at a cheaper feeling phone than the five it's just doesn't quite have that level of engineering in it and so that's why you have to look back at the margins I think ultimately that's probably why they're doing it it looks like a Lumia doesn't it yeah it does  yeah it looks like it looks like a cheap windows phone well okay so I guess that's not very nice no I think the Lumia phones feel very nice for being polycarbonate and I think that the 5c feels very nice for being polycarbonate too I did kind of chuckle a bit at the unapologetically plastic line from Johnny I that was a bit silly in my eye but I think it is a nice feeling phone in the hand I'm curious though how it's going to weather I mean we saw of course the black iPhone 5 get scratched up really easily polycarbonate of course is a well-earned reputation for being  easy to scratch this is a clear-coated device so maybe that'll add some durability but I'm curious what this is gonna look like after a couple of months of being thrown in your pocket with your keys is it gonna kind of get a nice patina to it or is it just gonna look scratched up and cheap and ugly yeah well I mean this this iPhone 5 I've had for you know less than a year and I've never had a case on it and it is extremely scratched up and I don't even it's not like I'm doing anything on purpose it's just in my purse with my keys and maybe some crumbs never in your purse it's constantly

Transcript:  sitting in when I am Sarah Lane's across the dinner to the whole time it's 2013 your eyes that's weird when she's texting yes she does that's a ringtone so so did okay so Tim has it what to the point I was asking earlier is there a single thing that you would show off like if we were at a bar and I was like all right prove to me make me want the 5s well yeah I guess  besides the fingerprint sensor which is just kind of cool because it's new what else is so great about it also they did kind of a clever trick with iOS 7 where they just made it part of the setup they're like and now you have to pick a pin unless you think to do little dismiss thing and so now I've never used a pin for like four and a half years and then now they're there they kind of tricked me into doing it and so now I it's like they created this inconvenience and yes there's added security but now I I could see wanting a fingerprint scanner yeah the police

Start time: 1145.34
End time: 1175.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  departments are trying to get everyone to do just that just what you had to do Brian right because you know it does increase security and it's a huge problem right now here in San Francisco it's a massive problem people getting their phones stolen all the time because they're like Sarah Lane and they're walking down the street and they can't put the phone in the I can outrun them they sneak up from behind they push here they clock it's a legitimate problem the phone and you fall on the sidewalk they grab the phone and run away I mean it happens daily absolutely that's exactly

Start time: 1175.68
End time: 1260.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  how it happens I used to do it what do you think are the standouts yeah Brian's absolutely right beyond fingerprints getting that there's nothing really that that makes you think oh my god I have to have this phone it's a combination of a lot of smaller features that may or may not be appealing to you I mean having dual LED flashes that can adjust color temperature is pretty interesting but ultimately how often do you actually use flash for a smartphone camera photography if anything we've all been trained to never take a picture  with a flash with your phone because ultimately it's just gonna be a terrible picture maybe we can relearn that better photography is nice but again it's not really night and day better than the iPhone 5 in my experience yet and again it's really I think the CPU that has the most potential for greater delivery down the road but of course all the apps that exist now have been written for the older CPU well it's easy to port them up to the new 64-bit chip ultimately there aren't going to be any gains until we see new new development going forward to make use of all the new registers and the increased  pipeline all that other good stuff that it brings along with it so I think that we'll see some great games going forward and a lot of cool stuff but again it's not something that's out there right now unless you're really really hot to play the new  infinity blade game in all its glory then then again it's not really huge strong selling point right now but the fingerprint scanner is legitimately good I mean I use a note 2 and I have a a pin on there and you know it feels archaic now for me to have to type my opinion all the time on that thing versus just scanning my finger

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the iPhone came out presumably they could take this tech and pop it onto a MacBook without too much trouble and you can sign into your laptop with your fingerprint to that to me is also quite exciting and so we can also see some cross pollination that guy I do want to talk a little bit more about what you what you brought up Martin about about safety and the story about New York City but before we do that we should take a moment to thank stamps.com for sponsoring this episode of this week in tech if you're not familiar with stamps.com you probably have a guess as to what  the business model is you buy and you print official US postage using your own computer your own printer it's very convenient who wants to go buy stamps anymore stamps.com will send you a digital scale and will automatically calculate exact postage for any letter you sometimes letters you put a bunch of stuff in there and all of a sudden you need two stamps and then it gets returned and oh who needs it any package any class of mail you never have to waste time going to the post office because sometimes there's something about the post office where it's like people just do not want to  be in a rush there and the way that Murphy's law works is if you're in a rush you will be 10 people back at the post office and you don't want to waste money with with some expensive postage meter type of a thing you just want to use stamps.com and keep it simple for yourself for example if you're a small business you got to you got to send stamps out you want a nice professional look you don't have to hand write addresses onto letters and packages with stamps.com you can print your own barcoded postage return and delivery addresses all  professionally done you don't have to get it sent out and then buy all the stuff in bulk you can do it directly onto the envelope makes everything you do and send out using the postal service look as professional as possible now there's a special offer for anybody who's interested and who likes and watches and listens to twit if you use the promo code TWIT you get a no risk trial plus you get a 110 bonus offer which includes  a digital scale and up to $55 of free postage think about it everything you can do at the post office plus a lot of things you can't do at the post office because think about it post offices have really annoying times you want to go there at seven well they say no stamps.com is never going to close so you can buy postage print it 24 7 you can import addresses from all of your address books across many of your computers you can use cost codes to track postage spending by  specific customers again if you're that small business that really comes in handy automatic address verification stamps.com will even offer postage discounts that the post office never offers you can get discounted package insurance in just one click and then you have to hand write stuff who wants to hand write an envelope anymore go to stamps.com right now before you do anything else click on the microphone at the top of the home page and type in twit again you get that $55 free postage which includes a  digital scale to 110 bonus offer that stamps.com and enter TWIT to take advantage of our special today and thanks to stamps.com for sponsoring this episode of twit so just summarize basically standing in line at the post office is about as ridiculous as standing in line at the apple store don't do it if only I could print out my own iphone at home I'd really be in business with 3d printing how far away are we really  the post office you get what you get a mail to you so you don't have to wait exactly that's that's true hey so you mentioned that it's an issue getting the issue getting gadgets stolen in general but iPhones have a particularly bad reputation because thieves just they don't want to take your identity they want nothing to do with your iPhone they just want the hardware and then they wipe it and then they sell on the black market what's interesting is not only with the fingerprint sensor hopefully unless somebody  steals your hand well that doesn't really work unless it's attached to you but in general it's harder to get in but also there's a new feature so that if your phone gets stolen and you've got find my iPhone turned on if I've got find my iPhone turned on and I leave it here and I look it up from from my MacBook or an iPad later I see that it's here somebody takes it I should be able to track that well in the past a thief turns that off and then you're screwed but now the thief will need  to enter a passcode or some other way to get in and if they don't have that information they still steal your phone but it's much easier to track them down now of course the New York Police Department has sort of started this I don't know I guess a citywide borough wide PSA saying this is why you should update to iOS 7 because this is a great feature that's part of iOS 7 still means someone's gonna have to go after a thief and it shouldn't be you but it does make sense for law enforcement to at least have some more control

Transcript:  over where all these phones are going yeah absolutely it makes sense for law enforcement actually makes sense for people who actually use these things to do this exactly this happens to them well hopefully this will be enough of a deterrent now that you know it'll take a little bit of time but people will stop clocking people in the back of the head so they drop their phone and they can snatch it because it'll be useless to them presumably Tim have you ever had an issue with anybody taking your phone or having to look it up on find my iPhone or is this just

Transcript:  sort of seem like good safety precaution in general I'm happy to say no one has ever hit me over the back of the head and stole my phone I have lost my phone though and so being able to to track it down that's for thing I think it's definitely a great feature and something that everybody should be doing and ultimately it's something that not everybody knows they can do so it is part of the iOS 7 setup now to have these extra security precautions enabled I think it's really nice to the police honestly to be doing these sorts of things and like I said yeah I think hopefully down the road this will sort of change the perception of stealing someone's phone because now it's basically like stealing

Transcript:  a tracking device that will help send the police right to your house potentially and yeah who knows maybe people will stop hitting people over the back of the head well and keep in mind also that you know iPhones have they first of all the same thing that we like about them as a consumer device is a liability it has a very characteristic look and thieves know that they'll have a high resale value immediately but if as a reason like people are saying like our government wants to get in your passwords that's why they want you to upgrade to iOS 7 or whatever no these people are just as lazy  as you are and they would like it make it to make it easier to catch the bad guys but think about it this way it's almost as though they're reminding you to get your shots to get your immunizations because if enough people upgrade iOS 7 and take advantage of the security features all of a sudden the iPhone ceases to be such a tasty treat for the criminals and even if you don't upgrade you might benefit from kind of a herd immunity where all of a sudden the iPhone is just too much trouble theoretically I'm sure that's where they're headed and obviously we're not there now but I I actually applaud  them going for it in fact you know my co-host on NSFW Justin Robert Young was robbed at gunpoint he was actually carrying he was carrying two three hundred dollar Bluetooth speakers in his hands on the phone so he had like what nine or two six  hundred dollars in speakers and in a phone up to his ear guy pulls a gun on him and and in and he's like oh so obviously you want these speakers and the guy said no man just the phone and he's like are you sure they're really nice  speakers he's like no I just want the phone and then ran off with them so again it's like the iPhone has a reputation of being fast and easy to turn around and anything they could do to stop that I think would be a benefit to all consumers

Transcript:  yeah you know Brian that's an interesting analogy you make to the government trying to get you to get immunizations then the government trying to get you to upgrade this phone because people are paranoid about both things I mean sort of for different  reasons but you know yes guy like Alex Jones he's probably gonna be against a lot of both of these things because there is this conspiracy theory out there a lot of people think this that that fingerprint scanner this is a way for the government to get your

Transcript:  fingerprints you no longer have to be arrested for them to harvest your fingerprints yeah does anyone feel this way I mean the chat is bubbling up with people saying like how long till we hear about someone cutting off a finger to use it to deactivate a phone  or whatever it's like I don't think that people are gonna do that if they're but they're stealing a phone for you know the whatever the the $200 they can get for it my guess is there's a big difference between like a you know a petty theft and a you know attempted manslaughter or whatever

Transcript:  apparently to the this has been thought about and for reasons that now are escaping me that blood has to be flowing to the fingerprint or it's not going to work Tim you probably not several limbs to try this out for yourself but one has to assume a club has managed to make a 3d print of a finger from

End time: 1855.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  from fingerprints basically and unlock a phone that way which is pretty a pretty typical way of getting past fingerprint sensors but ultimately you know you think of the level of effort to take someone's fingerprint to capture it and then to have the means to actually do a 3d printing you know already that's the  phrase the barrier of entry of reselling this thing way beyond the point of like Brian's point you know getting your $200 back it's just not worth it at that point so even if that is theoretically possible in no way does that compromise or reduce the value of the security

Transcript:  it but it is it is rather bright and it is rather vibrant and especially if you have kind of a muted or a simple background that doesn't match the colors of the foreground obviously that points and things are going to be even more garish I'm still not a fan of the icons but ultimately you know overall it's still a huge step forward I think it does look a lot more mature and a lot more simple a lot more sophisticated than the last version of iOS for sure but I do wish you had some some color customization options to be able to choose some templates or choose some some colors for menus and colors for backgrounds and folders  and that kind of thing I think that would appease a lot of folks and ultimately it's the kind of thing that you can do in OS 10 and obviously in Windows you can do it too so why not in iOS in terms of usability you think it's an improvement that just looks you're right the icons are a little garish but you know you tap you swipe you swish something fun's bound to happen

Transcript:  who cares what I'm trying how'd you do that yeah see okay no this is this is actually the point I'm about to make is that you have to you have to like aggressively swipe up if you just swipe up nothing will happen you have to be like aggressively swipe up to get that control center  yeah you just got it I think it's like you got to make sure to start it from below where the screen is it's got to touch the edge of the screen is yeah look at that you didn't even know what you had you're just sitting there a gold mine what's all this amazing right yeah you can toggle your Bluetooth all day long now there's a moon and a plane yeah and it took me um even though Apple told me quickly where it was when I was sitting up I was seven  it still took me a better part of an hour to figure out where my spotlight went because I was like swiping to the right doesn't go anywhere now how do I find anything I'm lost oh you swipe down that was not intuitive took me forever I had to look it up I thought I would like the parallax backgrounds but I really don't notice or care about them I know more that it's hard to see I'm surprised at how disappointed I am it well I mean are you disappointed or you just never gonna think about it again what no I just I'm just I wanted to  be blown away yeah but instead the effect was so small and I you know I don't know if that's a saving processor thing or what but it's it's subtler than I had hoped it would be and as a result I don't really dig it I don't really yeah I feel like it's just not at all something that I am impressed by what's weird too is that okay well you've got people who say a little too much swishing and animation going on here in iowa 7 so you go into your settings area if you go into settings I think I think it's a general and then down at accessibility  you've got a new option to is that where it is no not accessibility well I don't know it's in there somewhere you have some sort of an option to turn off some of the motion in iowa 7 I thought that's cool alright let's do that and it doesn't really change anything the only thing it does is turn off the parallax effects which I think is not even the part that bothers people the most what am I doing

I'm not even gonna try that. I didn't actually know that all of a sudden this has turned into some dark comedy but at shutterstock.com you can find the perfect image or video for your next creative project you see we're looking at all these great great images of dogs well you can search something as simple as dogs or let's say you're putting together a new website or or some sort  of advertisement or putting together a video whatever any type of creative project and maybe you need not just a picture of a dog but a picture of a dog that also has some sort of an incorporation of yellow into that because you're gonna make it your banner for your new review site or I don't know what that kind of site would be but you get the idea any type of project you can choose from over 28 million high quality stock photos illustrations vectors and video clips what's cool about it is that not only is there a huge variety  of the kind of images and videos that you'll find on shutterstock but the contributors are professional photographers this is not like some guy who's just mocking up some stuff and hoping to get a few bucks from shutterstock this is really really high quality stuff and what 10,000 images are added every day every day I mean think about how many new images you would have just per week if you had an account there's always something new every time you go flexible pricing at shutterstock so depending on what you're looking for you can you  can do individual image packs or a monthly subscription if that's the kind of deal that you're looking for you can download 25 images per day with a standard subscription so just starting off I mean that's a that's a lot of content to work with and you can download any image in any size and you just paying one price so if there's something that you like you feel like wow I can use this in a few different places you don't have to pay for it over and over again for anybody who may be familiar with how Facebook ads can look pretty unprofessional  shutterstock recently partnered with Facebook they're now providing advertising customers free access to shutterstock images through Facebook's ad creation tool the goal is let's make some of this stuff look more professional if you're the kind of person who's thinking about your own Facebook ads or maybe using them and you think that your traction could be greatly improved and this is going to be what shutterstock is helping you with great resource for local businesses that want professional looking ads now if you're interested in shutterstock.com you don't need a credit card  to try it out you can try shutterstock right now sign up for a free account start using shutterstock to help imagine what your next project could look like start saving some images to a light box to review later when you decide to purchase use the offer code twit nine so that's T.W.I.T. and the number nine a new accounts will receive 25% off any package it's a great deal shutterstock.com and for 25% off new accounts use the offer code twit nine and thanks to shutterstock for their  continued support of this week in tech you know Chad this is probably a good time to to look over the last week of twit the network not with the show because well we just like to confuse people that way it's a show and a network what else has been going on in the twit universe.

Transcript:  Smaller displays that they kind of get rid of a lot of that detail and it just sort of  looks messy.  So when you have something with bevels on under shadows it just makes the image look  muddier when you make it smaller.  So as we smaller displays on phones our logos are getting cleaner.  But of course while it's happening our displays are getting higher resolution which enables  us to have bevels and shadows and things like that too.  So you know probably in two or three years suddenly we'll have a lot of new logos with  a lot of bevels and shadows and probably some blingy effects too just to keep it exciting.  It'll probably be a cyclical thing.

This is actually Google announcing a new company called Calico.  It's going to focus on health and well-being and focus particularly on aging and associated  diseases with aging.  Arthur D. Levinson chairman and former CEO of Genentech chairman of Apple will be a chief  executive officer.  He's also a founding investor in Calico and Larry Page Google CEO had a statement about  it and I mean these Google guys you take them seriously because they really do like to put  a lot of effort into stuff that goes against the idea of you know search and advertising  through money says illness and aging affect all of our families with some longer term  moonshot thinking around health care and biotechnology.  I believe we can improve millions of lives.  Then he he talks apart he says it's impossible to imagine anyone better than art one of the  leading scientists entrepreneurs and CEOs of our generation to take this new venture  forward.

I'm sorry I didn't mean to cut you off but he specifically mentions in there that look  we're not just we're not trying to cure cancer here because cancer doesn't need to be cured  but because if you do cure cancer you live maybe three more years.  We're going for solutions that'll get you 20 40 100 more years.  And in fact I think they even said that like for folks who are younger than 20 years old  they want to see them living 100 extra years through these initiatives.  Yeah I mean it's super ambitious.

Transcript:  It's great.  You're with that cancer.  They are you know he said we think of solving cancer is this huge thing dot dot dot.  I'm cutting to the end here.  It's not as big as of an advance as you might think.  And the thinking of this as well that doesn't make any sense.  I mean of course if you cure cancer that's a huge thing.  A lot of people suffer from cancer.  His point is when people get cancer they usually you know that takes three years off their  life or whatever the average is hopefully a lot.  You know they live a lot longer than that.  But he's talking about making people live for decades longer.

Transcript:  Well and this is and there's a lot to do because you know when people die of old age you know  maybe they die of heart failure but then they open them up and there's like 12 other systems  that are just about to go.  So I mean it's it's ambitious but they're talking about everything from nanobots that  repair DNA to that to what is plenary and flat worms.  That is the is the comparison because plenary and worms are able to repair their own cells.  So let's all be like worms.

I mean that's that's Kurzweil's whole thing right where he talks about in his book the  singularities near that that it doesn't matter how old you are now as long as the technology  outpaces your aging that you'll be OK.  So all you got to do is stay alive long enough to the point where the technology makes it  possible to pretty much live forever which I think is a bit rosy but I'm excited he's  trying and I'm excited that that more advances are coming as a result.

Transcript:  I guess the really big deal is there's going to be a lot more money behind this.  It is hard to get a lot of money behind you know awful diseases or a lot of health care  things. I mean there's just not that much way.  But this this is you know we're talking about some huge people here.  We're talking about some billion multi-billion dollar companies.  Hopefully a huge amount of money will now be put into health care and a company like  Google that just you know it's just so innovative so revolutionary of so many different things  going to revolutionize the way we live.

Transcript:  Well by having that time to Genentech I mean that definitely means you know that that gives  them a lot of good tidings or potential.  Genentech kind of pioneered the idea of biotechnology and they were one of the first to replicate  human DNA in viruses basically which is a very common thing now.  It's the fundamental biotechnology came from Genentech.  So if we get the same kind of results from this new company Calico that Genentech basically  brought to that industry then yeah it could absolutely be huge repercussions.  But ultimately you know Genentech did a lot of that stuff back in the 70s and it's just  sort of coming to fruition now.  So if we see the same pace of innovation we're probably decades away from seeing anything  you know anything truly concrete come out of this.  But ultimately yeah I mean this is a very kind of nebulous issue that they're working  on the idea of stopping or fixing aging as it were.  And Google you know they're willing to throw money at cool things through the Google Ventures  venture and through other ventures as well.  And it's exciting to see what they might say what they might get out of this.  I don't think we'll probably hear anything out of this company though for at least five  years.

The Bump app.  Bump has been around a long time in fact it was one of the very first at the first iPhone  launch it was one of the small handful of apps that were available.  The idea is that you bump phones or devices together obviously that are running the app  and it is actually it would work between a phone and an iPad for example to bump information.  It was a great idea when it first started because we were all like that's so cool it's  like magic.  Now it's kind of like I want to touch somebody else's phone can't you just wirelessly transfer  it without bumping it.  However it is a very cool technology.  There's bump contacts there's you can bump photos images variety of files back and forth.

Transcript:  Leading the witness.  All right.  You know it's true though.  Leo and I talk about every time the bump app comes out with some new cool feature we talk  about it on our iPad today and we both go this is so cool and we never use it.  So I'm not exactly sure what Google gets out of this but yeah there's probably some there's  some NFC tie-in.  I made the prediction last week that it would be kind of there's some sort of like a future  of real time instant messaging that I can sort of see.  I haven't really thought that one through too well yet but yes apparently it's how much  should Google pay for it.  We don't know exactly sure.  Sources say this was not necessarily like a huge huge exit for the folks at bump but  not just an aqua hire as well.  So according to people who are familiar with these matters it's not so much that Google  said oh well this app is crap but there are a lot of smart people let's just hire them.  I can't specify an exact sale price but somewhere to the tune of 35 million.  So in all these billion dollar acquisitions these days I guess 35 million doesn't seem  like a whole lot anymore but again bump has been around for a while.

Transcript:  Should we talk about Brian I'm going to have to lean on you for this because I am just  not world's biggest gamer and I don't know how how how fired up I can get about valve  CEO Gabe Newell saying that Linux is the future of gaming.  But can you just can you start us off here.

Start time: 3912.38
End time: 4013.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well here's here's why is first of all you know in full disclosure I'm a pretty hardcore  PC gamer and if I play an immersive game it's almost never on a console.  It's almost always on the PC.  Steam is the world's largest gaming platform.  If you total up all the steam users there are it's bigger than Xbox bigger than PS3  bigger than any of them.  But it's but it's quiet and it doesn't get a lot of press.  We've talked for a while about creating a steam box of source that's not going to be  an actual console but it's going to be a platform.  They said they will come out with their own but it's going to be a platform that anyone  can make this Linux box that will be a unified experience.  Last year or the year before they rolled out what they called their big picture mode which  is basically the same way to access the games that you already have except for in a console  friendly environment so you can use a game pad to get around specifically at this Linux  event.  He made a big deal about talking about how Linux was the future of gaming for all the  reasons that Linux has always been a popular alternative OS.  And so people are wondering if this next week we're going to see the announcement of the  steam box which would be huge especially because if you know it valves in an announcing mood  I mean I don't know you know Half Life 3 might be fun to hear about if that came along too  but that's not speculated to happen someday.  Yeah sooner or later.  There actually was a leak of some internal memos that had like groups like mail listservs  and Half Life 3 and Left 4 Dead 3 were two of the listserv groups internally allegedly  according to this.  But I mean what do you think Tim?  Have you heard anything?  Did I cover most of it?

Start time: 4014.12
End time: 4058.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah absolutely.  You know there's been you know curiosity about the health of the Windows platform going forward  and so maybe this is Gabe thinking that by moving to Linux they can control the platform  a lot more solidly.  You know it'd be very very interesting to see this box we've been waiting for for so  long to come out and be really great if they could say something about Episode 3 which  we've been also waiting for so long to hear something about.  But yeah absolutely that was great.  I think that that is a fantastic platform for gaming and if Valve gets behind that platform  in a big way then that could be something that developers could start to target a bit  more than we've seen in the past.  It's not that often that a big AAA franchise comes out on Linux as well as Mac and Windows  so if that could be a platform that gets more support and that could help the Steam box  take off in a big big way.

Start time: 4060.02
End time: 4114.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah I think I'm trying to get the exact number.  He said I want to say it was either almost 200 or almost 300 Linux titles currently on  Steam and obviously they're looking to standardize that.  That's part of the reason that...  There you go thank you.  That's part of the reason that consoles do so well is because you can get so much out  of even though your Xbox 360 your PS3 is almost a decade old the hardware in there the fact  that it's standardized makes for a very smooth experience and when people program for it  they're able to make exactly one quality one game experience across all platforms and if  that is one of the things that has kept PC gaming as kind of a high-end boutique experience  because you know you can always keep upping your resolution you could customize it and  then you have problems because they planned on you playing it one way and not on the other  way if they can crack this code and get the PC gaming experience in the living room it  would be pretty huge.

Start time: 4114.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well Brian you mentioned you're a pretty hardcore PC gamer this is obviously something that  you've been used to for a long time when you hear something like this and it points to  inevitable change do you think well yeah there are a lot of limitations to the PC gaming  experience and I welcome this new Linux overlords or are you kind of like I like things the  way that they are and why does this whole thing have to decline and change?

Start time: 4135.38
End time: 4172.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like very much things the way they are but I know that I am not the target demographic  and I know that you know that there's situations that they could get around you know again  PC gaming is also plagued with piracy and it's also plagued with the fact that it's  hard to have a social experience with the family doing playing any of those higher-end  games to be honest as as much as I want success for Valve and as good as I think they are  and as much as they deserve it I think this is an extraordinarily difficult nut to crack  so I'm going to withhold judgment but I'm not very optimistic it just seems like a tough  tough situation for PC gaming to make that leap.

You know when in the 1930s it was it was pulp fiction books with it with their torrid tales  of zombies.  Then in the 40s it's comic books.  Oh they're torrid tales of zombies.  And then you know then Dungeons and Dragons.  Oh with their torrid tales of zombies.  And then now at some point the at some point we become comfortable with the medium we realize  that it's a storytelling medium just like everything else.  And so because the same people were horrified about the violence in Grand Theft Auto.  Of course you know don't mind that the whole city gets trashed and you know Transformers  three or whatever.  So I'm hoping that it's a case that we're all just getting mature.

It took about five years to develop this.  And of course you know the one billion dollars in sales is actual retail and they probably  see about you know 30 percent of that or 20 percent of that actually going back to the  studio something like that.

Transcript:  Thank you.  I'm pretty good at it.  You know how much we like Squarespace right.  This is the all-in-one platform that makes it easy to create a professional website or  online portfolio.  We've loved Squarespace for years.  In fact sometimes I just go to Squarespace and I think all right well my blog is getting  a little long in the tooth and I need a new template and I use Squarespace as my backend  The templates that they have just even if I customized nothing from the templates that  they start you off with they're beautiful and there's so many different kinds of templates  based on is am I going to put together an online portfolio maybe for you know my photography  business.  Well probably not because I'm really bad at that or maybe I want to start some sort of  a I don't know a cooking blog or maybe it's just long stories or don't laugh.  I can cook.  Yeah well you don't.  All right fine.  What's interesting though is that there are just so many different kinds of sites that  you can put together.  In fact we know that many of you have followed our advice and made your own Squarespace blogs  and we actually want to start doing something new.  We want to showcase some of your blogs rather than just telling you because some of you  guys are like I know Squarespace is awesome and you should see my site that I made with  Squarespace.  If you send a tweet with a link to your Squarespace website to the hashtag tweet Squarespace.  So hashtag tweet Squarespace.  We'll take a look at it and we may choose your Squarespace site to mention in a future  episode it's kind of a collaborative effort.  Let's see what you guys are creating.  So we win and you win as well.  Why you'll love Squarespace if you don't already have a Squarespace site is they're constantly  improving their platform.  New features new designs better support all the time.  As I mentioned the designs really are beautiful.  They've won awards.  Webbies from Ford's Forbes Awards.  I mean this is beautiful stuff and it's easy to use.  I've been using Squarespace for years.  Every time I run into an issue they've got 24 7 customer service support.  People are ready and willing.  I found them all very pleasant.  Easy to understand.  They walk me through some issues.  You've got real time stats of everybody who's visiting your site and where they're coming  from. And what's also nice these days is everything is mobile optimized with Squarespace.  In the past I used to have this blog that looked really, really nice if you open it up  on your computer. But if you looked at it on your Android smartphone or something it  was just going to look like a mess and Squarespace.  Anytime you upload any image it creates a bunch of different versions of that image  and says well we want to make sure that this is going to render well no matter how  somebody is accessing your site.  So it's mobile ready.  Code is beautiful.  Search engine optimized and hosting is included.  Squarespace takes control of the hosting so you don't have to worry about oh well I  make my design at Squarespace but then I have to work with a bunch of other companies for  my hosting and my support and oh if my blog goes down that I'm you know I have my hands  are tied. You're going to be fine with Squarespace.  They want to be an all in one solution.  So if you'd like to try it out why not just give it a trial run.  You don't need a credit card.  You can just start building your website.  No strings attached.  If you decide to sign up for a plan on Squarespace make sure to use the offer code TWIT9.  TWIT the number nine.  Nine refers to September.  It's just the way that they track us.  We thank Squarespace for their support of this week in tech.  Again try your new Squarespace site when you sign up use that offer code TWIT9 and you  get 20 percent off.  Squarespace is everything you need to create an exceptional website.  You know I was kind of trying to avoid some just any way you slice it.  This is just pretty bad news for the folks up at Blackberry.  But we've got to get this done.  The folks up at Blackberry.  But we've got to talk about it because Blackberry is laying off 4500 jobs give or take a  few. It is sad.  Everybody I talk to whether or not you felt like the executives at Blackberry over the  last year two or three years were moving in the right direction it's like nobody wanted  this to happen. It's like we were all pulling for the team at Blackberry.  There's a lot of legacy love isn't there.

I mean there are those people out there who absolutely love this thing.  And you know anytime people lose jobs of course that's a tragic thing.  And we'd say to see it happen.  And we always kind of root for the underdog.

Start time: 4704.79
End time: 4742.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Tim I mean do you think that there was really anything that the team at Blackberry could  have done differently.  I mean did they just date the whole thing with.  I remember when the iPhone was introduced and then you started seeing a lot of phones  that were just the next generation of smartphone at the beginning.  There were definitely a lot of people who were like that phone is cool but I need to  have my physical keyboard and there's just a lot of stuff about the security of Blackberry  or I use it with Mike Mike corporate mail and more of enterprise customers.  People were happy with Blackberry for a while but it's the next generation of smartphones  has just eaten into Blackberry's market share so much.

Start time: 4743.02
End time: 4822.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah you have to go back a long time to find where the mistakes were made and they were  made years ago and they weren't really obvious mistakes at the time.  Like you said they're very heavily reliant on that keyboard user base thinking that people  will that people need a keyboard on their phone.  And by the time they started to introduce touch screen dependent devices they were  pretty crummy to begin with.  You know it takes a while to figure out how to do a touch screen device really well.  And we're at the point now where Blackberry is doing that but it took them basically years  to kind of perfect that.  And while they were trying to figure that out and releasing kind of crummy storm devices  and things like that Blackberry was as good as Apple was releasing new iPhones and  Samsung was releasing new Galaxy devices and Blackberry is falling further and further  behind. And then of course with all the delays getting Blackberry tend to the markets and  the cool reception for the Blackberry Playbook which itself was a device that had a lot  of opportunity and could have been this amazing ideal productivity focused tablet because  at the time the iPad was something that a lot of enterprises were trying to use but  were really struggling.  If Blackberry had come out and really positioned that to be the ultimate productivity focused  tablet I think it could have been a success but they try to turn into this kind of lifestyle  gaming sort of tablet thing and it just wasn't really marketed clearly.  It didn't really find any traction at all.  So there were quite a few missteps along the way and ultimately it's going to be tough  to see exactly how Blackberry recovers and continues on in a healthy way.

Transcript:  Blackberry the company said it expects to lose 950 million as much as 995 million in  the fiscal second quarter.  That's a lot.  And announced a change in strategy and struggles ahead selling their Blackberry smartphones  which they were sort of the great hope really at one point was well Blackberry is struggling  but I don't know maybe this maybe these new smartphones are just going to turn the whole  thing around and it sort of played out I think the way Blackberry is going to be.  I think the way many people thought that it would the majority of people Brian you see  Blackberry going private.  Is it just a fire sale at this point.  What's.

Transcript:  I believe they're going to pull a Sega.  You know in the 90s Sega came out with a new console every year and then they finally did  it right with the Dreamcast which was a revolutionary console.  But by then they didn't have the money so they stopped doing hardware altogether and  they just became a software brand.  Blackberry's core value is that it represents security and stability for the enterprise  market and if they can offer to do that in software form with a suite of apps that are  for Android and iOS I could see them going completely virtual and maintaining their brand  value that way.  But that's my guess if I was going to look at it.

Start time: 4896.80
End time: 4934.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's actually turned the other way and stopped making their own software and purely became  a hardware company.  They became the ultimate productivity Android device with a QWERTY keyboard and with some  security measures on top of Android.  I think that could be a very attractive proposition.  We talked about who might want to buy Blackberry and I think it would be a smart acquisition  for Lenovo because Lenovo is trying to make strides in the smartphone business.  This would give them carrier partnerships and lots of other good stuff that they're going  to take years to build on their own.  But Blackberry has already made it's always made great hardware and it'd be kind of a  shame for them to step away from that.  But then again Sega always made great hardware too.  And I was very sad when that news came down.  They were going to stop making consoles.

Start time: 4935.02

Transcript:  I guess the rumor now is that the one of the founders might swoop in and buy the thing.

Start time: 4940.92
End time: 4991.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Michael Azeritis said that he wants to take the company private basically.  And you know if he sold any of his shares when he left the company more or less you  know that presumably he hasn't had money to buy back the company because the valuation  would be so much lower than it was before.  You know it'd be interesting to think what he would do with the company at that point.  Right now I'd say probably the healthiest part of the company is QNX which was kind of  an oddball purchase and kind of a curiosity.  But now you know it's the foundation for probably the majority of infotainment systems  in cars these days and it's a hugely successful part of the part of the business.  The biggest growing part of the business right now anyway.  So that right there could be the fundamental of a very successful business going forward  but it would mean shedding off a lot of weight which includes you know all these employees  who are unfortunately going to get some going to get laid off and probably a big chunk of  the hardware business if not the entire hardware business.

Start time: 5001.26
End time: 5026.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah I've read the specs and it's an interesting proposition for sure.  But you know it's just unfortunately not a platform that really ever got any momentum.  BlackBerry 10 that is.  So I don't think people have been really experiencing BlackBerry 10 either on the Z10  or the Q10 and thinking boy I'd really love this phone if only it were a little bit bigger.  Usually there are a lot of other complaints that come first and so you know it might be a  reasonable success but I don't think that it will really change things unfortunately for  BlackBerry.

Start time: 5027.28
End time: 5054.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah it sounds like sales of BlackBerry 10 devices just just not huge.  Company shipped about 2.7 million BlackBerry 10 handsets in Q1.  So adding a phablet which admittedly some people love that form factor.  It's too I don't know it's too in between for me if I had when I'd get used to it but  a lot of people do love that phablet.  They want a nice big screen but it's sort of still easy to hold in one hand.  Brian too little too late.

Transcript:  Yeah every time you start a new video it has to you have to download it and restream  it over and over and over again.  But it sounds almost like they're describing some kind of like like I don't know syndication  system that would allow you to take television like content and cast it out to everyone's  iPods that they could catch them and hold on to them.  I don't know.  It just seems like there's something to that.

Start time: 5151.46
End time: 5184.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Come on.  For this idea subscribe to the Spotify service for my music and I listen to Spotify offline  probably 80 or 90 percent of the time because I'm on a flight a bunch to all just download  an entire artist's discography discography and listen to it on the flight.  So if I could subscribe to a YouTube channel like the drive channel which is one of my  favorites if I could download all their stuff and have that offline and watch it on the  flight that would be pretty ideal to me.  So I'm actually pretty excited to see how this comes together.  But I hope that they do give the option of downloading everything from a given channel.  If I have to go in and manually flag everything that I need to download that'll be a little  bit more annoying.

Start time: 5184.82
End time: 5213.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah it's kind of cumbersome.  It's it'd be nice for some of this to happen behind the scenes.  But yeah I mean it's easy to sort of say oh yeah YouTube it's little people falling off  skateboards and cute cats and that sort of thing.  But it's like I mean YouTube is everything and obviously the YouTube partners project  that Chad flashed up on the screen it's like there is more and more just really great  content that happens to be on the YouTube platform instead of on Netflix or an NBC.  And go ahead Brian.

Start time: 5213.92
End time: 5255.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I was just going to say I mean essentially I mean this is awesome for me because I use  like I catch her right now for all my podcasts for audio but I don't really have a solution  that I like for video and I'm not going to go out and find an RSS feed for something  like epic rap battles of history or whatever.  But if you could add that functionality to your YouTube app and then all of a sudden  you're just sort of scrolling through what you got while you're offline looking for time  to kill because that's those are the times you want distracting videos the most are when  you're cut off from the outside world and don't have signal.  And so the fact that it would already have them preloaded in a syndication kind of way  subscription based service I think would be phenomenal.  I think it's a big win for content creators.  It takes the YouTube ecosystem and brings them many of the benefits that we've enjoyed  in podcasting for years.

Start time: 5273.28
End time: 5296.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  The tools we just have too many of them right.  I mean I think that just just in the sense that as you mentioned Brian there's these  limitations and there's a there's a video rebuffering or it starts over and you know  if you're cutting it out of signal if you never have to have the conversation with  yourself of oh wait am I in a position where I can't watch a YouTube video right now.  Then that just is a win for the platform because we end up consuming more videos and  hanging out on YouTube.

Start time: 5297.08
End time: 5298.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like a good idea all around.

Start time: 5298.92
End time: 5328.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah absolutely.  You know what else.  I think it's I think it's a great idea.  It's a genius.  Let's talk about Netflix for a second.  Netflix says we figure out what shows will bring to Netflix based on what is popular  on those pirated movie sites.  We want to know what do the people want.  Brian you and Tom talk about this stuff all the time on frame rate.  I mean is this a sort of thing.  I read Hastings and team they're always coming up with these genius ideas to make  Netflix better and this seems so smart.

Start time: 5329.12
End time: 5405.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well here's here's why it's double smart is because number one if it's popular on  on torrent sites then that means of course it's very likely popular not only in you  know to the world but in that region.  That was specifically how they chose I forget which series it was in Finland or  whatever that they noticed that maybe the Sons of Anarchy or something.  But the other thing that's significant is prison break.  When you see prison break that was the one.  Sorry.  When you see something explode on torrents it's often because there's an artificial  black market for it because the net the market isn't being served.  For example HBO has the very frustrating practice of the only way you can get HBO go  is to pay you know your your bazillion dollars to have HBO and cable.  You have to have cable you have to have HBO and all that stuff and you can't buy them  on iTunes the next day the way you can with something like Breaking Bad.  So as a result you know it's huge on torrent sites to have Game of Thrones come out.  Likewise if it means oftentimes there are titles that are in limbo that they haven't  found a home on Hulu Plus or they're not carried on Amazon Instant Prime.  And so again those are also very popular in torrent sites as well.  And so then that's it's a great flag to get Netflix interested in working out to be the  first to get the deal worked out with them.

Start time: 5406.86
End time: 5436.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well exactly it's it's all of a sudden there's this whole well this is this is a big this  is a big show.  This is a big deal.  Prison Break.  Got it.  Got to know about this.  People in the Netherlands are crazy for Prison Break but not everybody necessarily is even  comfortable with some sort of a torrent site.  You know either you feel like like you got to do the right thing and it would be nice  to legitimately pay for this.  All of a sudden Netflix says we know what you want.  Here you go.  I mean you this is a legitimate way to watch content but we know where the people want  to be.  We know where the trends are.

Start time: 5436.48
End time: 5450.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're following the trends.  I'm surprised it's not something they've been doing for a long time.  I don't understand why it's such a huge revelation that you're going to go where the viewers  are.  You know if everyone's over here watching these things well maybe you want to get those  things for your network if that's your business.

Transcript:  I'd like to combine this story with the last story and get offline Netflix.  About two years ago at Engadget we got it was a Lenovo tablet that had an early version  of a Netflix app on it and that app supported offline playback which we weren't supposed  to notice what we did.  So we got very excited because you know here's an app that supports offline playback for  Netflix.  It was a beta though and ultimately it never happened.  It never gained fruition.  This was two years ago.  But I would love to see offline Netflix.  I can't believe that they haven't found out a way to negotiate that with their content  providers because that would be a huge boon for them.

Transcript:  All right Netflix you're doing everything right once again.  This is this next story about a California school district which has hired an outside  firm to basically spy on the kids monitor the kids on their social network activities.  In fact this is a district in Glendale California.  This is a suburb of Los Angeles.  It's a big school district.  Paying a firm about forty thousand dollars to report on about fourteen thousand middle  school and high school students for one year.  Now that's not so much money.  I don't think the money is so much that the story here it's well there's two ways to look  at it is something that a kid is saying on a social network at all pertaining to the  way that the kid is interacting in class or doing well or interacting with her teacher  that sort of thing.  You hear all these stories about there's online bullying.  That's something that could happen in a hallway or could happen online and there are repercussions  of that.

Start time: 5554.08
End time: 5572.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's bad but even worse somebody thinking of hurting themselves.  That too.  I mean if you can catch us which they have done.  They have caught this stuff before it's actually happened and gotten the kid into the proper  therapy and gotten them back on under the happy course.  I mean is that a bad thing.  I mean it is.

Huge privacy concerns.  Brian you've got several kids.  What's your initial reaction on the idea that their school district might be doing the same.

Start time: 5595.52
End time: 5669.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well so what they're doing essentially as an analog I mean I guess you could call it  spying or you could say just watching what the students do.  For example if their students are physically in front of you and you could see them fighting  or bragging about drug abuse or something like that then you know obviously none of  us would hesitate for the counselor to say or do something.  What's tricky about this one is if it were a private school for example a friend of mine  went to the Marine Military Academy in Harlingen Texas and because it was a private school  they were able to say they had a code of ethics and they were able to say if you know of anyone  cheating you are obligated to report it and you know to and if you don't if you know that  somebody cheats and you don't say so then you know you could be kicked out of the school  or whatever and that's all fine because it's a private institution.  They can say things like you will never be caught wearing a red shirt on a Tuesday at  you know such and such place and then they can find out that you wore a red shirt and  kick you out for it.  What's tricky about it is that this is a public school and it's a public funds and now we  have the awkward position of the government funding people to monitor behavior of free  individuals outside of school and to give real academic repercussions as a result of  it and that's the part that makes me uncomfortable and feels icky to me.

Transcript:  I just feel and I don't want to be pessimistic because I agree with you.  There's going to be some situation where the school and the sperm can point to and say  it was all worth it for this this one instance alone but then you've got I mean kids are  just it's like they're one step ahead of the adults anyway and if you monitor your kids  on the social networks they're going to figure out a way to talking code you know or lock  down their profiles or you know some of this seems a little bit like yeah this is again  school trying to sort of make sense of what kids are doing and and then you know then  you kind of get into these gray areas if a teacher knows that a student has been saying  terrible things about them on Facebook is that going to affect the way that they perform  in school and that's you know obviously not what this tool is intended for but it's kind  of it's kind of hard to know how much that might play into it.

Let's take a moment to thank Carbonite our last last but not least sponsor.  Every time I talk about the ads you see Ozzie the dog goes a little goes a little nuts in  the background.  He knows where we get our money from.  Ozzie's got to eat.  All right. So when's the last time that you backed up your files on your computer Martin  Sargent. I know it was like years ago.

Transcript:  So you know a couple of years ago you're not alone though you're not alone.  Most people just don't back up their files on any sort of a regular basis either ever  or as often as they should.  What if you're running a small business.  I mean you are playing with fire if you're not backing up your files to the cloud on  the regular automatically and continually.  That's how carbonite works.  Whenever your computer is connected to the Internet carbonite is working.  You don't have to think about it.  So this is not something that you you have.  You don't have to say well OK I've got carbonite.  No. OK I'll make some time for myself on Friday at four between meetings.  This is all running in the background.  It's great unlimited backup space unlimited.  So not it's it's you'll never run out unlimited backup space for your PC or your Mac is 59  99 per year.  And if you run a small business and many people who watch and listen to Twitch shows do  carbonite has plans that will back up all of your computers.  So it's might just be one computer might be a group of computer or servers external hard  drives for a low flat annual fee.  So that can be a great solution for your business as well with carbonite.  Your files are continually backed up.  They're stored safely off site.  If you have some sort of a computer disaster you just restore your computer and it's like  oh good. All right.

Plus you can access your back to files on any computer or on your smartphone or a tablet  with a free carbonite app.  We've taken that for a while before and that's really nice as well.

Transcript:  Yeah. You got to go wash your hair or something.  Yeah. Tim.  Pinterest is going to start rolling out ads.  We've got CEO Ben Silverman saying we're going to start experimenting with promoting  certain pins.  This is going to be something that's going to be completely transparent for our user  base. You will know when there's an ad is there clearly Pinterest has a huge huge user  base. Is there any active user base.  Yeah. And a lot of the stuff that's pinned and shared on Pinterest will lead you back  to something that is purchasable on an originating site anyway.  I mean is this just like the best the best of two worlds here.  I mean as long as they they do it in a way that doesn't look too terrible or disrupt  the pictures experience.

Start time: 6003.06
End time: 6045.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah exactly. If they do it right it's definitely a great solution.  I mean how many times do you see people creating collections of home decor that they  want to buy or cupcakes that they want to make.  And imagine if you could click on this piece of home decor and say oh you can buy this  at Amazon dot com for nine ninety five or something like that.  I don't think anybody would really feel bad about that.  And ultimately Amazon would love to be there.  The manufacturer would love to be there.  Of course Pinterest would love to capture a percentage of that sale.  It's something that makes a huge amount of sense for all parties involved.  Again if they do it right if they do it in a transparent way which they're saying that  they're going to ultimately you know you can't be surprised.  It's a free service is a very popular one.  They have to make money at some point or the service is going to shut down.  So hopefully they do it right.  But ultimately I think they can.

Transcript:  Shopping for new wheels for my car and I use Pinterest for that.  I would paint a bunch of different wheels for my car and then I actually kind of use  that to decide which wheels I wanted to get.  So it was it's a great way to do comparison shopping and especially if you're talking  about things that are you know aesthetic based.  It's a really great way to do that sort of thing.  And again it's a huge huge marketing tie in.

Start time: 6101.20
End time: 6149.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah and it's sort of like OK so it the example that you used Tim it's like wheels for your  car. OK well Pinterest is like well we kind of get an idea of what Tim might want to buy  in the future. So when you see an ad that might be in that realm of you know car tech  or whatever you go yeah well I'm on Pinterest anyway because I'm probably doing research  on something that I'm going to end up buying and it all makes perfect sense when I see  an ad for you know a pair of shoes that maybe I've looked at online in the right rail of  my Facebook news feed I get livid because I'm like I'm not on Facebook to buy things.  I don't want to see shoes to buy here on Facebook.  We're on Pinterest.  I'm sure I would welcome it and say oh yeah that's right.  I didn't buy those shoes yet. I love these shoes.  I'm pinning like pinning.  I'm going to pin it.  You don't even know what pinning means.

Transcript:  I think that yeah it's sort of like when you have an instance where you're doing research  on wheels for your car in my case I wanted to buy a new couch and I went crazy on Pinterest  because because I thought well I just I just wanted one place where I can remember all  of these photos and then it turned into this thing where it's like now I'm really really  in love with some of these designers that I don't know these people.  They certainly don't know me but I love all their pins.  We look at that living room. Oh she did that really nice thing with the lamp.  It's like this whole community and it's really fun.  But I had to have that first little project in order to get in.

Transcript:  Hey should we talk about Cyanogen wanting to basically well they say that they would  like to be the third major mobile ecosystem and if you're not totally familiar  with Cyanogen, Cyanogen Mod has grown a lot as custom Android firmware  as introducing new services along the way and it is now going to operate as a full  any company like any other called Cyanogen Incorporated led by Boost Mobile co-founder  Kurt McMaster and they're going to devote themselves to building Cyanogen Mod as a  platform. We were talking about this on tech news today and I don't have an Android.  And so Jason Howell is always my go to when I say is this something that the Android  community wants.  He's explained that Cyanogen is great in many ways because it's a cleaner install.  It helps the whole system if you're on the Android system run more smoothly.  Boot up stuff faster that sort of thing.  So it makes perfect sense.  But then how do you get to the kind of hardware that you're going to choose when  you've got something like stock Android and you've got Cyanogen and then you've got  the manufacturers bloatware on top of that.  Tim is this is are they going in the right direction.  Is this some sort of a solution for Android.

Transcript:  I am actually really curious to see how this shakes out because I'm not sure that  I'm not sure that we need another player like this.  Obviously they've had huge success on the iOS front but you know it's always been  kind of an alternative kind of pirate operation.  So for them to be going I don't want to say legit but you know to be getting a little  bit more serious about this to be challenging the likes of Google and likes  of HTC and other folks who are doing customized versions of Android.  That's a pretty big ask.  I'm excited to see what they come up with though.  I mean their designs have been great and the sort of innovations that they brought  to the mobile operating system front are really encouraging to see.  So for them to have full reign to do whatever they want to with an operating  system is encouraging.  But I'm just not sure how the market is going to react because we've seen you know  offerings from Missoula not exactly take a lot of a lot of wind out of Android sales  by any means. And I'm afraid that afraid that they'll have some tough seas ahead  to continue with the stretched nautical metaphor there.

Transcript:  Yeah maybe.  We've got some people in chat saying Sarah there's not one single Android  community there are a lot of different kinds of Android and people who like this  and that. I think that's sort of the point though.  The point is is that there are many different Android experiences.  I mean look at look at the kindle fire.  I mean look at there there are Android experiences.  Amazon is just one great example of something where it's like well doesn't  really look like Android at all but that's what's under the hood.  Cyanogen saying we can provide an Android experience for anybody who believes in  this. Yes large and admittedly fragmented ecosystem but we're going to do it better.  And that's the that's that's the best Android experience that we're going to  offer.  Yeah yeah you're nodding.
