Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Time, please.  This is Twitter.  This is This Week in Tech, episode 85 for January 22, 2007, The Podfather.  It is time to twit, and Patrick Norton is back from a long hiatus.  I hope that hiatus has been operated on and is now completely removed.  You missed you, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well, it's that darn business production schedule CES holiday travel thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, between dusty trucks and trade shows in Vegas, it's hard to get, Patrick, but we're  glad to have you.  And I know you have a lot of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was being trapped in Wyoming behind this snowstorm was part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, dear.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was unplanned?  No, I love Laramie, Wyoming.  It's one of my favorite towns in Wyoming after Jackson Hole, but I was not planning on spending  a day and a half there waiting for Route 80 to open up on my way home.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  Also from Great Britain on the line, Will Harris from bit-tech.net.  He's become one of our most welcome regulars, and he's the guy who stirred up the whole  thing with the pink jumper and the pink glasses and Adam Curry.  It was your idea to offer him $20, and lo and behold, look here he is, ladies and gentlemen,  the pod father himself, the founder of Pod Show, of course, the original podcaster with  his daily source code still going strong over 500 episodes.  Adam, I'm so glad we could have you on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's really great to be here, Leo, and you may now kiss the ring.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can I tongue it?  Is it OK to tongue it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, as long as you get around all the edges, then it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Polish it.  Will and I were just going to the pub.  Y'all can call us when you're done with this slightly unsettling display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just glad Adam's got his connectivity.  He's in San Francisco today, and I guess Comcast was not behaving earlier this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is so amazing.  I am literally, you've got to check this out.  I'm going to do a whole video show about this.  I jacked into the telco closet.  I put a Wi-Fi range extender into a hub.  That is picked up by my iMac, which then routes to a link-sys, which then spreads it throughout  the condo.  I've got all kinds of routing shit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do not mess with Curry, man, when it comes to connectivity.  Damn it.  Damn it.  This is one of the things I think that's so cool about you, Adam, is you're kind of a  movie star, starting with MTV and everything, and yet you're really quite a geek deep down.  In fact, really, that's perhaps what your legacy will be.  Have they finally stopped introducing you as former MTV VJ?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that'll ever stop.  Does that drive you crazy?  No, no, no.  I'm very proud of the time I spent there.  Not proud of all the work that I did, but it was a very exciting time and an interesting  point in the history of media when things were changing dramatically.  True.  But it is true that if you look at the roots of my broadcasting career, it started with  me building my own transmitter and having my mom drive me around the block to see how  far the signal would reach.  I had the Radio Shack 101 project kit, so I was always making stuff.  I'm totally a geek.  I just met the right people who knew how to do my hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and your wife still does your hair, I think.  So she's doing it.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I'll tell her, Leo.  Thank you.  Still looking good.  A little shorter, but still looking like a movie star.  Pink Jumper or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me just say one thing about the Pink Jumper.  This was at the PodcastCon UK, which is not really the epitome of the fashion industry.  So no matter what you come in dressed as, and the Pink Jumper, okay, but I just want  to make one thing very clear.  The glasses, the rose-tinted glasses are really for seeing.  They're not sunglasses.  Yes, they're purposely rose-tinted because, let's face it, the wood looks nicer that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well in the interest of full disclosure, we didn't give you 20 bucks either.  That's true.  Although, I'm using a Splenda flavor blend right now in my senseo coffee.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, I appreciate it.  I'll send that snippet to the client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And in fact, I use GoDaddy to register all my domains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, you laugh about it, but this is exactly what brand advertising is about.  Brand advertising is not about finding some relevance on a web page and putting a relevant  link to a product to click.  It's about creating a brand messaging, and it carries through.  Here you are talking about Splendas, if it's the most normal thing in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well it is with the advantage of...  Folks, don't worry, this isn't going to become inside podcasting for the rest of the show.  We will get to the tech news.  I want to talk some geeky stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm more fascinated that people actually use Splenda in real life.  I love Splenda.  I'll be honest with you, I use Splenda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, Callie and Neil were up doing Call for Help a few months ago, and they got the  call that Splenda was going to be on the show, and I said, oh hey Neil, I'm a big Splenda.  I don't use the flavor blends, I'll be honest with you, but I do love Splenda.  I hate to think, you know, nobody knows what it's doing to me, but sure, it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nah, you can go to thetruthaboutsplenda.com and you can find out what it's not doing to  you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright.  But just for the record, I am a very big fan of the Pink Jumper, I did think it was very  nice.  Alright, thank you.  It was the context of the fashion parade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're confirming everything everybody thinks about Brits right now, Will, you understand  that.  What, why is that?  I don't know why that is.  I've never met a more macho, manly, you know, people as a whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you kidding me, Leo?  It's like 70% of all British men are gay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh wait a minute, you see, you see, you see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now let's slow down a little bit.  Now before we get too much- If you're living in San Francisco while you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  saying that, it may skew the results a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he has an I want you poster as his icon on Skype, so I don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what neighborhood do you live in?  May as well get all the facts out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now come on, not that there's anything wrong with that, but getting back to what you were  saying about podcasting and advertising, I think that that's an interesting juxtaposition.  You obviously were talking about Google ads versus podcast ads, and I think that that  is one of the strengths of podcasting ads.  They're personal as opposed to impersonal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well from a business perspective, and I've always made it very clear, a pod show is about  commercializing whatever we can in this new media revolution.  You know, Google is extremely successful with their ad words.  There's no doubt about it, they've turned advertising on their head.  But the big end game that even Google is working towards is brand advertising and creating  an affinity.  And if you look at the relationship between the producer of a podcast, who is also often  a host, and the audience, that's what they call customer engagement, what we call audience, Leo.  Engagement is the big word in advertising right now, isn't it?  Right, but it's all about audience.  And no matter what you're talking about, your audience will- they'll buy stuff that you're  not even getting paid to promote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mostly, that's the case, because we have so few advertisers.  Well, happy to talk to you about that, sir.  You know that.  Yeah, well, you know, how is- first of all, I actually would like to ask you a little  bit about pod show, because it isn't exactly clear what the notion is.  As some people said, you're trying to build a new media network.  Is it an advertising network?  Is it a network of programs?  What exactly is the plan with pod show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it is a new media network, because in order to have network entertainment, you know,  you have to be able to do the networking side and the entertainment side.  And it's all built around our version of an advertising platform, the way we sell packages  to advertisers, the way we work with producers and hosts who we have relationships with,  or things that we create ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it does make sense to integrate that across the board, I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to scale it, absolutely.  And also, advertisers are looking for, you know, I'm sorry, advertisers, of course, are  looking for their audience, but the agencies they work with, they're looking for a place  where they can go, where they're going to get consistency, they know what's going to  be delivered, they know how it's going to be reported to them.  So that's kind of where we fit in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's going well.  Adam, I've got to say, if your advertisers are looking for that much, they're ahead of  the curve in a lot of places, because most of the places I've seen are trying to define  how video and audio is delivered on the web, and there's more traction systems I've run  into in the last year than I ever thought would be possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Numbers are the problem, aren't they, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, what we work on the hardest, you can't have media change the way it's  created, the way it's distributed, who creates and distributes it.  You can't have that change without advertising changing.  That is what we work on the hardest, is changing advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's what our agency spends a lot of time doing, educating ad agencies, trying  to explain to them, this is something different.  It's not radio, you know, it's something different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we don't have to sell it in 30-second chunks because we have no limitation on time,  ergo this conversation that's going on.  And on, and on, and on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in this week's Tech News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to talk about Pirate Bay.  It's a little bit of an old story, but I think since we've got two Brits on here, or two  people who live in Britain anyway, this is such a tradition in Britain to have these  pirate radio stations like Radio Lux.  Oh, it's the Sea Land thing?  Sea Land in Radio Caroline.  Now Pirate Bay, the BitTorrent tracker site that has been up and down in Sweden, is trying,  I think it's more publicity than anything else, but wants to buy Sea Land.  Sea Land's got a kind of crazy quilt history.  Will Harris, are you following the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty crazy.  I mean, Bit Land, Sea Land, Sea Land was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they might call it Bit Land when they own it, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like an oil rig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's a naval platform.  It was for target practice.  Oh, it's a naval platform.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's a pile of concrete off the British coast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It looks like a drilling rig, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so I don't know if the guy still owns it, but for many years, there's a guy who  lived on Sea Land and he had his own passports and his own money, and he wasn't recognized  internationally.  Roy of Sea Land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Roy of Sea Land.  And he's still there.  And the problem is, he's getting old and he's trying to sell it off.  Were they ever acknowledged as a real sovereign nation?  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, if they could shut down all of mp3.com in Russia, eventually, I'm sure they can shut  down Sea Land.  So it sounds more like a publicity stunt to me, which is a nice one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I want to know is, if they're going to set up a pirate bay on Sea Land, what exactly  is the net connectivity in the middle of the ocean on a naval platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently it's one megabit.  It's not enough to run a track.  Dude, I've got the setup here in my condo.  I can sell it to him, no problem.  If he's got Adam to come out, he can wire it for Wi-Fi.  It'll be great.  All you need is a Pringles Cantina and you're set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, of course, the concept with BitTorrent is that they only have to seed it from Sea  Land.  They don't actually have to have all the bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But imagine the bandwidth on the pirate bay is pretty serious.  I mean, there's a lot of people using it.  How is all of mp3?  It's still alive.  It's still running.  You can't use a credit card, but they don't seem like they're out of business.  I don't know how well they're...  I mean, the RIAA's attempt to shut them down isn't that effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  It's on an agenda somewhere at the UN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it's on a big agenda.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think it's really on a big agenda?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, in the United States it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's been a part of economic policy of the United States government that's been beating  on Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's actually written into these treaties now.  They're named by name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's pretty much like the Gucci bags and the sunglasses that you can buy on any  street in New York or LA or San Francisco.  Yeah, they're supposed to be stopping that too.  Yeah, right.  But it's...  And I tell my wife all the time, don't buy that shit, man, because one day someone will  rip your shit off and you'll be really angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Adam, I'm going to have to edit those.  We have a clean tag.  This is not the daily source code, my friend.  I can't go around with $13 million of airplanes strapped to my tuchus.  It's 15.  15, I'm sorry.  Actually, that's an interesting story is Virgin Atlantic's attempt to get into the US market  with a viral video.  Have you seen the viral video?  No, I haven't.  The problem is that US law prohibits non-US citizens from operating an airline in the  United States.  Virgin would like to get into the US and the Department of Transportation is blocking them  right now.  I think Arnold will fix that.  Arnold has come in and say, if I can become president, Richard, you can become an American  citizen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're doing it through a shell company.  It's a shell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all Americans running it, but the Department of Transportation seems not to be swayed.  Now they've gone to YouTube.  You can actually see this.  Our friend Alex Lindsay produced a commercial for these new jets, which looks slick.  LinuxBox is running with entertainment.  They're trying to get people to sign petitions, which I signed, to get the DOT to get off  their B-U-T-T and let Virgin in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I fly Virgin once a month and their in-flight entertainment system, which indeed the one  they're using currently is based on Linux, because I've seen the boot screen a couple  times, is phenomenal.  It's really not just that it works, but they also refresh the content every month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're trying to bring this to the US.  They've got RJ-11 jacks at every seat.  They've got standard power supplies at every seat.  Wait, wait, they've got POTS jacks at every seat?  No, no, I'm sorry, RJ-45.  I'm sorry, I'm standing in the presence.  I bow down.  I'm sorry, I'll kiss your ring too, Patrick.  RJ-45.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, I was just sitting there like, you bring your own phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's ridiculous.  They've got dial-up networking in every seat.  It's amazing.  Do they offer internet connectivity on these Virgin flights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not currently.  You can use an SMS service.  I wish they would do it, because that's the only thing missing from that experience.  I love them to death.  I have a million miles, only one million more, and I can get a free flight on Spaceship One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really?  Yep, two million miles.  How long did it take to get the first million?  A year.  Really?  Yeah, so if I get the second million.  You did a million miles in one year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's a lot of bonuses and promotions in there.  So I probably did the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably about a quarter million miles, 300,000 miles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd say it's about that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good Lord.  It's time to stay home.  Holy cow, that's crazy.  So a million miles and you would get to go to space, would you do that?  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You would?  Oh yeah, oh man, I'd love to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're talking to the guy who refused to go on the Blue Angels plane.  Patrick went, but I wouldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm a pilot, you know, so I kind of have that bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You trust Richard Branson.  One of the features they do have on these new jets is you can chat with the other people  on the plane.  In fact, they create a chat room of everybody on the plane, which you can go into.  Cool.  Is that bizarre?  I don't know exactly what that would be like.  It's a hotty and 24G.  Look over here, baby.  They also, you can order food from the screen and they said the stewardesses will bring  it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you imagine just like an IRC back channel at a conference where the stewardess or the  flight attendant is doing the safety demonstration, everyone's ranking, ranking on them in the  chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the bad kids in the back of the class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love it.  Oh yeah, the little parking margarine cup attached to the enema bag is going to be real  useful.  Shoulder rolling at 500 miles an hour.  Yeah, I can see that happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Netflix is going to start streaming movies as well.  Now this is something that you won't be able to do, Will, but those of us who live in the  States will be able to, next to the add button where you add a movie to your Netflix queue,  press a play button on some movies.  We'll actually be able to watch it on the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We actually had a viewer email us in about this.  It's very similar to a lot of the existing systems except like cinema now kind of or  Yeah, except that apparently Netflix spent 40 million dollars developing this one.  Wow.  PC only, Internet Explorer only, WMV based encryption it looks like or feels like.  It would have to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no way they'd allow that.  But you can't stop and start and switch films, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well yeah, and that's what's kind of interesting is they're charging it based on the amount  of time you physically watch the movie, which means you have to be logged into the net every  time you want to watch the movie.  Right.  Netflix has to revalidate the DRM because it's essentially streaming.  So you're not going to be able to like, you know, purchase a movie or rent a movie and  then drive up to the ski house and watch it there.  You're going to have to have a broadband connection anywhere you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix said, we've got to have a second act.  Everybody agrees DVDs aren't going to last forever.  Is this a legitimate second act or is this just a, I mean, lots of other players as you  point out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they're in an interesting position in that they already have, you know, I've heard  numbers as high as six million regular subscribers to their service.  Wow.  So if all of those six million subscribers or even a small percentage or, you know, a  moderate percentage of the six million subscribers have broadband, that could give them a pretty  huge leg up over all of these online services.  That said, they suffer from the same problems.  They're claiming they'll be near instantaneous starting, but people have noted, if you write  it out, you know, like I said, we had a viewer who wrote in, he said one movie started in  like 30 seconds.  It was a black and white Abbott Costello movie.  You know, another movie, which was, you know, a modern, you know, full color feature.  It took about 15 or 20 minutes to queue before it started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's my problem with all these offerings is they don't tend to have Pirates of the  Caribbean on these streams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, actually a lot of the major ones like the movie link, Cinnamon Owl type ones, actually  do have, they've had big movies on for a very long time.  In fact, I believe movie link was actually started by the, I think either movie link  or Cinnamon Owl or both were actually started by the studios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This, you know, this concept, this business model of taking Hollywood content, licensing  that for distribution over the internet, I think is seriously flawed.  The distribution costs are going to be enormous just to get this to the customer.  And if they make any money, the first thing that Hollywood is going to do is renegotiate.  You know, it's a dead end.  It's just like iTunes.  Of course, the-  It's just like podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, and video delivery online.  How are we different?  How are we different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because we're willing to negotiate and deal with each other in a much more civilized manner.  Hollywood is all about squeezing the last nickel.  So if you don't own the content that you're distributing, you own your content, Leo, that  you're distributing.  So you're not going to rob yourself, you know, but Hollywood, believe me, Apple does not  make a lot of money per track.  In aggregate, if you sell a billion songs, that's great, but it's not about the music  and we know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  It's not a profit deal for them.  It's about selling iPods.  It's about selling the hardware, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well talking about squeezing every last-  Are you going to bring up the Zune?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, baby.  Tell me about this.  Is this just fraud?  Well, okay, go ahead.  I'll-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody knows, right, that the Zune catchphrase is welcome to the social.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, I found a nightclub in Toronto called The Social, so I finally figured out  what that means.  It's this nightclub in Toronto.  Yeah.  They all want you to go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No?  No?  But also, we also know that, you know, Microsoft is pimping the Zune out to all the big studios  to try and get some support.  Sony Univision, Sony's and whatever.  Well, it turns out now that there are some-  Oops.  Oops.  You can't squirt it.  songs in the Zune music catalog that you can't squirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not some.  It's quite an-  You can squirt it.  It's quite-  Somebody told me it's almost half.  It's a huge number.  So how pointless is that?  You can't even squirt them.  I mean, what kind-  These record companies are insane.  The thing is so protected.  You can only three days or three plays, and they don't even want you to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty- I mean, it's pretty bonkers.  It's a bit of a half-cut measure, really, isn't it?  It makes it look like even more of a gimmick than it was before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of stunning.  Is it Sony that's one of the-  Yeah, Sony.  It's Universal and Sony, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Universal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's pretty much- That covers a lot of material.  And you won't know.  You can't tell until you try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and Gadget says it's roughly 40 to 50% of artists.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whereas if they had only made the Zune a little bit more compatible with MP3s and a little  more easy to work with MP3s, I think it would gain a lot more traction.  Hey, if they just supported podcasts.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, that's- They brought this to market so quickly.  They knew from day one that podcasting was not going to be in the first release, and  they will support it one way or the other, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I talked to the product manager for Windows Media Play 11 last year at CEF, CCDS  2006, and they said, yeah, we really want to have RSS, and we should have RSS, but we  don't, and we're going to try to add it in as quickly as possible.  You know, and I was kind of sitting there just kind of like, you're kidding me, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know.  By the way, Adam, you might be interested.  There are 100 pink Zunes out there to go.  If you could go with your jumper.  It's just random whether you'll get one.  Thanks, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Always good to have you with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although I understand they're available on eBay if you really have to have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was at Fry's Electronics in Concord, which of course is kind of a-  Oh, that's a Mecca.  Yeah, that is a Mecca when you're in Northern California, and it was the first time I was  able to get my hands on a Zune, and I was surprised.  Of course, everyone else who's tried one knows this, but I was surprised that that turn wheel  doesn't turn.  It's the first thing you do.  Up, down, left, right.  Yeah, I was like, huh?  It's not working right.  And then I figured it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like the Zune in a lot of ways.  I like the Zune, but I think it's clear now that this DRM thing is just broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I played Room 1 for the first time at CES this year.  I hadn't seen it before.  And what amazed me with it was basically like the first iPod.  Yeah.  It feels like that, doesn't it?  Kind of big and clunky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  The interface is pretty clean, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like the UI.  I wish there was the word podcaster in the UI.  So you think, Patrick, that they will at some point release an update to the Zune that suddenly  you'll see that word podcaster?  Will they use the word podcaster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, part of the issue with podcasters is they don't currently have RSS support in Windows  Media Player 11.  And like I said before, that's something they were aware of being a major flaw in Windows  Media Player 11 12 months ago.  So DBMP 11's out.  It'd be nice to see them maybe after Vista ships, they'll finally turn around.  Without the RSS integration, without the RSS reader or podcaster.  It has to aggregate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, Patrick?  You can use juice.  You can use the iPod or juice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's a reason such a huge number.  40% of the people downloading, at least 40% of the people downloading.  They use iTunes.  Yeah.  Because it's built in.  For DLTV, use iTunes.  Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you think that the reason why Microsoft has been so in limbo about RSS in Media Player  and the Zune is because they were supposed to be using the central RSS repository in  Vista that is under the hood and that no longer got support and it's just everyone's confused  about where they should be getting it from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would certainly be a start of it.  I also want to say, I was surprised at how fervent they were about getting RSS built  into IE7 as part of their checklist for things they were two years late on catching up to  Firefox with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It would make sense, though, if they'd relied upon a central capability in Vista and it  was one more thing yanked out of Vista that, well, all the plans are now on the back burner  because they can't count on it.  That's probably what could probably happen.  Yeah, that makes sense.  I would like to see you, Adam, and other new media people really put some pressure, certainly  I've been outspoken on Microsoft to really make this a priority, to put this into...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me tell you a little story, Leo.  Before Apple integrated podcasting into iTunes, well before that, probably six months, my  partner and I, Ron Bloom, we went to Microsoft and we had a number of conversations and we  talked about, we actually were willing to put our developers to work to put a headless  version of iPod or Juicy, if you will, into something that we would install that would  be on Windows.  We had all these conversations.  At that point, it was like, it's definitely coming in the next release of Windows Media  Player and then we didn't hear anything and then Apple called and said it had the exact  same spiel to them and they just did it and they just integrated it.  Yeah, kudos to Apple for that.  And quite honestly, I'm really tired.  Why the hell should I have to push Microsoft?  It's impossible.  You can't push that company to do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I'll tell you why, because 95% of the world's using it.  If they don't support it, we're going to hit a ceiling.  I think we've hit the ceiling and we can't go much beyond that until it's kind of on  the desktop in Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's true, but you have to look at how many people use iTunes on Windows.  It's all very well saying, you know, 95% of people use Windows.  How many Windows users are using iPod and therefore using iTunes?  Well, every iPod user on Windows is using iTunes and so is it really a ceiling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We see about 70% of all downloads that are iTunes related coming from the Windows version.  It used to be 50-50 and now it's about 70%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think our numbers are something similar, although it's almost 90% of our listeners  are using iTunes on some platform.  I just think we need an ecology here.  Apple's so dominant in this.  And again, kudos to Apple for stepping up and doing it.  I'm not complaining about that at all.  I want to see Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're the open source guys outside of...  Here's what I think happened where we went wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Juice, formerly known as iPod or Lemon...  Which you wrote the first version of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I didn't write any of that code because I think it was in Python initially.  I wrote an Apple script and then it went to Python and PHP or so now it's Python I think.  What I think they did wrong there is they then turned it into a player and that really  confuses a lot of people.  If it was just a utility, which was what my original script was, just hidden and doesn't  do anything but maybe notify you of what it's doing.  I think that's where they went wrong because creating a player is very, very difficult business.  And you don't need to because there is a player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's plenty of players.  Yeah, Windows media player.  I think the more it looks like Windows the better and that's why I'd like to see Microsoft.  But you think the open source community could step up and provide a solution that people  would adopt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, one of two ways.  Maybe someone revisits the whole concept of Juice and creates a new version that somehow  makes it clearer to users and how it integrates with a favorite player.  It's just an extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a widget.  And then media player takes over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or conversely, the open source community, of course, could easily create a kick-ass  player.  But what I typically find is that it just misses the beautiful art that Apple cranks  out.  It just never looks right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's Songbird, which is pretty gorgeous.  But it's hard to get people to download that.  It certainly hasn't hurt Apple.  They reported on Wednesday that their first quarter profit was up 78% exceeding Wall Street's  expectations, a profit of $1 billion with apologies to Dr. Evil.  That's $1.14 a share.  iPod sales $21 million in a quarter.  That's pretty astounding.  Total iPod sales $90 million since October 2001.  That's pretty crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, do you remember the cassette Walkmans?  Yeah, Sony.  Yeah, we've been through this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You think the same thing will happen?  Will something else come along?  Or will somebody make a better iPod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was thinking about this the other day.  I remember when you just had to have the Walkman.  If you didn't have the Sony Walkman, you had the cheesy kind.  You got the crappy headphones.  You got the crappy headphones.  You don't have the new Dolby DBX noise reduction.  Then something along the way happened.  I'm not quite sure what, honestly.  Then we tried the portable DVD players.  That wasn't really too successful because there was too much skipping typically.  Maybe it was just pent up demand that built over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember, Patrick, though, when we saw the first hard drive MP3 players.  Remember that?  What was it?  PJB100.  Yeah.  That was pretty exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I still have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was amazing.  Clearly something special about the idea of having that many songs in a device.  It wasn't as small as an iPod, but it was very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it predated.  It was before the iPod.  Well, before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't know.  I know.  Then there was a company that was doing that with the Indash.  Was it Q?  What was the name of that?  The MP3 car.  MP3 car, yeah.  Or carmp3.com.  I wonder if some of the impetus for Apple's iPhone is not to be there when that time has  come when the iPod reaches end of life to have the next thing.  Isn't that what Apple's goal is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's just having another next thing.  That's how Steve's positioning it, for sure.  It's the next thing.  Yeah, when you had the first Motorola flip phones in 1996, 1997, and everyone loved it  and it was the coolest thing to have, then all of a sudden they were completely out of  style.  They were also breaking because you'd open it, the lid would flip off into space and  stuff.  But now the flip phone is without a doubt is back.  It's fashion, Leo.  It's just fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a very good point.  It's hard to influence fashion.  I don't think Apple, more than anybody else, has a handle on how to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, but wait.  This is where Steve Jobs is brilliant.  He brings in Bono, the epitome of rock and roll and fashion.  I don't agree with his fashion sense, but yeah, exactly.  Very debatable.  But coming out with a red iPod for the red brand, that's a huge fashion statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That doesn't explain why John Mayer keeps showing up at the keynotes, though.  I don't understand that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's also Steve's weird.  Steve's been obsessed with rock stars forever and he's had this sort of NPR target audience  for all of his recent patients these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.  You've got to have different opening and closing acts sometimes.  Kanye West was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love that.  But John Mayer, I can do without.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the question is, nobody at Apple could have known that the iPod was going to explode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  If you gave this headline to Apple five years ago, they would go, huh?  We make most of our money on what?  A music player?  We are not Apple Computer Inc.  We are just Apple Inc.?  Huh?  Although, Mac sales were up 40% too.  Mac sales did well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's also a big quarter for spending for a lot of people, too.  For the first time in a while, everybody wasn't looking around going, where's Mac Pro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mac sales grew a double the growth of overall PC market.  It was a good quarter for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but it'll be curious to see what the next quarter is like.  People were waiting for Vista.  A lot of pent-up demand was coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You think they'll be glad they waited for Vista, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.  Vista is better than Windows ME.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Walt Mossberg in the journal this week said something that kind of surprised me, because  lately he's been a bit of an Apple cheerleader.  He said, this is the best version of Windows ever.  And frankly, I'd agree with him.  It's very impressive.  And then he goes on to say, but it's still Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cold, but hard, but fair.  What's that like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He said it's more, and this is true, too.  I think Microsoft has to respect its DNA.  It's more Windows.  It's not going to be a revolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well part of what's interesting is you kind of take a look at where the, and I'm going  to send my apologies out to the entire open source community to sort of prevent a flood  of email.  If you step away from Linux and BSD and the other open source operating systems, and you  basically look at the two highest profile operating systems out there, and again, don't  send me emails saying more people are using Linux than OS X.  I don't care for the purposes of this conversation.  Is that true?  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody is asserting that, however.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm certainly going to get email if I say that OS X is more popular, but if you look  at the way I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually more people are using World of Warcraft as their base operating system than any other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or at least to occupy most of their day.  And how about that guy that got the levels?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Burning Crusade, baby.  I was going to rename Twit to the Burning Crusade, but then they did that and I couldn't,  so I'm very disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All I'm thinking is like, you know, in the era of cyber war, France is going to clean  up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we should explain the Burning Crusade, and then we can get back to your, because  we've now gone completely down a rat hole.  The newest, actually the first expansion pack for World of Warcraft is out.  Burning Crusade allows you to go, it's got a whole new world, and allows you to go from  the top 60 to 70 now, which is one beta.  It's the version of 11 for World of Warcraft users.  And I just want you to know I am not a geek.  I am a level 12 Paladin, baby.  And somebody did that.  Somebody did that in, yeah, I'm a very casual player.  Somebody did that, you said, in 28 hours a French fellow did that.  A 10 leveled up 10.  From 60 to 70.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I recorded the whole thing and put it on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it on YouTube?  I'm pretty sure.  A 28 hour marathon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Perhaps they fast forwarded through it.  Just the highlights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's the Burning Crusade rat hole.  Let's get back to what you were saying, which was, I forgot, something about Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, looking at the way the two major players, like I think in the public's mind, there's  two major players right now for personal operating systems, and there's Apple and there's Microsoft.  And Apple's, they've always, every three years they wipe off an entire generation of hardware.  And now they're basically doing these sort of annual, little more than annual updates  to OS X.  And they charge you what's starting to look more and more like a fair amount.  If a video game can cost 60 bucks, an operating system at 120 doesn't sound too bad.  Versus the sort of massive attempts to rewrite Microsoft's operating system coupled with  a massive cost to upgrade.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The table will be at least 100 and many 200 and more, right?  To get to Ultimate, anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Ultimate's fascinating, but I mean, we're what, two weeks less than two weeks  away at this point from the release, the consumer version.  Actually, I wonder if anybody's pre-ordering for that.  But it's such a very different, Apple's kind of like, hey, we've got the foundation is  good, we've got these open source cats that are doing great things with the kernel, and  we're just going to keep plugging away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm excited about Leopard.  I think it's got a long way off.  Interesting twist, however, to this Apple story.  You know, all the Core 2 Macs have come with, it turns out, airport cards that could do  802.11n.  It does require a firmware patch.  And Apple's claiming that it's Sarbanes Oxley that's making them charge a buck 99.  Some weird accounting rule that since they've already booked the revenue from selling these  machines, if they're going to upgrade, I don't buy this.  Anybody buy this, they figure to upgrade the capabilities of the machine, they have to  charge you a buck 99.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I can't say what you're going to charge.  I think it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Adam, did you study accounting in school?  Because we needed some help here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, but I did run my own public company.  So that's Sox.  Well, this is before Sox.  Sarbanes Oxley is class weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As somebody like one of my best friends that's an accountant, if you want to hear him sort  of go off in strange directions, just bring up Sox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This was the US law that came in after the Enron scandal to what one hoped to add transparency  and accounting reliability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It used to be much easier to indeed if you...  So from what I understand of it, and I certainly don't plan to be an expert or know everything  about it, they did recognize the revenue from this in advance, which of course is something  that props up your 10Q and your quarterly numbers.  I think it used to be a lot easier to explain that away later without charging the customer  for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I understand when I download an update to software for free, doesn't that add value  to the software?  And wasn't that revenue already recognized?  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think this is something to follow because if this is a trend, then it may very  well be that you have to pay for this stuff or it has to be accounted for some way directly  with the consumer instead of between balance sheets within a corporation.  That could be pretty messed up.  So I do have my eye on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, CNET's actually got a pretty good article written up on this.  And they're saying basically this was a choice of how to book the revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they're probably a little bit conservative given the options scandal.  The SEC is looking closely at them.  This might be a good time to toe the line.  Here's another thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it possible this is a licensing issue that if you know they put something in that they  have to pay for per user essentially if it's activated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does seem a rather token amount.  I mean, Apple probably will have some revenue from this, but not a significant amount.  I'll pay it.  It's a buck 99.  I mean, I'll pay it to get in my MacBook Pro.  It's just an odd thing to do.  The good news is the new US Congress is apparently re-evaluating Sarbanes-Oxley.  So maybe this is something that will change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're in deep kimchi with Sarbanes-Oxley.  That's another word for crap, Leo.  No, I mean, this is really horrible.  The IPO market has gone overseas.  It's in London.  It's thriving now.  And just look at the dollars.  Is that what happened to IPOs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We haven't had an IPO in years.  Certainly no tech IPO in years.  Nobody wants to do it.  Even GoDaddy came right up to the line and said, whoa, and backed off.  And that's because it sucks.  Oh, absolutely.  Very interesting.  Well, it sounds like a bad law if it's doing it.  While we're on the topic of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bad laws?  ...I was going to go with transmission and sort of data rates and things, I was absolutely  amazed to see this month that the latest issue of Playboy has got a two-page editorial on  net neutrality, FCC and bandwidth utilisation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I only read it for the pictures, so I must have missed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the article was written three months ago.  Has it changed now?  Well, no, that's their lead time.  It's three months to get an article of the press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  So it was a big story three months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I thought it was amazing that the tech community has done such a great job of  making such a hoo-ha out of this that it can reach something that is completely mainstream  as Playboy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if it was the tech community so much as the content community that made  such a huge noise about it.  I thought it was Tricia Helfer.  I didn't know.  Playboy makes a lot of money online.  You know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's certainly in their...  Yeah, absolutely in their interest to keep an eye on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  They certainly took their time and sort of...  I mean, what was the gist of the article?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was just basically saying how absolutely useless the FCC was, how it was in the grasp  of all the big content companies and that it was giving...  It was trying to stiff users effectively by selling out to all these people and that the  FCC had lost its remit of public service and had basically become a sort of business evangelist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this whole net neutrality debate has been a very futile one.  And I'm not even sure I understand what people are trying to communicate with net neutrality,  nor do I believe that these people understand what networking is and what it costs to make  a network and to maintain it and how that's utilized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you say these people, who do you mean?  You mean the Congress or do you mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, everybody who was yelling and screaming about net neutrality.  You think that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're in the AT&T court on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm not necessarily in either court, but I do know a lot about networking and when  you see what it...  Look, it's all about money.  It's very expensive to set up a network and if you have lots of traffic, that means more  switches, bigger switches, that comes at a huge cost.  So I'm not necessarily against ISPs and telcos charging the content providers for that distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, but it sounds like then you've got this kind of toll road, this gerrymandered network  where every time you want to go somewhere, you've got to pay a little fee because we've  got toll roads everywhere.  Is that what we want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm also not worried about the sheer force of human beings to get something if they want  it, no matter if they have to beg, steal or borrow to get it.  There will be alternatives, but we already have a toll road.  I pay for bandwidth going out and you pay for bandwidth coming in.  The toll road's already there.  There's nothing new here.  Yeah, but let's not add more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But we're paying for it now and it's a variable cost and there's competition.  Adam, we're arguing on the same side.  AT&T basically claims that they can't deliver the bandwidth that you think you're paying

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  for.  Ironically, they've kind of backed off on this.  They said, we'll never do that.  We didn't mean that and we don't want to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I think they will, Leo.  I think they will most definitely do it, but they won't do it to people who are providing  media and other content peer to peer or one to few or even one to many.  It'll really come companies like YouTube, Pod Show, Google.  Twit may have to deal with that as well because you're just pushing tremendous amounts of  bandwidth through their system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So basically, let me see if I got this straight, Adam.  I'm paying Comcast a bloody fortune for my connectivity, which I can't actually reach  with any single provider that can actually saturate that connection because I don't deserve  to get the bandwidth I think I'm paying for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I don't think anyone said it's exactly going to be like that.  I think that there's been talk of prioritization of packets.  Not reach and have a different priority are two different things.  I think that there will definitely be levels of the so-called toll road that will depend  upon amount of media, quality of media and consistency that is being sent down the pipe.  I don't think anyone's going to get cut off and I don't think the consumer at home, we  already have all kinds of restrictions on running servers, on your ISP connections.  This has been around for a long, long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm talking about getting the download speed I think I'm paying for.  I think that's a different issue.  We have thousands of users that find themselves dealing with packet shaping issues on the  ISP level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a misnomer because it's been marketed incorrectly or maybe very correctly.  When someone sells you an 8 megabit connection and you see a video coming down at 2 megabits  per second, there's a lot of stuff in the middle that that 8 megabit connection has  no control over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not talking about 8 megabits to 2 megabits.  I'm talking about people being throttled to 20 or 50k.  People who are consistently seeing 500k to a megabit suddenly finding themselves and  not because they've hit a monthly cap in the amount they're allowed to download, the people  universally suddenly can't get downloads made from certain sites higher than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is already happening.  This is already happening because their networks can't handle the amount of traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this the old argument though that we can't sustain flat rate prices?  We've got to go back to per bit pricing.  Isn't that something people would like to do too?  Wouldn't that solve the issue?  Customers want flat rate.  Just look at cell phone plans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When networking started, we came up with this whole idea of a peering agreement precisely  because the telcos didn't really have the capability or the horsepower at the time to  be able to calculate every bit that passed through their routers and who it belonged  to like they were used to doing with telephone minutes because there's something at the end  of every month that's called settlement and all the telcos exchange all their records  and hey, I sent this much your way, you sent this much my way.  We're going to either wash it out or you owe me money or I owe you money.  These peering agreements started basically by saying, look, we can't count it but we  can't see exactly what's coming through you or is directed towards you but it's kind of  the same amount so we're peers.  Yes, I think the only way to do it is to go back to actual packet counting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At a cost.  That means all of a sudden you're putting switches and routers everywhere, you're measuring  everything, there's some bottlenecking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At the end of the day though, I think the consumer will win big time.  I think exactly the opposite.  The consumer at home is going to get fantastic throughput from anything they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If they're willing to pay for it and their ISP is willing to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have listeners in Sweden who continually tell me, oh, hey, we get 100 megabit downloads  for 20 bucks a month.  Why is it so cheap there?  It's subsidized by the government.  The government's paying for it.  Is that what you want to do?  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure.  I think our government should pitch in too.  In fact, I believe that's part of the net neutrality debate is that there was lots of  money allocated towards the telcos years ago and they were supposed to build out their  networks and they didn't really do it.  I think that's where a lot of anger stems from.  But yeah, this is just important to me as the electricity grid or the water network.  Why wouldn't the government at least have some involvement or set some type of regulation?  I'm not against that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just in case you think this is a dead issue, the new Congress has in fact reintroduced  a net neutrality bill, a pro net neutrality bill I might add.  And as long as we're talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is just pandering towards constituents because they don't know what the hell they're  talking about.  It's a series of tubes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're saying it's us that's dumb and Ted Stevens knew what he was talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was right on the money, man.  He sent a truck my way just this morning.  I got the internet.  I don't want one of Adam's smoking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's a new bill actually.  As long as we're talking about Congress, the Senate introduced a bill called the platform,  I should say the US Senate, introduced a bill called the Platform Equality and Remedies  for Rights Holders in Music Act, a nice acronym that stands for PERFORM.  This is a bill that died, an RIA bill that died last year.  It would require content protection on all satellite radio broadcasts.  You might be interested in this, Adam, since you do stuff on Sirius, along with cable and  internet broadcasts.  Broadcasters would be required to use reasonably available and economically reasonable technology  to prevent music theft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Another misunderstood conversation that has produced a knee-jerk reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you've done a lot for PodSafe Music with your PodSafe Network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, that's the point.  That's what this is about.  It's about licensing and money.  There's huge forces at work who make money based upon the reuse of content, musical works,  the publishing predominantly, but also the replication rights.  It's always been a nice little game.  We have 6,000 radio stations.  They all have to pay X amount based upon how many listeners they have.  The way that money is divided within the performing rights societies, ASCAP BMI has always been  a very fuzzy black box, but the people who want to make money are making the money.  What the PodSafe Music Revolution did is said, hey, that's fine.  We want your stuff protected, and we don't necessarily believe in DRM.  Trust your co-license agreement partners on this, mainly podcasters, and give your stuff  for free.  Let them play it, and we'll tell you when it was played, and then you can go and build  your business and everything's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no money exchanging hands though.  Chirp, chirp, chirp.  Only about licensing.  It's merely just so that they know what's going on.  They're getting value in terms of promotional value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're getting huge value, and not just financial value, but there is a tremendous  social reward.  If you get a recommendation like, oh, you were looking for the Rolling Stones, you might  want to check out Brother Love, and I listen to a song, and maybe I buy a CD.  But when a creator of a product like a song is played on a show, basically someone who's  telling his thousand friends or more, hey, check this out.  I really love this guy.  In fact, I love it so much, and to play it back to back five times, that is a great feeling.  That's what motivates people, I think, more than money.  From one can, typically, you can create the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Brother Love's very happy.  I know he's got a lot of notoriety now, and it's done a great thing for him, I think.  Hey, Will, you had some stories that you wanted to bring up.  Have we covered them, or I'm looking for them, and I don't see them here?  I put them in the Fortwit bucket.  Ah, they're in Fortwit.  Well, bring them up.  Tell me what you would like to say.  I can't remember what it is, man.  All right, I'm still looking at Tricia Helfer's layout in Playboy, so let me load Delicious,  speaking of which.  Which was shot three years ago.  Was it really?  Of course.  Took forever.  Now that she's a star on Battlestar Galactica.  Poor kid.  Apple says Cisco lawsuit is silly.  Apple actually has an interesting loophole.  Apparently Cisco held that trademark for iPhone for six years before they released an iPhone,  just before Apple did, hoping to revive the trademark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the patent and trade office says nine different organizations have claimed ownership  over the iPhone patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what Apple said as well.  So I think Apple's going to get away with it, and Cisco's trademark is going to look  like it's not going to get it because they didn't use it for too long.  They didn't use it.  People are using it in the meantime.  And also there's a great video on YouTube of Steve Ballmer, Microsoft being asked about  the iPhone, and he puts on this really stupid, affected, kind of snort, laugh hybrid, and  looks like a complete idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It really looks like he's actually quite nervous about the iPhone and is doing his best to  make it not seem so.  Yes.  It's pretty hilarious.  Should I play a little bit of that?  Yeah, go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me ask you about the iPhone and the Zune, if I may.  Zune was getting some traction, then Steve Jobs goes to Macworld and he pulls out this  iPhone.  What was your first reaction when you saw that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Five hundred dollars, fully subsidized with a plan?  I said that is the most expensive phone in the world, and it doesn't appeal to business  customers because it doesn't have a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He almost sounds like he's crying, I'll be honest with you.  He doesn't sound too happy about that.  He's almost serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says something really interesting there about the keyboard, which I'm very interested  in as well.  I have not held an iPhone.  I do have a Nokia N800 internet tablet.  You love that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've been raving about that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and at first I thought this on-screen keyboard was really no good because you have  no tactile response, but I've forced myself to relearn how to use a different type of  keyboard.  I have to say, it's kind of growing on me.  And to hear Balmer laugh like that, I think he has to be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he's also, I mean, that's classic Balmer kind of redirect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but he makes a point.  It's very expensive.  There is no keyboard.  Everybody's kind of conditioned to the Trio Blackberry model where you have a little keyboard,  Although Jobs addressed that in his keynote and said, we don't think this is a good idea.  I did talk to David Pogue of the New York Times, who actually typed on the thing for  about 20 minutes and said, it's very hard to type on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it takes a lot longer than 20 minutes to get used to it.  I'm a Blackberry fiend.  I actually gave that up for my Nokia, what is it, E61, which has, it does have a regular  keyboard, but it's not in the patented fan configuration.  So that took me a little while to learn.  And I don't know, I was pretty much against the whole on-screen keyboard and user interface.  I'm starting to back out a little bit.  Did you have a 770 or is this 800 that you're first in?  No, I did not.  This is a, I would never buy anything like that.  Nokia sent me this and I was happy to try it out and I'm quite enamored with what it  does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's basically, I think-  It's very small.  It's almost a little tablet, but it's not a full-size tablet.  It's a small screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a small screen, but what's nice about it?  Well, there's two things.  One is it doesn't have a phone integrated, but it communicates with your phone through  Bluetooth so you can get a wireless data connection.  It does all the remembering of your Wi-Fi points and switches automatically.  But the most interesting thing about it, and I don't hear anyone, you know, this whole  conversation about iPhone being open or closed.  The Nokia is open.  It's Linux.  It's built on Debian, I think, Debian flavor of Linux.  And there's an active developer community creating applications for it.  It's got GPS in the chip.  It's even got radio in the chip.  It's got an onboard camera.  It's got all the things there.  Don't you find it immensely slow, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, not at all.  Is it transmetal?  Is it X-scale?  What's in there?  I've used both generations and it just seems, it takes an incredible act of patience to  wait for even basic web pages to load.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  On the N800?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  It didn't bother me at all.  No, I mean, I have to say I...  How do you use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you use it for?  Is it for going about town or?  Yeah, good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I use it for, basically for Gmail.  And you know, if I just want to look at something, I download podcasts with it and listen to  them on the device.  But I will say I use the, even though it has a full functioning Opera browser inside, which  supports Flash 7, which is also quite nice for a Linux-based device.  I use Gmail Mobile, which of course loads really fast and just works.  But you can drag the screen around with your finger so you don't have to necessarily use  scroll bars.  You can just tap, hold, and move a web page left, right, up, down, any direction you want.  Oh, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's kind of like the iPhone, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're really using your hands to do more with the interface than a mouse click and  point.  It's interesting, and I think there is something to explore there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's one of the things people were very interested in with the iPhone and the  Safari browser on the iPhone.  And maybe we are entering a new world of touch screen user interfaces.  Maybe there's some progress to be made there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well it's open source, so I think developers should go to, what is it, maybo.org, M-A-E-B-O.org,  and jump in because people are creating stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me ask you about this, Patrick.  You work for Ziff Davis.  According to Hard OCP, Ziff's going to be broken up and sold.  Bids were due on Friday.  Do you know anything about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this is an eight month old story that apparently just picked up on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's nothing, they didn't add anything new?  They said that the PC and gaming division would be broken up.  That's not new?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there is no PC and gaming division.  There's three divisions to the companies, the enterprise, consumer and small business,  and the gaming division.  The gaming division is the gaming magazines and whatup.com, the enterprises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They picked this up by the, I should point out, from the post, the New York Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, they've been shopping all three divisions.  I think the books have been shopped for the gaming division and enterprise already.  The final division being shopped is the consumer and small business division, which is why

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we're here.  Does it impact you at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, how many sales do we go through at ZDTV to TechTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That'd be two.  I went through my last Ziff Davis sale.  I'm not going through any more Ziff Davis sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I went through what?  Three or four?  Three or four, yeah.  TechTV was sold to G4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was with it, I started it in 94 when it was still owned by the Ziff family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so when Bill Ziff owned it.  He went from Bill Ziff to a holding company to a holding company.  To SoftBank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To SoftBank.  To Paul Allen.  Paul Allen.  I left before Comcast.  No, I guess I didn't leave before Comcast.  So I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you were out right before that closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was it just before that closed?  All right.  And a good thing too.  Let me tell you, I'm happy.  I have some Ziff Davis related news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yes?  Well, former Ziff Davis employee, Natalie Delconte, will start her own video new show  called Tech Check on Pod Show in a couple of weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Excellent.  How many shows are on Pod Show now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have any idea?  On the network itself, we have 5,000.  And of those 5,000, about 500 we have expanded agreements with and who are making upfront  money, etc.  That's impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, is she making upfront money or is she doing this on spec?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Natalie is working for us full time on this.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So she was in TechCrunch.  TechCrunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting.  I almost got Mike Harrington on this.  That's why he didn't want to go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he wouldn't let her work for Pod Show and write for TechCrunch.  He considers us a competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's exactly why I mentioned that you'd be on, Adam.  All right.  Just curious.  The Juiced is on the loose.  How many of you have played with Juiced and what do you think of it?  This is the new venture from Skype full screen television network via streaming.  I have to say pretty impressive.  The user interface especially is just gorgeous.  BitTech does a review of it.  Let's first ask Nick what he thinks.  Will, what do you say about Juiced?  How do you like Juiced?  You were the one who put the story in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you know what?  I think it's really interesting because it's a recognition of what I think is one of the  big areas of content to come, which is like this mid tail of content.  If you take like...  Not long tail, but mid tail.  If you've got the top of the tail, as it were, is like your Fox and your 24 and Lost  and whatever, you've got YouTube and Cat in Toilet at the far end.  In the middle, you've got this kind of professional grade programming that is possibly interest  sort of specific and is really, really interesting.  Juiced is going around truly trying to roll up some of that stuff and get it online and  You know, real sort of like a TV browser and a TV channel, but on your computer made up  of this really kind of interesting content.  I think it's going to be a great home for the kind of the Dignations and the Mac breaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right now you're even seeing much music on it.  You're seeing some world poker tour on there.  Adam, you said you sound like you had some thoughts about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have not been able to use it.  I'm still waiting for my beta user password.  As are a lot of people.  I'm obviously aware of it.  I think there's a couple things that are wrong with this.  One, it appears to me that they are soliciting mainstream content and building basically  a television service, which technically I'm sure is going to be extremely well received  and I think the experience will be great.  We go right back to my example of making no money on Hollywood content.  So I think that's a mistake.  And then from what I have read about their business model in mainstream publications  I read that they're going with a form of AdSense type model trying to provide relevancy, not  just based upon the content, but based upon who you are.  So a lot of pie in the sky type stuff, which is not, again, it's not the brand advertising  I think everyone's looking for.  So I'd have to really see, it all comes down to the content at the end of the day.  Look at what people are willing to watch on crappy YouTube.  So can you give me the same hilarious stuff on this beautiful high def type experience.  You think they should go with the user generated content?  Their distribution, they've always relied on other people to create the content.  Skype is the same thing because I was the same thing.  So other people providing the content has made them very successful.  But I think now they're stepping into a game which I just don't know if there's a game  to be had.  The other issue from what I understand is that this thing will chew up 200 to 300 megabytes  of data transferred down and 150 megabytes of data transferred up if you are within the  network.  So I have my doubts about how that's going to sit with our ISP friends.  But at the end of the day I've poo-pooed both of them in the past.  I met them when they were building Kazab because they were stationed in the, actually they  were just about to sell it, they were stationed in Amsterdam.  And at the time I thought, man these wacky guys, they're out of their mind.  And I was very wrong about that.  So they're definitely not stupid and they know how to get press but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're good programmers.  I think in each case they've written really good software.  This juice is beautiful.  I really see it.  It's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it was all...  They do that in Romania I think.  I don't know if they still do it that way but that's how they built a lot of Skype and  Kazab.  It was just the two of them sitting in an office in Amsterdam and all their engineers  were in Romania.  But again, is this what we're waiting for?  Are we waiting to be able to see the office?  You could watch the office.  It's like no, I don't think so.  Even downloadable videos, I have to question stuff.  What is the success of video on the internet?  No one can deny that it's YouTube.  And in general, although it's possible, people aren't downloading, they're just viewing in  web browsers.  And it's some combination of it being simple, it working every single time and the content  being funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But for it to mature, doesn't it have to stop playing on my web browser and start playing  on my TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think it's two different things.  The television is morphing dramatically.  It's become flat, it's become big, it's on the wall, it's like a piece of art, it's  delivering sports, it's delivering news, it's delivering a cinema experience, which is why  I'm not too high on the whole Netflix streaming.  I don't think it's too much trouble for people to go and get a HD DVD if they're going to  watch a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So do you think the dichotomy is the good TV is for premium content, the computer is  for YouTube style?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, don't get me wrong.  When you say premium content, I think I'm talking about quality.  So you can't watch a sports game really effectively on your computer with today's technology.  You want to watch sports on a big ass screen with a whole bunch of your buddies around  drinking beer, you know, and it's got to have great sound.  And it's a whole different type of experience and very, very costly to make.  It's 13 to 20 cameras on any good day at any game.  This is just an expensive proposition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what's interesting, Adam, is until YouTube, the biggest purveyor of video online was actually  Major League Baseball, who were taking their rights over the broadcast to stream them online  and make them available and charge money for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interim step, I think.  And it's a little different than a lot of sports.  It's not NASCAR, it's not football, it's not soccer.  Baseball at times can be a very, very slow game.  And that kind of fits in with what you can parse through today's technology and what  you can actually parse with your eyes.  For movies, the same thing.  Yeah, I think there'll be a lot.  I watch all kinds of movies streaming through Windows Media Player.  I've got my porn accounts.  I watch that and it's exactly what I want.  And I pay per minute.  Fantastic.  But if I'm going to watch a movie that $100 million went into to create, I really enjoy  it much more if I'm watching that in an HD experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not arguing against that, but there's certainly some compelling arguments for streaming,  live streaming of sporting events.  And if Major League Baseball can make it work, it's interesting to think about what it costs  to actually get a 500k or megabit stream, to get it out there to people, what it's going  to cost in terms of either advertising revenue or people being willing to pay for the subscriptions.  And that latter part, paying for the subscriptions is kind of what made Major League Baseball  work.  But it's also interesting to realize there's an entire generation that's been perfectly  happy with mediocre quality MP3s that they download.  And how many people have you run into that live off of content they download off of peer  to peer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think you're right there about Major League Baseball, but I think this just proves  that the reason why people were willing to subscribe to Major League Baseball is to be  able to see all the games they want to see.  Because you just can't get access to the content, to all the content in your region.  That's just the way everything's been set up.  So that just proves that people will go to any extent to get content they really love.  Television is much more a social experience.  You're watching a game with friends, you're watching a movie with your family or friends,  you're using it as a screen for your Wii.  It's just a different type of device and demands different content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not that hard to bring online content onto the screen.  It's how long it's going to take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was watching Studio 40 that I downloaded from the internet on my Xbox 360 on my HDTV  last night.  To me, that seems like a perfect world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But we've got like 80% of our users download rather than streaming.  It's a long format program and about 20-25% actually already are watching on a television  or an HDTV.  One of the biggest demands we get is people want a widescreen version and they want basically  a higher bitrate version that's going to look better on an HDTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's no question we're in a state of flux.  It's kind of hard to predict exactly what's going to happen.  I think you both made good points, but we're going to wrap this up because we're out of  time.  And you know what, Adam?  I think you've got to come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'd love to.  If you could PayPal me another 20 bucks, I'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We got our 20 bucks worth, I'll tell you, even when you convert it to British pounds  or euros or whatever the hell it is you guys use over there.  I'm really glad you could be here.  Of course, Pod Show is Adam's great company and has done so much to help podcasters.  When you say, what did you say?  10,000 podcasts on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  5,000 on the network, 500 are making upfront money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's fantastic.  That's just, you know, that's a great boon for those 500 and for the 5,000.  And of course, anyone's welcome to join.  Daily Source Code is Adam's own podcast.  It has been since practically day one.  I think it's actually the second podcast of all time.  He's the pod father.  Adam, thank you for joining us.  Thank you.  One question, were you wearing the pink jumper?  No, I'm wearing the turquoise jumper, actually.  Thank you.  Very nice.  Of course, the American audience is saying, what is all this about jumpers?  They think you're wearing a muumuu or something.  It's just a sweater, folks.  It's just a sweater.  Thanks to Will Harris.  Bit-Tech.net is his website.  He's the guy who gave us the pink jumper sighting.  And thanks to you, we got Adam on.  And it's great to hear from you as always.  I get more email when you're on than almost anybody else.  People really like hearing the international perspective.  So thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just the British accent.  Nobody likes me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just the accent.  It's true.  We love the accent.  You sound so intelligent, you know.  Bit-Tech.net is a great place to go to read up on a lot of these stories.  And of course, Patrick Norton is the host of DL.TV, as long as Ziff Davis can hold it  together.  But Patrick, you know there's always a home for DLTV no matter where you, you know, whatever  happens.  I don't think that's any question about that.  That's a great show with Robert Heron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Leo, may I thank you for being such a fantastic host.  It's very difficult having been involved with several of these type of roundtable shows.  There's only three guests, but you do a great job at that.  And my wife just creams over your voice.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, while you're busy watching your pay-per-view porn, I might just come over and say hello.  You got a deal, man.  Twenty bucks.  I'll send it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, it really is...  It's a pod show channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It really has been a lot of fun.  I thank you all.  And I'm serious, Adam.  I would love to have you on any time you're interested.  You add considerably to the panel and it's just really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, thank you.  I'd love to.  And the only reason I just haven't hooked it up earlier is because I usually travel  on Saturday and I arrive Sunday and it's midnight where I am.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and million dollars.  You don't get a million miles without doing a considerable amount of time in an airplane.  Whether it's worth 13 or 15 million, it is not that important.  Of course, Will is up.  And let's see.  Let's see, Will.  Now it's...  What is it?  About one in the morning there?  That's it, Tweet.  This week in tech is in the can.  No.  This week in tech.  This week in tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just made my sensei a coffee with my Splenda Flavor Blend, and I'm gonna sign up right  now for a GoDaddy account, and I'm ready!  I love you.  How come you're not in the GoDaddy Super Bowl commercial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My breast size is too small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I noticed there were quite a few women in that.  But he can't make one they'll air yet.  I don't think he's got one yet that they'll air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but you certainly understand them doing that purposely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, and he's sure getting a lot of attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the entire point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I haven't talked to Callie, but I know she was in one of the early ones.  Is she still in the later editions, or is she one of the people's greatest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Callie's commercial was more one of the brand imaging things they're doing where  they want to approach a whole bunch of different markets.  So the whole vibe of GoDaddy is big-chested, all-American bombshell girls.  I know, that's what I look for when I look for a domain registrar.  Well, I'll tell you, it's interesting.  We have, on our homepage is the GoDaddy Girl advertisement, and we've done some surveys,  and lots of people said, well, I saw this picture on the homepage, so I wasn't too sure  what the site was about.  So I clicked it.  I got a little worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
