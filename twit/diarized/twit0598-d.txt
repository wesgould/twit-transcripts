Transcript:  Yeah, it's my job to make sure we have lots of stuff floating around the studio that could kill you.  I notice you're still growing things.  Yes, yeah. Well, growing is a very loose term. I put them into automated devices and I'm kind of wondering how long it will take for them to die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a whole segment of know-how that was called Grow How, and he was showing us how to grow, you know, herbs.  Like herbs.  Like herbs.  Hey, that's Jason Callicannis. Great to see you again, my friend.  Good to be here.  From Inside.com.

Start time: 194.60
End time: 257.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just an experiment. I call it Jasonstxtlist.com, and 1,300 people are on it.  And what I said was, you know, I have 100,000 emails over here. Let me see if any of them want to just get like very personal thoughts over SMS.  The interesting thing is very few people unsubscribe. I have to do something really interesting if I send it.  And...  How many a day do you end up sending?  I send maybe two or three a week.  So it's like a very personal thing that I don't want to deal with shenanigans on Twitter about.  So I kind of privatize my Twitter with my top 1%.  But it is Twitter-like, isn't it?  It's short, but it's 1% of your audience, 100% open rate.  Right.  And it's the most intimate...  Give me an example.  An example.  Well, like today I was talking about...  One, I just let people know that I finished...  I was listening to Shoe Dog and I loved it. And what other books are you interested in?  And then another one was I was just saying, I'm thinking about buying these like modular homes and putting it on a lot somewhere.  And I was wondering if anybody had done a development project.  So it is very much like Twitter.  It is, but it's stuff that I don't necessarily want in the public that the press would pick up on.  Or that would be like a permanent record.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, one to few.  But every time you're here, we have great conversations.  You just told me about John Mayer performing with The Dead and how great that was.  And I watched a video. So I learn a lot every time you're here.  I get some of that value.  It's nice.  I can see why people subscribe to that.  Also here from theregister.co.uk, a good friend, Sir Ian Thompson.  Not quite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I loved Sir Ian McKellen's March in London March yesterday.  Indeed.  And his poster.  And people thought it was shopped, but there were enough images of it that I think it was real.  Was of his good friend, Jean-Luc Picard.

Start time: 294.42
End time: 306.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With his famous face palm.  Face palm.  And that's all. No words.  So he was trolling them.  It was wonderful. I thought it was really...  I saw them in a play together.  Yeah, they're good friends, of course.  Yeah.

Start time: 307.00
End time: 308.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're very good friends.

Start time: 308.00
End time: 316.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They pal around a lot.  Yeah. He's done a lot of interesting work on that one.  I'm sure he was inwardly quite pleased to be carrying this around.  To be able to do that, yeah.

Start time: 317.88
End time: 381.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there was, obviously we don't have to talk around it, on Friday, the really important, peaceful transition of Twitter accounts.  And it didn't go completely smoothly.  Not so much, no.  So just to recap, at POTUS, President of the United States, was created, wasn't it last year?  Of course, President Obama, at the time, was using it.  And always the intent was, and they even said this at the beginning, this is not Obama's account, this is the office's account.  And so the Secret Service said, now Mr. President, would you please start using POTUS?  They took Obama's tweets and moved them to POTUS 44.  Permanent record.  And archived it.  Yeah, he can't tweet any more to it. It's done.  And he can't edit it.  It's done, as it should be.  And I think this is the case of almost everything that goes on in the White House.  It becomes a matter of public record at some point.  But what's interesting is the Secret Service took away Trump's Galaxy phone.  We don't know exactly what kind of Galaxy.  As they did with Obama.  And they gave him some sort of secure phone. We don't know what it is.

Start time: 381.02
End time: 383.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did they really take it away from him or just say, put it in your drawer?

Start time: 384.87
End time: 395.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, with Obama, I think he was really forbidden.  And this is the interesting question.  I mean, you're the president of the United States.  Who can say anything to you?  But I guess the Secret Service probably can.  You know, I'm sure.

Start time: 396.18
End time: 400.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, the people who shadow with guns, it's probably a good idea to listen to them  because their responsibility is to keep you alive.

Start time: 401.48
End time: 417.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Heads of state, be it the president or the pope, always have people who have been in that job longer.  They know all the details and all the dirty parts.  And they get to call the shots, believe it or not.  It's not like being a CEO of a company.  If you're CEO of a company, you really can't do anything within that company.  But like...  Well, he's not the boss.  He's not.

Start time: 418.02
End time: 422.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He works for us.  Yes.  Yes.  And I think that becomes very clear at some point.  Right.

Start time: 423.00
End time: 462.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, if you look at Saturday versus Friday, Friday was the inauguration.  Saturday was the Women's March.  I mean, I think the fifth largest Women's March was bigger than the inauguration crowd.  Right.  So and that occurred across the country.  What's very interesting about the Trump situation is, you know, one of the big concerns with Trump is that his brand and his name are one in the same.  He has all these hotels and obviously is double dealing and all kinds of, you know, real estate projects around the world that he is going to benefit from from being president.  And he hasn't put everything in a blind trust.  He's got it in his son's trust.  Although that's pretty close to being blind in my mind.  Actually, he's done nothing.  He said he was going to do all this.  No, I meant his...  He's done nothing.  None of it.

Start time: 463.00
End time: 463.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  However, but let's stick to the tech on this.

Start time: 464.12
End time: 493.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, on the tech, he is going to gain at least 20, maybe 50 million followers.  You talked to us on the CNBC.  Yeah, and that's worth a dollar or two dollars each.  There is a quantifiable value to Twitter followers.  When marketers pay for Twitter followers, there is a way in the ad network.  A multiple.  You can just say, I want to gain followers.  I'm willing to pay a dollar.  I'm willing to pay two dollars.  So when he gains 20, 30, 40 million people, he's going to be making, let's say, 20 to 100 million dollar asset, which when he gets out of office...  But he can't take at POTUS with him.

Start time: 493.57
End time: 503.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so this is one of the interesting things.  I was told that along with taking the phone, they said, and Mr. President, you must now tweet at POTUS and not real Donald Trump.

Start time: 503.00
End time: 503.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not happened.

Start time: 504.35
End time: 529.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that did not happen.  That's not going to happen.  It did not happen.  So he continues to tweet at both, although at POTUS, which has 14.2 million followers, seems to be the kind of tweets that came during the campaign from the iPhone, during the day, the staffer tweets.  Because there's no spelling errors, right?  Well, there was a spelling error on this one originally.  I am honored to serve you was spelled with an E-R.

Start time: 530.27
End time: 538.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, wait a second.  But fixed.  Is he... So does that mean he actually is the president is literally writing his own tweets?  Or the people who work for him are incapable of using spellcheck?

Start time: 539.88
End time: 542.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say that any tweets that he writes will be signed DT.

Start time: 543.14
End time: 555.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think that's true.  I'm looking at real Donald Trump.  I see no signature at all.  No, no, no, only on the POTUS account.  So on the POTUS account, if there's anything that actually comes from him, it will be signed DT.  Is it to be presumed that real Donald Trump then these are his tweets?

Start time: 555.08
End time: 562.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, then there was some somewhere he said that he would read them out to a staffer and they would write them.  But then it's like you have a staffer there at 3 a.m.

Start time: 563.76
End time: 581.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and does this new phone, because remember when Obama got a phone in 2013, a couple of years ago, he complained on The Tonight Show.  It doesn't play music.  It doesn't take pictures.  It doesn't do any of the things a normal smartphone would do.  He said, it's your child.  It's a kid. It's a play phone.  Yeah.  I would be surprised if it would tweet.

Start time: 583.08
End time: 586.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would go to browser on that.  You can access Twitter.  Well, it does not have a browser.

Start time: 587.20
End time: 588.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do not believe it has a browser.

Start time: 589.10
End time: 593.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A device that's designed for secure communication should never touch an insecure network.  Precisely.

Start time: 594.30
End time: 626.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's that's so it doesn't go on the public Internet or if it does, it goes through a filter that makes sure that he's not getting phoned, whatever.  So I just I wonder maybe he did keep the galaxy in a drawer and he's pulling it out.  I don't know what's going on.  But clearly he's still tweeting in on real Donald Trump, which has considerably more followers, 21 and a half million followers.  There was also a little kerfuffle because for a while and Twitter says it was about 50,000 people were auto followed to at POTUS.  It was more than 50,000.  Well, Twitter said it was 50.  It seemed like it must have been more.

Start time: 627.10
End time: 637.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because when they moved over the account, POTUS had 14.5 million.  It had dropped to under under 14 million.  Then it went up to 14.5.  Then it went down to 14.1.  Now it's stabilized at 14.2.

Start time: 638.12
End time: 652.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because people were unsubscribing in anticipation of Trump taking it.  Right.  Therefore, when they did the migration, some of those people who had unsubscribed were resubscribed.  Also known as no big deal.  NBD. Right.  Well, it's a button you could push.

Start time: 653.22
End time: 662.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  They were replaying the script.  They were going back to a backup.  OK.  Moving all the tweets and then saying, OK, we're going to replay.  It took a while to replay that script.  Jack Dorsey apologized.

Start time: 663.14
End time: 665.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know.  It wasn't intentional in other words.

Start time: 665.08
End time: 665.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And who cares?

Start time: 666.68
End time: 675.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I would care if Twitter were throwing its hat in the ring and saying, well, you  all ought to follow Donald Trump.  Right.  But it was people who had previously.

Start time: 675.02
End time: 686.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it was just an accident.  Yeah.  It's just an accident.  I mean, people are so quick on Twitter and in other places to sort of ascribe some sort  of agenda.  But in fact, almost all of Twitter's behavior comes out of just their utter incompetence.  Right?

Start time: 687.00
End time: 691.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there anybody left at Twitter?  They've lost, what, eight or nine of the top executives?  They've lost everybody.

Start time: 691.02
End time: 701.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've lost everybody.  And if you have a half time CEO, and listen, Jack's a friend of mine, or an acquaintance  slash friend of mine, I consider him, we're friendly.  I don't want to be critical of Jack, but it is a horrible idea to.

Start time: 702.00
End time: 704.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because somebody's going to tweet him if you say anything bad.  Well, anyway, whatever.

Start time: 705.00
End time: 709.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, he knows my position, which is a half time CEO of a troubled company.

Start time: 710.26
End time: 713.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So he doesn't really step down at Square.  He's still running Square.

Start time: 713.20
End time: 720.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And now we're six quarters in.  I mean, I think the half time CEO experiment is going to end in the next 60 to, you know,  whatever, 180 days.

Start time: 721.00
End time: 727.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The board's transformed too, though, right?  It's not the same board.  They transferred some of the board, but you know.  Isn't that who would then force Jack to step down?

Start time: 727.36
End time: 734.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, you know, again, the incompetence level on the board as well is just so bad.  Like, it's really run improperly.

Start time: 735.00
End time: 742.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happens to Twitter?  I mean, clearly we just spent 20 minutes talking about the president's Twitter account.  It's clearly an important medium.

Start time: 742.30
End time: 749.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's important, but the only way to keep Twitter as an important medium is to basically guarantee  that it's never profitable.

Start time: 749.37
End time: 760.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's a problem.  This is a thing.  It's going to get bought up by a bunch of venture capitalists.  Should it be a nonprofit?  And who are going to try and run it at a profit and kill it is the way I see it.  Should it be a nonprofit?  It should be a nonprofit.

Start time: 761.00
End time: 764.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What would you liken this to?  A public utility?

Start time: 764.20
End time: 778.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is like PBS back in the day.  It was an important public service.  Actually, even way more important than PBS.  And it needs to stay free.  It needs to stay more or less free flowing.  The minute that someone figures out a really good way to monetize Twitter, it's no longer Twitter.  There is a security concern.

Start time: 779.10
End time: 788.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody just raised this.  What happens when North Korea hacks the president's account and starts tweeting?  And could they even create a war?  No.

Start time: 789.00
End time: 791.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do people pay enough attention to this?  We've seen this before with the Syrian Electronic Army.

Start time: 792.99
End time: 803.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They got hold of, it was AP's tweet.  They put out there was going to be a bomb attack in the White House.  You got a flash crash and it was straight back up again within a few minutes.  People understand.  We can be convenient.

Start time: 803.00
End time: 805.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think people understand that it can be hacked.  We have a pretty educated population.

Start time: 806.36
End time: 812.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Trump's tweets, he's caused Boeing, Lockheed.  He's caused a lot of companies some real value.  That's the bigger thing.

Start time: 813.06
End time: 816.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Someone hacks the account and then they sell short on a company that they have the account.

Start time: 817.06
End time: 829.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's really interesting about the Lockheed case is if you look at the pattern of share traffic,  the Lockheed share price started to drop sharply about five minutes before that tweet went out.  That was very suspicious of interesting questions.

Start time: 830.00
End time: 877.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll get caught real quick.  I mean, the thing is fascinating.  Inside of trading is hard to get away with, right?  I think it pretty.  They know who bought the stock.  Yeah.  The only thing you can really do is like take a long term view.  So, okay, I'm going to load up on Twitter because I know it's going to get acquired and I'm going to take a long view.  But it's very hard to trade on that information.  Now, what's interesting about Twitter, I think, is never before have we had as polarizing a politician as Trump.  I mean, maybe Nixon.  I don't know when the last time it was this polarized.  Nixon's pretty close.  Pretty close.  I wasn't alive during it.  So here's the thing.  If Twitter can't grow meaningfully when the president of the United States is using it to start like and create chaos, when will they ever be able to grow?  Well, I think they can't capitalize on this.  If we had Ashton Kutcher, we'd be big.

Start time: 878.00
End time: 879.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You see, my worry isn't the president's going to use this.

Start time: 880.08
End time: 894.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They can't capitalize on it.  It's crazy.  My worry isn't the president's going to use this.  My worry is that somebody with access to that Twitter feed is going to use it and just ride on his coattails to do some kind of dodgy stuff.  Because Trump's honestly, I don't think going to risk the presidency on something as stupid as a little bit inside of trading.

Start time: 895.64
End time: 908.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do have to say a lot of people were, I noticed a lot of people in my various feeds were saying, were wanting to watch the march yesterday and watched on Twitter.  Yeah.  So there is a use case for live Twitter.

Start time: 909.08
End time: 934.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter is an incredibly successful company that has been mismanaged for the last couple of years.  It hasn't been managed for growth and it's just gone sideways.  And you just, you, these companies are so competitive.  If you look at how Zuckerberg runs his company, he is so competitive that to be halftime CEO, it just doesn't work.  It just doesn't work.  And we, I mean, I've been saying it from the beginning.  Everybody else has been saying it.  It was a mistake and you look square.  What's going wrong at Twitter?

Start time: 935.38
End time: 937.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They just can't monetize?

Start time: 937.73
End time: 963.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they have plenty of revenue.  They can't grow.  The product is not getting easier to use.  And they're focused.  There's no product cadence.  What product cadence means in the technology space is that on a regular basis, you're getting nice updates.  You see, you know, Facebook runs their FA conference.  They run a regular, you see regular updates with their products.  Microsoft, Google, everybody's got regular updates.  You don't get that sense as a Twitter user.  There's any kind of rhyme or reason.

Start time: 964.00
End time: 967.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's never a new invitation for a new generation of users or new generation of developers.

Start time: 968.46
End time: 998.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they've got a very mature marketplace and there's a limited number of people who are now looking to sign on to increase their numbers growth.  So they've got a real problem.  And every time they try and muck around with the actual service, the users throw up a complete stink.  And they either back down or they wind it down.  I mean, Facebook used to do this.  They'd institute a change.  The users would go, this is the worst thing ever.  And then they started off rolling it back and then they just decided, hell with it.  We're going to do it anyway.  And they can either go away or they can come along with us.  And they come along with you in Facebook, by and large.

Start time: 999.04
End time: 1007.90

So if you look at AOL or Yahoo, I mean, these brands still exist even today, even though they haven't done anything innovative in a decade.  So it's going to it'll stick around.

And the only problem is Jack has, I think, a little bit of a strong grip on the board and he wants to keep going.  He wants to keep innovating.  It's an ego thing for him.  He's the founder.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, people who were involved sold their shares to Chris Saka, who ran syndicates of secondary shares all the way up.  So that's how Chris Saka made all his money.  And he'll make his future thing on the Uber bet.  But at the time, what he did was he put a pool of capital together, went to them and said, anybody who's an ex-employee, I'll buy your shares or current employee so you can get some liquidity and buy a house.  That's when it was a billion dollar company, two billion dollar company.  It ran all the way up to a 45 billion dollar company.  So a lot of people got rich.

I know this sounds crazy for somebody to create another social network that is based on privacy.  What?  And it's not we're not done.  No, no.  Listen, Google was the 12 search engine, right?  Or 13 search engine.  So there's always an opportunity.  I think that somebody could create a Twitter competitor if they did it based on mobile first and based in the same way signal is, you know, encrypted and secure.  Would you have verified users?  I think you could go one of two ways.  You can go only verified to be on the system so you get better behavior or you could go complete free for all.  We don't control anything.  It's more like BitTorrent or it's a little bit more open and nobody controls.  Why can't you combine those?  Don't you fix most of the troll problem if everybody was verified?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. They did say we're going to open it up to everybody.  You can request it.  So I was right again.  And it's easy to be right when you people are feeding you information.  But yeah, it's definitely I think eventually will happen as the default on Twitter will be verified people.  So after a certain number of people tip over, they'll say your experience is verified.  And what I asked Jack to do and when I told Twitter they should do is when somebody has a flag on their account,  too many complaints like a Milo or something, when they come up and they want to harass you and they're like, hey, Leo, hey, Padre, you know,  and it just should come up blurred and it should say unverified user or controversial user.  It should be blurred. And then you it says click to reveal.  You click to reveal it and it automatically has a box there.  Block, you know, or report.  So you're basically saying you can get put in the penalty box if too many people complain.  And the cost of being the penalty box is your tweets are blurred.  Then you have to approve people say in the future, I'll let this person tweet.

Start time: 1258.20
End time: 1272.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think that solves the problem is that solves one part of the problem, which is you don't want to see trolls.  But trolls can do you damage by the tweets that they say to other people.  They can damage you. And that doesn't change that situation at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if enough let's say there's a triggering mechanism, a thousand people who are qualified, verify people say this person is horrible,  then maybe they just move to every tweet they do is it's a tough thing to solve.

We'll get to it in just a moment.  But first, let's have snacks. It's snack time. We don't want to do it early today.  Nature Box. They've been our snack provider since 2010.  We love Nature Box. What do you do when you want a snack?  But all you can find is crap junk food.  Self control, right? That works. Resist temptation.  No, please. I've heard it. Never did it.  You what do you do? You eat the crap.  Here's what you do. Instead, you have Nature Box handy ready and you're going to have wonderful snacks that taste great.  They fulfill your need. Look at that Big Island pineapple.  That is the best dried fruit in the history of the world.  It's chewy and delicious and garlic plantains. What the what?  Cranberry, almond bites, whole wheat, raspberry figgy bars.  I'll never forget the day. Sarah Lane ate an entire bag of those.  Mini Belgian waffles. Oh, I love those. Those are really, really good.  They have the high quality ingredients. Yeah, the sriracha.  Free from artificial colors, flavors or sweeteners.  They've just if you've tried Nature Box before, they've changed it a little bit.  And this is what I've wanted. You can order as much as you want as often as you want.  So they used to be a subscription. You get a box.  You'd have to it was complicated to get more now.  But no, no minimum purchase. Cancel any time. Get as much as you want.  There are over 100 snacks. They always are refining it.  Always improving it based on you know, they've got a lot of data.  They know what people like.  But one of the reasons is you can return a snack if you don't like it and they'll replace it for free.  That's that's that's their research. No risk. No risk.  Zero. Toasted sesame sticks.  And you could get those. Yeah, sure. You go to the store and get them.  They're not as good. They're not as good.  It's not as convenient. Well, you don't want to think about the sea salt pop pops.  Oh, yum yum. Okay, stop. Stop showing. Stop showing.  Vinegar, veggies.  Choose the snacks you want at naturebox.com slash twit.  We're going to give you 50 percent off your first order right now.  Oh, come on. Now what's holding you back?  naturebox.com slash twit 50 percent off your first order.  We thank naturebox for their longtime support.  They've been keeping us as snacks forever.  Naturebox. So this is just a rumor.  This has not yet been confirmed by the Trump administration.  But there are several sources have reported to Politico that one of the current commissioners of the FCC, Ajit Pai,  Yes, will become chairman of the FCC.  As you know, the FCC was told, don't make any more rules till the new administration comes in.  It is up to the president to appoint the new commissioners half have to be Republican, half Democratic.  We all already know that Tom Wheeler, who was an Obama appointee, is gone.  And Ajit Pai is an interesting choice because he is already a commissioner.  He does not need Senate approval. He can go right into the work.  He was already confirmed. Now that's just for the term.  He would have to be reconfirmed when the new term comes up.  Pai was a nominee by Obama. He is a Republican.  He's in fact, he's a senior FCC Republican.  But here's the thing that I find interesting.  He is a rabid anti-net neutrality, a fierce critic of net neutrality, of many regulations that the commission has passed over the last few years,  not just net neutrality, but a lot more.  He will at least be acting chairman, I think.  And we'll see if he becomes a more permanent chairman.  But this has always been on the Trump plan to get rid of regulation.  And in particular, the net neutrality regulation.

Start time: 1543.67
End time: 1566.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it basically just about wraps it up for net neutrality at the moment.  Because if you read what this guy has been writing for the last three or four years,  and the talks he gives to various think tanks about the way, net neutrality is out.  Any kind of laws against conglomeration of broadband ownership, they're out.  Of course, if you're trying to set up your own municipal network, that's out as well because he's not a big fan of those.  It has to be done by a corporate thing.

Transcript:  It goes back to the 86 Cable Act.  So in the 86 Cable Act, in order to entice companies to come in and actually deploy,  they basically said, we're going to give you the rights to set up connectivity across a municipality.  However, there is a clause in there. It is part of the bill.  It's not just an interpretation that says it needs to be for the betterment of the community.  Unfortunately, it's so vaguely written that you can argue that locking you out of a faster connection is serving the betterment of the community.  But, you know, looking at looking at this whole thing, the net neutrality, the interesting part here is, yes, they could roll it back.  They could get rid of the regulation.  However, the hard part of setting up net neutrality the way that we had it under Wheeler was the reclassification.  And it was the argument of whether or not that should be allowed.  Even if they roll back the regulation, when the next administration comes across, if they are friendly to the net neutrality regulations, it's not going to be an eight year fight.  It's going to be a two month fight because they're going to say the president is already there, that this is possible.  We can reclassify. And once we have the votes, we do.  So this ultimately is Congress. Ultimately, it's Congress. No matter what that hard part was already done.

Transcript:  Here's what here's what pie he wrote in September.  He wrote a digital empowerment agenda.  So I'm just curious. We'll go through these points.  There's four points. What do you think?  First, I mean, some of this, I'd say great gigabit opportunity zones to bring broadband and digital opportunity to their most economically challenged areas, create these zones that would incentivize broadband deployment, spur local governments to streamline regulations, help job creators, in other words, help business revitalize neighborhoods.  Any area where the average household income is below seventy five percent of the national median would qualify.  State and local lawmakers would adopt streamlined broadband deployment friendly policies.  Probably that's a euphemism. Yeah.  Significant tax incentives.  Entrepreneurs instead advise to create jobs in these zones through a tax credit.  Sounds like a good thing, right?  Can't argue against that.  Mobile broadband for rural America.  I mean, this is one of the things we've called for for a long time.  It's clear that businesses, one of the problems, of course, in this country is that a business is less incentivized to provide Internet to a very low density population, a rural population.  There's not enough money to be made.  So we've got to do something, in my opinion, like the rural electrification programs of the depression.  They did that to bring electricity to areas that would not be powered.  Let's bring broadband that way.  He proposes increase the build out obligations of wireless carriers and incentivize rural broadband investment by extending license terms up to 15 years.  Move forward with a mobility fund phase two that includes tech neutral performance metrics, eliminates duplicative support.  I don't even know what we're talking about. Maintain support where it's needed.  Subsidizes the deployment of new networks.  Create a rural dividend.  So basically incentives.

Transcript:  This is a copy of the plan they tried to implement in the early 2000s when they gave the telco industry $200 billion to build out rural Internet.  And how did that work?  Never happened. Exactly.  So if they want to do it again, I'm fine.  There has to be stronger language that says you only get the money if you actually do it.

You know, and there's one web, I think is the other one that's doing it.  We're trying to do it.  Essentially, it's like a pizza box size dish you put anywhere.  Right. And then, boom, you're all set up.  And that's going to be here in two or three years, I think.  And when that happens, you know, I think we're going to see we definitely need some disruption.  It's going to be very disruptive because all this the whole concept of like, you know, upstate New York or some rural place, Montana, it's going to have gigabit over satellite.  So there's not and there's going to be multiple providers doing this.  That's going to be the key.  And RadyM just put up a bunch of satellites in the last SpaceX launch.  So you're going to have multiple people putting up arrays of Internet from this, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If, as you say, the companies take this money and actually do this, take these incentives, the tax credits.  He has things like he doesn't.  Government officials, I think this is great, should adopt a dig once policy so that whenever you do a highway or road construction project, you'll lay conduit for broadband.  That makes a lot of sense.  I think a lot of this makes sense.  Maybe it's time to try another approach.

Start time: 1939.04

One of the really astounding things about moving to this country, because America is built as the home of competition and the free market, the cut and thrust of free market capitalism, you've got one of the most monopolized, duopolized markets in the world for things like telecommunications, for healthcare.  Yeah, it's wacky.  It's not even close to being a free market.  And that's why you need to have someone in there as an arbiter of things saying, right, if we're going to have a proper free market, you can't manipulate markets in this way.

And that is to protect and expand the act that they passed the week after net neutrality that got so little play.  And that was that opened up the polls.  It made it much easier for a non incumbent to come in and deploy broadband.  Right.  If they expand that, because it's been challenged by 18 very heavily challenged if they uphold that, and they allow a sonic dotnet to come in and use less than $5,000 per house because that's the number the CEO of Sonic quoted.  He said, whether or not we're running to a house, it costs us $5,000 per house in San Francisco to run.  If they can reduce that significantly to even $500 a house, then suddenly you do have competition.

Transcript:  And one of the interesting things I've seen, I've gotten this proposal a bunch of times as an angel investor is people doing crowdfunding for fiber.  So you have a provider who says, hey, I want to put this in a building.  And they say, yeah, just get us 15 people in your building to say, yes, we'll run the fiber.  Right.  And then people at some buildings now are putting their own Internet into the building as a way to draw people to the building.  So if you want to sell in a luxury building now to millennials, you just basically get a huge fiber connection.  You say we give Wi-Fi up to this amount for $10 a month or included.  And then you can actually get fiber in Germany.

It's just he promised X or he promised X, Y and Z.  And here's how he's tracking against that promise.  This is your model for inside.

That's one of our fastest growing.  It's got twelve thousand emails on it.  It's just about AI and machine learning twice a week.  A friend of mine.  So do you just hire one person for each newsletter to do?  Yeah, a full time person can do two to three newsletters if they're two to three.  It basically takes five, six, seven hours to do a great newsletters.  Some most are twice a week, sometimes three and then some we're doing twice a day.  So the idea is just to make you smarter.

Transcript:  And that's what we're trying to do here is like basically curate that and say,  curation.  Just, you know, here's the top 10 stories about Facebook in the last four days.  If you were involved in Facebook in some way as a stakeholder, read it.  But we will only need you to sign up for two or three.  You don't have to sign up for 50.  Just two.  Just pick a couple.  Three.  That's all. It's free, right?  Yeah, it's free.  It's going to be classified and then eventually patronage based.  We're building the CMS now.  So eventually one percent of people will be able to pay or two percent will be able to pay as a thank you patronage is  I think it is your patron or you actually doing.  No, we've done some tests on Patreon.  I think we're going to build it into our build our own system.  OK.  You know, my my whole playbook is to build the CMS and make a whole machine.  So when you do it for one newsletter, you establish a best practice like we did for Weblogs Inc.  We had a best practice ring gadget that then went over to auto blog and joystick.  So if we establish a best practice on inside Trump, then it goes right to the AI newsletter and the drones  newsletter and everything else.  OK.  But you have to figure it out.  So it's still hard.  And finally, Ian.

You're a sole proprietor, a small business maybe.  Can you tell me if 2016 was profitable?  Are you in profit right now?  Usually you don't know that until you do your taxes.  Like once a year you go, ah, now I know.  How did I do?  You lost money.  FreshBooks, you know all the time, their new dashboard.  This is brand new, redesigned.  Knows what invoices you're out, what invoices have been paid, what your expenses are, what  your profit is, and you can see it at every moment.  You know how you're doing without any accounting.  Now of course they have the accounting reports.  Here we come to tax time.  Sales, tax, summary, profit and loss, all the stuff your accountant wants they can do.  But that's kind of behind the scenes.  It's done automatically and you just do what you would normally do.  You invoice people.  And by the way, it's a lot easier to invoice people than it used to be.  I used to fire up Microsoft Word and Excel and then I have to figure out.  The invoicing is the best piece.  Oh, well that's how they started, right?  And that's how I started using it.  Yeah, invoicing is so good.  Twelve years ago I started using it.

Did you know that invoicing clients online, the kind of invoices you do at FreshBus will  get you paid an average of 11 days faster?  That's because it's easy for the clients to pay.  There's even a pay me button right on there.  You can see what invoices have been sent, what viewed.  Yes, viewed.  You can tell if they've read the invoice.  You'll know immediately.  So when they try that, I didn't get your invoice.  No, you can say, no, no, you read it.  I saw it.  And of course, when you've been paid as well as overdue and outstanding invoices, it's  easy to brand the invoices, set recurring invoices, set auto payment reminders, even  automatic late fees.  It's just the easiest way to keep track of the business.  Time tracking too.  Yeah.

Apple engineer says Tim Cook is more rigid, less competitive than Steve Jobs was.  I don't know.  Can you trust these former Apple engineer?  At least he's he's doing it by name on CNBC.  Bob Burrow.  He said in 2007, four years before Steve's death, Apple was organizationally the wild  west.  But this is in response.  This is, you know, kind of a follow up to his tweets saying the jobs era company was  thin, competitive and dynamic.  He says under Tim Cook, rigid, not competitive.  Tony Fidel denied it.  He said wrong.  Wrong.  There was a new MacBook Pro.

Start time: 2717.08
End time: 2743.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to say there's only one product Apple's come out with in the last year that I think  is worth talking about.  Maybe the iPhone 7, but the AirPods are probably the only thing that is really a classic Apple  product, where it's kind of a beautiful design, highly functional, overpriced, easy to lose.  But I think it is design wise, very impressive.  Apple 7 is pretty good.

Start time: 2743.56
End time: 2762.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They look great, but it's the implementation of it.  You know, I mean, it's like Apple has always built good looking products with very few  exceptions.  But at the moment, they're just treading water and they seem to have been for the last couple  of years.  And I don't get why they've stalled quite as bad as they have.  It's hard.

Start time: 2763.36

Start time: 2780.70
End time: 2796.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Obviously, he would admit that he does not inspire people to the way Steve Jobs does.  So they're just going through this dark era.  And at some point, Tim's going to have to find somebody who can then come out with this  next level of products that is inspiring.  They're not inspiring people, and in fact, they're frustrating people.

Start time: 2797.60
End time: 2819.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just take issue with someone saying that, oh, it was the Wild West and it was so much  better back then.  That's nostalgia.  Because one of the things, actually, I'd say this is even more important than the design  cues because there was a lot of companies out there making beautiful stuff.  But Apple built this juggernaut, this behind the scenes juggernaut of a supply chain.  And it destroyed everybody.  Because it was the combination.

Start time: 2819.72
End time: 2888.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You had to have a product to sell.  So if Tim Cook was given a bunch of Nokia phones for Zooms, it's not going to help.  So what Tim's done well, and he deserves credit for, is he has massively ranked the cash register.  The level of efficiency, the amount of cash they have, it's all flawless, which you would  expect.  But at some point, they're going to need somebody in there who can actually be the arbiter of  beauty and design and take risk.  They have no iPhone-like product in the pipeline that anybody knows about.  The only possibility is AR glasses.  But the MacBook is a disaster.  The watch is a disaster.  I think that's their next attempt.  I mean, that's got to be the next attempt is the AR glasses.  The other possibility is with Johnny Iovine there.  I'm sorry.  Is Johnny there?  No, he's not.  Johnny Iovine, I think, is gone.  Jimmy Iovine, I think, has got this possibility of creating a Netflix-like service.  And what I've been pushing them to do is to create their own version of Prime, which is  put iCloud with music, with some sort of video rental, and with AppleCare.

Start time: 2888.58
End time: 2907.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although I have to say, would you have said the same thing before Bezos was so successful  with Prime?  Because on the surface, Prime looks like this hodgepodge of unrelated services.  Here's the thing.  Like, here's my basket of crap.  Yeah.  It's $299.  Right?  Before it happened, I would have said that's not a bad name.

Start time: 2907.24
End time: 2924.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two-day delivery was compelling for a large number of people.  Video becomes icing.  Music becomes icing.  It's all icing.  You have to realize, Apple now has iCloud.  They figure it out.  And they launch music.  I never was an AppleCare guy.  But I would, yeah, if you throw in AppleCare, maybe.  But music is intriguing, but not enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you look at House of Cards, a lot of that was data mined.  Because they found out that people that liked Kevin Spacey also liked films done by the  director of House of Cards.  And they liked political dramas.  So they thought, right, okay, we'll do a political drama with Kevin Spacey and a director by  this guy.

Start time: 2968.62
End time: 3016.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It didn't work that way, though, because what happened was Dana Brunetti and Kevin Spacey,  Trigger Street, put together House of Cards, shopped it, and I think it was, had a good  offer from a cable network, probably HBO.  And Brunetti told me this on the night before they made the deal with HBO, or he never did  tell me who the cable company was, but I have to presume, he got a call from Netflix who  said, hold on, we'd like to offer you $100 million.  And they said a few things that Brunetti liked and Spacey liked, one of which is you can  launch the whole season at once.  And for some reason, they really liked that.  They loved that binge thing.  It's the game changer.  Well, but you know, I don't understand, because it seems to me that's a negative, because  look at the shows that come out once a week, like Game of Thrones, which is coming back  in three months.  You get this whole week of blog posts and newspaper articles and magazine articles.

And they made the deal and they're obviously very happy.  Season four or five, I think it's coming five.

You don't you don't have to do a whole lot of exposition saying now you may remember  last week all of this happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the main problem.  When you're NBC and CBS and ABC and I've had to deal with this of late, you have to wait  for a show to come off air for your show to get slotted in.  You're in a holding pattern.  If Netflix wants to put out five Game of Thrones or two more whatever House of Cards, they don't  have to wait for anybody.  They just put it out.  And they don't have to appease the lowest common denominator.  They can put out a show they know appeals to women, to men.  They don't need to get a hundred million viewers.  They don't need to.  They can make this work, which means the artists are happier.

Transcript:  Well, here's the thing.  Netflix is making over $2 billion a quarter.  They're spending $6 billion on content.  The content issue doesn't take a genius to say that 70% of their money is going to content,  which is extraordinary.  But then you have to think about the fact that they're going to own that content forever.  Yeah.  Well, not always.  They can continue to monetize it.

Transcript:  So it's also something that was making a virtue out of necessity because Netflix was having  trouble just as Apple is making deals with Hollywood to get these shows on streaming.  Hollywood said, you don't have the DVD, but you're not putting our first run movie on  streaming and they were getting more and more crap.  Now nobody cares what's on Netflix.  It's a bonus.

If you got accepted to Sundance, they gave you a hundred thousand dollar offer for the  streaming rights.  Chicken Feet.  Well, here's the thing.  Chicken Feet.  It is Chicken Feet for the top third of movies at Sundance.  The bottom half of movies at Sundance don't get paid.  They literally do not get sold or they get sold for 25k.  So it's a massive payday.  So this is just like coming in and being like, you know what, we'll take everything and showing  a massive amount of support for new directors and they'll pick up, I think, a dozen or two  dozen films this way.

Just get your net out.  And yeah, you're going to own a lot of really bad content.  But that one series that takes off, it's going to be a cash cow for the next 10 years.

So if you buy an iPhone or an iPad, it could come with the first year of Apple Music or  Apple Entertainment, let's call it, or Apple Now, whatever we're going to call it.  Apple Entertainment.  If Apple Entertainment came for a year with any device, I mean, what an amazing offering  that would be if they wound up hitting their own Game of Thrones or their own house of  cards.  You'd be like, oh, when I get the device, I can watch this TV show.  This is rad.

So if they're making 25 billion on services, they can f around and put five billion towards  this and be spending just as much as Netflix and then just add it to the service package.

The more Apple innovates with unique features like touch ID, advanced displays,  owners, owners, cameras, just to name a few.  The more money Qualcomm collects for no reasons.  Well, that's how royalties work.  And the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations.  Qualcomm builds its business on older legacy standards, but reinforces its dominance  through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties.

Anyway, the story maybe they did have a leak is that the batteries in the iPhone,  I'm sorry, the Note 7 were irregularly sized.  And so some of the notes, this is why not all, but some of the Note 7s became  explosive because the batteries were, I guess, too big.

I've heard that it was the software problem.  It's just, this is what they're going to tell us the problem was.  The big thing is, can they actually make it right next time around?  They have to.  They've got the S8.  They'll get it right.

Cost the company five billion.  Which is nothing for a company that makes 300.  So they'll easily get through it.

And all of a sudden they're in blue and they can't see any of the,  No, they're left out.  They're blue, blue bubbles.  Well, and he'd literally changed his phone back because of iMessage.

Why doesn't Apple do this with iMessage and just put it on every platform?  It's because of that stickiness.  You just described the stickiness.  For that reason, it sells iPhones.  But just think about how they might be, but it would be a bold move to try to  pull people back.

Transcript:  Thanks, Leo.  Here is a look at just a few things that we're going to be following in the coming  week.  Later on tonight, actually, don't have to wait very long for this.  Samsung is going to reveal its findings as to why the Note 7's batteries were so  explosive.  Samsung reportedly enlisted the help of three independent agencies to examine the  cause, which led the company to recall millions of units late last year.  And we're going to find out what that reason is.  On Tuesday, January 24th, Samsung again is expected to have some good news during  its earning report, despite its ongoing Note 7 issues with record profits for Q  4, thanks to its chip business that is reportedly offsetting its losses in the  mobile division.  On Thursday, January 26th, Microsoft and Alphabet are just a few who are set to  release their earnings report numbers.  Alphabet beat expectations for Q 3, which puts pressure on the company to continue  that progress, especially in light of its new crop of hardware offerings, the  Pixel device and all of its other stuff that hit the market in October.  Megan Moroney and I will cover all of this and a whole lot more as it pops up on  Tech News today, each and every weekday at 4 p.m.  Pacific. That is a look at the week ahead.  Back to you, Leo.

One of the things I found,  because I've tested out a lot of smartwatches  and I've never yet found one that I would actually spend my own money for.  Because they make you incredibly rude.  Every time your wrist vibrates, instinctively you look at it.  People say you're less rude because you're not looking at your phone as much.  But if you're in a conversation with somebody  and you're looking at your watch,  you're basically saying, I'm bored with you.  I've got other things to do.  Why are you still here?  And it just makes you automatically rude.

Transcript:  You know what?  It's very interesting you bring this up  because I am writing a series of protocols for meetings.  Because people don't know how to take meetings anymore,  especially millennials, etc.  Now, I set my clock.  I say, I have 25 minutes.  I'm going to set a 25 minute timer.  It'll go off.  We can wrap up.  I'm just going to put my phone down  and then I take out my pen and paper.  And then I have some knucklehead millennial come in.  They've opened their laptop up.  They've got eight windows open and they're in the meeting typing.  And I said, whoa, time out.  Especially if they work for me.  I said, do not show up for a meeting unless I explicitly tell you to have your laptop.  Do not show up with a laptop.  Pen and paper.  Pay attention.  Keep it short.  We're not here to do group email.  That's like this.  I was about to say something.

That's the first thing you do.  Okay.  I can see that.  Yeah.  You got to have a good elevator pitch and the two pizza rule.  You should never have a meeting that is bigger than two pizzas would feed.  That's a good one.  So that's two people.  But he never has pizza at these meetings.  It depends.

Something you won't have to do once the AR is popular.  Whether or not people come in, there's a magic leap of the new Theranos when it comes to this  sort of thing, because we've seen so much hype and we were talking earlier about Apple getting  into the AR game and Microsoft's been talking about these low cost AR devices, which are  apparently coming down the line at some point.  There's going to be so much hype and so much rubbish out there.  I mean, I've tried HoloLens.  It's good, but it's not game changingly good.  You could see it.  Yeah, you could see it.

Transcript:  I mean, version three of that.  Version one and two, fascinating.  Version three of that is going to be game changer.  The thing that's interesting about Magic Leap is, one, the company's from Florida,  which I never trusted companies from Florida.  That's just...  Yeah, how can you come up with a good idea?  No, but it's also like every company in Florida seems to be a little full-gazy.  Anyway, putting that aside, from what I understand, they sold people on the technology.  They sold people on the technology by showing them a box that was an oversized box and they  were like, yeah, we're going to be able to get this down to glass size.  And they never have.  And they have and to date, so you have this one group of people, like I think Andreessen  Horowitz people are like, it's the greatest thing ever.  But then none of us have seen it except all the people who are proponents of it are the investors.  Starting to sound a little familiar.  Yeah.

But we are at least 10 years away from making that happen.  And I thought that was very honest and upfront to them.  But for a company to say, no, no, we can make it happen in the next two years.

Our show today brought to you by my sheets.  Slept on by three former US presidents.  Maybe even by a current US president.  So luxurious.  These are the greatest.  They are the best sheets made from 100% organic cotton.  And you're going to say, what's the thread count, Leon?  I'm going to say, I don't care.  It's not about thread count.  In fact, I've had terrible sheets with a very high thread count.  That is kind of a red herring.  Bogus metric.  It's bogus.  What you should check is the cotton.  Is it soft?  Where does it come from?  Bolin Branch uses sustainable and responsibly sourced cotton.  Responsibly manufactured.  The softest cotton.  It's incredible.  It's organic.  And they get softer over time.  And I tell you, I've bought really nice expensive sheets that never softened.  They felt like I was crispy the whole time.  Itchy.  Not Bolin Branch.  They're nice.  They donate a portion of every sale to help fight human trafficking.  They really want to make a socially responsible product.  Look at that box.  Wait a minute.  Look at that box.  That's what their Bolin Branch sheets come in.  Beautiful.  I thought this is a wedding gift.  Where did this come from?  No, it was my Bolin Branch.  Beautiful satin ribbon.  So if you have a wedding gift or you want to give a housewarming gift to somebody,  Bolin Branch is a wonderful choice.  100% ultra soft, 100% organic cotton sheets.  You're buying directly from the factory.  So if you were buying these in stores, you'd pay like a thousand bucks for these,  but they're only a couple of hundred bucks because you're buying direct from the factory.  No middleman.  No real estate.  No real estate either.  Thousands of five-star reviews.  Forbes, Fast Company, The Wall Street Journal.  They're all talking about it.  People love them.  Try it risk-free for 30 nights.  BolinBranch.com.  It's B-O-L-L like cotton ball, like the bowl we've BolinBranch.com.  If you don't love them, you send them back for a refund.  You'll never, I'm telling you, you're never going to send these back.  You're going to say, give me my Bolin Branch.  BolinBranch.com.  We've got $50 off your first set of sheets.  When you say that fast, you get $50 off your first set of sheets.  When you see how for code TWIT.  B-O-L-L and B-R-A-N-C-H.  BolinBranch.com.  You see how for code TWIT.

ZeniMax says Carmack stole trade secrets and destroyed evidence.  He took VR technology when he was an employee over to Oculus when he became the CTO in 2013.  Now remember, the Oculus Rift has been around for longer than that.  So Zuckerberg testified.  He wore a suit, looked very nice.  He said, quote, the idea that Oculus products are based on someone else's technology is just wrong.

Transcript:  Well, he would say that, wouldn't he?  But if you look at the camera, I mean, this is the problem with NDAs in our industry is that,  you know, if the company that you move to is doing fairly well, then the terms of most NDAs  are such that if you even breathe in another company, then you're liable to be sued.  So it's an interesting case, but they need some kind of a smoking gun at the moment.  It's all, well, he must have used a bit of it.  There doesn't seem to be any proof on one way or the other.

Start time: 4893.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Their smoking gun right now seems to be that text from Zuck essentially saying,  well, how much, how much due diligence should we do?  That's not a smoking gun.  That's something that might raise suspicion, but it's not saying,  hey, you know what, let's just steal that tech.

In response, Zuck texted back, and this is in the court records.  That is the one.  Keep pushing forward. Do we have something we could sign on a moment's notice that we  can figure out how long we wait for diligence? Essentially, the lawyers for ZeniMax said that  the deal, there was very little due diligence. They began on Friday, signed the deal on Monday.  So he's not really impugning Zuck so much as saying maybe Palmer Lucky and Oculus  pulled the wool over Facebook's eyes. Facebook did want to get in on VR and they say they were  awfully anxious to do so. So they didn't ask the tough questions.

Start time: 5015.04
End time: 5025.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a complete red herring. I mean, this was...  But it wasn't untrue.  Well, no, but you've got to make certain security choices in an app to deal with various...  It is.

Start time: 5025.64
End time: 5105.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To use the word backdoor was wrong.  Yes, absolutely.  That was sensationalist and probably to drive traffic. It isn't the problem.  So here's the problem. When you use WhatsApp, and it's a problem, frankly, with a lot of  encrypted messaging, WhatsApp lets you change your key.  You go to a new phone, you've got to change your key, right?  And the vulnerability is that if somebody changes their phone and their key is changed,  they can continue to send you messages, but messages now, and you could send them messages,  which perhaps are no longer secure because maybe it wasn't them that changed their phone,  but some other third party that changed the key and WhatsApp didn't really notify you.  But there is a setting in WhatsApp's settings to say, hey, when the key changes, notify me and  don't just send that message automatically. So that was the loophole. It would still message,  even if the key was changed. Now, if you switch this switch, it's just as secure a signal.  Moxie Marlinspike, who created the signal protocol that WhatsApp uses, and of course,  it's also in Signal, said it's not a backdoor. It's not a vulnerability. It's an implementation  decision. It's not the way we do it in Signal, but it's legitimate. And there is a setting in  WhatsApp. It really wasn't appropriate for them to say there was a vulnerability, but it wasn't  inappropriate for the Guardian to write an article saying, hey, if you want security in WhatsApp,

Start time: 5105.56
End time: 5136.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you should disable this feature. That would have been a legitimate article to go, but saying  there's a backdoor at a time like this where everyone's really worried about this sort of  thing. I trust Moxie far more than I would trust the Guardian for a start, but when you actually  looked into the intricacies of this, technically they might have had a point. But it's one of those  things where you could actually have created a serious security situation if you had control  of so many other things that you own them anyway. I mean, I found the use of the term backdoor to be,

Start time: 5137.68
End time: 5178.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  quite frankly, it's just scaremongering. Well, 30 security researchers have signed an open letter  saying, Guardian, you should retract that story. It isn't a backdoor. Zeynep Tufekci, who is an  academic, wrote and a friend of the show also wrote, unfortunately, your story was the equivalent  of putting vaccines kill people in a blaring headline over a poorly contextualized piece.  I'm not sure I'd go that far. If you read the piece, it was pretty straightforward at what it said.  However, I think since people do use WhatsApp for secure communications,  it wasn't a backdoor, but it probably is appropriate to tell them you need to flip this switch

End time: 5213.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right. Until someone leaks out a rumor that Signal's also got a backdoor. I mean, the issue  with all of this is this is if anyone's going to use these applications, it means they're concerned  about privacy and privacy all matters on you trusting the provider. And that is so easy to  break, which is why the people I run with at DEF CON, Black Hat, they don't use these. They  roll their own because then they can be sure that there's nothing else in there. People believe

I mean, Bruce Schneier,  yeah, Isis Lovecraft from the Tor project, Catherine McKinley from Mozilla. I mean, some very good.  They know what they're doing. Jonathan Zdarsky. Yeah.

And when he was trying to give him the upper hand with like the governance  committee on the board, which is like a massive disaster where like Mark was on this committee,  to like convince the board to give super shares to Zuckerberg to have control of the company,  even if he left the company for two years, which was like completely against all corporate governance  rules.

I think probably these tech guys who were absolutely in most cases, except for Peter Thiel,  Clinton supporters also feel like they need to step in and win.  There's a sense of urgency now. Believe me, Zuckerberg controls Facebook. He could  win anytime he wants. But he could also win based upon having been in a movie,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Number one, yeah, so he bought a huge estate, which Oprah did as well.  On Kauai. On Kauai.  The most beautiful of the islands. When you buy these huge estates there,  there is definitely some resentment because people feel you should be able to traverse the land. And  then this has to do with pockets of land that nobody knows who the ownership of is, which he's  forcing to be auctioned and then will buy, obviously, because he doesn't want people on

The other thing was Zuckerberg built a six foot wall around his property.  Yeah, they didn't like that. And they didn't like that either because now people had the view of  stones. And yeah.

I think people are starting to realize, hey, you don't have to be... We got  kind of con that you had to be a lifelong politician to be a politician and win.  If Bloomberg had gone up against Trump, which he should have, and he was very close to doing,  and there were many talks internally amongst the last...  He would have had to be an independent though, right?  He could have run as Republican or a Democrat or an independent, but he did not want to split  the Hillary vote and Hillary would not have given him the spot. I believe he should have run as  Hillary's vice president. I think if he does that, Hillary wins. I think if he runs, he wins,  but he didn't want to split the vote. But I think he would have... If he did split the vote...

I took that bet. Then my friend offered to buy me out of the bet the week before,  two weeks before for 80 cents on the dollar. So I was like, all right, I'll save 20 cents on the  dollar. I bought the buyout because I was feeling guilty about when all the stuff came out about  him. I kind of feel bad about this bet. I mean, I like to gamble, but I just don't want to win  this money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm thinking about this from a PR perspective because when you look when Facebook has already  done unauthorized research as to how to change people's moods by varying what they see on their  newsfeed, I don't think people would trust him in a political role if he was still in a position  of responsibility.

Start time: 5935.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't matter if they trust him. He just makes sure that they trust him. He can change  their minds.  He can change their minds by manipulating the people.  By the end of it, he'll be the most beloved character in American history, I think.  Huge, huge beloved character.  Huge beloved.  One of our friends, Matt Cutts, now has a job with the government.  Matt, I feel bad that we have not talked more about the US Digital Services.  This was the SWAT team that was brought in from Silicon Valley when the Affordable Care Act,  the website for the Obamacare, was such a mess.  Didn't work.  And Silicon Valley stepped up and said, no, no, no, you guys, you can't let these government  contractors design these sites.  Let us take it over.  They fixed it.  The US Digital Service was born since, there's actually a great video on the site,  they have done work to help veterans get better care.  They've stepped in and rescued websites.  Matt Cutts, a few, I guess he was almost a year ago, told us he can't be on our shows  anymore.  He was a regular on this week in Google, one of the early Googlers.  He said, I can't be on your show anymore.  He's been on sabbatical at Google for a while.  I'm going to work for the USDS and it would be a conflict of interest.  Little did he know.  It would be a conflict of interest for me to be on Twig.  And so we haven't heard from him in a while.  He posted on January 18th that he's resigning from Google.  In fact, resigned at the end of the year last year and is staying on with the US Digital  Service and is, as of right now, the interim administrator.  The first administrator, Mikey Dickerson, is a political appointee.  So he stepped down on Inauguration Day and Matt Cutts is this acting administrator of  the US Digital Services.

So I think it does it the second somebody tweets,  so you would have a permanent record of it.  And then I guess somebody had done the thing where you could show  for verified accounts which tweets they deleted in the original tweets or whatever.

Transcript:  No, what happened was, you know, I had a deep relationship with Google.  We had made tens of millions of dollars together as partners and then they just  started changing everything.  And then they would sit there and be like, we don't have any penalty against you.  But I was like, 80% of the traffic's gone.  I was like, yeah, we don't know what happened.  It was just like this guy said lying.  And I was like, guys, don't lie to me.  Just tell me.  And they're like, well, we don't have partners.  I'm like, do you want me to take the thousand partnership emails that we've had over the  years and all these lunches I've had over here?  Will you beg me to put AdSense on my site?  Bag me to put search on my site?  Like, what are we talking about here?  I just felt like Drew Curtis is now furious with Google.  Yeah, they just don't treat partners well.  What happened was there was a time when Matt joined where they were very partner centric  and they would have you over Google.  They needed content sites.  And then, you know, Matt just started lying to me and other people about like our status  because he had my my take on it now is that he had his hands tied.  So he couldn't tell the truth.  And then he was being deposed, I believe, for all these government things.  And so it was it put him in a very awkward position where he essentially had to lie to  us.  And that I know Matt doesn't like doing that.  No.  And I think that's part it became it became very hard for him, I think, to have that job  there and with a straight face, tell people we're not destroying you intentionally.  We're not changing your stuff.  And then like Yelp is getting moved down the page in favor of the listings from the good  news is that if you work for the US government, you never have to lie.

Transcript:  They call it Rocket Mortgage.  It's a completely transparent, trustworthy online process to apply for a mortgage.  You don't have to go to a mortgage lender anymore.  You don't have to bring paperwork or mail paperwork or fax paperwork.  We had three, it was only three years ago.  We bought our house and we had to fax them stuff.  In fact, crazy.  We thought, oh, it'll only take a few weeks.  We're going on vacation a month.  How long could it?  We're on the cruise still doing the paperwork, faxing stuff from a boat.  There's a simple questionnaire you go through.  They have sliders that let you choose your rate, choose your term.  You have complete control.  It's completely transparent.  And the key is it's very fast.  Yes.  And you can absolutely upload your pay stubs and your bank statements.  They don't, you know, it's all digital.  It's a completely online approval process.  I'm told one of our hosts, I think it was Brad Sam's had a mortgage through Rocket.  He said, now there's that point where you have to sign the loan and you still have to physically sign it.  But they come to you.  They send a note of Republic with all the paperwork and you just sit down.  You stay on the couch.  You never left the couch and you just fill out the whole thing.  Quickenloans.com slash twit two.  That's a new address and I want you to use that if you will.  Quickenloans.com slash twit and the number two for Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  Fast, efficient, transparent.  Skip the bank, skip the waiting, go completely online.  Quickenloans.com slash twit two.  And this is where you say equal housing,  when the license on 50 states and MLS consumer access.  I don't do it that way.  I don't do it that way.  Because, see, you know, we used to have sponsors.  You don't have to say it as fast as you can.  It's like, what are you, are you trying to hide this?  I'm going to say it in a normal voice.  Equal housing lender.  Why would you hide that?  Licensed in all 50 states.  Why would you hide that?  And MLS consumer access.org number 33.  So you can look it up.

Start time: 6741.16
End time: 6757.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The argument is she served seven years  and that is very commonly the length of time for the crime she committed.  That the 35 or was it 45?  35 years.  35 year sentence was egregious and overly long.  Sure.  I mean, she did get 112 days knocked off because the judge determined

Start time: 6760.50
End time: 6767.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Who could have guessed that Prince Andrew is a foot in the mouth idiot when it comes  to diplomatic relations?  You just got to look at his family and you know that they're like that.

Transcript:  Why I don't think the most fun story of the week for me,  as she came out last weekend, which was SchmooCon, the big security conference.  And someone had done some research into hackers taking down the power grid  and compared that to the amount of times the power grid has been taken down by animals.  And it turns out it's not hackers.  It's not terrorists.  It's squirrels.  You got to watch out for.  So it's rats with good PR that gnaw through cables.  I mean, there are eight deaths in the last four years  due to animals screwing around with power systems.  You know, three SchmooCon soldiers got electrocuted when a squirrel chewed through the power line,  got electrocuted, the power line fell onto their van and electrocuted them.  It's just there's so much fud talked about.  Oh, the hackers are going to take down the power grid.  The hackers can do this.  And then if you actually look that against 879 squirrel attacks,  which are called power outages, we need to get a refocusing as to what exactly the point.

Transcript:  The person had abdicated and was doing level four and 11 tool device.  You're not supposed to do.  The interesting thing that they found was they looked at since the Tesla was released,  the autopilot was released, it was a 40% drop in crashes.  So what's very interesting about connected cars and all the data is that now Tesla can  definitively know, hey, we put in autopilot.  What happened to crashes?  Oh, we tweaked the software.  What happened to crashes?  They have a feedback loop that's never existed before.  They're pushing updates, as you know, every couple of months and a major one every year  or year and a half.  Already, after auto steer, which is just one of many features, it keeps you in the lane.  It is scary how well it keeps you in the lane.  It is unbelievably, it's uncanny and it's only in version 1.0.  So I think that they're going to continue to drop 40% a year until we get to the point  where people in Teslas just are not getting an accident.

Start time: 7087.58

And you decide that that's not worth it.  You won't do it.  And at the end you do.  There's the great moral dilemma.  There's a huge moral dilemma.  It's a beautiful story.  It's incredibly well done.  It's going to do horribly at the theater because it was in the middle of the release.  It's going to clean up at the awards.

They want to know everything about you and they're outing gay people and other things  by knowing stuff about you.  They can basically predict and then sell you to people.

So if you're a business travel going in and out of San Francisco or any of these places,  I always book two flights.  Back to back or from Oakland and San Francisco because the system is so screwed up here in the  Bay Area and LA and New York that it's like, I don't know if it's a quarter of all flights or  20% of all flights get delayed or changed.  So if you have two flights, all you do is you just refund the one that you're not going to take and  you get a credit or you get a full refund.  It's worked out brilliantly for me.

The first batch suffered from a design flaw.  The external casing was too small for the components inside.  So this is the, not the phone, but the battery casing itself.  The belt was too tight.  The belt was too tight, causing it to short circuit and ignite.  Then the replacement battery, which came from another supplier, didn't have that problem.  But in a rush to pump out enough batteries for the replacement units,  they introduced a manufacturing defect.  They ended up doing the same thing.  Oh, good grief.  So there were really two different problems.  Remember, Samsung quickly moved to replace them.  Rushed replacements out within a week or two.  Yeah.  And those replacements then caught on fire.

Although, look, because a lot of pilots,  the worst fear you have is an in-flight fire.  I mean, barring a sudden reduction in the number of wings or an explosive loss of cabin pressure.  But I mean, the really big one is a fire-  Somebody have a fun time in there.  ...wing reduction is definitely above the fire.  No, because if you've got to get down 30,000 feet in a hurry and you've got a fire on board,  you're toast, quite literally.  But I mean, that's their big fear.
