So did you have a good week Kevin Rose?  You still working on that show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Still working on the show.  It was a pretty good week, pretty relaxing.  Came across some pretty interesting news articles though I wanted to bring to your guys' attention.  What's happening?  The first one I thought was really interesting was the spyware.  Did you guys happen to see this about the Symantec released a study based on spyware  firms are now targeting children?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do they know they're targeting children?  I don't understand.  What do you mean they're doing it on children's websites?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's very young pornography Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like 6 year olds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They took a few different PCs out there and they put them out on the web and they're allowing,  they basically went to 5 or 6 different websites that were aimed at kids and they clicked around  like any kid would, you know different links, various different pop ups and after just a  few hours they had 359 different pieces of adware that were installed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now I take it that was using Internet Explorer.  Yeah, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a feeling most of this stuff probably comes through a lot of the ActiveX pop ups  that you see to try and install on your machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well the problem is kids, I know this is true of my kids, they just click yes yes yes.  Henry came in this morning and said, Dad I won $100,000.  I said Henry you didn't win $100,000.  I said, scam.  He said, no I did.  He said, I did.  How do you know I didn't?  And how do you explain that to a kid?  You know, no you didn't.  They're ripping you off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this spyware that's targeted at children or is it just the same spyware you find everywhere  else that they're hosting on children?  I mean, I don't know if this is particularly new because it seems like a lot of the spyware  vendors for lack of a less charitable phrase I can say without using expletives.  But it seems like they're just, they post it on any server they can for distribution.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well and also self-serving.  Right, I think there's a thing here is that the reason that they're going after kids is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that when kids are more apathetic on this stuff without having to you know think about  it or ask a friend or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're getting it on mom and dad's computer through the kid.  That's the whole point is that this is a way to get to mom and dad's computer.  I don't know if they want the kids.  It's just easier to get on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, right.  Yeah, but I mean I've cleared off two people's systems in the last month.  You know, one of them had like 200 pieces of spyware.  They had no idea what they were getting into and their machine basically wasn't running.  And I just cleared another machine last week and it had a bunch of really nasty viruses  they picked up over worms actually.  They picked up off of a peer-to-peer trading site.  And the other thing was there's just a ton of spyware and it was being run by adults  that were running anti-spyware.  They just hadn't updated it in eight and a half months.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's the question.  Is Kazaa spyware or not?  You know, Microsoft's anti-spyware program gives you a warning.  Now of course Kazaa by itself is not spyware, but it's a conduit.  Right.  So is it's I mean so.  No, not at all.  It's Adware though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is Adware.  B2P applications I feel are just you know they're made for moving files around.  What those files are could be anything.  And if you're going to be using those applications you have to take a certain precaution to you  know take a look at the file you just downloaded and really carefully read any hopefully hidden  somewhere in the EULA they'll have the saying yes we are going to install something or not.  Well see that's the thing.  Some websites just simply create crafted dialogues though that look so suspiciously.  You have to hit cancel when you normally would hit okay on a certain button and those type  of deceptive pop-ups are just some of the worst.  Well you know that's what Symantec was saying right here.  They said that kids are targeted because they're very easy to manipulate and they see the video  game cheat codes.  They click on stuff like that and then all of a sudden they have spyware that is in.  Not really going after the targeted kids but it's popping up ads for mom and dad later  when they get on the machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah they're going after the adults.  Hey I got something scary for you if you're a Tiger user as I know you are a new Tiger  user Kevin.  Did you see this article?  Malicious applets can install dashboard widgets on Tiger malicious webpages.  You can go there and they'll install these new dashboard widgets that could be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Safari on OS X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little scary.  I mean we've said for a long time you don't have to worry about Macintosh you're safe  but this is a huge hole that Apple just basically installed on everybody's system.  I'll put a link on slash dot Stefan.com slash widgets slash Zaptastic.  If you go there on a Macintosh it installs the widget.  It just did it on my system.  And the thing is the way widgets work they are installed automatically.  Now this one's not malicious but it's a good demonstration of the fact that it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you read the essay that's up on the website that installs the widget?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Zaptastic blueprint for widget of mass destruction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Skip aside the Bainbridge and the Oppenheimer quotes from the Trinity test.  But he's basically pointing out that this has opened up a really nasty security hole  in OS X.  Yeah I think it's really a shame.  Is it really nasty because I know with some of these other different widget programs like  Confabulator it was just a variation of JavaScript right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean can it really do that much damage?  Yes of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He says it can't do much damage because there's sandbox but he goes what's interesting is  you can't remove the widget once it's installed.  There's no way according to Apple you can't remove it.  There's no way to remove a widget from the widget bar or change their order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what if this widget the icon of it is a casino or a porn site and you click on it  and it brings you to the porn site.  I mean that's spyware.  That's exactly what's happening on the Windows side.  That's spyware.  So I think this is in fact an exploit that is something significant that shouldn't be  ignored.  I think Apple's got to fix it and it's kind of disappointing that it exists.  I've got now green zap all over my desktop.  I don't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well you can if you can find your library forward slash widget so you can delete the  widget you don't want in there.  Right.  You've got to know what you're doing.  That seems like an awfully easy exploit too.  I think that's what makes it really scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I went to the website.  I didn't click anything.  I'm just sitting on the website and the widget installs.  That's a very scary exploit.  I think that's a real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I mean makes enough of those things.  I think one that just looks like a rotating hard drive that just shows it being deleted  even though nothing's really happening but just totally frightening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.  Right there.  Or you know I mean exactly.  So I think that this it's too bad because Apple has up to now been pretty good about  protecting its users and this whole is not I think that's a bad thing.  The one advantage Apple had against Windows was that they had this kind of secure environment  and now it's not there anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did Apple actually buy the widget technology or that type of interface from the Confabulator  folks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  In fact that's a point of they claim they developed on their end.  Yeah that's a bone of contention from the Confabulator folks.  They were kind of bitter about it.  Arlo Rose.  Remember we had him on the screensavers.  He made a little looking Leo widget and I love Confabulator.  They made a Windows version and it's just a great product.  Apple stole it basically.  Locks it out of the barrel.  I'm using it right now.  Yeah.  And Dashboard is Confabulator.  Frankly I don't think it's as good as Confabulator but it's JavaScript.  It's very similar in the construction and the overall idea.  And stole is such a harsh word.  Alright let me not use the word stole because that's accusing them of something that could  be you know not exactly.  I don't want to get sued for libel on our third podcast but.  No I hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you don't want to get your boat taken out of the Apple store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The similarities are striking.  They basically borrowed a number of things.  In a way that's good.  Isn't that what happens with operating system development?  Don't you think Microsoft is now looking at Tiger saying what can we put in Longhorn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Microsoft at this point is trying to figure out how can we finish Longhorn and  ship it because they've just been slashing and burning.  They've been cutting features out of Longhorn at this point and it's still forever and a  day away.  Good point.  I'd like to see Microsoft at some point just create an interface for their operating system  that lets you customize it to your heart's content very easily.  We don't have to download third party apps to make it you know give it the flavor you  like in particular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Couple of Google stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well they tried it with the original plus packs.  Yeah right.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Forty bucks more and you can have a great screen saver of fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's nothing wrong with the farming one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That makes you feel right at home doesn't it Patrick.  Hey did you guys know there's a couple of big Google stories in the news.  Google was down yesterday for about four hours and for a while was being referred.  Really.  Yeah.  It was being referred to a site SOGO site which is apparently a New York marketing firm  that has Google dot net I think or Google dot com dot net I think they own.  Google says it wasn't a hack it was a DNS error but it was I was shocked.  I mean to go to Google and get a 404 is shocking don't you think.  That's pretty scary.  I felt like I couldn't.  I felt debilitated.  I can't use the net.  It just showed Google has become so important to using.  I didn't think of going MSN search or Yahoo.  I just I went I left.  I did something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That always makes me think of when you type in the ping command it's like you ping.  It used to be Yahoo dot com and now eventually I see all the IT guys using ping Google dot  com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they pinging Google now because I still ping Yahoo.  Who here pings Yahoo who pings Google.  I ping Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Robert's ahead of the pack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One or the other.  It's like anything I know that's working and it surprised me that Google would ever go  down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Has anybody tried the new Google web accelerator?  With all the stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've tried it.  I don't know.  They've run into a lot of issues that I've run into.  They pulled it from Google.  You can't download it any longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh did they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I'll tell you initially my initial reaction was it doesn't seem to speed things up much  and I can no longer edit my wiki.  I can no longer edit my webpage.  The caching screwed up things apparently saving from a webpage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you hear about the story about some people were logging to other people's user accounts

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  because it was caching them already being logged in.  Oh interesting.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it was a good idea and it's dead.  It's dead now.  And privacy advocates of course worried about the whole notion of saving webpages on the  Google servers.  You know it's something that makes sense maybe for your internet service provider to do to  cache webpages because you have a direct connect to them.  I'm not sure I understood the value of having Google do it.  Are there servers so much faster that we're going to benefit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No please just give me a 20 megabit connection.  It needs to be just a level.  Anything else you want?  It's really tricky too.  Faster internet cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well you know we pay more in this country than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No web accelerator technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We pay more now for internet access in this country than almost any other country.  Well no that's not true.  We're an industrial nation.  Oddly enough for a long time we had the deal but now it's gotten so cheap in most other  nations in the west that we're paying more than most.  Really?  Yeah isn't that weird?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well here's the open cell companies kick in and deploy their high speed wireless networks  so we can eventually... or maybe Wi-Fi will just take everything over.  Wi-Fi is not going to take everything over because you still need a DSLR cable connection  at the end.  It's interesting because like...  Sorry I've been thinking a lot about this because we're launching a new WiMAX site at  extremetech.com.  But it's interesting because WiMAX has all this potential at least for metropolitan areas  if it ever ships.  It's the idea of just better than cable or DSL speeds, wireless, no line of sight issues  but it still comes down to...  Be nice if the phone companies get it but the phone companies can't decide how much  they want to charge everybody.  They're either going to charge you 80 bucks a month to access it over your phone or they're  going to charge you nothing for 3G or 4G bandwidth.  It's like they can't decide on how much money they want to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just checked the Google Web Accelerator site.  It says we have currently reached our maximum capacity of users and are actively working  to increase the number of users we can support.  So the Web Accelerator is ostensibly still up but they've maxed out.  That's their claim.  But we can't support any more users.  Right well that's what they say.  I don't know.  They don't want to use it anymore.  Hey I saw that Seattle is putting Speakeasy...  They have a finite number of servers for it.  Yeah well that was the whole point.  I don't understand why they're even getting in this business.  What is the percentage for Google?  To go back to the WiMAX thing I saw that the Speakeasy, which is the big Seattle internet  service provider, says they're putting WiMAX on the space needle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're putting pre-WiMAX on the space needle and actually a week or two ago Intel was playing  around with pre-WiMAX or some of their WiMAX technology on the stratosphere in Vegas and  claiming they're covering 500 square miles off of that.  Holy cow.  I mean the WiMAX is a huge...  Well it's an interesting idea and I'm kind of looking forward to getting a chance to  talk to some of the geeks that are involved running it because if you can really cover...  I mean San Francisco is kind of a wireless nightmare because of all the hills and nooks  and crannies but the idea is that it's going to be microwave, it's going to be non-line  of sight, you're going to be able to go through building walls.  They're first going to...  It's going to roll out in static, non-moving locations first, fixed locations as a competitor  to cable and DSL, which is a really nice way of not having to fight with the phone company  and not having to deal with the cable company, which has a certain definite attraction to  me.  You know what bugs me though is that unfortunately it's just another high speed internet for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  who already has in most cases at least two choices.  What it really could be used in rural areas to wire people who are completely disenfranchised,  the best they can do is a 28.8 modem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  WiMAX could be used to cover rural areas because it's going to be concentrated in basically  town and town's a lot smaller than the top 100 metropolitan markets.  But what's interesting, what's much, much more threatening is what Verizon started in  Pennsylvania, which is getting state legislatures passing laws that prevent local communities  from establishing their own ISPs, which is what Philadelphia was doing.  Most of Philadelphia doesn't have access to broadband and they started a project to bring  municipal wireless and Verizon went nuts and ended up getting a law passed by the state  legislature in Pennsylvania preventing any other community in Pennsylvania from doing  that.  Was it just Verizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think eight or eleven states have followed suit.  Was it just Verizon?  Was Philadelphia the home of Comcast and you think they would have wired the damn town?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well Verizon was the big push behind that effort.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And of course they grandfathered in Philadelphia, but yeah the rest of Pennsylvania is out of  luck and I think that's terrible, criminal.  People ought to go up and be up in arms over that.  What else is on the top of your mind?  Robert Heron, what are you thinking about these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I was just thinking about when you're talking about the wireless networking.  I was wondering why more networking companies aren't offering some sort of default mesh  technology within the routers they sell.  So you could at least say you know what by default it will sacrifice say 20% of my bandwidth  to connect to another one that would further this network and help perpetuate connections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you some kind of commie?  You're a communist Robert.  Why should I share my bandwidth with my neighbors?  Screw them.  No, no.  Totally voluntary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like I leave mine wide open.  I do too.  And I hope people use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do too.  I think that I can download all my porn.  Hey, I remember you Patrick saying that mesh was problematic.  It wasn't as wonderful as everybody's been saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well mesh has changed a lot in the last two years because mesh has gone from like the  mesh routers we were looking at were open source based routers that were primarily being  used in England to do exactly what you were just talking about Robert is to extend the  network to places where people couldn't get it.  There's a lot of overhead and there was a lot of mostly it's just a lot of overhead  and you ended up you could really get your bandwidth hammered on if you happen to be  the last connection to broadband standing.  But there's mesh networks are starting to show up everywhere.  I was going to say it also seems that it's proprietary whenever you come across any mesh  technology that it's our particular formula of how we want to do it and we're not going  to make it compatible with anything else.  Hopefully we'll see an open source push behind that.  Well partially mesh is mostly showing up in low latency environments like if you look  at Zigbee where you're talking about low speed, low latency, high latency.  When you don't care about latency like you're turning on all the lights in an office building  or waiting for the temperature to be sent back from a remote sensor and that's what  Zigbee is doing and a couple other competing technologies the mesh works out really great  because it's healing, it's self-configuring, it monitors itself, it can be incredibly low  power but when you're talking about broadband speeds mesh gets really complicated especially  if you're trying to keep the latency down.  I thought there was a SourceForge project actually now that I'm thinking about this  a little more where they had a list of firmware upgradeable routers where you could actually  go ahead and enable programs within the router itself run a small Linux app basically that  would enable a mesh technology and several of the popular just off the shelf routers  and I'm trying to remember I should look that up next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know what you're talking about actually there was also a really cool firmware that  allowed you to create your own hotspot too remember that?  If you put that in a link system you have a little hotspot.  This is something you might like Patrick somebody's come up with a Wi-Fi surfboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's in.  Becky demonstrated that on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe she did, I don't know it's from England and you have to have a base station on the  beach maybe it would support WiMAX I don't know maybe it's mesh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh I saw this one where it's got like the browser embedded in the face and the VLCD  in the face of the surfboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly Intel built it they're showing it off they're going to show it off at the OceanFest  on 18th of June in Devon England so but is there much surfing in North Devon?  Apparently there is it's the UK's surfer paradise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't imagine it's much of a paradise but okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe some of our.  It's kind of like surfing in Northern California or Oregon it's cold.  It is cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A wetsuit is required.  Any other stories before we get to our questions from our listeners?  Oh I got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi guys there's about 55 days left until the broadcast flag comes into play.  I was wondering what your opinions are of the broadcast flag and how that's going to  play out in the industry and for consumers like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The broadcast flag it's over the broadcast flag is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah well is the FCC going to appeal that decision?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You bet I'm sure they're going all the way to the Supreme Court you don't think so?  You think they're going to lie down?  Not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They want to outlaw every piece of hardware that's been sold I guess it wouldn't outlaw  what you currently own but suddenly every receiver out there that could accept say an  over the air HD signal you're going to suddenly make that illegal to even own or resell in  some way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless it has copy protection built in it has to have the broadcast flag or it's illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right but everything up to this point especially on the PC side just simply ignores the broadcast  flag ignores it outright.  I just think the FCC says how can we possibly go back at this point after we've let it out  of the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well just between us kids you know when we had Michael Powell the former chairman of  the SEC on the screensavers about a year ago he said just between you and me we didn't  have any choice we had to do it the movie companies were asking for a lot more he said  but just between you and me Leo you know this will never stand and I don't know whether  he knew that the courts would throw it out or he thought it would be hacked but he felt  like it wasn't anything to worry about even then because it wasn't going to get implemented  so maybe this was maybe he was prescient maybe he knew this would happen and maybe the FCC  doesn't really have the will maybe they're glad to see this happen and of course the  Motion Picture Association of America immediately responded saying well that's it we're not  going to put any good movies on HDTV broadcast you can say goodbye to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're taking our ball and going home.  That's true.  That's it we're through you know I don't care how much money you throw at us how much?  I would hope and oh well never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would hope it sounds like the SEC might have actually talked to a nonpartisan video  engineer broadcast engineer said look no matter what you come up with at some point it will  be hacked and especially on the PC side of things you will always be able to redirect  that output to either a different out to a fully full blown port like something like  DVI or through Firewire or it's just it's just oh.  Privately when I was in the Cable Industry Association meeting a couple weeks ago one  of the engineers on the download just said you know what even Microsoft has fully acknowledged  that every piece of video technology they have out there can be cracked and they expect  not simply if but when.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look how fast a bunny cracked the Xbox which had the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Better content and make it cheaper for everyone.  Yeah I agree.  And it seems like they're going about the wrong way this I mean if you think that I'm  seriously considering canceling my cable altogether because with RSS wrapping all these BitTorrent  files I can subscribe to different channels tell it the content that I want and I have  my own little built-in TiVo right on my PC and as there is just goes out and downloads

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  everything for me automatically.  Who was it was it Battlestar Galactica that they started offering BitTorrents of their

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  show like the day after the show aired or maybe even the day before the show aired somebody's  doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah they did.  I think that's amazing.  But you know what I prefer honestly downloading shows from overseas like especially the broadcast  out of Europe and in particular England because they don't use all of those pop-up graphics  during a broadcast now that people are channel skipping through the commercials or I mean  commercial skipping through their favorite programs they're now introducing new forms  of advertising while you're actually watching the show itself where you have the bottom  third something going up the right hand side that just totally takes me out of the moment  when I'm watching my favorite shows and if I have to go overseas to download a relatively  clean looking version of that show so be it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that this is the beginning of the end frankly for broadcast media between the  podcasts and mp3 players killing radio BitTorrents killing television.  The question is is somebody going to who's going to continue to make premium content  expensive things if they can't make the money back.  I mean how do they make the money back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It should all be premium.  I like it.  I like having no advertising.  I'll pay for it if there's no advertising.  I mean I paid for cable.  I paid for my 70, 80, 150 channels and I still am bombarded with advertising left and right  to the point where I'm trying to actively skip it using every piece of technology I  can.  It's frustrating and I see no end to it.  You're absolutely right there Robert.  I think it's going to go to like a kind of like a you just choose the content that you  want at the time.  You know you'll buy the certain channels or the certain types of content that you want  and you know it works that way already.  If you take a look at the way that BitTorrents working I can download a file before it even  airs on the west coast.  It will have aired on the east coast.  Someone will BitTorrent put it online.  I'll download it have it and be able to watch it in HD before it even broadcasts out here  in the west coast which is awesome.  Big Battlestar Galactica that broadcasted in Europe about three months before it came  here so I could actually cheat and get the whole season ahead of time in HD.  It goes perfectly.  With no commercial interruptions, no weird lower third graphics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How big are those files?  If they're HD are they Divx and how big are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The current goal right now everyone is shooting at 350 megabytes per hour long show so you  can put two hours on a single CD which I'll be honest they're using n pass encoding multiple  passing codes and they make them look beautiful.  They do a really really good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're not sacrificing quality by doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My biggest complaint though this goes to TV goes to DVD and everything.  They just simply don't offer an option to not have that additional advertising.  I would honestly pay a little bit more to avoid all that.  I'd give the profit straight to whoever the provider is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the experiment that we're trying.  Are people willing to hear what we have to say and pay a little bit?  We're giving it for free but asking them to pay a little bit.  So far I've been very gratified by the response.  It's certainly not 100 percent it's probably one in a hundred but those one in a hundred  are supporting the show.  I think that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to start somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey Yoshi is...  You're the other 99.  That's actually... is he back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Yoshi's back.  I think we got it fixed.  Ladies and gentlemen.  It's the Mod Master.  What you been up to these days Yoshi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We miss you.  I've missed you guys too.  Tons of stuff.  I've been up to a lot.  I've been doing a little bit of modding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been trying to get light up that's been taking over in a day.  I did that stuff with those guys from the shadows.  I've done a couple more things.  I helped them out with basically the range testing and all that for that first episode  and for this next one where I have coming up I did some mod for it.  I think we got it fixed.  I think we got it fixed.  I think we got it fixed.  I think we got it fixed.  I think we got it fixed.  I think we got it fixed.  I think we got it fixed.  Doing stuff like that for fun.  I was going to be moving.  We'll see if that's still going to happen.  That might have actually fallen through.  I was going to be going to Dallas but I'm not sure if I still will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a lot of people in Dallas who just got their hopes up.  They want to buy a hat.  All hat, no cattle right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well what I was going to do there kind of fell through so I might not be doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well maybe you'll be doing this.  We'd love to have you here on a regular basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Personally I'm actually, I'll announce it on air here.  I am getting married soon and I am soon to be a father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh congratulations!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whoa!  Yay, Yoshi!  That's great!  So can you tell us who the lucky lady is?  Don't say her whole name.  We don't want to expose her too quickly.  Oh, Carrie.  Carrie, yeah.  That's great.  Well congratulations to you and Carrie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's been pretty much the best thing that's ever happened so it's pretty cool.  The woman that's around me has told me that they've seen an invisible change in me since  she's been around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As all of us here will testify, there's nothing like a good woman to tame a bad man.  That sounds like a Johnny Cash song, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, I want to mention that Megan was going to...  Dr. Phil, I wanted to ask you a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to mention that Megan was going to join us.  Megan Maroney, another longtime friend of ours and a screen saver.  It is Mother's Day.  Her mother is in town so she couldn't make it but she'll come in sometime soon.  You know she had twin boys a month ago.  Huck and Milo and they're just adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, she has to empty out her jumping monkeys mailbox.  She'll send her an email about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, she's got quite a bit I'm sure.  Well, I had dinner with her on Friday night.  Her husband and the three kids, they had an instant family, came over and it was so great  and her mom too.  So she wishes you all the best.  She's just doing great.  She's very happy.  And we expect to get her in here doing the show very soon.  So that's good news too.  I think we've got a pretty complete reunion here.  We're working on it.  There are a few people missing and I've sent them all emails.  But we might be able to kind of recreate the screen savers.  I mean the, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think one by one we'll drag them back in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That show we used to do.  Let's take some questions.  You're going to have to bleep that Leo.  I'll bleep it.  God damn it.  Let's take...  I've got to bleep that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've got to bleep that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never ending.  And that too.  And that.  Here's a question from Brian for all of us.  Listen up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey guys.  I was a ZDTV and Tech TV fan since like before day one.  Originally I found ZDTV when it was a test pattern on C-band on the old satellite C4.  I noticed that over the course of time that basically things were...  I hate to use the phrase dumbed down but the content became a little more simplified I guess.  The caliber of questions that once were on Call for Help actually became more of the  kind of questions that you had on the screen savers.  And the stuff, the really hardcore stuff that was on the screen saver sort of faded away  and wasn't addressed.  Was this a conscious decision or was it just organic?  And also is there any chance of Martin Sargent showing up?  Really Miss Martin?  And also Scott Harriot?  Or heck even Carmine Gallo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo and I got dumber over time.  I think that's what happened.  We didn't dumb the show down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We dumbed down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think we intentionally did that.  Did we?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well there was a...  I think they wanted it to be more entertaining than just pure tech.  They wanted to get away from the super hardcore geek side.  They wanted it to be a little more general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That did happen and that happened.  And that was the push all over the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think a mistake.  I mean I think one of the things we're going to do with this podcast, we're not beholden  to anybody, right?  We can make it as geeky as we want and I don't have any intention of, unless you guys do,  of dumbing it down, I think we should just do what we're interested in, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I say why dumbing it down.  People want to hear the details.  That's what they want.  They always write us the emails when they're there before saying we want more info.  We'd have to email them back, give them the info.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  TV is, you know, commercial TV is not a great medium.  We're many and many a rounds of dumbing down.  Here's the king of dumbed down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His IQ is now down about 20.  The king of dumbed down is right here.  Yeah, but look, I don't blame, I think that's normal.  That's what broadcast television or cable television, you know, commercial television  does.  It's aimed at the largest possible audience and they assume that that audience isn't too  bright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We need more celebrities.  Very true.  We need more TV over IP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what's happening.  Kevin's working very hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, narrowcasting, it's going to, but that's what print media did back in the,  you know, between the 20s and the 50s.  You went from the Ladies Home Journal to Flying Magazine, these special interest, tightly  focused magazines.  And between, you know, 500 cable channels and Robert, totally right, IPTV, I think broadcast  media is going to make that change.  And oh yeah, podcasting.  I mean, that's the big thing.  That's the big thing right now.  One of the main reasons I want to get into this space and really do this is that I want  to be able to do the content that, you know, I enjoy, which is the super geeky stuff where  I can get in depth as I want to.  And I control it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I control all of that, which is great.  You know, next year is going to be a huge backlash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Next year's going to be one more step toward all the cart cable programming or content

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  programming.  It's what you were asking for, Robert.  We have so much stuff on TV right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's garbage.  Well like out of DirecTV, I'll have 400 and 500 channels.  I have about two channels I'll watch.  I really don't watch much broadcast television anymore.  It doesn't show me the information I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well as somebody who's been in broadcasting now, it'll be 30 years in a couple of years.  This is the most exciting development I've ever seen because broadcasting was always  some small group of people deciding what was going to happen.  And if they controlled the transmitter or they controlled the presses, they decided.  Well now we all have presses and transmitters.  We can all do what we want.  And you know who gets to decide now?  The audience gets to decide.  I think that's how it should be.  All right, I'll get off my high horse here.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It gives the audience the chance to see that dorky and geeky Linux code across the screen  that the producers would always scream about seeing on air too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, more Linux!  What are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the thing that blew me away.  When I got to Canada they said, more Linux.  Can you do more Linux?  I said, what?  We want more Linux.  I said, okay.  It is a different state.  This is the problem we're talking about is a US problem primarily, although it's spreading  everywhere, but it's more so in the United States.  We don't have the national channels, the government-funded channels.  They got the BBC in Britain where they'll do the most of...  Some of my favorite podcasts are from BBC Radio.  Let's talk about Homer and the Aeneid and the impact of the Peloponnesian War on agriculture  in 5th century BC.  I love it.  I don't know what they're talking about, but I love it.  Hey, let's get another call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey guys, this is The Man from IrvineUnderground.org.  I just want to know, Patrick and Kevin, both of you have gone to DEFCON before and I was  wondering if you guys were going to podcast live from there or not live, but if you were  record the podcasts and then post them from DEFCON 13.  When is DEFCON?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The last...  The last night, the 31st.  Yeah.  Who's going to DEFCON?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going.  I'm there.  Yoshi, you going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I will be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we should do stuff there for System.  Oh, good.  There's a three-part...  Yeah, when is System going to launch, by the way?  Actually, we should answer this guy's question first.  Good question.  Sorry.  Well, I think I...  When is DEFCON 13?  Well, DEFCON 13 is July, like Yoshi said, July 29th to 31st, but this guy's saying,  are we going to podcast from there?  I'll record stuff there, but I won't go on a network pretty much anywhere in Vegas, much  less at DEFCON during that three-day period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really, isn't there no honor among hackers?  You think you'd actually get hacked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, they hacked Kevin Mitnick and posted his name on a wall.  Basically, there's a network system inside the hotel, the resort, the Alexis Park, where  DEFCON is held, and there's a pretty good high-speed broadband access there.  What happens is you have all these people scanning and running every attack possible  in every operating system.  There's a few guys who basically sit...  There's a central area where you can sit in a lounge and meet and hang out with people.  They have a big overhead projector that aims at the wall, a projector that aims at the  wall as they list, as they've basically rooted people's systems out and list their information  up on the wall.  It just scrolls slowly up all day long.  That would be humiliating.  I won't actually connect my system to the network.  Certainly not there.  I actually...  I can watch Bluetooth phones, whatever you're carrying with you that might happen to be  vulnerable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you what.  We'll set you up, Patrick, with a secure recording device that is not...  You can bring back the tapes and we'll play them on the show.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I figured out some places to sneak out to where it's far enough away that nobody...  It's far enough away from the Alexis Park where I feel safe.  I wouldn't even...  In any of the surrounding hotels, I wouldn't use any of their connections.  People just...  You're paranoid, Pat.  He really is.  Well, have you ever...  You should see something sad.  It's like you see some like, I'm the biggest bad ass from insert town here.  My systems are secure.  I can take down any network.  And he like plugs onto the Wi-Fi network at DEFCON and you can just watch his system get  nuked and you'll see people in the hallways desperately typing on their screens.  And you know, they were like, my system is secure.  And it's like, well, guess what?  You just learned something new, didn't you Sparky?  And my notebook stays in my bag.  Oh boy.  So now you're making me nervous about getting into my hotel room.  Yeah, no kidding.  Well, if the hotel rooms were the walking distance of DEFCON, I would be.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, well, we'll report something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what we should do?  We got to do this.  If we're all going to be there at the same time, let's get together.  Let's do it.  We should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should have a meetup.  DEFCON, there's a good idea, a meetup.  We'll send out...  For those of you who are subscribers, one of the things we do want to do is some meetups.  We will send out an email, two subscribers only, that will reveal the secret location  of our DEFCON meetup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I know the perfect location for the DEFCON one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cool.  All right.  That'll be great.  That'll be great.  I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it.  I know a good place too.  And you must bring recording devices.  We'll get you some recording stuff and you can do the podcast there.  That'd be really fun.  That'd be really fun.  All right.  Let me see.  We've got to take time for one or two more questions here.  This has been great.  I tell you, it's wonderful to have you, Yoshi.  Now that we...  I have to say...  I'm not crazy about the TeamSpeak.  I think the latency on this is kind of an issue.  We'll have to look at some other things.  Next week...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, we should thank the guy whose TeamSpeak server we're using because that was really  cool of him to loan this to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he's gone now.  But we talked to him earlier.  Mark Williamson, very nice of him.  He's out of Austin.  That might be one of the reasons that we have a little bit of lag because we're all on the  West Coast.  That was very nice of him.  He's got a T1.  It shows that we can have more people.  One of the things that TeamSpeak would allow us to do is take live calls because you could  log into the server and we could invite you in and ask your question and then kick you  out.  So I like the idea of this.  We're going to look at some other ways.  We're going to look at Ventrilo.  Maybe next week we'll use Ventrilo.  We can compare and contrast.  And then I'm going to work on a way to do it with asterisk and see if we can do it a  little bit better.  We have a question in here though before we take off.  This is John in Nashville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey guys, this is Josh from Nashville.  I just wanted to let you know it's great to have you all back together here again.  And this podcast has really turned me on to podcasting in general.  So in light of that, I'd like to ask all of you, what are some of your favorite podcasts,  your favorite podcast software for receiving and your favorite podcast software for producing?  Because I'm planning on starting one when I go to college.  So on a related note, what are some of your favorite MP3 players right now?  Thanks guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  I hope you're taking notes.  Let's see.  All right.  First, do any of you listen to podcasts or is that kind of not something you guys do?  I do actually.  What do you like Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just starting.  I actually, you know, there's nothing other than the daily source.  There's not a lot that I listen to particularly regularly.  sample here and there.  Because I've been basically for extreme iPod.com, we're starting to put up more podcast listings.  I just say I use iPod or it's kind of like the original and the easy one.  Right.  Maybe it's because I'm too lazy to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're going to use the BitTorrent feeds that I that we offer for this or the evil  genius Chronicles, Dave Slusher uses iPod or X is a better choice.  It seems to work better with BitTorrent because it has it built in.  I like iPod or X.  I know Ray Slakansky.  Pardon me Ray.  I can never get your name right.  Very nice guy.  And he and August who writes the interface have done a really nice job.  So that's my favorite.  But there's a light version and a paid version.  Doppler is pretty good on Windows.  Again, doesn't do a very good job with BitTorrent.  Have you listened Patrick to the IT Conversations?  I think that's an amazing podcast.  No, I'll check that one out.  There's a lot of them.  I think they do it almost a dozen a week.  But it's it's what it is is a lot of its conference present, you know, panels and speeches and  interviews and stuff.  And it's just really high quality content.  There's also dotnet radio, which is quite good.  How about you, Kevin?  You listen to podcasts or is this not something you do?  You probably don't have a lot of time to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not much now, but I do have iPod or X and it's funny because there's even starting to  work with video now too moving forward.  Right.  Because videos that you're into, as long as they have the RSS enclosures, you'll be able  to grab the video even though if it's BitTorrent wrap too, it'll suck the BitTorrent, open  it up and then save it to your hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I like about iPod or X.  It does that transparently.  Which is going to be pretty interesting.  Yeah, because you're going to have big files when you do system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they're going to be two to three hundred megs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's the beauty of this is it goes on in the background, you don't really pay attention  and it's just there at some point it just arrives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly.  One thing I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I see why iPod or X is a...  Oh, sorry, iPod or X is an IA for OS X only?  Right now.  One thing I don't like about it in any of these is that they leech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't leave the BitTorrent client open.  And I understand, I asked Ray about that and he said, well, we don't want people to have  stuff running on their system all the time that they don't know about so we didn't feel  right about it.  But it would be nice if they would see it.  I mean the whole idea of BitTorrent is once you've got the file, you can go to the website  and get it.  The whole idea of BitTorrent is once you've got the file, leave your client open so that  other people can get it as well.  Robert, you listen to any podcasts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not really.  I'd like to be able to find certain radio shows that I can't find.  I got really hooked to a few radio shows in particular down in Los Angeles that aren't  being broadcast up here and I was hoping that they would eventually move to a podcast format  or there's always the P2P networks as well.  But the third question or the third part of that question was about, was it flash based  MP3 players?  And I have to say, iRiver makes my favorite.  Just about anything they make.  You like the iRivers, huh?  Including Nia.  As soon as they can come up with like a 5 gig flash player, I'd buy it immediately.  It's just the storage factor.  It's hard to find them in gig size let alone 2 or 3 gigs of flash storage.  The iRivers tend to, I mean, it's just, I don't know, I've tested 3 or 4 different models  of iRiver and it seems like it's all the same guts but the implementation in the case and  the screen display kind of varies all over the map.  I'm also an iPod player.  It was the FM tuner built into the iRiver products that really sold it because I love  listening to radio and built in voice recorder and just the shape of it that kind of like  a wise triangle.  Do you actually use the voice recorder?  I use it mostly on my cell phone.  My cell phone has one built into it so I use that more often than I use anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Adam Curry's using the iRiver voice recorder sometimes to do his podcasts as I  remember.  So, I mean, the quality is pretty good.  Well, if you have a good mic, I think the quality is actually pretty good.  That's one downside of the iPod.  Even if you get the Belkin, or rather the Griffin iMic, the iPod won't let you record  it better than 8-bit recording unless you put Linux on it, in which case why'd you get  an iPod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that in the lack of an FM tuner?  No, I don't mind that.  I like listening to the radio once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't mind that.  That's why I have one shuffle.  I have a gigabyte shuffle that's dedicated to podcasts.  It's all talk.  Any of my Howard Stern in the morning?  There's some really, what I like about podcasting, there's some interesting, innovative stuff  happening which you wouldn't see in mainstream media and I just like that.  I don't think we could get this show on a regular radio station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That and the whole lack of censorship too, which is always refreshing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, I think it'll be very interesting to hear Howard on a satellite when nobody's  telling him what not to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my.  He has a boulder he's saving up of things he hasn't been able to do.  In that first, at least the first couple days, it should be pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know how serious he's going to do it though.  How can they pay for Howard Stern?  They're going to have to get, I think they said, what did they say, another 10 million  subscribers or something to pay for?  Half a billion dollars a year.  Well, they need a huge number of subscribers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Half a billion for a five-year contract, not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's making pretty serious bank now, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's true.  But he's doing it with a much larger audience.  That's the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the serious is betting that they're going to be able to pick up a large portion  of that audience.  And the players, by the time he gets on air, the players are going to be incredibly cheap.  The subscription's already not that bad.  It's going to be one of the most popular Christmas presents this year.  Yoshi, do you listen to the podcast at all?  This year, I mean, honestly, I don't really listen to them that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How about an MP3 player?  What's your...  We're starting to kind of get into it another...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, my thing, I agree with Robert on the FM tuner, because for MP3 players, for me,  the only time I listen to an MP3 player is if I'm on foot.  If I'm in the car, I have MP3 in my car stereo at home.  I have MP3 in my home stereo.  A few of my computers all network together.  So the iPod is just about me being on foot.  So if I'm on foot, like out, you know, if I want to go down to the beach or I'm out jogging  or walking around or whatever, maybe, you know, I might want to listen to the radio  to see what's up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  I live on the iPod.  I live on the iPod.  I live on the iPod.  I have airplane travel I do and everything.  I have books on there.  I have music on there.  I have podcasts on there.  It's my, you know, it's my audio entertainment center, maybe because I've been radio so long.  I like audio and it's, you know, it does the job for me.

Transcript:  Yeah, as of late...  I played in Vegas over a couple of weeks back.  Everyone I knew who had an iPod had an FM tuner and the new thing is to either, if the  radio in the hotel room has an input, cool, use that.  But if not, just throw the FM tuner right there, tune in the cheesy clock radio and you can  listen to whatever music you want right there.  It's just little things like that.  You suddenly see it creeping in everywhere.
