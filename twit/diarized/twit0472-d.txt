Woke up apparently every every startup entrepreneur in the every Twitter user in my I tell you the first thing I did after I jumped out of bed shouting earthquake.  And ran around in circles as I pulled out the smartphone and looked at Twitter.  There was nothing on Google plus there was nothing on well Facebook there was a lot of people doing the ALS ice bucket challenge three days ago and then Twitter was all about the earthquake I got the magnitude the epicenter.  Almost instantly.

Transcript:  Big earthquake.  Big earthquake.  Big earthquake was my first one on Facebook and then big big earthquake woke me up was my tweet and.  Why just out of curiosity.  Within a minute because I put both screens up within a minute.  My entire Facebook feed was the earthquake and my entire Twitter feed was earthquake.  So it depends on who you followed who you liked who you've taught the engine that you want to see and even what you put into the engine it so I bet.  It saw that I'm interested in earthquake because I tweeted I posted something about earthquake and it brought me a whole bunch of stuff immediately it was pretty interesting.

Start time: 534.86
End time: 558.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 560.24
End time: 566.62

Start time: 577.70
End time: 594.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's what what things you've liked who your friends are who you put on close friends list and who you put on acquaintance list because if you put somebody on the close friends list you'll see more items from them so you're actually on my close friends list because I want to see every every time you talk about Twitter something right.

Start time: 596.60
End time: 600.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Close friends list.  Yeah.  Okay.  That doesn't mean.

Start time: 607.64
End time: 616.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it takes you to really kind of cultivating it to get it to be any good.  Yeah.  They do not expose how you do it.  I mean they don't say oh this is what you should do.

Start time: 617.02
End time: 634.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No no no no because it's trying to study your emotional attachment to things to content to places to people.  And so I'm giving it more signal than most human beings.  When you haven't given enough signal it doesn't it doesn't really work that way.

Start time: 634.40
End time: 649.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here's my question I see this post from Julio.  He does a potta great journalist at the Minneapolis or Minnesota Twin Press and it's a salsa dancing.  Now if I like this what is the signal am I sending a signal I like salsa dancing.  Am I sending a signal I like Julio.

Start time: 649.94
End time: 657.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You like Julio you like salsa dancing you like videos.  Every one of them is a little tiny vote for more of the of that.

Start time: 660.19
End time: 662.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do I vote for less of this.  Click hide.

Start time: 662.76
End time: 664.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're over on the right side there's a little but am I.

Start time: 666.39
End time: 668.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is my problem am I hiding Julio.

Start time: 672.72
End time: 694.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No you're hiding that specific post and you what's the signal is it going to give me less Julio.  You're going to see maybe less salsa dancing so it might it.  You don't know how it works but you admit this you are guessing.  I know that it's a signal.  You have no clue.  They are watching the content.

Start time: 695.69
End time: 700.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know they're watching but do you have any clue what any of this is doing.  Don't look behind the curtain gentlemen.

Start time: 701.95
End time: 724.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quite a bit.  Here's here's an example if I post a family photo.  The first people to like it are almost always my family members.  And if I post something like I'm on Twitter like I just did it's goes to a more general audience and it goes further.  So it's keeping track of the kind of content that you click like on and hide and it's trying to bring you more.  I disagree.

Start time: 724.48
End time: 736.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't see how Facebook could possibly distinguish between a post about family members or a post family members to be.  How does it know your family is not named Twit.  Because they're all on my list.  I put them all on my family list.

Start time: 738.52
End time: 740.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if you call a family member a Twitter.

Start time: 741.21
End time: 741.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah exactly.

Start time: 743.52
End time: 747.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Robert I don't want to see your feet.  There's a family list over here.  Yeah.

Start time: 748.94
End time: 769.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You click family and there's 32 people on that.  So those Facebook knows that these people.  I never see her stuff because she's on my family list and I've taught my main feed not to show me her stuff or my brother's.  Wait a minute.  Tavern right.  I don't see.  Look there's a cat photo I never see cat photos on my name.  You're drunk Robert.  This makes no sense.

Start time: 769.52
End time: 780.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're saying I don't see her because she's on my family list but I see more family.  I don't understand.  Because it is.  Isn't that precisely what you want to see more of.  It's building a contextual system that is studying the family.

Start time: 782.42
End time: 794.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's building a contextual system that is studying how to get news to you route news to you and it's trying to pick pick the best 30 things to show you right now.  Right.  Actually I take it back.  You're not drunk.

Start time: 794.54
End time: 795.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook is drunk.

Start time: 796.14
End time: 815.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right here.  I don't want to see this kind of post so I hide that right now.  I see a giga ohm post.  I see Eric who runs Pebble watch.  I see Francisco who does conferences for executives.  I see Steve Jervison who's not only a neighbor.  Is this all stuff you want to see.  Yes this is all high pretty high quality.

Start time: 815.80
End time: 818.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do you know that other stuff you don't you want to see is not on there.

Start time: 819.00
End time: 826.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I can use a list to see all of it and when I click on my acquaintance list for instance I see all my acquaintances.

Start time: 826.40
End time: 831.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know you're the only person in the world who's done this much work.  I hear that.  I know it's a problem.

Start time: 832.12
End time: 841.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean don't you think that that much curation no way in the world.  The average user of Facebook is doing this much curation like you do.  You do this on Google plus your Twitter.

Start time: 843.72
End time: 870.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My signals are helping the engine learn because the way Gmail's filters work the way the machine learning on on Facebook works.  If I teach it how to create a good feed and there's a whole team working on this at Facebook.  They're trying to pick the right thing for the right person at the right time.  If I help that engine by liking things it brings more things into your view.  It feels to me like a pinball game.

Start time: 871.00
End time: 876.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You like something then something else comes and you get too much of that.  It doesn't ever seem to really suit as far as I'm concerned.

Start time: 877.52
End time: 945.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's my friends and I when we compare and I pull out the feed it is running away with the game.  Oh no not even close.  I guarantee you in a year you are going to come back to me and say I was wrong that Facebook is running away with the game particularly if it ships a search engine and if he ships an at work thing.  It is running away with the game.  Here's another way it's running away with the game.  I post a video done on my iPhone on the Facebook app and it's up in two minutes because it's compressing on the GPU of the iPhone and then it's uploading while I'm typing the description.  So by the time I hit publish it nearly goes live instantly.  Google plus I just did the same thing three days ago.  It took 10 hours for a video from my iPhone to get online live.  This is Facebook is running away with the game and all a lot of levels and if Twitter and Google plus don't don't fix what's going on they're going to notice that other people are going away from it.  And I'm not a gamer we talking about is that are those videos searchable for instance if not yet.

Start time: 946.18
End time: 950.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now that's the issue right.  So someone takes a video of themselves in their backyard doing an ice bucket challenge.

Start time: 951.40
End time: 956.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there's the first the first place I went after the earthquake was Twitter.  I didn't even see it consider Facebook.

Start time: 957.48
End time: 965.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook in one minute brought me 20 posts I posted a whole bunch of them right instantly off my iPhone that I Tim Tim what was your what was the first place.

Start time: 965.80
End time: 974.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well you weren't in the Bay Area neither of you are in the Bay Area so no sir that you probably didn't jump up and say at 321 for no reason at all.  Let me check Twitter.

Start time: 976.00
End time: 977.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It didn't even occur to me to go to Facebook.

Start time: 977.76
End time: 981.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll give you a more germane example when you heard Robin Williams died did you go to Twitter.

Start time: 984.38
End time: 988.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah I flipped it on well I flipped it on television because I want you know your TV guy.

Start time: 988.74
End time: 1013.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you my wife my wife yelled she saw it on Facebook.  I went to Twitter and Facebook instantly and I was still very early in the story.  Most people were when I said Robin Williams just died the X Y Z I forget whether it was ABC or somebody is reporting.  People were saying dude is that a hoax right because they didn't believe that it's that it was so early in the news.  I don't think you're calm.

Start time: 1013.96
End time: 1020.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're typical though Robert I think most people would don't think of Facebook as a good source for breaking news.  Absolutely true.

Start time: 1021.56
End time: 1028.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm ahead and that's why I know in a year you're going to come back to me and say you were right.  This thing is running away with the game.

Start time: 1029.82
End time: 1034.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  By game I mean my feed is just filled with social article Farmville.

Start time: 1034.92
End time: 1037.30

Start time: 1043.86
End time: 1052.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 1101.22
End time: 1111.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes it's your fault because you haven't been on Facebook.  It's your showing you interesting stuff from the past hours that you haven't been on Facebook.  I've been on Facebook all day so it's no no that's wrong.

Transcript:  Go ahead.  Go ahead Clayton.  Robert let me ask you this.  I mean I know that pictures get such a huge reaction right.  So in my Facebook feed I just posted you know we were heading on vacation.  I was playing around with this one you know one of these giant as Windows phones and I'm just shooting some photos while my wife was driving.  And so that that post that I put up there a little on the road for a little family vacation it's public.  You know that photo post got 245 likes in just like a matter of minutes.  I had linked to via Twitter this earthquakes course on iTunes University.  That was like an excellent iTunes you course from Cal Academy and said hey you know if you hear something great I was fooling around my iPad when daddy asks you know when your when your child asks what's an earthquake and I linked to that almost no likes.  But you know because I pushed it from Twitter so literally one like compared to nearly 300 likes for a photo.  And that seems anytime I post a news piece on on Facebook very rarely do I get any kind of interest on it.  It's usually just casual junk that gets the most response.

Here's how Facebook today on the air.  Today on the air.  Let me just say this.  This was so.  Go ahead Tim.  Let me give you a chance that you haven't had been able to get awarded edgewise.

Transcript:  I think Robert needs to start up a school for how to use Facebook and then we can send all of our friends to the school.  I'm guessing tuition will be affordable and maybe they'll be financially available.  But if we send all of our friends then maybe Facebook will be a better experience.

Transcript:  I will say let me say this about local advertising.  You're absolutely right.  And I see a lot of small businesses that I work with and and and you know help them with their Facebook advertising and talk with them about this.  And I've done some myself and it's been tremendous.  I mean the amount of granularity that you can get in a community.  So let's say I use this example if you're a you know if you're a local pet store owner or you know you have a small little pet store in some small town in New Jersey.  What better way to get people foot traffic into your store.  You know in addition to the general traffic that's walking by but then by taking out a Facebook ad locally that targets specifically with all of the information you can do now with the power editor inside of Facebook advertising to target those people who a have a pet in that town might be over 33 years old.  So they may have some more disposable income than the 18 year old.  Maybe they own their own home.  You can target all of those people specifically within a specific zip code and you can offer them a coupon of 20 percent off or even a free toy to come in and say hello for the first week while we're opening at the grand opening store nowhere else I think.  Can you get that kind of granularity from from advertising.  But it pays Robert to your point to learn how to use that system instead of just putting up one of those generic posts to try to drive traffic to a post.  Actually how to use the power editor within Facebook can be tremendous for local businesses.

Start time: 1376.68

Start time: 1381.06
End time: 1441.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean here's here's the problem for end users for normal people not not me.  They are going to open up Facebook and Twitter and Google Plus on their phone probably an Android phone and they're going to compare the three and the three probably of the three.  Facebook will have some more interesting things to them.  Their friends are on it.  First of all their work coworkers are on it.  They're the brands that they care about are on it.  And so and they've friended enough they've done enough to get something interesting on that first feed.  For me I see it as a platform that gives me news because I have notifications coming to my phone.  So if if I was somewhere else and there was an earthquake I would see it on Twitter and Facebook in real time and I would know who's the most credible and authoritative person and talking about that.  Normal people don't care about that.  They just want to see do you have any baby photos on the feed.  You go over to Twitter and they follow the Kardashians and that's all they see.  Right.

I feel socially engineered every time I use Facebook.  I absolutely feel that we're always socially do.  Do you all not feel manipulated every time you use Facebook.  Am I wrong.  Don't I don't you feel a little manipulated when you visit.  I've gotten over that feeling that feeling I have by suppressing it.  Robert you know you're being manipulated.  You just you compartmentalize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Today on the air during the earthquake.  Four hour show.  I was on the air this morning at 6 a.m.  Eastern time so about 3 a.m.  Local time there in Petaluma.  And I went right to Twitter about 320 after we were getting word that we had come out of a commercial break and we had a break in with breaking news that there was a 6.0 earthquake in California.  So you know immediately I think about my my in-laws that live right there but also jumped on Twitter to see what you know what the news was.  And if there were any images being shared at that hour certainly dark.  So getting cameras into that area was going to be problem.  But you know we were able to pull up images I was able to get great you know local reports from people who were right in downtown Napa who are seeing people that were trapped buildings that had collapsed.  Minutes before you know maybe 30 minutes before we were able to get you know actual cameras on the ground there.  But it was great to be able to supplement that reporting live on the air from credible sources and some of our reporters who weren't able to actually get boots on the ground.  And that's in that in that area one of our reporters lives right in Napa.  He grew up there and we were able to see reports and photos he was posting to Twitter and pull those up right on the show and using stream board a great app that Robert I think told me about last year to be able to watch all of the commentary you can follow  specific hashtags and see what's being said.  You can then make it more granular to follow just like verified accounts or people with a certain number of followers.  So it might be a news organization or something like that.  But it was a great source of news on the air and I think you know I have a tendency to always go to Twitter when there's pieces of breaking news and information where you want to see the conversation.  I never really see it unfolding on Facebook.  But maybe it's my fault.

Start time: 1659.86

And I can scroll through here and I just get tech news.  There's no cat photos here.  There's no personal memes.  It's everything happening in the tech industry right now.  And it's better than than what I see on Twitter for the general part.  Now breaking news and searching.  Absolutely.  Twitter is still there and I keep Twitter on my screen most of the time.  So it's not really a Twitter versus Facebook thing but Google Plus is falling way.

Transcript:  I'll tell you first of all if you have if you're a person Robert Scobel Leo the port you have a personal profile and you can turn on a feature called follow follow.  So the foundation of Facebook is a friend.  That means I want to see some of your stuff and you want to see some of my stuff.  That's what a friend on Facebook means.  Not a friend in real life but a friend on Facebook.  If you if I don't want to see your stuff I don't friend you and I make you follow me.  Following me means you see some of my stuff and I don't see much of any of your stuff.  If you have a brand page and you click like on it it adds that like to your like area on your profile.  So everybody everybody can see that you like target or like Formula One racing or something like that.  Right. And you'll see a few of those posts on your main feed as well.  You'll also it also automatically adds them to this list over here called pages and public pages and public figures.  And this is everything that I've liked.  And you know the quality is way lower than the main feed.  There's a lot of memes.  There's a lot of cat photos on here.  There's a lot of personal photos.

Transcript:  Robert at some point I would love to get you to do this.  The problem is you're scrolling it grows scrolls by so fast we can't see the result.  And it does seem like this is a technique that requires a PhD in Facebook.  So let's let's I'm not kidding.  I want you to come over and spend some time.  We'll do a special and how to scobalize your feed.  And I'd be very curious.  I'd be willing to try it.  We have somebody in the chat room KB Sriram who is actually interesting.  He's written a script to use Facebook's knowledge graph API or Facebook graph API using some Java code.  He downloads just what he wants from Facebook.  He actually doesn't ever go to Facebook.  This is how I want to use Facebook.  So I'm going to download his code and see if there's a lot of ways to use all these tools.  It's interesting that Facebook that makes it's pretty clear.  And we're going to move on because this is incredibly boring to most people.  But the chat room is having fun with it.

My guess is it's not anywhere near as bizarre and sophisticated as what Robert is doing.  And as you say Robert I doubt many people if any are doing this on Facebook.  I put thousands of hours into Facebook.  See that's just the last thing in the world I'd ever want to do.

Transcript:  What about their strategy which it looks to be cleared now that Facebook and I think this is brilliant has the strategy they don't really care if you spend most of your time at the blue page.  They.  And in fact I noticed my daughter I watch her.  She's 22 using her smartphone.  She goes to Facebook because she's got groups there the her dorm group and her friends from one school and another school and she'll check up on and then she goes to Instagram to see what the pictures there.  She probably isn't fully aware of the fact that she's never left Facebook by going to Instagram is just another branch.  Mike Elgin who our news director is positive that I think he's right that in a few years Facebook may have a hundred apps.  And they don't care because what they what what's very interesting is to watch my daughter not really ever leave Facebook but in fact you know use messenger use Facebook and messenger being extracted from Facebook now as a separate app use WhatsApp.  She said in Mexico she used WhatsApp.  Everybody there used WhatsApp.  She never left the Facebook ecosystem.  And yet it seemed like she was.  I think that's to me is a very smart move.

Facebook they might call it something like workbook or something.  But Zuckerberg is running Facebook on a version of Facebook that we can't see.  And I find that's interesting.  And I'm sure he's working on the search feature that Twitter has.  So and my former boss is at Twitter.

Transcript:  The one thing you did say that was very astute.  They are changing the rules every week.  Every week I noticed something changes about the news feed.  It gets it generally gets better, but sometimes it gets worse in a little bit in a little way.  But the trend line is clear.  It's going like this and it's getting better.  It's dramatically better than it was a year ago, partly because I put in more work on it and given it more signal.  But also because the feed is changing and what they want through the feed is changing.  And they do have the ability to turn you off.  They do have the ability to turn up the knob on you and get you more distribution.

When we ask a question sort of of the day of a story that might be controversial and we want to see where, you know,  and see 50-50 response, you know, half the people torn by this story or this story.  And I like to see the responses from people.  And we post a story on our Facebook page.  You know, we'll get thousands of responses during the show.  And it's great to see all those responses.  But I don't go there for news, typically breaking news during the show.  It just doesn't seem.  You don't know. I don't know.  I don't ever see it in my feed.  So I guess I don't because I don't see it in my feed.  I don't think to go there when I go on Facebook, the stuff that I end up seeing is old, you know, not old information, but it certainly doesn't feel like it's breaking.

How do I turn that off?  There is a way I found the setting, but that's interesting.  I never think of that, but that is probably a significant increase in bandwidth use.

It was just such a special, a special week and seeing people who maybe couldn't afford  the app before saying, you know, I couldn't afford it before, but this really has  changed the way that I read the papers from school now.  And it was really, really touching, you know, because I built it as, as you know,  just as a scratch your own itch thing for myself.

So, but it's doing really well and we're I'm really curious and we can talk about this  later, just with the different size iPhones, how this, you know, what the, I was thinking  about this this week, really what is the definition of a universal app anymore?  With the different phone sizes, you know, a 5.5 inch screen, 4.7 inch iPad, mini iPad  there. What, what does that mean anymore?  What features do you not enable for a larger screen, smaller screen?

Transcript:  That's a good topic for when we come back.  We, we are getting close to we think to an iPhone launch.  We got wonder what September 9th will bring.  Let's talk about it.  But first a word from Gazelle.  Actually, if you've got an iPhone, I got a tip for you.  It is likely we're going to see new phones from Motorola next week, a new iPhone in two  weeks, perhaps new phones, the Galaxy Note 4 in the next couple of weeks.  IFA is coming up in Berlin.  We'll probably see new stuff there.  And I can tell you one thing for sure.  The minute they announce a new iPhone, your current iPhone is going to drop in value.  It's dropping right now.  Go to Gazelle and lock that value in.  This is your chance to get some money for your old stuff to help pay for the new stuff.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E dot com.  You very likely have a few other gadgets in your gadget drawer that you're not using.  Think of it as bundles of greenbacks in that drawer, just sitting there collecting dust.  They, this could be money right now, by the way, when you lock in the price for your  iPhone, they're going to extend it.  Normally it's 30 days.  They're going to extend it all the way to October 10th, giving you time.  No matter when the ship date is on the new iPhone, no matter how long the lines are to  get that new iPhone, get your data transferred over and then ship the iPhone back.  But that price will be the price from today.  And that's the beauty part.  Go to G-A-Z-E-L-L-E dot com and sell your cell phone, your tablet, your iPad, your  Surface, your Apple computer, your Samsung, your Galaxy, all of that.  They'll buy it.  And there's three ways you can get paid.  You can get a check.  If you just want, you know, the standard just we'll send you a check.  You can get a PayPal credit.  That's a little more quick.  And if you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon, I'd get the Amazon gift card because they  bumped that up by a 5%.  Let's see, but you know, let's just see what an old iPad Mini is worth today.  Wi-Fi iPad Mini.  Sixteen, 110 bucks.  That's like just sitting in the drawer.  Wouldn't you, you know, get this and you're locking it in for 30 days.  Actually, you're locking it in if it's an iPhone until October 10th.  Now, when you get the new phone and you're ready to ship the old phone in, you check  out and they'll send you a box, prepaid postage.  If you forget to wipe the data, don't worry, they'll do it for you.  Then they'll send you the money.  It's a really great way to sell your gadgets.  The fast and simple way.  If you're upgrading to a new iPad, new MacBook, do it with Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.  But again, do not delay because those gadgets are not gaining in value.  And the minute the announcement happens, they're going to plummet.  What?  5S was worth how much unlocked?  300 bucks.  I'm going to make money.  I'm going to make money.  A new iPhone.  We're going to see, you know, I'm thinking the rumors are congealing.  Yeah, definitely.  That's probably not a very auspicious image in your mind, but the rumors feel like  they're kind of converging, maybe a better word, onto two iPhones, a 4.7 inch  iPhone and a 5.5.  You think we'll see both, Tim, on September 9th?

Start time: 2734.04
End time: 2785.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm inclined to think that we will see both devices on that date.  I don't know whether they'll launch simultaneously.  There's definitely a chance that Apple will say one's going to be out next week  and the other one maybe will be a month later.  Certainly, we've heard issues of low yields on some of their display componentry  that might be causing some shortages when it comes to supply.  But but short of that, I think they would probably like to have both launched  simultaneously, and it'll be interesting to see how that goes, how they message the  two, how they differentiate the two, because, you know, they did launch, of course,  the 5C not that long ago, and the messaging there was very much, you know,  this is not a cheaper phone.  This is just a different type of phone.  But I think that these are going to have to be a little bit more focused devices  when it comes to the messaging, a little bit more focused in terms of usage and,  you know, maybe aiming to a professional's versus just casual users and that kind of  thing. So I think we'll see some interesting marketing and some interesting  advertising. And I'm curious to see what the message is on September 9th.

So on the five point five inch.  So like what did he say to a 2208?  Is that right?  2208 times 1248 on the five point five inch screen.  And he did a whole lot of math on it.

Start time: 2933.88
End time: 2954.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The five point five is 2208 by 1242.  Yeah.  And that would be four hundred sixty one pixels per inch.  Ironically, more than these smaller iPhones.  You'd think those would have a higher density.  The four point seven would be 1334 by 750.  Is this because it's doubled and tripled?  Is that why they come up with this?

Transcript:  That's impressive. Serious questions, though, I think, too, when I'm thinking about,  you know, some of the different apps that when I think about Read Quick, for instance,  about, well, you know, there's a difference.  We made it a universal app for a reason. Right.  But there's different versions of it.  So what does it mean to have the app running on an iPad, an iPad Air, an iPad Mini?  Then what does it mean to have it on such a small device when you're in line at a Starbucks?  Well, then what does it now mean to have it on five point five inch screen?  What sorts of buttons can we employ there?  What sorts of things will pop up?  What sorts of tools will pop up on that screen?  And I know that obviously Apple seems to be pushing developers in that direction  to really consider these different screen sizes when they're building their apps tall.  And, you know, I know there's been plenty of rumors out there about.  Go ahead.  Oh, I was going to say with with split screen apps now,  let me see what the surface we know I always say we'll have that. Right. Right. So.  A lot. A lot of developer questions I'm having.  Yeah, I bet. A couple of weeks.

Start time: 3057.86
End time: 3163.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  His point is that if you make the four point seven inch  1334 by 750, that's double the pixel density.  Doubles easy to do, you know, for a developer.  You want to do multiples.  You don't want to do one point six, eight times, because then that's tough.  The five and a half inch he's thinking will be three times the density.  And I'll read you his reasoning.  First, I'm assuming that both the four point seven and five point five inch rumors are true.  Second, I'm assuming a 69 aspect ratio for both displays.  Given these assumptions and the Pythagorean theorem,  it's easy to create a spreadsheet model that gives you the pixels per inch  resolution for a given pixel count.  Given the height and width and pixels, we could solve for the diagonal  and pixels a squared plus b squared equals c squared, starting with value.  Oh, forget it.  He's just showing off now.  Anyway, but that makes sense because you want to make it easy for developers.  And did you see the Android  fragmentation graphic that came out this week?  And it shows you why what Apple's trying to avoid.  There are so many different Android devices  and so many different this is this is the graphic for Android users.  This is from OpenSignal.  This this looks like my hard drive.  Defragging defragging each rectangle represents a unique Android device.  Of according to OpenSignal, which makes software for mobile devices  that track cell phone towers and Wi-Fi signals.  So they're getting this data from the field.  There are get this 18,796 different unique Android devices.  Imagine your do you do read quick for Android?

Transcript:  This is the various Android screen sizes that you have to deal with.  They're all over the place.  Now, iPad and iPhone, it's very linear.  And then and this is the key.  If you add the new iPhone, it goes right in here in the box.  You know, it's not nearly so  crazy Android versions over time.  These graphs are just bizarre.  Ninety one percent of iOS devices run the latest version.  So that's also simplification for you.

I'm hearing better battery, but that's to be expected with a larger phone.  But you know what I'm saying, like the four S had Siri, the four the four did not.  Because they're being released at the same time, probably the same camera.  Everything else, you know, everything else will be the same.  My question, though, will be will one of them have larger storage?  Will that be an incentive to get the larger iPhone  because it has an increased storage capacity for business or something?  If you're on the road and you need that extra storage, I don't know.  But everything else probably will be the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we've been waiting for 128 gig phones for a long time now,  and this is certainly be a good time for them to do that battery life.  Absolutely. I would definitely expect a much bigger battery life from the larger device.  I'm curious what they advertise it as.  You know, they've always pretty much advertised the same battery life  for each new generation of iPhone.  It'll be interesting, I think good for them to maybe finally step away from that  and show something a little bit different with these new larger devices.  And pixel density does play a role in that, too.  The higher pixel density usually need a more powerful backlight,  which then decreases your battery life.  So that's probably another issue that they're trying to deal with,  if indeed those display yields are indeed lower than they are supposed to be.  But I think battery life should be better.  Pixel density higher is great, of course.  In terms of features, I mean, there's been a lot of talk about NFC now,  which is interesting, of course.

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm hearing NFC as well.  And I had heard that Apple wanted to do, you know, a significant move  for Passbook last year, but really wasn't ready for prime time.  With what they wanted to do with NFC.  So it'll be interesting to see, you know, perhaps who takes the stage with Apple  or at least who's featured with Apple.  Because, you know, I think about NFC and I think about the stores  that I would like to see involved with an NFC play.  I hate carrying my wallet.  You know, I've got the giant, you know, like Costanza size wallet.  And, you know, now when I go into the city, I just take my phone  and I can buy my train ticket using my phone.

Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, we should tell people what iBeacon is.  It's a little radio that costs less than $10.  It spits three numbers into the air every second.  And your phone, whether it be Android or iPhone, can see how close it is.  Your iPhone, if you have an iPhone, it has one of these radios in it.  It's not on, but the iBeacon software can turn it on.  So if you get a new app from Target or Macy's,  or if you go to Coachella next year, they had Beacons on the field there.  So as you walk around the field, stuff can happen on your iPhone  that can show you where you are.  It feels to me like Apple could do everything that you can do with NFC.

I know our mutual friend, Renee Richie, talks about,  it's crazy to think that Canada, how far advanced they are for payments with NFC up there.  Everything from train tickets to gas payments to food purchases,  all NFC enabled, but they come to the United States and we're woefully behind the times.  I think if some of the partners like with Google, I go to Home Depot quite a bit.  And at the checkout at Home Depot, I believe they have the Google Wallet and PayPal.  But this is one of the rare occasions where I see like Google Wallet payment out in the wild.  So I think it'll be important to have who appears on stage with Apple  for an NFC announcement in a few weeks.

Transcript:  One of the things people are using NFC for a lot now, it's not payments, but  is tap to pair where the NFC does the Bluetooth pairing kind of automatically.  And I see devices in the store all over the place where you just tap your phone to it  and it'll handle all the ugly details of a Bluetooth pairing.  You can't do it on an iPhone.  Alone, that might be a reason.  Even iHome, which makes all those iPhone gadgets, has NFC tap to pair.  That might be a reason too, not just payments.  But you're right, the money is in payments.  Somebody in the chat room said, here we go again, the annual iPhone will have NFC fantasy.

Transcript:  Right, like coin.  I would love to be able, in partnering with a lot of major credit card companies and payment  structure that way, so I could just put my credit card information right inside my iPhone.  Type it in the way that you would keep on.  Inside now, you can keep that with what's the name of Apple's one password structure.  Keychain.  Credit cards.  Keychain.  Exactly.  You can already keep your credit cards on file within keychains.  Enabling keychain support through NFC and being able to pay with the credit card of choice  upon checkout without having to carry your wallet, your metro card,  and all these other things would be fantastic.

Transcript:  I totally buy into this and the idea that Apple can have this ecosystem.  They've got the credit cards.  They have the whole thing.  So many times we've seen Apple poised, really ready to do something like this,  and just unable to pull the trigger for whatever reason.  Passbook's a good example where they've had that for how many years?  And they've really done nothing with it.  It's got my target card and an airplane boarding pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was really disappointed after a long...  I was super excited about it.  You know, think Amtrak and multiple boarding passes and all of those things.  And after launch, it was impossible to even figure out how to get it from the app  into Passbook to be able to use the little certificate,  the little share sheet certificate that you would take with you.  Well, I mean, it seemed like...  And it was using some weird...  Before iOS 8, it was using some weird URL scheme, right?  Wasn't it?  That was the only way you could do a handoff before extensions.  So now with extensions, I think you're going to see a whole new...  You know, a whole new life for Passbook using extensions.  But yeah, before it was some really janky URL handoff.  And most of the apps, you would wonder why Delta or Delta could do it,  but Southwest didn't know how to do it.  Right.  Or, you know, United...  I have to blame Apple.  ...but couldn't do it.

We'll make sure it happens.  Apple just seems to...  Whether they lack the resources, they lack the commitment,  they don't have the leadership from the top,  something's missing that's keeping them from capitalizing on iBeacon.  Right, Robert?  I mean, iBeacon's been around for two years now.

Transcript:  And to hold the hands of developers like that  and really try to bring corporate partners on board,  you know, I think that they just expect that everybody's going to want to be on board  and want to be a part of it.  And so I think that probably plays part of the reason  for the lack of success.  And I also wonder how much, you know, talking about NFC  and why we had to wait so long for,  how much they really expected Bluetooth LE to take off  and maybe they were making some movements behind the scenes  to try to get that rolled out into point-and-sale terminals  and ultimately just got no traction whatsoever  and they're finally, you know, thrown in the bag and going with NFC now.

Start time: 3864.83
End time: 3873.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Transcript:  Well, the proof will be in the pudding, right?  When we saw the announcement of HomeKit  and the health initiative from Apple, right?  We have, we're all pontificating about how great this is going to be  for blood pressure being sent right to your doctor.  And, you know, if you live in rural West Virginia,  a place that I know well and I was a reporter years ago,  I mean it was like 45 minutes to an hour to get to a heart center.  And that's a real concern for people that live in those areas.  And certainly I talked to, I led a panel on healthcare at CES  and we talking about the inefficiency of getting information  to certain parts of the world,  being able to have smartphones in those areas  with heart rate monitors on the back  to be able to put your thumbprint on there to have it read that information.  So can HomeKit carry the torch?  Exactly what you're saying, Leo.  And HomeKit and also the health initiative.  Here it is.  Here's our HomeKit.  Now, are we going to work with a few big partners to make sure,  are we going to work with you,  are we going to work with Nest owned by Google  to make some of these big things happen  or are we just going to wait and let it die on the vine again?

Start time: 3972.70
End time: 3996.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that part of the problem is that Apple wants to keep it all to itself  and it doesn't work that way.  Although as Jeff Nenos points out, this is endemic in the tech industry.  Google has an issue, you know, how many initiatives  has Google announced and then just forgotten about?  I think there's a lack of follow through in general.  All these companies are ADD and they just go, what?  Oh, squirrel.  And then they're off doing something else.

I've given several speeches in the last couple of months,  some to computer science people, and they have no idea what beacons are.  And so it's an education process.  It takes time.  This is why Doug Engelbart got kicked out of his own research lab in the 1970s.  He's better than the mouse in the windows.

But even when they integrated with passbook later  and you would go up to the attendance, I don't know if you would notice that  when you go to the different gates and they would look at you like you were an idiot.  Give me, you have a boarding pass?  No.  Right. You have a boarding pass on your phone.  That's what is that?  What?  You got to go back to the counter.

Your sandwich, your coffee in the morning, your books.  And there's a machine in this in the sandwich shop.  So when you say I want a sandwich, it sends the order to the machine.  It lights up.  It beeps and it spits out a receipt.  The receipt goes into the workflow of the restaurant and you walk in and pick up your  sandwich and you leave.  You don't hand them a credit card.  And already 70% of all the transactions at Santa Clara University are going through to Pingo.  Is that an NFC technology?

So they've kind of used that capital audience to start to launch concept cars and that kind of thing as well.  So that's part of the reason why that's happening.

Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix who do GoToMeeting.  I've told you so many times how important GoToMeeting is.  It's in fact the only way we meet at the Twitbrick house because nowadays many of the people we meet  with are not here.  Just like this show.  They're spread out all over the world.  That shouldn't stop you.  Thanks to the internet, we can meet practically face-to-face with people using GoToMeeting.  They're HD video conferencing, crystal clear.  Everybody's got a camera now.  You see people just like you're in the same room with them.  Because you're using GoToMeeting, you also see their screens or they see your screens.  It's as if you're showing them your PowerPoint presentation or collaborating together on a  document.  Eliminate the expensive and time consuming travel.  It makes those meetings more effective.  Everybody knows meetings are kind of the backbone of business, but you don't want to spend more  time than you have to.  Citrix GoToMeeting makes it easy.  By the way, one low flat rate per month makes it easy to have as many meetings as you need  as long as you want, anytime, anywhere.  It is a fabulous system and I want you to try it free for 30 days.  If you visit GoToMeeting.com, you click the Try It Free button, the big orange button there,  and use the promo code TWIT, you got 30 days free.  They don't, I don't think they even ask you for a credit card.  It just really is simple.  GoToMeeting.com, promo code TWIT, 30 days free from Citrix.  It is definitely the way to meet in modern times.  It is in effect the Mercedes concept car of online meeting.  It's funny, this is just, I just saw this and I said, I'm not even a car guy and I said,  I want that.  Vic Condotra was there.  We now know what Vic is doing since he left Google and Google Plus, he's going to car shows.  Pretty much whatever he wants to, I think.  He's retired.  What else?

Or over the next five years, you're going to see a lot of things that you're going to put on your body to study whether you're having a heart attack or having cancer or on and on.  Right.

Transcript:  I used to help run a consumer electronics store in the 80s.  And I learned one thing about how people buy things.  They don't want to appear stupid.  If all of their friends who are the people in this chat room say,  there's no apps on this thing or look, I have both of them.  Marcus Brownlee carries both of them and all three of them.  He's not a good example because he's a reviewer.  People like that influence us.  If you have a teacher who's really into tech or a friend who's really into tech,  you ask him, what should I buy?  He's going to say, well, the iPhone has the best apps.  The Android phones have the best choice and it's cheaper.  And the Windows Phone has no support at all.  None of us use it.  So which one are you going to buy?  You're going to buy the one that your friends have.  And that's the real problem.  It's a real problem for Microsoft.  And that's why if I was at Microsoft,  that's the most interesting problem to work on.  And I like to work on interesting problems.  I don't like to just...  But what about the cloud?

Start time: 5334.16
End time: 5379.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about the cloud?  Look, here's my position on this.  Just as in the 90s, Microsoft, by creating a solid platform for developers  as close to a universal platform as you can get for PCs,  established the PC revolution.  There was no question that without Microsoft,  there is no PC revolution because they built a platform everybody else could build on.  Well, it's clear the PC is not the platform.  It's clear there is fragmentation in the mobile space.  What is the platform for the 2010s?  It's the cloud because the cloud is cross-platform.  That's where apps should be built.  That's where apps are being built.  And that's where the future is.  And Microsoft has a strong play there.  And Nadella knows it.  He came from the Azure Services Division.  The question, though, is how do they monetize that?

Start time: 5380.08
End time: 5418.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a very different sort of thing.  If you're charging somebody $100 for each new version of Windows  or $200 or a lot more for each new version of Office,  they can't charge for Office anymore because of Google Drive  and everything we've been speaking about.  Cloud is great, but they're basically giving away OneDrive at this point.  I don't know how many gigs of OneDrive storage that I have  that have been shoveled at me over the years,  and I have no interest in paying for it.  Even if they do build out OneDrive to be the ultimate solution for consumers,  and they do build out a lot of great services around that,  is there any possible way of monetizing the cloud  that will bring them anywhere near where they used to be  when everyone was buying Windows and everybody was buying Office?  That's a very interesting fact.

Start time: 5418.74
End time: 5430.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is even the rumor, and it's apparently credible  according to Mary Jo Foley and Paul Therotte,  that the next version of Windows will be free.  So that really does put them in a very difficult position.  If you can't sell devices and you can't sell software.

Start time: 5431.20
End time: 5445.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They still load it up with a whole bunch of crap, right?  Because most of the PCs you buy, you don't get a pure Windows 8 experience,  you get loaded up with eBay and other random apps  that come still built on right there when you launch it.

Start time: 5455.08
End time: 5484.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do you monetize?  How do you keep a company that's based on these incredibly  high margin products like Windows and Office?  How do you get that transition that company  is something that's so much more low margin or no margin?  That's actually a very good point.  And yet the cloud, from the point of view of the enterprise,  is exactly what you need to be doing.  And I think there is an opportunity to sell licenses to cloud services.  SaaS.  Software as a service.  Isn't that the future?

Start time: 5485.55
End time: 5515.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And you can make a lot of money on the back end.  Ultimately, there are going to need to be a lot of servers running this stuff,  and there'll need to be a lot of integration,  especially in corporations and that kind of thing.  There's certainly a lot of money to be made on that side.  But if your sole revenue stream is coming from enterprises, really,  and if you're having to chase after advertising or something,  so sort of minor incremental revenue stream from consumers,  that's nowhere near if you can get the Windows NT set of things on the business side  and have all of your enterprise customers  and also have all the consumer customers that they had 10, 15 years ago.

So they were making the point like if you live in these cities,  you don't need to be buying bottled water.

Very famous because it's getting it from the Skykill reservoir or something.  It's supposed to be very, very, I think Consumer Reports rated it the best water  that you throw out the avion.  That stuff's from France, that can't be good.  And have your good old fashioned American tap water right there.  Skykill's a beautiful place too.

Transcript:  Here's a story I thought was very interesting.  It's not breaking news, but I thought it was very interesting.  A study published in Science Express, they describe four experiments based on their results.  People are recalling information less because of Google.  Why bother to remember when you could just Google it?  In fact, what people are doing instead of trying to remember something is remembering how to find it.  That makes sense.  Here's the tally of tests to see if you're one of these people.  Imagine somebody asks you, and I'll ask you right now, everybody in the audience,  how many countries have flags with only one color?  Some of you, you old timers, will start thinking of flags.  Most of you will start thinking of where you would search to find that.  Yes?  Wow.  Yeah.  How do I Google that?  Right?  Welcome to the 21st century.  This concept, by the way, is not new to the computer age.  It's called transactive memory.  That's the sum of information held by a group.  Think of it as a group of experts working as a team where each person has their own area of expertise.  But now, of course, we don't need the team.  What are you looking at?  What is that?  Oh, he's looking at...  And you Googled it.

Transcript:  Is it evolutionary, though?  I'm curious.  There are certain things that we needed to remember more of 300 years ago.  Are these things now less important to us that we don't need to worry about them  because the tools have come along so that part of our brain has shut down?  Not shut down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember my home phone number as a kid.  I vividly remember that.  But I haven't had to memorize a number since because my phone does it.  And in fact, when you exchange numbers these days,  what's the easiest way to do it?  You have somebody will...  I don't know what my number is.  Let me just call you.  And now it's in your phone.  Right?

Start time: 6149.00

Transcript:  When I was...  I was a software developer for a long time.  And when I first started to learn software development in the 90s,  it was a lot of memorization of APIs and calls and things like that.  But as the tools got better and as the research abilities got better,  you didn't have to learn APIs anymore because the tools are going to look up everything for you.  At that point, it just became kind of a game of remembering what each module could do,  what each language could do, roughly.  And knowing where to look to find it, basically.  But you didn't have to remember anything anymore.  And suddenly you could go out and learn a new programming language in a couple of days  because you only needed to get the syntax down.  You didn't have to memorize every little bit.  And ultimately, that made me a much more powerful programmer.  And I think that that's kind of the general approach that we're being able to take to  our day-to-day lives now with the smartphones and being able to look up things  dynamically and get directions to places.  You don't have to remember even how to get anywhere anymore, which is...  I think it's a good thing.  I do too.

Transcript:  But I worry about the vapidness, though, with the...  Because just the level of information we have access to now and we know...  I mean, and Tim, I'm sure you can speak to this as a writer and the reaction that  you would get from longer posts on Engadget.  We see this with BuzzFeed and the smaller and smaller snippets of information.  People are only looking at screens for a few seconds before they move on to the next thing.  They're not really sitting there reading 40-minute articles or digesting 10,000 words  like we used to.  And so I know there was a period, I felt like there was a two-year period  that where I just don't think I remembered a damn thing.  Where I used to sit inside of Barnes and Noble for hours and just read  Foreign Policy Magazine and Time Magazine and just go through these large articles.  Then when I would go on the air, I would be able to have deep contextual analysis.  And I would be able to pull from this as a history major and be able to say,  well, back in 1960, this happened.  There was a two-year period a few years ago where I felt dumb as a rock.  I just felt like I wasn't remembering anything and I couldn't contextualize  large pieces of information.  I couldn't contextualize news stories in a way that I used to be able to.  And I really blame that on just consuming small snippets of information  and not sitting for long periods of time.  Factoids, yeah.

Start time: 6328.96
End time: 6342.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How you know them.  So people that you met at a given meeting or you can run queries in there to say,  Who is this?  Why do I know them?  Who did I meet at this meeting?  And I should recuse myself and say that I've actually done some advising with Human.  Oh.  So I should make that clear.

Start time: 6342.94
End time: 6350.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, well, don't recuse yourself.  We now understand that you have some relationship with them.  But tell us more.  I think this is interesting.

Start time: 6351.02
End time: 6386.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the idea is basically to bring some of this intelligence in a modern system to your contact  book.  So instead of just saying, so and so's last name begins with A, so therefore he's at the top.  Say instead, this is the person that I call a lot, so therefore they're going to be at the top.  Or I'm traveling to San Francisco.  Who do I know who lives in San Francisco?  And then post a message and say, Hey, I'm in San Francisco.  Or I need to get an introduction to somebody at Google because I'm looking to get a job there.  Who do I know who works at Google?  Or who do I know who knows somebody who works at Google?  And basically trying to bring that sort of smart and that sort of real world context and  relationships to an app effectively.

Start time: 6387.14
End time: 6448.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It also keeps your contact list up to date because let's say I have an old business card  from Tim Stevens that I scanned five years ago and it's in my Google Contacts and he got a new  job and a new phone and a new email address.  And I don't know any of that.  He can validate his account and say, Oh, if anybody has these things in their contacts,  replace them with the new thing and send it out.  And then everybody's contact list gets up to date.  And it's really nice.  How do you, so it's Plaxo?  It's similar to Plaxo, but it's for mobile phone.  It's much nicer than Plaxo and it's contextual.  So if we're together, it starts telling us information about each other, which is nice.  And it also, if I add you, let's say I meet you at a party or something and I ask, Hey,  can I enter your email address into my contact list?  It'll even keep track of what party we met at.  So, you know, four years later when I...

Start time: 6448.60

Start time: 6456.90
End time: 6480.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And because of that, it can actually say, if you've got a meeting coming up, it'll say,  you've got a meeting with Betty, who you met at this party and show you Betty's picture.  So when you walk into that meeting, you'll now know what Betty looks like, because I'm  terrible with names, which may tie back to this other issue that we're talking about,  not being able to remember anything anymore.  But the app will basically prompt you about the people that you're about to see and where  you met them and kind of give you some contextual clues to help you remember who those people were.  Which is also a great issue.

We talked a lot about Apple.  What about Motorola?  Watch?  The 360?  A new Moto X?  I see.  I thought the Moto X was like the best Android phone of the year.  You're all iPhone users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But is it going to be ahead of the curve?  I think that's the question.  I think Moto X was a good phone, but it just felt like it was maybe six months too late.  Maybe it's too late.  Yeah.  It was a phone that I think a lot of people loved because of the personalization too,  which is certainly nice.  And I hope that they maintain that.

Because I was excited.  Apparently LG is also going to do a round Android Wear watch.  And of all the watches so far until Apple does its watch, I think the Android Wear is the one.  But they're ugly and clunky and square.  Motorola's got this round 360.  But I'm going to ruin this for you now.  And somebody told me this and it's really pissing me off.

Transcript:  Let's see.  YouTube subscription service music.  Somebody might know more about this than I.  I don't understand.  I do understand that most kids these days there's no music on MTV.  They're watching Big Brother if they're watching MTV.  But if they want to watch or listen to music.  I see my son do this they'll queue up YouTube videos.  And that's how you get music.  If you're under 25 that's where music comes from is YouTube.

Start time: 7232.64
End time: 7286.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right but the big problem is you can't take that offline of course.  Ah yeah and that's part of part of the solution that's going to be offered by this music key  service supposedly at least.  Is that you'll be able to queue up those things and take them offline with you including  supposedly concert footage and things like that too should be interesting.  And there's been a lot of discussions and leaks about YouTube's offline video service  for a long time now and I've been pretty eager to see if YouTube could offer that.  So I'm curious to see if that'll get rolled into this as well or if it'll just be YouTube  offline for music based stuff.  But I think it'd be great if you could you know if you've got a flight coming up if you  could go to make a big playlist of you know subscriptions on YouTube and funny videos  and download them all and take it on the plane with you I think that'd be great.  And ten dollars a month if you could do pay that and have you know ad free videos forever  on YouTube that'd be pretty great too.  But right now at least the leak is just pointing to music service.  Offlineable YouTube video stuff and it will also tie into the the play music service too.

Transcript:  So you'll get both for 10 bucks a month.  Android police had this exclusive earlier this week.  I do like one of the features is no ads.  So that's the big drawback if you're watching if you like made a playlist of YouTube videos  of songs you like you got to have a you know there's going to be an ad in between them.  So you can if you pay 10 bucks it will eliminate the ads offline.  I think that's less desirable just because those are big files right.  And then background audio so it will continue to play on your Android device  after you exit out of it which I don't think YouTube does right now right.

Transcript:  No well if you have one of the Galaxy devices you can do the picture in picture stuff and some  other Android devices have customizations like that.  But I'm curious if this is built into the the Android YouTube app or if they'll have a new  app because right now you know you can search for artists and that kind of thing but you can't  browse down through an artist discography like you can through Spotify for example.  So I would think they would need to do some pretty significant enhancements to the YouTube  app to make it work like this which kind of feels like you know shoving a square peg in  a round hole.  So I'm curious to see how they how they handle that how they make the YouTube app  better for music playback than it is now or if they really rely on the play music services  and then kind of just have ties out to video when needed.

You know if it comes with Google Play Music that makes Google Play Music all the more enticing.  Absolutely.  That's what I use for my music because I love it because you've got 20 million albums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I use Spotify as well.  I still use play music for my offline collection you know my old CDs that I've ripped and that  kind of thing.  I almost left Spotify for beats just because it was getting difficult to manage playlists  especially if you wanted to take an entire artist discography offline.  I didn't think they were doing that very well but they just recently changed with the my  music system we can now save an artist and then tag albums that you want and mark those  for offline playback which is much much easier than it used to be.  So since they made that change I'm pretty happy with that.  I also like the the inclusion of desktop apps and they voted to play right from the web  too which means I can play from from pretty much anywhere.

Transcript:  You know I'm still sort of old school I love the idea of owning my own albums.  I had a huge wall of CDs growing up and I used to sit there for hours in my room and  listen to Pink Floyd and R.M. and all these other albums and so I would digest that stuff.  So the idea of sort of curating my own stuff has been great but as I've gotten older I mean  I'll launch iTunes and just play my own albums and playlists that I've created.  But as I've gotten older I realize like my playlist like 20 songs deep now and really  I just want someone else to do the thinking for me that when I'm going to listen to music  I don't want to have to think about all the extra layers of building playlists.  I love songs.  I'm a huge fan of songs.  Google just bought them.  Oh yeah yeah so you pick you know you're able to pick the mood that you're in so if you're  having you know we're out on the patio cooking on the barbecue or something like that or having  a cookout just afternoon hit those songs and it'll you know I love like the Ron Burgundy  bachelor pad playlist that the songs that has curated.  They have one oh I want that.  Oh yeah there's so many great and you know what they actually work with certain artists  like David Byrne and others to sort of well curate their own list.  That was the promise of Beats too.
