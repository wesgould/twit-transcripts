Transcript:  Well, you know, my husband works for a news channel, so when it's a holiday for everyone else, it's usually not for us. So he works when there's holidays. I as a longtime broadcaster, I always work holidays and weekends. Yeah, yeah.  It's hard. You don't have. Yeah, you don't have them off. No. But don't cry for me, Argentina.

Transcript:  Actually, Argentina plays tomorrow, I think. So don't worry about that one. Also here, Denise Howell wearing her EFF t shirt. She's, of course, the host of This Week in Law, blogger at Bags and Bags and Bags.  Baggage and we just love Denise. Hi, it's great to be back. A practicing working attorney on the show. What a thought. Yes. That's why you're here today, because the Supreme Court's been busy and we need your help. They have been busy.  We also welcome Tim Stevens from Engadget. I'm sorry, CNET. Rewind. I was living in the past. It's only been a year now. One of these days I'll figure it out.

Start time: 204.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can rewind a little bit and give me the CNET title. You both. Had you ever worked for CNET, Denise? Because I worked for CNET too. I worked for ZDNet. Well, I blogged for them. That's close enough, right? Are you part of the Facebook page? There's an ex CNET employee Facebook page. No, I'll have to sign up.

Start time: 224.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would win a prize because I was the fourth employee of CNET. Are you part of that page? I'll invite you. I want to be on that page because I was Shelby Lyman and the weirdo. Who's that? Who was the other guy? I've forgotten him. He got in trouble with the state of California for not paying his taxes. He bought a race horse because he looked it in the eyes and he could see it was a winner. I forgot his name.  I can't. It just gives me. You know what I'm talking about. Oh, his reputation precedes him. Yes. Halsey Minor. That's it. That's it. Yeah. And I remember he told me there that Halsey Minor at the University of Virginia. There's a Halsey Hall and a minor hall and they're right across the street because his family is an old Virginia family. He comes from money. And I was like the fourth employee. It was just the two of them when I was hired to be the VP of programming for one week. And I was out the door. And that was it. Were you there?  When Ryan Seacrest was there? Oh, no, no, no. He came after me. I literally I did their first pilot with the VORAC and I'll mean I go way back. But that's a long and boring story. Let's get into the news because there's a lot of it. We'll be talking about Google I.O. in a bit. And I do have the most valuable gimme. You know, every year at Google's Developer Conference, they give away notebooks, they give away phones, they give away the Google queue, which they never even sold. That's got to be worth something if you still have your Google queue. But this year, yeah, you got Android Wear watches. Sure.

Start time: 314.32
End time: 349.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But more to the point, you got cardboard. You have yours, Tim, because you were at Google I.O. I do. Yeah. I actually haven't opened mine yet. So it's still in the folded up form, totally unopened. I'm going to shrink wrap that thing. I'm going to go down the comic book store and get one of those acid free baggies, I think, and put it in there. You should store it for a couple of decades. We just checked on eBay. Eighty six bucks for Google cardboard unopened. Assembled, I think is going to have less. It's less valuable, but unopened.  Right out of them. I know some people who were at the keynote who came out the door too late and weren't able to get them. So you didn't have to get out there early.

Start time: 350.22
End time: 391.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I got mine. Gina and Jeff were there. I wasn't there. But they gave me mine. This was this was a flat piece of cardboard. Gina took the time to assemble it in the car right up here. It's got a little magnet thing on the side with a rubber band. It's got some plastic lenses. That's the only thing that'd be hard to get. They do have the plans online. And then you could either go to a website or download on the Google Play Store the free cardboard app.  You put on your smartphone has to be an Android phone. You put the smartphone in here. It senses that it's in the box and it gives you it gives you a VR view. And I think the whole thing is that for a buck fifty they made something that's worth that does the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's better than Oculus Rift does for two billion because it does. It's stereo. Pretty impressive. It's actually better. They were able to pull that together for something so cheaply. And people were very excited to see it. I mean, I tweeted when I got mine and I don't know how many hundred retweets I got out of that thing. But yeah, it is an interesting way to get VR in the hands of more people. I mean, people have certainly heard about VR for a long time and not everyone has had the chance to try out Oculus. And you know, this isn't as good as Oculus, but it certainly I think it's better than Oculus. How is it not as good? So here's a stare. First of all, Oculus Rift is a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good

Start time: 421.36
End time: 451.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oculus. Well, this is OK. So it's using an Android phone. Apparently that's enough compute power to do what Oculus does. This is this was the very fun thing they put out on the Moto X where it's a game where you look around and you follow a hat. It's called Windy Day. But if you put it in here and you don't let your camera fall out, yes, you look around. I wish you could see this, but you're looking around. You look down, you look up, there's the hat. Where'd it go? Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. And the accelerometer in the phone, it works.

Start time: 452.50
End time: 489.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How big is that? Because Android phones vary so much in size. Yeah, this is a 5 inch. This is the HTC One. It's 5 inches, but it would fit a variety. As you can see, it's you know, I don't think it would make the 6 inch. It scales because it's got little lenses. And you know what? How is it not as good as Oculus Rift? I just don't think that the optical quality is quite as good as an Oculus, given that it's dealing with multiple sized phones. And I think the lenses are a little bit cheaper. But yeah, I mean, it's nine tenths of the way there for like a set of other  small fraction of the cost. It's kind of thing that you can ship somebody in the mail for, you know, a buck 25 and they can get a feel for what VR is like. You know, whether or not they should get excited about it.

Start time: 489.44
End time: 498.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And who doesn't have an Android phone? You could do this. And somebody said, well, your arms get tired. Well, it'd be easy enough to just to glue a little rubber, you know, strap. Actually, I have a rubber band.  I think it'll work to put this on.

End time: 526.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See, Google's had problems because they give away such great stuff.  You know, they gave her thousands of dollars with this stuff last year that that nobody can get in anymore.  They had to have a lottery to get in.  I think half the people going there aren't developers. They just want free crap.  So give away cardboard and maybe it'll be easier to get into the developers conference.  And frankly, this is giving me a lot of joy, as you can see.

Start time: 527.36
End time: 532.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They either want to free stuff or they wanted to protest one or the other.  But those are the two hot tickets, cardboard or protesting.

Start time: 533.18
End time: 549.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we noted that Google at the beginning of the of the I.O. keynote noted that 20 percent of the attendees of Google I.O. this year were female.  But I want to point out that 50 percent of the protesters were female.  So there's still some catching up to do.  Here's my Oculus Rift.

Start time: 551.62
End time: 565.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We got tweeted from, let's see, who is this?  G Rajeev on Twitter that the Dodo case people are making their own model and they're calling it the Google Cardboard VR Toolkit for 1995.

Start time: 566.48
End time: 640.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Perfect. Not bad. Cheaper than eBay.  And there's no wires. It's wireless.  They have a museum tour. They have a tour of Versailles.  I mean, I think I don't know. I think this does everything the Oculus Rift does.  Anyway, that's enough of that.  We'll talk about what Google announced to Google I.O. because it's a kind of a mishmash.  And I want to get everybody involved in that.  But before we do, we should talk about the Supreme Court because those those the SCOTUS was a little bit busy on Friday with two, I think, land.  Well, important rulings. One may be a landmark ruling.  But let's start with a less important ruling.  And that's the one that's got all the geeks ahead up.  And that's the area ruling. Now, Denise had a great this week in law on Friday discussing the area ruling.  And I certainly point you to that show if you want to really go into detail.  But let's it's called Monkeys, Ducks and Unicorns.  And one of your guests was Sonia West was from the University of Georgia, right?  Yeah, their school of law.  She was an expert on this whole issue.  But maybe, Denise, you can kind of summarize.  What did the Supreme Court rule?

Start time: 642.90
End time: 676.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the Supreme Court tried to do something very limited and say that somebody who is doing what Aereo does in the way Aereo does it  is directly infringing copyright law by engaging in a public performance of the copyrighted works here,  the free over the air broadcast television that Aereo was providing to its customers via its series of tiny dime size antennas.

Start time: 676.98
End time: 687.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  ABC had sued saying that Aereo is illegally retransmitting ABC television programming via the local television stations.

Start time: 689.20
End time: 733.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. ABC and other networks.  And it's been a very long and arduous and multi-jurisdictional world of litigation around this issue because Aereo is not the only company.  That has tried going after this using this kind of technology.  So we've had some conflicting decisions from around the country at the federal court level.  And what the Supreme Court was specifically looking at was an injunction against Aereo that was declined to be put in place by the New York Federal Court of Appeal.

Start time: 734.52
End time: 736.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The lower court said Aereo was OK.

Start time: 736.94
End time: 813.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Said Aereo was OK for now, doesn't need to be enjoined.  We're still going to have a trial on all these copyright issues.  But what you haven't done, broadcasters, is show a strong likelihood that you're going to be able to demonstrate at trial that Aereo directly infringed copyright.  And that's a big distinction, whether Aereo directly infringed or whether its users are somehow engaged in copyright infringement.  Because you think back on the history of the kinds of copyright cases the Supreme Court has considered.  You think about the Grokster case.  You think about the Betamax case way back then.  We're talking about things that could be copyright infringement by the users.  But the person supplying the intermediary technology may or may not be responsible for what the users are doing.  And here the direct question before the court was, is Aereo itself performing?  We know there's a performance going on of the copyrighted works that the broadcasters are putting out there.  But is Aereo doing that performance or is the performance happening on the viewer side?  And that turns out to be a very important distinction under copyright law.

Start time: 813.96
End time: 824.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the fact that Aereo won this decision, all that means...  Does that mean now that the injunction will be in effect?  It means that Aereo has to go back to the lower court.

Start time: 825.02
End time: 826.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It means that Aereo has to go back to the lower court, yes.

Start time: 826.96
End time: 830.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The trial is still on.  There still will be a trial, right?

Start time: 830.86
End time: 843.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And under this decision from the Supreme Court, there should be an injunction against Aereo's...  The live broadcast, the near live broadcast aspect of Aereo's business.

Start time: 844.06
End time: 847.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And so Aereo has just kind of unilaterally decided to suspend business.

Start time: 848.98
End time: 922.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is sad because if they don't go ahead and litigate out the issues in this case,  we're not really going to reach the complicated nuances here that I think still need to be explored.  The Supreme Court looked way back to the late 60s and 70s before the 1976 Copyright Act and said...  Basically, the majority opinion authored by Justice Breyer said,  you know, our hands are kind of tied because we had some opinions that we, the Supreme Court,  our predecessors on the Supreme Court authored way back in the late 60s and the 1970s,  that looked at the community access television system,  the old cable system where people would put antennas on hills because people did not have good reception at their homes  and not powerful enough, amplified enough reception to really make use of free over the air broadcast television.  And we had decided in a couple of those decisions that there wasn't a public performance going on.  There wasn't a performance going on at all.  And you know what Congress did? They came in in 1976 and undid those decisions.

Start time: 926.34
End time: 931.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They gave the copyright owner exclusive right to perform the copyrighted work publicly.

Start time: 932.54
End time: 976.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And they decided that cable companies were actually doing that.  And that if that's the case, and then, you know, you were talking before the show about now all the regulations  and requirements that are incumbent on cable companies because of the role that they are playing in passing along the signal,  the free broadcast over the air television signal to their customers.  So the court went through some really strange machinations of, you know, just couldn't really, I think, get its head around  Arios technology very well or the fact that Arios technology should be treated different than an antenna on a hill.  Lots of people are sharing.

Start time: 976.88
End time: 1004.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's point one. And I mentioned before we began that I think my position on this is contrarian to what most geeks feel like.  I think geeks love the area. They love the idea of screwing the cable companies, screwing the networks.  Nobody loves either. And why shouldn't we be able to pay eight bucks and be able to watch TV over the air using these antennas?  But it strikes me as areas doing exactly what the original cable system was supposed to do.  The cables.

Start time: 1004.22
End time: 1019.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is why we heard so many of the dissent and most of the judges actually who ruled for this, like Justice Sotomayor was saying,  like she kept scratching her head saying, why is this not a cable company?  How is this not different?  The cable company. Right.  When if you really look into the technology, clearly it's not a cable company.

Start time: 1019.46
End time: 1038.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I disagree. I think it's exactly the same thing as community access television.  I think it's exactly the same thing.  Now, I understand cable don't do it this way anymore, but in the original days, as Denise was saying, they put up an antenna  because you couldn't get it and they ran a cable to your house and everybody who subscribed to the cable company used that antenna.

Start time: 1038.84
End time: 1041.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it? But everybody didn't have their own antenna.

Start time: 1041.56
End time: 1054.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, first of all, and you're first of all, I know this wasn't our you have the same right to it in the way that you don't with a cable company.  It's a lot like a timeshare, like those timeshare solar gardens that are popular these days.  Like you're paying into the hardware.

Start time: 1055.92
End time: 1060.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What? How does this change your argument?  If the dime size antennas are lies, does this change your argument?

Start time: 1061.66
End time: 1062.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.

Start time: 1062.64
End time: 1114.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, because I want to point out that antenna experts have said, and I'll point you to this article from Pete Putman, HDTVexpert.com, that in fact, it's not possible that these dime size antennas could effectively receive the transmissions.  They're too small. They're probably acting as an array.  Despite what Areo says now, I admit this was not argued in court.  In fact, what the court decided is we're not even going to think about the technology.  Let's just see the end result.  And I think the court probably was right because you could debate this issue, the dime size antenna issue, till the cows come home.  But they stipulated that Areo was telling the truth.  I don't think Areo is telling the truth.  The Areo is doing two things to get around the Copyright Act.  One is the dime size antennas.  Two is a six second delay.  But in fact, isn't it doing exactly the same thing as a cable company does, really, from the point of view of the user, the point of view of everybody else?

Start time: 1115.98
End time: 1133.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, certainly the majority of the Supreme Court felt that way.  I think they got it right.  The very well reasoned Scalia dissent points out why we shouldn't consider it that way.  And Justice Scalia joined by Justices Thomas and Alito.

Start time: 1133.78
End time: 1144.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The most conservative members of the court.  Right. Exactly.  And I think they were giving a constructionist argument.  I don't think that they were arguing in favor of the technology, but they just were uncomfortable with the court overreaching.

Start time: 1145.92
End time: 1160.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think they were worried about the precedent in cloud computing in general, because in this way we can call iTunes match a cable company if you and I just play the same album at the same time.  We're forgetting about the users.  But we pay for it and iTunes pays for it.

Start time: 1160.86
End time: 1170.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  And so I think Areo gets around this and knew it from the beginning by paying retransmission fees like a cable company.  And then it's all legal.

Start time: 1171.64
End time: 1227.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's what Justice Scalia would say to you, Leo.  He says, I share the court's evident feeling that what Areo is doing or enabling to be done to the network's copyrighted programming ought not to be allowed.  But perhaps we need not distort the Copyright Act to forbid it.  As discussed at the outset, Areo's secondary liability for for performance infringement is yet to be determined.  They've never even gotten to that issue in the case.  As is its primary and secondary liability for reproduction infringement.  If that does not suffice, then assuming one shares the majority's estimation of right and wrong, what we have before us must be considered a loophole in the law.  It is not the role of this court to identify and plug loopholes.  It is the role of good lawyers to identify and exploit them and the role of Congress to eliminate them if it wishes.  Congress can do that, I may add, in a much more targeted, better informed and less disruptive fashion than the crude looks like table TV solution the court invents today.

Start time: 1227.78
End time: 1237.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it sounds like Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito merely said we shouldn't have taken this case in the first place, right?  That's what they're saying.  Or having taken it, we shouldn't make a ruling?

Start time: 1238.78
End time: 1279.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think having taken it, we should we should find that there's no performance going on here, is what they would say under the technology that they're reviewing.  The three dissenting justices rejected this whole notion that we can't look under the covers or behind the scenes and that that would be unimportant.  What's only important is the impact because in other cases, we definitely look at what the technology is doing.  In the cable vision case that blessed the notion of a remote DVR, how the technology works was very important and whether the users were directing the performance.

Start time: 1281.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I put myself in the in the position of the content creators, the networks.  What if somebody were to take twit and rebroadcast it in some form, charge people eight bucks to do it, add to my audience?  Great, but in a way that I can't count and monetize it, I would be pissed off and I think I would have a right to recourse.  Doesn't that happen?

Start time: 1306.64
End time: 1310.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are plenty of podcast apps that maybe rebroadcast.

Start time: 1310.32
End time: 1349.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They do and our rule with those, like Stitcher is a good example, is they have to they cannot keep a copy of it on their servers.  They must merely provide an interface to our copy, which we count.  So they don't cash our content.  They come they just provide an interface to get it, which is fine with me because I can count it.  But if some but I've always had the rule that if somebody comes along and says and by the way, there's that guy in L.A.  who has that what is that bizarre business where he's rebroadcasting stuff completely illegally over the Internet.  He rebroadcasts us.  It's my position that because I can't count that rebroadcast, it's not his right to do that.

Start time: 1352.10
End time: 1386.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And I think we're talking apples and oranges is the problem.  We're not talking about free over the air broadcast TV brought down by an antenna and whether it matters who has the antenna.  We're talking about something completely different.  A piece of video that you put out under a certain license and certain uses are allowed under that license.  You also make it embeddable via YouTube.  So, you know, being able to embed around the Internet is is fine if you're doing it.  Because I don't do over the air for free.

Start time: 1388.26
End time: 1389.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not really it's not it's different.

Start time: 1390.38
End time: 1391.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's different. Yes.

Start time: 1392.14
End time: 1403.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that one of the things that the fact that film on TV and this guy, I don't know why this guy's still in business, rebroadcasts,  twit and by the way, everything else it looks like in the world.

Start time: 1404.20
End time: 1405.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He copies and rebroadcasts or does he?

Start time: 1405.96
End time: 1408.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, copies and rebroadcasts.

Start time: 1408.66
End time: 1419.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So that's I think pretty clearly if if, you know, I'm not here to give the network legal advice.  But I think if you consulted with a lawyer, you might find that there that could well be.

Start time: 1419.82
End time: 1429.16

Start time: 1437.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was, but it was it was one antenna on a hill.  I see a fool on the hill being shared by many.  And we're not talking about that situation here.  We're talking about much more.  I think the cable vision situation where was the particular user directing the particular recording on the remote DVR.  That decision was never taken up by the Supreme Court.  They had the chance to to decide that that was wrongly decided in one way and they didn't do that.  So it's still the law until the Supreme Court decides otherwise.  And I think they've they've kind of, you know, the majority decision doesn't even really address that they may have monkeyed around with that.  And in fact, went out of its way to say we're not touching the DVR aspect of area's business.  That's not in front of us right now, but I think you can't really get around the fact that their decision impacts not just remote DVR services,  but potentially things.  Professor Goldman has a great article on four unanswered questions that the area case leaves.  And one of those unanswered questions is, well, if we're not going to look at how things work technologically and whether technologically they comply with what we've decided is OK under the law or not.  Then things like embedding could well be jeopardized.  You know, it's hard to tell if that film on is embedding or copying.  You have to go behind the scenes and under the hood to figure that out.  And, you know, should it matter?  Well, the law has always said that it does.  So it's a dangerous precedent in that way.

Start time: 1572.52
End time: 1629.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's because I think Denise has got a pretty good lock on the situation.  You know, my non-legal gut instinct is that I tend to agree with the dissenting opinion here.  I mean, I think it is a loophole that's being exploited by Aereo,  but I think that it is ultimately a loophole.  And, you know, I don't know where you draw the line.  If there's one antenna for me that somebody else is leasing to me and that's legal.  You know, if there's two antennas that somebody else is leasing to two people, that's legal.  At what point does it become illegal?  And of course, as you mentioned, if indeed this is all a bit of a lie  and all those antennas are acting in series, then that's a different story altogether.  Does that change things?  In my eye, absolutely does. Yes.  At that point, then there's no doubt that they are breaking the law.  But, you know, taking things at face value and, you know,  assuming that they're not lying to us, then, yeah, I don't see why this would not be the same  as just having a bunch of separate antennas and leasing those individually.  So I am a little bit disappointed by the ruling, but ultimately I'm not surprised at all by the ruling.  That's this is pretty much how I expected it to go down.

Start time: 1629.86
End time: 1657.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So just we're going to wrap it up, but just to get clear in my mind, Denise,  yeah, if it's kind of like a hypothetical, if what they were doing is just passing it on,  like they the consumers choosing the channel, the consumers choosing what to watch,  Ariya is doing nothing but letting them do that and pass it on.  That would not be a public performance.  That would be legal.

Start time: 1660.51
End time: 1664.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't think that's quite what the court in the majority decision said.

Start time: 1665.32
End time: 1669.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What did the court did the court give any direction, Ariya, about how they could make this legal?

Start time: 1674.15
End time: 1763.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it did not really just looked at what it was doing and said, you can't do that.  We think you're like a cable company and what you're doing is skirting the law.  You know, we had some cases on the books in the late 60s and the 70s that embraced this.  Embraced what you were doing, you know, in the form of what the cable companies were doing then.  The cable.  And we think that Congress in 1976 expressly enacted, it goes so far as to say we think that Congress enacted  the 1976 Copyright Act specifically to undo these two decisions that we that the Supreme Court had,  deciding that cable companies were not publicly performing.  And it just decided so much that what Ariya was doing looked like what they were doing,  that it ought to be treated the same way.  And I think, although this does not come through, it is not expressly stated in the opinion,  I think there must have been some sort of underlying concern that if we go ahead and say that this is not a public  performance, then the cable companies, all they have to do to get out from under all the must carry and  retransmission fees and licensing consent requirements that they are under now,  the very heavily regulated industry that they are, all they have to do is adopt an aerial like technology.  And they're golden.  They're no longer cable companies either.  And I think the court was concerned about that kind of thing.  Again, this is just my guess on that front.

Transcript:  In the oral arguments, they were very concerned that whatever decision they made would impact services like  Dropbox.

Transcript:  I think that's the question.  I don't have the answer.  Yeah.

Start time: 1789.58
End time: 1831.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the court is trying hard not to jeopardize services like Dropbox or Google Drive and to say,  hey, if you're not dealing in free over the air broadcast television, we don't apply.  This decision won't apply.  But I'm not quite sure.  And when you read through the dissent, there are good arguments why it's difficult to draw lines.  You know, it's going to be fuzzy as to what's a public performance.  And as Justice Scalia says, it looks like this standard will sow confusion for years to come.  And I think that we will see some confusion around what constitutes a public performance after this decision.

Start time: 1831.04
End time: 1843.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That is what the Supreme Court's job is to try to infer what the intent of the of the legislation was and to enforce it in a way that's consistent with the legislation.  Right. I mean, they're not overstepping their bounds.  That's what they do.

Start time: 1844.78
End time: 1855.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they also know what they do is set precedences, which is why I think Scalia was so uncomfortable saying we're trying to ensure that this won't set a precedence,  but we cannot assure that.  Right. Right.

Start time: 1856.06

Transcript:  And if Congress intends for things that aren't cable companies to be treated like cable companies, they should say Congress should say that they should say that not the court.

Start time: 1866.80
End time: 1955.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But this happens all the time.  The court's always making decisions about what it thinks Congress meant.  That's a lot of what the court does.  Right. Yes.  Fox is already using Aereo's defeat as ammunition against Dish, by the way, they're revisiting a case they already lost.  Saying, but wait a minute, maybe we shouldn't have lost this.  And they're going back to the court.  So this is just the beginning.  Fox's lawyer, Richard Stone, wrote a letter to the court saying Dish, which engages in virtually identical conduct when it streams Fox's program to dissubscribers over the Internet, has repeatedly raised the same defenses as Aereo.  Those defenses have now been rejected by the Supreme Court.  They're trying to have the case reheard.  Okay.  A couple of things to point out.  Yes, of course, Aereo was trying to take advantages of loopholes.  You could call them loopholes or just the way the law was written.  They worked very hard when they first created the business to create a business that was legal, that was based on the law.  And somebody some have said, well, that's wrong.  You know, their intent was to circumvent.  But they try to use loopholes to get away with it.  But hey, that's what happens.  Every company does when they try to avoid paying taxes, too.  You just you find the loopholes and you use them.  That's not illegal.  And their intent, the Supreme Court is not ruling on the intent of whether they intended to violate copyright, right?  Or are they?

Start time: 1956.92
End time: 2022.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there is this volitional aspect to copyright infringement.  And it comes into play in the cable vision case and whether the user is doing the selecting or the intermediary technology entity.  So it comes into play there.  And if you're just passing through and allowing the user to do the selection, you know, I mean, Corey, whether it really makes sense to be able to go after all of Aereo's users for copyright infringement.  But that's what we've seen in the movie industry, in the music industry, in other similar situations.  So so, yeah, you might find yourself in that kind of weird world.  But the other thing that could have put Aereo on the hook, getting back to direct liability or indirect liability, is if it's inducing users to infringe.  And that's what did away with Grokster.

Start time: 2023.32
End time: 2030.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  So Grokster didn't infringe, but because they gave users the ability to infringe and incented them to do so, it was deemed illegal.

Start time: 2031.41
End time: 2037.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  So the direct infringement thing is is what's really problematic here.

Start time: 2039.50
End time: 2053.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The other thing I think that comes up is that a lot of people are upset with the decision, not on the law or the merits of the law and whether the Supreme Court's right or wrong, but just because they wanted Aereo to succeed.  I think that's the vast majority of geeks.  We just wanted this way to do this.

Start time: 2054.50
End time: 2086.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Doc Searles put up a good post today, just sort of lamenting the fact that Aereo did not position themselves differently in this case and did not come across, not as the person providing you with a dime size or the company providing you with a dime size antenna.  But instead, the company providing you with the ability to actually receive free over the air broadcasts, because as Doc writes in his post, that's virtually impossible to do in a lot of places.

Start time: 2087.00
End time: 2100.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And Doc, by the way, agrees with me.  He says the court was right that Aereo should have cleared performance rights with the stations and didn't.  But I think he makes the right case, which is that Aereo made the wrong case.

Start time: 2101.06
End time: 2108.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Aereo might have wanted to do a little different kind of approach to what their business was.

Start time: 2108.42
End time: 2127.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. He says Aereo is a perfect example of the marketplace at work.  After the digital TV transition, Aereo fulfilled a demand that existed because people could no longer get over the air signals.  Right.  If Aereo met a market demand, and that's how these things work.

Start time: 2128.16
End time: 2140.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know that it would have done a lot of good, because that's what the original cable companies did too.  And whether you should even consider Aereo a cable company is really the crux of this case.

Start time: 2141.20
End time: 2174.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I also think that sometimes we in our zeal to get new technologies and to cut the cable and all of this, we forget that people who create content do deserve to get paid for it, do have rights to be protected.  There's a reason why there are patents and copyrights. These are not uniformly bad things. In fact, they're very good things.  And they do support innovation.  Innovation comes when you have a feeling that you can make some money on it, that there's a reason for you to innovate.  Not just because of, hey, it's a good thing. I like to do this, but because it's a business.

Start time: 2176.88
End time: 2206.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wonder if Aereo had partnered up with Nielsen to be able to provide ratings and viewership numbers back to the broadcasters.  Effectively, so that those eyes were counted. That might have changed things a little bit.  Because ultimately, for over-the-air broadcasts, that's the only way that these companies really have an idea of what people are watching.  Cable, they can get views, obviously, and through streaming networks, they can, of course, know what's going on.  But beyond that, it's pretty much relying on Nielsen numbers.  And I wonder if they had done something there so that those numbers got back so that advertisers at least would know what's going on.  That might have helped their case a little bit.

Start time: 2207.40
End time: 2242.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think, frankly, if Aereo had gone to the locals and said, we want to retransmit.  Do you give us permission? This is what a cable company does. Do you give us permission?  And the locals say, yeah, but you've got to pay me 10 cents a subscriber and agreed to that.  Admittedly, they wouldn't have had an $8 a month service, but they would also be legal.  And I feel like Aereo really set us up.  Said, no, you can have an $8 a month service.  You just we just do these things and magically it's legal.  And they've been proven wrong. So for people to get upset.

Start time: 2243.68
End time: 2264.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now you're getting into economics, though, because what is the cost is definitely not what we pay our cable companies.  That is not the cost. We pay for a lot of things we do not consume.  And so the cost is if I'm talking on behalf of the user inflated.  But you're right, it's not eight dollars a month and it's not 60.  Like the real cost somewhere in between there is somewhere in between.

Start time: 2265.36
End time: 2267.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, then that was an opportunity for Aereo then.

Start time: 2267.82

End time: 2297.82

End time: 2304.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 2332.10
End time: 2371.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I frankly don't think the Aereo case matters all that much because it seems to me in five years sooner or later,  everything will be on the Internet. That's where it's going.  These last gasp lawsuits are merely an attempt to kind of keep the business model going a little bit longer.  But just as with everything else, it's all going to be on the Internet.  None of this is going to matter in the long run.  This is a short term problem.  Aereo was solving a short term issue.  And am I wrong on this?  I mean, I understand that cable companies and television companies are going kicking and screaming.  But at some point, sooner than later, it's going to all be on the Internet.

Start time: 2373.16
End time: 2376.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And well, that's why Comcast is doing what it's doing to become the evil empire,  because they want to make sure that if they can't charge you for HBO and Showtime and a package of stuff,  just so you can watch the World Cup, at least they can charge you through the wazoo for your Internet access.  And notice, by the way, if you look at the pricing, the pricing of cable with Internet and cable without Internet,  cable TV with Internet cable with that, it has come closer and closer and closer.  The differential is very small and it's getting smaller all the time because they know eventually they're not going to be able to charge you for television,  but they're going to get it out of you for cable for Internet.

And when the content creators then break the model so that you can subscribe to one channel without all of the rest of them,  because that's what really pisses us off so much about the cable companies,  is not so much their service or lack thereof,  but paying for things that we don't consume and wanting to buy a cable package  that doesn't include whatever that channel you just were talking about, Horse, whatever.  Horse auctions.

Start time: 2494.88
End time: 2528.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I think truthfully, the real people behind this,  the ones who are most concerned about area, were the cable companies.  Because what they...  It's not, yes, it was the content creators suing,  but I think the cable companies do not want this to change.  They need to preserve their power as long as possible.  Otherwise, HBO and ESPN and everybody else just go directly to consumers and say,  pay us 10 bucks a month for HBO Go, disintermediate Comcast, who needs them?  Right.  And the only reason they don't do that is they're terrified of Comcast.  Right.  They can't afford yet to do that.

So at the same exact time as they released the aerial decision,  they released the cell phone decision.  And I think this is very good news for privacy in this country.  Even if you have been arrested, the police still must seek in most cases a warrant before  they can search your cell phone.  And we know law enforcement actually has boxes they can plug into your phone and dump all  the data off of it.  And they do often routinely do that.  But the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that this is, you've got to get a warrant.  Is that good, Denise?

Transcript:  Right.  Here we have the court actually really showing a good grasp of what new technologies mean  and how they impact people's lives and the difference between being able to search someone's  pocket for a weapon or something else that might hurt an officer during an arrest or  something else that might be informationally important to the arrest, evidence that you  could gather just by finding it.  Exactly.  No, you're going to find lots of evidence on somebody's phone, but it's going to be  stuff that not only could convict them, that is going to be a lot of other stuff too.

Start time: 2886.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the case was a guy who was stopped for a traffic violation.  They I guess must have given the probable cause seen weapons.  He was arrested on weapons charges.  The officer searching him seized a phone from his pants pocket.  The officer accessed information on the phone, noticed the repeated use of a term associated  with a street gang.  At the police station two hours later, a detective specializing in gangs further examined the  phone's contents.  Based on photographs and videos, the detective found the state charged the petitioner in  connection with a shooting that had occurred a few weeks earlier and sought an enhanced  sentence based on gang membership.  He was convicted, then appealed.  California Court of Appeals affirmed.

Transcript:  Actually, if you've done something wrong, give them the phone.  Let them say, oh officer, no, you're not allowed to search that, but here.  And then they throw the whole thing out of court.  Chief Justice Roberts wrote, modern cell phones, I love this, are not just another  technological convenience with all they contain and all they may reveal, they hold for many  Americans, the privacies of life.  The fact that technology now allows an individual to carry this in his hand does not make the  information any less worthy of protection.  I love that.  That's right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  They can still, you know, the seat of your car, your pocket, they can pat you down.  You know, if the safety concern of the officers has always been behind, you can go ahead and  do a search incident to arrest.  But if you're going to search a cell phone, this decision says, you're going to need to  get a warrant.  And law enforcement was not wild about this decision and fought it because they said,  particularly in today's day and age, getting a warrant is not going to be effective because  what if someone just, you know, you've got Apple, they've got this great remote wipe,  Android does it too.  We're going to have our evidence destroyed.  And the court, you know, really showed a nice grasp, not only of the nature of the cell  phone, but of how these things work in the decision.  Talks about as to remote wiping, there are means to address that.  First of all, you could turn the phone off.  Then it can't be wiped.  Bear that in mind, law enforcement officers.  And also you could use a Faraday bag.  Would you ever have expected to see the word Faraday bag in a US Supreme Court decision?

Start time: 3113.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Such devices are commonly called Faraday bags.  After the English scientist, Michael Faraday, they are essentially sandwich bags made of  aluminum foil, cheap, lightweight and easy to use.  And then they cite the brief of the criminal law professors that was filed as an amicus  brief.  So they're reading their briefs and they know what this stuff is.  Or a clerk is, yes.  Yes.  This may not be a complete answer to the problem, but at least for now, they provide a reasonable  They talk about that not only that law enforcement agencies know what Faraday bags are and use  them and encourage officers to use them, but they talk about the fact that a warrant is  a lot easier to get than it used to be to.  And that a lot of law enforcement officers can rely on like a 15 minute electronic email  response to a request for a warrant.  So we're not talking about a whole lot of hoops that need to be jumped through here.

Transcript:  I got a good question from someone on Twitter along these lines.  His name was Mark Jones.  And he was sort of keying into the fact that not only do we keep everything on our cell  phones, but we have things like boarding passes.  And in his particular case, I guess his insurance card for showing that he has auto insurance  on his cell phone and asking if you show that to an officer on your phone, are you giving  up your privacy rights to anything else on the phone?  I certainly don't think so.  You know, first of all, you have to be if you're under arrest is the only way that there  could even be an issue about an officer's ability to search your phone without a warrant  and just handing an officer an unlocked phone to show a particular item on there, I don't  think is communicating consent to search the phone.  But again, you might want to say when you're handing the phone over, hey, I don't consent  to you searching the whole phone.

Transcript:  Also, my mention that the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the ACLU have pages called  Know Your Rights where you can print a PDF about what the police can and cannot do.  I presume updated thanks to this most recent decision and also a PDF of tips when confronted  by the police.  The thing I want to emphasize, this is not designed to, you know, somehow get gang members  off because the police do have the ability to ask for a warrant to put the thing in a  Faraday box.  There's a lot, you know, it's this, you know, if there really is a crime, the police can  pursue it.  This is to protect our privacy against an overreaching police state.  And this is good tips for talking to the police.  I hope it's there's a great long YouTube video by you should never, ever talk to the police  that I recommend I refer you to without recommending it.  I refer you to if you want to know more.  I certainly made sure my kids knew it.  So good news.  Privacy rights are protected.  What do you think in the in the in the light of these two decisions?  A lot of people were mocking the Supreme Court in the Areo case saying, oh, they're clearly  technologically out of touch.  I actually thought in the oral arguments, most of them, not all of them, but most of  them were pretty in touch.  Sotomayor showed a real understanding of how this stuff works.  I think she knew about Roku boxes and Netflix.  So I think in this in this privacy thing, they seem very much in touch with what a cell  phone is and and why it's important to protect.  They seem like they are in touch.  Yes, Denise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they're more in touch than people give them credit for.  I do think, you know, you're talking about people in an older demographic who are still,  you know, incorporating these tools in their own life and trying to grasp what how they  work and what they mean and doing their best with it.  And they have really smart clerks, as you pointed out, Leo.  So I think they they do a pretty darn good job.  You know, the copy shop with the library card, you know, is something.  Cable company, when it's clearly not, they've got some hurdles to overcome still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I went with the Samsung, which is here.  I was kind of curious to see what Samsung would do in the long term with the device.  Samsung said during I.O. that they're going to differentiate their device a little bit more.  Right now, all three devices do basically the same thing, which is Android Wear notifications  plus heart rate and some of the stuff.  Samsung did say they'd be bringing some of their functionality to this device.  And I did like the look of the Samsung a little bit better.  The LG is more square, more blockish.  It looks bigger, even though they're the same size.  The tapered bezel on the Samsung, I think, looks a little bit nicer.  I went with this guy, but ultimately in terms of functionality,  at least they're very, very similar devices.

Transcript:  In particular, you have very little control in Android Auto over the look and feel of your apps.  And that's by design.  I actually spoke with folks from General Motors and Audi  to get a little bit more information on that.  But ultimately, when you are talking about something that you use while you're driving,  it's very important for that not to be distracting.  So Google worked very closely with those auto manufacturers and with others  to design a look and feel for the interface that's going to be consistent.  It's going to be the kind of thing that you can extend a little bit,  but ultimately they're not going to give developers the opportunity  to change the look and feel of those apps.  So if you go between Spotify and Play Music, for example,  the apps look exactly the same except the colors change  and the logos change.  So all the developers can really do there is basically change the orientation of the buttons.  They can change which buttons are there,  but there's always going to be the same row of buttons across the middle  and the same basic layout.  So that's so that you can kind of get some muscle memory going  and so that you can't create an app that is distracting.  There's been a lot of kind of fear this week about people joking,  about people creating video games and running 248 on your dashboard,  that kind of thing, but that's simply not possible.

Transcript:  Well, it also avoids the toxic hell stew, as Microsoft call it.  Or was it Apple?  I can't remember.  Somebody called it.  Andrew Cunningham writing at ours, Technica says,  it's not just auto.  Android Wear and TV will not be skinnable.  They will always be the same version.  Updates will come from Google directly.  Andrew says he talked with Google engineering director David Burke,  said all the new Android initiatives announced at the keynote  will have user interfaces and underlying software controlled by Google.  And that's the deal you make if you're LG or Moto or Samsung.  I think that's good on the one hand because  you do avoid fragmentation.  You do know what you've got.  Certainly in an auto application, that's very important.  But even for the watches, you use one, you'll know how to use the other.  This is what Microsoft did with a Windows phone.  But on the other hand, it does kind of limit the innovation in the ecosystem.

Transcript:  Right.  And manufacturers can still create custom apps, of course.  They can still deploy custom content.  So Ford, for example, could write an app that only works on Ford cars.  Android Auto, Samsung can write apps that will only run on Samsung watches if they want to.  That sort of thing is fine.  But when it comes to the core aspect of the operating system itself,  that's locked down.  And I think just about any Android fan will probably say that's for the best.  And of course, when it comes to watches, there's so many more opportunities to personalize the  devices, much more so than phones now, which all kind of more or less have shaped or morphed into  the same sort of device.  It's really difficult to telephones apart these days.  But watches, there's a lot more room for differentiation,  especially when we look at the Moto 360, which is around.  Versus the other two, which are not around, of course.  That's another opportunity for manufacturers to differentiate themselves.

And they even have a, you can even go to a website on your phone  and check compatibility and it'll tell you if it's compatible or not.  Okay.  So look, we've all seen every one of these stupid devices from the Jawbone, the Nike,  to the Pebble.  I've had the Gear 1, the Gear 2.  All of them have kind of left something to be desired.  Is it your experience, since you only have one, Tim, on this panel, that this is any better than those?

Start time: 4231.30
End time: 4257.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's very different than those.  Ultimately, it's doing a different sort of thing right now, which is really focused on notifications.  I actually think this is closer to Google Class than to  most of the smartwatches that we've seen so far, because really it's focused on notifications  first and foremost.  And there's not really a lot else that you can do with it.  You can do a pedometer on here and you can get your heart rate, which is no better than on any  of the other Gear devices, which is to say not very good.  But there really isn't a lot else that you can do right now.

You look pretty dorky, but hey, we're used to that.  But you can.  I mean, it is nice to be able to say, you know,  give me directions to whatever to your watch and then have it pop up on your phone.  That's kind of nice.  And I was also, for example, you know, the contextual stuff is very good.  So I was flying back from San Francisco here to Albany on Thursday night.  And the watch not only gave me the weather in San Francisco where I was,  but it gave me the weather here in Albany where I was headed to.  And it gave me the weather in Detroit where I was connecting, which I thought was an interesting touch.  Because it knows your itinerary.

And articles that I've searched for in the past, I guess.  And the local weather.  And you know what?  It's doing the same thing you just described.

Transcript:  I just got a notification that Denise Howlett has tweeted about me.  So that just popped up here on watch, too.  So you get pretty much any notification that shows up on your phone will show up here, too.  So developers don't need to do anything extra to integrate here.  So I use AnyDo for tasking, for example.  And those pop up on the watch.  Those pop up, too.  Now, presumably, AnyDo can then extend their app and provide more functionality through the watch,  which I'm looking forward to them doing.  But for now, those notifications will come right up.

I'm good with my phone and already feel silly enough talking into that.  I don't know that I necessarily need to talk to my watch.  Although I think that we do need a world where the watch and the car and the phone  and everything's integrated and whatever technology people like to interact with  works in a unified way and works well.  So I kind of see what Google is doing,  exerting a little bit more control over the Android ecosystem here.  The thing I just notified Tim about is our same Twitter that let us know about the...  What are those things called?  Dodo case?  Dodo case, yeah.  So G Rajeev again sends us the developer's file for the Google Cardboard and  the schematics and everything.  Google published it.

What we really are waiting for is for them to become fashionable because a watch and  glasses, these are accessories that the technology companies are going so crazy to try and make  them better and better.  They're already OK.  What we really need is for these to become desirable in terms of fashion.  And maybe that's why we see so many executives from the fashion world now coming over to  technology.

Transcript:  So there are some things that they talked about as well when it comes to Android Auto,  for example, if you have navigation open on your phone and you're directing somewhere and you plug  your phone into your car, the car will basically pick up navigation right in your dashboard and  take off where you left off effectively.  But if you're not navigating, just plug your phone in.  It won't start navigating anywhere or it won't even take over the display of your car,  for example.  So there's some contextual stuff coming in there, which I think is interesting.  Of course, with with Nest kind of getting in the game, I think we'll definitely see some  good stuff when it comes to smart home integration as well.  So I think there's a lot more contextual stuff that's going to be coming in the future.  But yeah, right now the designs do leave a bit to be desired.  These watches are all very big.

Transcript:  So were shoulder pads.  Too bad they missed it.  We've moved on.  Thank God.  Well, let's talk about auto because it looks like what Google is doing is very similar to what  Apple's doing with their, what do they call it?  Carplay.  They're casting it into the car.  So what, since you're the car editor over there at CNET,  fill me in on what does the car have to do?  Audi just announced, for instance, the 2015 models will support Android Auto.

Start time: 4833.82
End time: 4959.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  And this is another bit of fear, uncertainty and doubt that's been thrown on this week is that  your car will probably support both of these standards.  There's a lot of people saying that you might have to buy one car or another based on what  phone you have, but it's very likely that manufacturers will support both because ultimately  from a car manufacturer standpoint, they're very, very similar.  All they need to do is basically run a very simple software stack in their cars and then  provide a USB input and the means for video stream to come from your phone to your dashboard.  And that's pretty much all that they need to provide plus a couple of buttons and some other  stuff.  So Carplay works basically the same as Android Auto.  It's the same.  Basically exactly the same thing.  So that what the phone is doing is effectively rendering an external display.  And then that content is shown up on your dashboard and then voice commands and  touchscreen or physical buttons, those stuff could then push back into your phone and that  controls the apps.  So it's very much the same between the two.  The big difference between Carplay and Android Auto is that developers can get in the game.  When it comes to Android Auto, they cannot do that when it comes to Carplay.  Apple is basically locking things down and saying only our approved developers can write  apps for Carplay, at least for now.  Android and Google are giving developers the permission and the means to write apps, but in  a very limited way.  Right now, only media apps and messaging apps are allowed.  And again, as I said before, they had to fit into the standard templates that Google has  defined.  And those templates are approved based on global standards for distracted driving and  that sort of thing.  So for example, no single interaction with the app will take more than two seconds.  Those are things that are globally accepted and those are things that are now approved and  included within the Android Auto standard.  Now there's another standard called MirrorLink, which does the same sort of thing.  You plug in your Android phone, it connects and takes over the dashboard of your car.  That allows developers to do anything that they want to.  They can write any apps that they want to.  But those apps need to be certified to run in the dashboard.  So that's even more open than Google.  But what Google didn't want to do is force developers to learn all these standards when  it comes to button size and contrast and allowable fonts and things like that.  There's a giant stack of certifications that you can read if you really want to.  Google said we're going to kind of get rid of all that stuff and just basically create a  template that's allowable and our data has to fit within that.

Start time: 4961.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It seems like a lot of interaction with the screen that it kind of fosters distracted driving.  I presume that they're going to be very careful about that.

Start time: 4970.40
End time: 5008.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they're absolutely.  I mean, GM and Audi and all the other 40 members had a very big part in saying what exactly  these apps can look like.  And so these apps are all basically going through the same sort of standardized testing  that any of the head units for a General Motors car, for example, would go through.  They have to abide by the same rules and regulations as those things.  So while, of course, the demonstrations that we've all been getting this week,  it shows a lot of people staring at these screens, hitting buttons and things like that.  That scared me.  Playing with it.  But anything can be done by voice.  They can all be done by a steering wheel controls as well.  The car supports it and there will never be more than I think about 10 buttons on  screen at one time.  They're all fairly large and they're all in the same place.  So you can get muscle memory going to.

Transcript:  Because the technology for a GPS is much different.  You can actually get mapping when you don't have reception,  but that's not the case with these mobile devices.  It's a completely different mapping technology.

Start time: 5044.34
End time: 5087.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It would be just like Google navigation now where if you have connection when you start  and you lose connection along the way, that's fine because it'll cache the path  that you're going along.  Or if you've downloaded that map to your phone locally, which you can do now,  you can then navigate within.  The other thing that the system can do because it talks to your car,  it can actually pull GPS data from the car.  It can pull speedometer data and wheel position data from the car too.  So if you're walking through the city or if you go through a tunnel with your phone,  it gets really confused because the GPS sensors and phones are pretty weak compared to a car.  But if the car loses signal, the car can still get a pretty good idea of where it is based on  where it knew it was before and based on how fast and in what direction it's traveling.  So even if you're driving through a tunnel,  you'll still get better navigation through your car with your phone than if you just had your phone out.  I like that.

Transcript:  Tim, can I ask you a question?  Do you think that car companies are going to embrace this because  technology companies can do it better?  Or do you think they'll get defensive because they have their own sorts of things  they've been developing?

Start time: 5100.44
End time: 5158.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're going to embrace it very reluctantly,  but they don't really have much of a choice at this point.  They've been trying to develop their own systems that would be better for years now  and ultimately they failed.  In fact, I've been interested to watch all the poaching from  these consumer tech companies that the auto manufacturers have been making,  hiring a lot of mobile developers to help build their software and to improve their software.  When you're talking about software that goes into a car,  the integration cycle on those things is at least three years,  more like five years most of the time.  So even if they're doing cutting edge stuff, it's three years away from showing up.  And that's a problem.  There are solutions to that, but the best solution is simply  to take that stuff out of the car, put it in a phone,  and then you'll get a much better experience because that can be updated more easily.  So the manufacturers know that that's what people want.  Manufacturers don't really want to hand that control over.  They want to control the dashboard as much as they want to control  the shape of the steering wheel and the shape of the headlights and everything else.  But this is something that people are really going to demand in the next  probably 24 months from now.  This is the sort of thing people are going to expect from their cars.  So GM and Ford and everybody else are going to reluctantly have to support it.

Start time: 5159.60
End time: 5170.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have to be very careful.  They don't want legislatures.  They don't want Congress to start passing laws about this stuff though,  because of distracted driving.  They've got to be really, really cautious.

Start time: 5171.08
End time: 5197.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the other thing too.  I spoke with manufacturers about that too, and they are definitely afraid of that  because they feel that that will stifle innovation.  I think that that definitely would.  So I think that they are taking the right steps, especially Apple with CarPlay  and Google now with Android Auto.  They're being very careful about making sure that these interfaces pass.  All the regulations that are out there and well-defined now,  and those right now are industry-defined regulations,  but they are very comprehensive.  So I hope that we don't see any more legislation coming  because that would definitely throw a big old wrench in the works.

Android TV, which is their third attempt, actually fourth if you include the ill-fated Q  to get Android in the living room.  I thought there were a couple of things that they showed that maybe they didn't fully explain  how they worked and I thought could be very interesting.  One was the idea that you could use, forget Android TV, you could use your Chromecast  to do a lot of the things that you would do with an Android TV including cast applications,  play games.  It's unclear how they're going to do this, when they're going to do this, but this is  pretty neat.  You can replicate your display or you will be able to replicate your display to the Chromecast

I don't know if it'll be across every Wi-Fi chipset and every device that's out there,  but that'll definitely make Chromecast a lot more usable, I think, for a lot of people.

Transcript:  You just put it in the HDMI port, you use your phone to set it up,  then you use your phone to find content and you cast it to your Chromecast,  which then receives it and puts it on your screen.  What could be easier?  Right.  It's only $35.  Yeah, no, the normal people I know can't even figure out how to turn the TV on, so this is not...

Transcript:  What is an HDMI port?  My dad thinks it's HTML.  Yeah, that thing that does the internet, the HTML, I got it on my TV now.  It's amazing.  They also showed, and I thought this could be huge, again, they just did a little quickie,  the ability to run some Android apps on your Chromebook.  They showed Evernote, Flipboard, and I'm not sure...  They didn't really say how this works, but it strikes me if you can do...  If you can run Android apps on your Chromebook, they've added this kind of same app capability  to Google Chrome, the browser on Windows and Mac.  It's just a short amount of time before you can run Android apps on your Windows machine  and your Mac machine as well.  This is really what the keynote was about.  Android everywhere.  Good strategy for Google?  Yeah, I think so.  Pretty obvious strategy.  Yeah, maybe.  They had Chrome OS too, but Android seems to be the killer.

Start time: 5426.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Especially as they're trying to build dependence on things like Android Home  and Android Notifications, you want that data to be everywhere that you are.  For them to be able to extend Android apps across all these platforms,  you get more dependent on those Android apps.  As your accessibility and visibility into that data gets broader and easier to access,  that means that you have more opportunities to use that data,  and you become ultimately more tethered to their ecosystem.  That's good for Google.  That's ultimately what they want.  I think it's absolutely great.  I think it's good for the users too.  I mean, that simple example of getting weather in Detroit on my fly back was ultimately a  useful thing.  Not that I couldn't have gotten to that in some other way, but to have it right there on my wrist  was pretty nice.  I think that's the kind of thing that we can just expect to see in the coming years.

Transcript:  Ben Thompson, who's been on to it before and really think the world of,  he writes a blog called Stratecary and a newsletter,  pointed out there is a difference between Android on the phones  and Android on other things like your wrist.  Mainly that phones are a must have.  The primary difference between a watch and your phone is you buy the former,  the watch by choice, and the latter by necessity.  I think that's a very good point that these other devices are more of a luxury item.  You can't expect them to dominate the same way  Android has dominated the phone market.

But let me check Android Wear here.  Let's just click this and look at the Samsung Gear Live.  That's the watch.  And where did I see?  Maybe you're right.  Maybe you're right.  I thought I saw text that says with any Samsung phone.  But I guess that's not the case.  So good.  That's good news.  I ordered the other one.

And as the officer is talking to you,  you get a notification on your wristwatch that says something that incriminates you.  And the officer sees that.  Is that probable cause in that case to search your phone?

Transcript:  Yeah.  Don't touch my watch!  Deeper access.  I would think that it would, again, this decision that just came out deals with phones,  but there was a lot of good language in there indicating that we have a lot of devices in  our lives that have deep information about us far deeper than anything that we could keep in our  pockets.  And a watch may fall into that category.

Is this, because really this is moving Google more towards a world where instead of you searching,  it pushes to you the information it thinks you want on your wrist and your glasses and your car  and your TV set.  Have we raised the creepy factor or not?

I don't think any of this was like, whoa, that's above and beyond.  Was there any one thing there?  No.  Fitness stuff.  This is so much more innocuous than Google Health, which everyone was pissed off about.  I think they've dialed it back.

Transcript:  By the way, they're bringing that back, but you're right.  It's not, they're not going to violate any FDA rules or need even FDA permission for this  new stuff.  I Farhad Manju talked to Larry Page and Sundar Pichai after the keynote and there's a really  good Bits Blog post on this.  One of the things he did ask about was creepiness.  He says, do you worry the more devices we have that are connected to Google, there's not just  a privacy question, but also something like creepiness.  Page, I think had the right answer.  He says, as long as we make these things useful, people will accept them.  He says, the problem is when we talk about things before people see them, there's a much  more negative reaction.  It's really important for people to be able to experience products.  Otherwise, you fear the worst without seeing the benefits.  That seems sensible to me.  If you can see Google Now and the value of Google Now and use it, it won't bug you as  much as if you just hear about this idea that Google will tell you, oh, hey, there's a great  deer on pizza down the street and I know you like pepperoni, so let's go.  Do you think that he's fair on that?  I think so.

Start time: 5802.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's part of what makes that Facebook research study seems partly bad because there  ultimately was no, there was no net benefit for Facebook users coming out of that study.  That's why I think there was such a negative reaction from that.  Whereas with all the predictive search things we're getting out of Google, those are helpful  things and so therefore we're getting a service from it.

Transcript:  He's saying the right words.  He says, I'm not, this is Larry Page again, I'm not trying to minimize the issues.  For me, I'm so excited about the possibilities to improve things for people.  My worry actually would be the opposite.  We get so worried about these things, we don't get the benefits.  I think that's what's happened in healthcare.  We decided largely through regulation that data is so locked up that it can't be used  to benefit people well.  We don't mine data, mine healthcare data.  If we did though, we could save 100,000 lives next year.

There's a lot of speculation about, well, if the court is recognizing that we have this  strong privacy information on our phones and the information that can be accessed from  our phones, how much protection does the cloud have and is the NSA surveillance constitutional?  I think that's a strong piece of how much people are going to trust cloud services.  If you're putting all your information there, who gets to see it?  Who gets to use it?

In fact, Page in this article says, no, we're all in on Google+.  We're very happy with it.  I think that this was a long enough keynote there.  It's been a long enough segment.  We're going to talk about the Facebook case.  I think there's a few more things to talk about before we wrap things up.  You know, before we go to the ad though, and by the way, I really want to thank you, Anthony,  for filling in for Chad Johnson.  Chad is on vacation.  He went to Birmingham for I think a Minecraft convention.  So got Anthony Nielsen filling in.  But before we go to the ad, Anthony, let's see what you missed if you missed anything on  Twitter.

We're so exhausted from the week gone by that we're just going to forget it.  I don't know if there's anything coming up.  I'm not even going to be here.  It's not a week anyway.  It is the fourth of July.  Let's just relax, set off fireworks, explode things.  If you're not in the United States, you could explode things anyway because it's the fourth  of July here and all bets are off.  Our show today brought to you by Personal Capital.  Really a clever idea.  I talked to its founder, Bill Harris, on triangulation a couple of years ago,  and he was looking for a way to help people make better sense of their financial life  so they could make better decisions for their future.  He's come up with this great free secure tool that is so cool.  It's Personal Capital and it helps you in a couple of ways.  First of all, of course, hard to keep track of all your finances, your stocks, your investments,  your charge cards, your bank accounts, your property, all the things that you've got.  They're all on different websites with different logins.  Personal Capital collates it all in a single page with easy to use, easy to understand  graphs and information.  Then, of course, it helps you analyze what you're doing.  Are you paying too much for financial advice?  Have you allocated your assets properly?  Are you invested properly so that you can retire when that time comes?  Some of you are young enough that you're probably not thinking about that.  Now is the time.  In fact, I told Chad that and Chad's been using, I think he's been using Personal Capital.  Now is the time to start thinking about retirement because if you start putting  stuff aside now and you do it right, you won't have to worry.  I love Personal Capital.  Signing up just takes a minute.  It'll pay big dividends right away.  Total clarity, transparency, make better investment decisions.  And by the way, if you do use their financial advisors, they are not on commission.  They're all certified financial planners.  They're fee based, but you don't have to use them.  It's absolutely free.  Personalcapital.com slash twit.  It's a smart way to grow your money.  And I strongly suggest you sign up and try it today.  I've been using it for two years ever since I talked to Bill and I'm thrilled with it.  It's just really, really great.  Do you know how your 401K is doing this year?  Do you know?  Maybe not.  Maybe you should.  Personalcapital.com slash twit.  Okay, the crumbs.  I don't know if I even want to mention this story about Tim Cook.  I'm not.  I'm not going to.

Transcript:  It's none of our freaking business.  That's right.  Let's talk about the Facebook thing because I think maybe I'm upset for no good reason.  It turns out Facebook participated in a study, an interesting study,  about how what you see on social media affects your feelings.  It turns out that in, I think it was January 2011 for one week,  Facebook intentionally manipulated the news feeds for 700,000 users.  They gave half of them happy stories, half of them sad stories,  and then a week later monitored their posts to see if they were happier or sadder.  And surprise, surprise, people who saw depressing sad stories were more depressed.  And people who saw happy go lucky stories were happier.  First of all, what a waste of time.  That's obvious, but okay.  This was by the way, Cornell was involved in this.  California University involved in this study.  Experimental evidence of massive scale emotional contagion through social networks  published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences of the USA.  But Princeton University, a woman who edited it from Princeton even said,  the creepy factor was off the scale here.  Is it normally in research when you do this kind of research,  you get the consent of the subject.  You may not say what you're going to do,  but you say we're going to do a research study.  Just want to make sure it's okay with you.

Start time: 6294.46
End time: 6300.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, because how much different is this than the Stanley Milgram experiment, which...  That was the impetus of review boards.  That's why we have them, is because when you manipulate someone's psyche  to think the world is one way that it is not,  it has lasting effects on them, even if it's something as stupid as your newsfeed.

Start time: 6367.80
End time: 6397.64

Their information may be used for, quote, internal operations, including,  I hope you read this carefully,  troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, research, research, and service improvement.  Now, of course, the other point to be made is that Facebook is constantly manipulating the newsfeed  in ways that we don't know.  Who knows what the hell they're up to?  This makes me want to quit Facebook so bad.

Start time: 6397.72
End time: 6436.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they did this two years ago, which is also disconcerting to me.  There's a statement posted just about an hour ago from one of the data engineers from Facebook,  kind of explaining things a little bit better, apologizing, and saying that they wish that they  had been a little bit more communicative and transparent for the reasoning.  But he said, you know, we've learned a lot and grown a lot in the past two years,  so we're better at this now.  But still, there has been two years of this sort of activity.  And that's, I'm wondering what other studies are still in the pipeline and haven't even been  published yet.  But I do agree that I think that they were not acting ethically here.  But to play devil's advocate, how is this different than a website using an A-B test  to decide which headline they should run for a given story?  I'll throw that out there.

Transcript:  Well, I can tell you one thing.  Facebook got sued over Beacon.  They're going to get sued over this.  Good. I hope they do.  But I think they will.  I mean, Professor James Grimmelman, who is far more knowledgeable about this sort of thing  than I would ever pretend to be, has said, you know, if you're exposing people to something  that causes changes in psychological status, that's experimentation and requires informed consent.  Should anyway.  So, I mean, he's just kind of spitballing as a law professor.  But if he's spitballing as a law professor, there are plaintiffs' lawyers out there who  are putting it in pleadings and probably thinking about filing.  As a class action?

Transcript:  It's no different than you go to a restaurant.  The chef says, do you like this or this is where the eye doctor says A or B.  It's just you given somebody a choice and the choice isn't explicitly requested  or explicitly given, but you just see well to people like this site or that site.  That does not feel as manipulative as somebody modifying the newsfeed  to try to make me happy or sad.  That seems really messed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And these researchers had to go to Facebook and say, our hypothesis is that.  The emotional content of your Facebook feed will affect your emotional content,  your emotional response.  So we intend to manipulate this in order to elicit  emotional responses from your participants.  And that is very different than just seeing what color looks best on your banner.  Wouldn't you say?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, isn't that the same thing as an editor going to another editor saying,  I believe that if we change the headline to be this structure,  that we'll get more people to click on it.  So therefore, let's run both using some optimizing software  and testing capabilities and we'll see which one is more effective.  And therefore, they're going to learn which is more effective.  Again, I'm playing devil's advocate here, but I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Effective is a different thing because these authors have specified to Facebook  that we would like to emotionally manipulate your users.  And they said, yes, it's not a matter of which ones get the most click bait,  which I agree does happen.  But when once Facebook got this abstract, then they should have said no.

Transcript:  Well, the good news is fewer than one tenth of one percent of the users committed suicide.  So it's OK.  I don't know.  But that's a legitimate question.  What if somebody got so depressed they, you know, they harmed themselves  because of this stupid study.  Then what's the liability?

Start time: 6633.32
End time: 6644.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And there's one other thing out of this is that I'm not sure that they actually proved anything  because if you need you're seeing sad news, you might say, oh,  I'm really sorry to hear about that.  And then ultimately, you are contributing to their research.  But it doesn't necessarily mean that you're actually any sadder yourself.

Transcript:  Yes, dumb.  The whole thing is dumb.  And by the way, you mentioned, Natalie, I did quit Facebook once.  I wish I weren't on Facebook, but I feel like I have to use it so I can report on stories like this.  I need to have an experience.  So I'm taking the hit for you.

Then all of a sudden, Lisa said, oh, you're tapped out seems to be back.  I went, oh, no, they keep pulling me in.  And for the last month, it's been about a month.  I've been doing it.  And I realized that it's like an hour a day.  I'm farming and tapping.  So I'm very proud of myself.  I just and Lisa did too.  We deleted our Simpsons tapped out because Farmville 2 is coming.
