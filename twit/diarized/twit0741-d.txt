Transcript:  Yeah, so the I I'm gonna speak here on behalf of the state legislature  My wife I'm an employer. Yes, my wife is an employer. She hates the California State Legislature  Oh, this is making it hard for employers, but the theory behind this is  That a lot of businesses will use independent contractors to avoid paying  Benefits yes, and so they designate you you're writing. Let's say you're a columnist for computer world  You're writing a column every week 52 columns a year computer world should hire you as an employee  But they avoid that by saying well. He's an independent contractor so California is saying no no  You and uber drivers and all these other people need to be employees right wrong the the problem is that this is part of the fantasy land?

Start time: 460.96
End time: 491.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is the other this is the second attack on my line of work that has occurred in the last couple of weeks  So Zuckerberg decided that  So  You know Facebook I should say I shouldn't personalize it Facebook decided they weren't gonna fact-check  Political speech which got all the press and also opinion columns. I'm like wait you not gonna fact-check  We didn't even mention slap opinion on any piece of fake news junk, and that's fine  And what does that say about opinion writers and then this this thing is it's?

Start time: 492.52
End time: 503.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll get back to the a b5, but this is more tech. Yeah, it what it says  Not about opinion writers it says that Facebook doesn't want to weigh in on what the truth or  Fallacy of a statement because they're morons

Start time: 504.12
End time: 508.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Columns are based on facts that are checkable. This is like who doesn't know that it's like

Start time: 510.22
End time: 518.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not no I say in my opinion column Facebook is evil  Yeah, you might say that's a fact, but well it is you might not

Start time: 519.74
End time: 525.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so but nobody says that there's no such thing as a column that says that and doesn't go like to say why

Start time: 525.92
End time: 545.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what opinion columns do but you're  And I think the same thing with political ads in fact the FTC and this is what?  Zuckerberg brought up yeah  Does not does not  Require that broadcast you can lie in a broadcast ad the FTC requires truth and advertising with the exception of political ads

Start time: 545.58
End time: 594.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so Facebook's just doing what the FCC and FTC do but my point is that in like you you have a reported article  That's not an opinion column  They should have be based on the same standard so for example if either one of them says Facebook is evil  That's not really  That's just a crime that's a good that's harmless. That's just a claim that meaning even libelous  I could say you're evil, but if they say they're sacrificing puppies by the thousands. That's if that's a  Provable fact provable fat. Oh, it's pretty much actually it's not a fact so it's like you can't be proved or a provable lie  but my point is that  You the biggest problem is that they're not fact-checking anyone if they say that opinion columns  aren't can be fact-checked because  Every Macedonian teenager is gonna say oh, it's just like everybody is oh, it's parody

Start time: 595.08
End time: 599.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the good news is they won't be able to get a job in California. That's the good news right exactly

Start time: 599.48
End time: 616.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so all it will all be out of work and  so yeah, no, but it's it's just it's just ignorant and  And  It's extremely sort of a klutzy way to just eat  I spent decades literally Leo decades getting the point where I can be a freelance writer with a couple of weeks

Start time: 641.36
End time: 745.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that has more to do with the amount of funding that I have  Right with the funding I don't have  What's really interesting to me about this is that there there's a legitimate reason for state legislatures  To look at things like the car sharing economy and the gig economy and stuff like that and say hey look you are doing  An end run around our laws these people need to be fully employed stop doing this in the way that you're doing it  there's also a very legitimate reason to allow journalists to be freelancers and  You know  And to allow them freedom of work and freedom to be able to move from publication to publication as they see fit  How it is I mean I'm still boggled by this lie right about it when it when it came out in the in on the SPJ  society professional journalists was  You know has been  working on this  And I'm still boggled by the by how this thing got passed in the way that it got passed  And why of all the laws that Newsom decided to not sign he looked at this and said oh sure YOLO  This is fine  It makes no sense to me and and it's so confusing as to why it was able to get through in the way that it is  There's very good reasons for why journalism is set up the way it is now  And has a lot to do with the lack of stability and lack of unions in  journalism jobs  and and and there's you know a very and there's very bad reasons for why the gig economy is the way it is and  Trying to fix them both with you know the world's largest ball-peen hammer seems like a really bad idea  You're a freelancer flow.

I'm stuck here. I'm  Have building a family here, and I've been here all my life like I'm gonna have to go do some grassroots  Campaigning to get this amended because yelling at Lorena on  Twitter is not gonna get it changed at this point  So I ain't yelled at a lot a lot which I completely understand and absolutely of course  that's what's gonna happen, but I I have to do something and being that I live in the state and I  Have the privilege of having a husband that has been you know gets benefits for us  I should go find some time to to do some grassroots campaigning and  Go the old diplomatic way

End time: 837.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

It's outrageous

Start time: 933.32
End time: 972.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We know that that tech companies have been using  freelance and contract  Employees as ways of getting around people who are otherwise doing 35 plus hours a week of work, especially  in  Low wage or minimum wage jobs  So the intent behind the bill clearly seems to be on the up and up what worries me is this particular part of it and  It doesn't just affect journalists  It also affects people in in Hollywood working on TV shows working on movies because a lot of those are freelance  They have some of them have union protection because of the what's the union there?  Can't remember the name of the union but  The writers guild sorry, yeah, of course  But for others, I mean, you know, this is this is simply gonna force journalists either out of California or journalists outside of California  Are gonna benefit at our expense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At least nobody's making money. I mean, I'm actually glad you brought that up because one of the issues here is accountability  You've been freelancing  I mean  I haven't really done a lot of freelance work because when I left CNET I founded the parallax and this has been going on for  You know for four years now, but um, you've been freelancing a really long time  What rates are you getting paid?  You don't have to share but what like compared to how they were because I've heard from friends of mine who freelance at places  Where what they got paid for an 800 to a thousand word piece in?  2005 yeah is  Unchanged from what they got paid for the exact same length piece in  2015 20 cents a word, you know  I mean so so clearly journalists are being taken advantage of and it's clear that it's that that that it's not  for  Wages. Yeah, but it is good for freedom  The difference is is that a lot of journalism, especially if you're in tech journalism you can do from a beach in Thailand  Why are we not on a beach in Thailand?

She's taking your time. No, it doesn't with you  So that I think that's a good point Seth only you would know except that people would gradually learn  Every time you looked at your phone you wait.

Transcript:  I actually have a lot of problems with facial recognition on phones as a way to as the only way to unlock  It's nice to have multi-factor or additional who I mean as a  Motorcyclist people who who are on their phones on cars in cars all the time make me want to  Strangle them. Oh, so you're saying if you're gonna do this with solely you probably don't even have to lift it

Oh, you're gonna love the new version of Android Auto in the car  This is the first phone to ship with an actual radar chip in it  That's the solely to have an it has to be approved by the FCC and the equivalent worldwide in fact  I understand you can't buy solely turned on in some countries India is not they're not gonna sell the phone in India

So okay, so I'm eyes in Europe huge number  Yeah, huge number exactly and you five eyes will unlock the phone really well really fast  Yeah, but it it's it's really not a global phone for because the solely chip  And if I as a solely chip user in the US go to a non solely country it just stops working  It that's what she says she offends. How do I get the phone?

The answer is you bet now runs Chrome and now well except except now Chrome and Firefox are doing their thing  It's all to me as far as I'm concerned  I think like the more important issues are how do these devices handle the the  things that  Consumers need to be concerned about and businesses need to be concerned about when it comes to privacy security

End time: 2785.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not a bad idea on the face of it, but I think  But seriously, I think it's something that should be an option  I think making it the only biometric especially after the Apple and and Google had such great success with fingerprint readers  That forcing people onto facial recognition biometrics. That is a bad idea  I think it's too soon. I think the technology has not yet been  Figured out. I mean we've had biometric fingerprint readers on laptops for a decade and a half or two decades prior to phones

Start time: 2786.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we should point out though that there's fingerprints and there's fingerprints that there's face ID and there's face ID that some are more  Effective than others Apple in fact said that our fingerprint reader has one in ten thousand false positives  Our face reader has one in one million false positives  So they they pitched it that it was a more secure  The fingerprint reader on most laptops until recently was not particularly good, right?

Start time: 2813.10

Transcript:  It was it was it was Apple's purchase of whatever the company was the  Israeli fintech or authentic that was it that  Allow them to really push the development of it and you know and and that spurred the market  I'm just concerned that with how little we know about how  About how facial recognition data gets used  and

Start time: 2944.26
End time: 2994.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So so what though one of them one of the major issues is that at least in the US we haven't yet sorted out legal  ramifications of biometric login and  It's still not considered  A key that you know, right even though it's your face and it's unique to you  And so you and so law enforcement agencies don't necessarily need  You know a court order in order to force you to unlock your device  that's  You know that for one thing that's problematic  The other thing is is that there is potential for abuse when you have when you when we've seen  Demonstrated that you can show a photo of a person to a phone with facial recognition and have that device unlocked  You can't really do that with fingerprints easily

Start time: 2995.06

End time: 3117.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Solely is smarter than that Apple's face ID is smarter than that. You can't show it a picture at that's why you have radar  That's why you have these depth sensing cameras. Mmm, you have to make a 3d model and even then there's also  Infrared sensing so you so you need to have it heated it becomes more and more difficult  I you know, you're probably right you can make a simulcrum that would unlock a phone, but it is non-trivial  I think that we're beyond that time now on the other hand the Samsung s10 and note 10  Which have I've never liked it a kind of a crappy ultrasonic fingerprint reader that's really slow and often fails  It turns out if you have a screen protector on your Samsung phone. It's not reading your fingerprint  It's reading the pattern on the back of the screen protector and so anybody can unlock your phone  Samsung says we're gonna try to fix this this week  That is an example of just bad design, especially since those Samsung phones come with a screen protector  I don't know if the Samsung screen protector does that or only third party do are we yeah  Okay, I thought it was just one plus. No, no Samsung weirdly comes with a screen. I thought why it why are they doing this?  I guess cuz so many people like it  I always peel it off. Really? Yeah, that's brave  Look at this face down on the table the man owns 30 phones doesn't matter  I don't care if a phone dies. I give it to my kids  All right, you know, I don't know what to say I think it's but I think on balance is good any any security is better than no  security  You're right Mike that a lot of software like our banking software suddenly  I can unlock my all my financial stuff with just a face if that face is wrong or bad or not good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh really? Yeah, you have to turn it on you have to go in and they by the way  They make you sign a very at least my bank all my banks make you set a very long multi multi-page disclaimer, which I think  Boils down to you if this doesn't work, it's not our fault  You're taking all responsibility. I just like the idea that this is this because so much valuable stuff is in this phone is  secured and  And my banking information is further secure  I just feel like the even if it's not perfect that if somebody's targeting me  They're gonna get in if they can build a 3d model of my face with an internal heater  They can get in but that I want some speed bumps. That's all we're talking right Seth

Start time: 3164.80
End time: 3192.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ultimately security is just speed well you you you can also use face ID for two-factor authentication  Just need another factor. The other thing is I think the truth is that we're to the point now where it's too late  It's not even worth having the conversation face ID is and face authentication and face  Everything is here to stay forever. It's like we're not talking go back  I know that you know some some governments want to bang that we're talking that's temporary  They'll bring it back later with you see marketing to well, there's well, there's different

Let's not use it  Right, I think that's sensible, but they will fix it  Don't you think those Seth if you're Taylor Swift, we know state Taylor Swift uses this in her stadiums  There's people stalking her there's face recognition used at the gates to make sure those people don't enter the stadium

Start time: 3240.48
End time: 3333.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I that does not seem bad to me. No, I think I think there are legitimate uses of facial recognition  I think that there has to be a much more robust public debate about what those are  I think that relying on lawmakers who have struggled for you know decades to figure out how to construct a decent password  To be leading this debate is a problem  But I also feel that it's a problem for the tech companies to be leading the debate because they have a financial  Investment in this that goes far beyond anything else  I think there's more I think this is actually emblematic of a massive problem with tech  Which is that the more advanced tech gets the harder it becomes to accurately talk about what the problems with it are and  Figure out who the stakeholders are and figure out what the responsibility should be  There's there's no discussion except in a few rarefied circles of the ethics of what's going on that worries me deeply  and  you know and and and and and I think overall that we are not really we as a  Country and we as a society are not really talking about what we want this for what we don't want this for do we want it  To stop Taylor Swift being stocked sure nobody wants her to be stocked except for her stalkers  But what else do we want to be walking past  You know t-shirts in in a shopping hello, Mr.  Anderton right and then and then have you know your phone vibrate with ads for a discount for t-shirts that sounds horrible  The price

Start time: 3335.76

Transcript:  My point is the public will care because people will give away their privacy for three dollars  And then but but that's why it's up to us geniuses here on Mount Olympus to make these decisions  So you opt in right? Well the biggest  confusion around face  Recognition technology is that it's all lumped together  So for example the way you you need to use gin-yang's like not hot dog method for  Waiting on stalkers you don't recognize everyone who comes in it's like oh, there's there's so-and-so there's so-and-so

Transcript:  We have to consider tech companies developing  Technology, especially something like facial recognition not using it in say the US or other countries that have  More advanced debates about what the technology is for and then selling that technology for uses that we would be abhorred by  And again these these conversations are not happening by and large the technology is being forced on people  and and I think again that that that without the conversations about ethical impact and  How it is that we want to proceed we're going to wind up in a situation very similar to where we are with privacy  And other things where where there's issues of community standards there's issues of what privacy means  Now in Android 10 you can you now have a nuanced option for choosing which apps  You've installed can can use your GPS and and locate you and tell I love that by the way, which is great  It's doing that.

To like push things towards you to like get your money  and then when you say it in that way like and that's not a difficult thing to say that's a very like  obvious kind of little statement to put out there and that's when the person goes oh  Yeah, that's a good point  And then it's just putting it into let's not fight flow over

Oh, yeah  Well, she covers IOT and I gather well, here's this here's  What rich Osterloh said when he opened?  The the event he's the vice president of devices services came from I really like rich  Came from Motorola stayed when they sold off  Rick not rich Rick Osterloh said if you look across all of Google's products from search to Maps gmail to photos our mission  Is to bring a more helpful Google for you  Now this is by the way a little bit of a different mission from to organize the world's information and put it at your fingertips  But he says creating tools that help you increase your knowledge success health and happiness now when we apply that mission to hardware and services  It means creating products like the phones the wearables the laptops nest  Each one is thoughtfully responsibly designed to help you day to day  Without intruding on your life without intruding on your life in other words to be in the background  ambient  Anytime you need it just speak  Google's listening. That's my house  Is that what ambient computing is it's it's computing in the background

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is this concepts been around since the 70s 80s 90s something like that  Been around in computer science for a long long time if you recall Andy Rubin's operating system was called the ambient OS  I'm so like the before Android it was  Well, not before Android. This is this is after Google. Oh  That was the ambient OS, but but the but the computer scientists have been knowing about this  It's not just talking to a virtual assistant  But it's also lots of sensors that know what you're doing  Why you're doing it and sort of guide you along and it's kind of just the the computing is it's not just  input output through  requesting searches it's like, you know having the thing just  Sensor that knows when you're a little chilly and turning up the heat without even bothering you about it  So it's like essentially being immersed in a world of sensors and computers that are

Start time: 4152.64
End time: 4177.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  AI is a key part and I remember this in the 70s and 80s and the problem was these sensors were massive  You look like a robot walking around, you know that well what's happening?  I think you can give Apple credit for this because in mass producing the iPhone they've created a  Industrial channel to make these things smaller and smaller and smaller cheaper and cheaper and cheaper now  Everything has sensors your car has sensors your house has everything they're everywhere because they're so cheap, right?

Start time: 4177.64
End time: 4251.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and but not just just now consumer devices are getting super intelligence and  Sensors that are doing things and a great example  It sounds like a trivial thing, but it's actually really interesting from an ambient computing point of view  But when you when your alarm goes off on a on a pixel 4 as you're reaching for it, it quiets down  It sees your hand  So this think about the psychological effect where your environment changes as you move around in 3d physical space based on AI  That's and sensors that are like making these decisions  We're gonna get super used to that the car starts when we're walking toward it  The door opens and unlocks and opens everything's just gonna start increasingly just adapting and changing and doing things for us automatically  And we just would just feel like these all-powerful beings walking around on Mount Olympus  Just like everything's you know, and and by the way the the most common and oldest ambient  Computing device is the automatic door at the grocery store  So we're all used to that we feel it feels if we walk up to an automatic door  We walk into the glass it's exactly and then when you wake up after  It really is a new era and it's  Google's right to be emphasizing this buzzword because it's actually going to be one of the most interesting things over the next five

Transcript:  I suspect that in every case and it's kind of like the grocery door is a really good example  I'm glad you brought that up  These companies move slowly with the capabilities because they want you to get used to the door just opening. Yep  They then then they add new features that you can make your own gestures or although I have to say we still can't make  Our own trigger words for these smart devices, which drives me nuts.

Transcript:  So it's interesting you say that because I so I'm was I am selling my house in the midst of it and I had to  Take down a lot of stuff  Because it's really creepy to have potential buyers walk into a house that has hot mics on it and hot cameras  And which is why?  Anyway, so all the cameras were taken offline  I muted all the smart speakers in the house of which you can imagine like I have everything as a review unit  So it's perfectly outfitted and it was upon request  I also had to take down anything that we didn't want to include in the house because then people will want to have that  as a part of like, you know, because you're selling it as a part of the package and  People are still dubious about the idea of all this IOT in the home and just having hot mics

Start time: 4651.18
End time: 4690.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and you know, the problem with that though is that the microphones will  inevitably end up on our bodies instead of being sprinkled around the house and  We'll each have our own individual microphone, which is our track  a lot of the ambient computing stuff is happening in the in the in the  Hearable type devices and Google's earbuds is one example  but then but this is a  An even more impressive example is a product called the Jabra elite 85h, right?  Basically, it turns up and down the ambient sound based on what it very popular is  So if it hears traffic it figures well, you're walking into traffic  You probably should hear these cars coming at you  So let's turn that up and then you walk into a coffee shop  It's like well, you're probably gonna want to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The whole point of the camera the pixel floor is that it has all of that machine learning smarts the you know  The computer is doing all of the work that your DSLR you'd usually have to do manually to kind of get the results that you wanted  and it's it's

Transcript:  And and to to your concern, I don't think if history is any guide  They're not going to care that much or they're really going to be against the idea of giving people control  The whole all this one these wonderful benefits come at the loss of control, right?  So all this stuff is gonna be happening automatically  I mean even look at something as trivial as in on Twitter where you can see the latest tweets recently  There's a lot of demand for that  So they put it in there grudgingly and then automatically it reverts to the other one  They really really really don't want you to have control over your Twitter feed  None of these companies want you to have control over any of this stuff because that's not where the money is  That's not where the algorithms, you know  They want to be able to just like have this automatic thing going all the time and they don't want nerds like you and me  Basically saying okay, like I want to be in control of this.

Transcript:  Earlier last week I had the opportunity to try on not ride  But try on a new motorcycle helmet made by a company an Australian company called foresight  And once we got past the jokes about their internet and and our health care  You know  Suicidal bushes. Yeah. Well homicidal  but anyway, so so so, you know one of the pieces of tech that they've put into this thing which is really really interesting is that  You turn it on and it scans ways and Google Maps and other  Systems to see if there is law enforcement in the area if there is a traffic incident in the area  Notice I said incident not accident ask me about that later and  If there's construction going on if there's any kind of road related thing if there's and eventually it's supposed to be able to tell if  People have been avoiding a particular lane or something and use that to it to warn riders that  There's some there's something going on in that lane and you should be prepared to to evade it  Maybe it's a branch maybe you know something else in the middle of the lane  It's it's something that you would think  Motorcyclists would really want right you want to know these things in advance what I think yeah  Buy it buy it. It's a community that is heavily populated by people who are skeptical of  Anything that tells them what to do or how to do it  interesting and and so I'm wondering if  There's going to be at some point some kind of backlash where people are just gonna look at this stuff  It's not gonna matter who comes up with it. They're just gonna look at it and say  Nah, you know, I don't want this I don't need this

I've developed little man syndrome  I'm not a little man, but I'm a littler man than them our show today brought to you by  Wasabi hot cloud storage if you're thinking about moving your data storage to the cloud and everybody is these days fact Gartner  Estimated by 2025 80% of businesses will just have shut down their local data centers  80% 10% now 80% in five years that means  163 zettabytes of data will be migrated to the cloud by 2025. It's not a real number  Sounds like I'm making it up bazillion gazillion. It's a it's 163 followed by 21 zeros. I  Counted them. It's a lot of bytes those zettabytes  So it's clear that it's gonna be important cloud storage can be more important than ever and I think unfortunately a lot of people go  Oh, just use Amazon or all you just maybe you just use Microsoft  Nobody's saying oh you just use Google, but that would be the third choice  I want to give you a fourth choice that you actually should use and this is wasabi hot cloud storage  Now I know this is a tough sell because you never heard of them  So let me tell you why you want wasabi first of all  They have a patented process for writing data on disk sequentially as opposed to in blocks  They pat they created this when they were back at carbonite and now Jeff flowers and David friend have created wasabi enterprise class cloud storage  That is 80% cheaper than Amazon and up to six times faster  Faster and cheaper. Okay, that's pretty good  They don't charge for egress Amazon does and they use the Amazon s3 API  So you already know how to use it, but they don't charge unlike Amazon. They don't charge for API requests. So it's more affordable  It's very flexible. It's faster  11 nines of durability. That's the highest you can get  they also do  Integrity checketing regularly they rotate through all the files to make sure not one bit is changed and then you can even declare and this is really  Good nowadays with ransomware. You can even declare some or all of your storage immutable  That means it cannot be modified by ransomware by fun. Both fingered employees not intentionally not accidentally  It's safe. Of course data center redundancy. It's HIPAA compliant FINRA compliant CJIS compliant  Honestly wasabi is just as secure in some cases even more secure than on-prem storage and  Yet still people will go. Oh, yeah. Okay Amazon. No gotta remember wasabi  All I'm asking is when you go present to the boss you say a boss. There's this one more thing  Just one more thing 80% cheaper six times faster 11 nines of durability immutable storage. No charge for egress  No charge for API requests. It's wasabi you want to bang on it?  We're gonna give you unlimited storage for a month when you go to wasabi wasabi  Com offer code twit unlimited free storage for a month. You can really just  Burn that stuff up. Just do everything you can wasabi comm offer code twit  I thank wasabi so much and I really am a  big fan of David and Jeff over there and thank them so much for believing in us enough to  introduce wasabi to you through our  Podcasts I invite you to support twit by going to wasabi comm and using the offer code  Twitter yeah, Google's announced that they're not gonna allow unlimited

No, no, we do care  I'm saying we care at Google nobody Google cares because they're engineers  In fact, Ben Thompson has a great article about Google in which he says the real problem is that  Their engineers they feel like you should just know what we're doing  We don't need to really market it  He says Google from its founding has succeeded simply by being better and letting the masses figure it out for themselves  It completely worked to Google search was better than anything else in the market  Right by virtue of being on the internet was immediately accessible to anyone zero marginal cost basis  We all said we all found it. We all went to Google everybody started using Google the company struggles though  This is again Ben Thompson's tritechary when it actually has to sell something  Look no farther than Google Cloud platform a distant third to Amazon and Microsoft  The company is currently trying to brute force its way into contention hiring a VP from Oracle a whole bunch of salespeople  But those efforts will run up against the company since that simply building better stuff should be enough

However, there's not much evidence  The company's made progress in any of these areas when he says education  Education  And given how strong the company's core business remains not much motivation to either he says they're doing so fine in search and add sales on

It's not really Google doing that  I mean the reason Android is such a big deal  I would say in North America is because of Samsung and all the other manufacturers that came through and put all that money behind marketing  Because when you think about like when I see what Apple does what it's marketing it is  So much better than what Google does and even Samsung like gets on that train  The picture really quick the pixel 3 sold worse than the pixel 2 the pixel 3 until they released the 3a

Maybe we need to make a less expensive one, but that had an edge pixel 3 sold  In its entire year less than Apple sold iPhones in two weeks  So no, they're not a player in hardware  No, but the point I'm making is is that their hardware is so much better than Google's

Start time: 6146.04
End time: 6169.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that their hardware is always in service of whatever software service it is that they're pitching they don't I mean  It's not that they don't care about the hardware, but it's just not their big big concern  so, you know and looking at some of the adoption rates of  Of their products it who cares about the hardware when you've got  And I think it's over 2 billion or very close to 2 billion now using Android
