Transcript:  Jeff, I just want you to, if there's a touchdown, go do the touchdown thing. If there's pass interference, just grab your wrist. Do the whole thing, OK?  All right. Jeff Needles is in charge.  Big story this week. Actually, there were several, but the big story, I guess, is the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack,  which many people said is the worst corporate breach in American history. It couldn't get much worse than this.  Sony Pictures, as you may remember from the news last, I guess it was last week, we heard something.  There's a virus. They've sent people home. All the systems are shut down. Something's gone wrong for a couple of days.  And now we're starting to see leaks. Journalists are getting links on Pastebin to 40 gigabytes of data.  Pretty much, in fact, I would say everything that was on those Sony computers and that corporate network at Sony Pictures Entertainment has been leaked.  We're talking scripts, JJ Abrams pilots, salaries. You can even deduce employees' romances.  But the best part I love is there were folders in the Pastebin that hackers cleverly and conveniently for us journalists organized them.  There is a folder called Passwords, securepasswords.txt. They just put it all in a folder on somebody's desktop.  FTP passwords, logins to the corporate YouTube accounts for various movies, all of this stuff.  And much more seriously, tens of thousands of social security numbers, not only for current employees, but for past employees, completely open.  Just a mess. The group that claims the hack put hashtag GOP on this defaced website. They're called the Guardians of Peace.  We don't know exactly who they are, although we've heard that some of the source code for the hack software is in Korean.  And there is some, you know, I think it's speculation because Sony was doing a movie called The Interview that mocks North Korea, that North Korea is a suspect.  If you've been watching the coverage and we've been doing it all week long on TNT, it is as stunning as you can get.  Here's the homepage, hacked by hashtag GOP. We've already warned you, and this is just a beginning.  We continue till our request be met. We've obtained all your internal data, including your secrets.  And if you don't obey us, I don't know what they're asking for. We'll release data shown to the world.  Determine what you will till November 24th at 11 p.m. GMT.  And while in fact, I don't know if Sony even knew what they wanted. So this stuff was all released.  What do you, Lisa, what do you make of this story? This is a scary story. And do you believe North Korea is involved?

End time: 609.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's really hard to tell at this point. I mean, I don't know about you guys, but like reading that message that you just read and reading about it,  it seemed like like a very like personal attack, like whoever was behind this really felt like Sony had done something wrong or really hesitant for Sony.  And yeah, I don't know. It's hard to tell if it's North Korea specifically.  They definitely don't seem to be really denying that they're behind it, but it's hard to kind of nail it down.

Start time: 611.16
End time: 624.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One security expert said, you know, state sponsored hackers don't create cool names for themselves like the Guardians of Peace.  But maybe but maybe they're doing that to, you know, take people off the scent.

Start time: 625.70
End time: 649.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's possible. I mean, it could be, you know, another group that supports North Korea, maybe that just really dislike Sony for any reason.  But yeah, it's just really terrifying. I mean, we're not even just talking about leaked movies or anything like that.  It's like literally every single thing that Sony has every bit of personal information about employees and about the company in general is just out there, which is terrifying.

Transcript:  Fusion.net, which has done a good job of covering this reports with interviews with former employees that this hack was a long time coming.  This is Kashmir Hill writing for Fusion.net.  Apparently Sony's, by the way, here's the here's storycomputerpasswords.doc.  Systems user IDs and passwords.excel.  This is spreadsheet territories passwords.excel.  The interview budget, the interview, by the way, was that anti-North Korean film.  Unix servers.exceles.  Unlock ID and reset.exceles.  UPS login and password users names and passwords.  Apparently the person.  First of all, there's a couple of issues here.  One employee told Kashmir Hill that the information team for the seven thousand employee Sony Pictures Entertainment is eleven people.  Of those eleven people.  There are only three actual security analysts.  The rest are managers, three managers, three directors, an executive director and a senior vice president.  Apparently, even though they've done risk assessment with third parties, they've ignored the advice.  And Kashmir even found an interview with Jason Spaltrow, who was then the executive director of information security at Sony Pictures.  An interview in 2007 with CIO magazine in which he said, you know, it's a valid business decision to accept the risk of a security breach.  Why spend ten million dollars to avoid a possible million dollar loss?  Apparently, they didn't care if users had passwords like password 123.  It's almost a sense.  And this isn't the first time Sony's been hacked.  They should have.  They should have been prepared.  Right, Serena?  I mean, didn't the PlayStation network get hacked too?  That's right.

Start time: 765.36
End time: 819.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think it was credit cards and that information for folks who were part of the PlayStation online.  That was what?  A couple of years back.  2011 or 2012, I want to say.  Yeah, no, it's it's a little mind boggling to to think just how far they've they've gone off the deep end in terms of not being able to securely guard their employees information.  I mean, again, it would be a ridiculous breach if it was just internal confidential scripts and information being breached.  But the fact that it's also personal information, including passwords, but also including employees names, employees phone numbers, potential security numbers.  Exactly. Exactly.  That kind of stuff.  For one thing, that kind of stuff should be kept under lock and key.  And we don't even know.  I mean, there may be applicants to you've applied for a job at Sony.  Your information might be in there somewhere.  That's really scary.

Start time: 821.48
End time: 830.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sony's promised, you know, credit reporting for people who work there, but for former employees, nothing, even though their information has been leaked to.

Start time: 832.32
End time: 837.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Exactly. I mean, this is a it's a completely widespread hack and and complete like the outrage is completely justified.

Start time: 838.28
End time: 839.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm just glad I never worked for Sony.

Start time: 840.78

Transcript:  Me too. I'm glad I never applied to college because.

Start time: 845.26
End time: 869.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. So the PlayStation hack was three years ago, April 2011.  Seventy seven million accounts had been stolen, including credit cards.  At the time, it was one of the largest data breaches in history.  So it's not like Sony didn't know that these things could happen and know that the you know, the the blowback could be considerable.  And they still.

Start time: 871.62
End time: 890.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Whatever. I think your quote, you know, oh, you know, how well, yeah, we, you know, what's one million dollars?  And if we have to pay ten million dollars?  Well, it's not necessarily the one million dollars that you might lose on, you know, pre-production expenses.  Now that you're looking at employee safeguards, I mean, that's that's all kinds of doors open for lawsuits.  Everything else, it's crazy.

Start time: 892.34
End time: 894.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? They're going to get sued.

Start time: 895.14
End time: 906.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Like Sony is in such a deep hole like this isn't might be the biggest hack of all time.  This is the biggest hack of all time. Somebody put in there, so it's going to be a number.  I don't actors and actress have their social number out there.

Start time: 906.22
End time: 917.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I mean, we know that, for instance, James, we know that James Franco got paid six thousand dollars to drive himself to work on the interview.  I mean, the budgets are there.

Start time: 918.52
End time: 945.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those people are going to get they're going to sue.  You know what I got to do?  I got to change all kinds of stuff in my life because regular people get their identity ID snatched up and people have fake credit card stuff in their name and they've got to work to get that information.  Now, everybody and anybody could just go download this information and go do whatever they want to do.  Sony has got a huge problem.  We might not even have Sony anymore.  They might have to like chop it down and call Tony and start all over again because it is a huge problem.

Start time: 946.20
End time: 973.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, Sony is not all that.  I don't know about the Sony Pictures Entertainment, but Sony, the total corporation has actually been suffering badly.  Their consumer electronics division is losing money like crazy.  In fact, somebody there was a story a few months ago that most of the money Sony makes comes from selling insurance in Japan.  This is not you may be right.  It sounds like hyperbole say this could be the end of Sony.  It could be the end of Sony.

End time: 1026.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like everything is out there.  Like anything you ever wanted to know is out there.  What color socks people were wearing.  Like it is insane.  Who was sleeping with whom.  That's the thing too.  You're taking corporate things with people and then you don't get fired and you sleep with your subordinates.  So you take your subordinates on an island trip.  I need to go work at Sony.  They got money to burn.

Start time: 1027.70
End time: 1085.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Letters showed that Sony executives were censured but not fired for exactly that.  For taking junkets with their girlfriends and charging it back to subordinates.  Subordinates.  Yeah.  Let's see.  There's a, let's see.  Sony, let's see.  Tribune Broadcasting.  The syndication deal pays $37,500 per week over the three years to air Seinfeld on nine of its stations.  That's $5.85 million.  We know how much they paid for the King of Queens, the Dr. Oz show, All in the Family.  If I were Seinfeld though, I'd be a little worried that my social security number had been leaked.  We know how much Seth Rogen and James Franco got paid to be in the interview.  I think it's interesting that the GOP is releasing this information, particularly about the interview.  I think it's a red herring, don't you?  I don't think it's the North Koreans that did this.

Start time: 1086.00
End time: 1124.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't get that vibe.  It might well be Asian hackers, but I don't think it was the government of North Korea,  especially when you consider that the interview was actually delayed several months because they did excessive rewrites  because they had a contact in the government in North Korea who was like, mmm.  Can't do that.  Yeah, exactly.  So I'm like, if they went to all of this trouble to tone this movie down so they didn't get government retaliation,  either there's someone in the North Korean government who's like, this is unacceptable.  I'm going to go contact some black hat hackers and make sure the folks don't get it.

Start time: 1124.00
End time: 1152.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It sounds like it's that, right? It's not state sponsored, it's black hat.  And for all we know, it's one guy.  And as we all know, with the way hackers work, they cover their tracks.  The details of this particular hack had shown them routed through five or six countries.  They do everything they can.  And in fact, it's a you know, you see this every time in mainstream media, oh, is it Chinese?  Because that's, you know, yeah, it was through a Chinese computer, but you don't know really did that.  Aren't all computers Chinese computers?  Ultimately, they all belong to China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One third of everybody online is Chinese.  Yeah.  In North Korea, however, don't don't deprecate the abilities of the North Korean hacking team,  because according to this article from writers, Jumin Park and James Pearson writing,  there is something called Bureau 121, a cyber warfare cell in North Korea,  staffed by really pampered expert hackers.  This is if you want to get a good job in a state that is, you know, for many of its citizens, they're starving.  It is a failing state.  But but if you want to do well, become a computer.  I don't know if I were in North Korea if I wouldn't try to get a job at this place.  Military hackers, Reuters, Reitz are among the most talented and rewarded people in North Korea,  handpicked and trained from as young as 17.  Their informant Jang Se-yool studied with them at North Korea's Military College for Computer Science,  or the and this is the school I'd like to have a degree from, the University of Automation.  He defected in this six years ago, but he knows about that.  He says Bureau 121 has about 1800 hackers and is the is the elite.  In North Korea, it's called the secret war.  So it is it is conceivable that there could be cyber warfare from North Korea.  And maybe if there's, you know, they're they're hiding their roots.  But why? I mean, look, if you're North Korea, this isn't the first thing you do is hack Sony Picture Entertainment.

Transcript:  I should save that and I didn't. But everybody wants to get their kids, you know, more up on how technology works.  But once you start playing with a little bit kits, you're going to suddenly say out of my way, kid. I want to play with this a little bit.  The first time I saw little bits was I think two years ago. They are now they've got an ever growing library of modules ranging from simple like power, sensors and LEDs to wireless, even programmable modules.  This is a typical little bits kit, unlimited creations, but there's no soldering. And that's that's so cool. It's a great holiday gift for anybody for eight years old and up.  Whether you're a musician, a programmer. Yes, you can make musical instruments with this a gadget geek, a home project enthusiast, no wiring or soldering.  But that doesn't limit you. You can still do great things. I am going to make a little bits right now on the show. Are you ready?  And then I'll tell you how you can get 20 bucks off your purchase. I think I want to make the tickle machine. All right.  Let's see if I can. How fast can you make a tickle machine? So I do this just so you can understand kind of how it works.  There's the power module. So that's in there all color coded, which makes it easy. I need a wire module.  Now, instead of soldering these just kind of snap together and their magnets. So you can't do it wrong, which is which is really nice.  It all goes together and you'll know because it's got this very satisfying click when it goes together. There it is.  There's the wire. I need a motor, a DC motor. Where is that? Ah, here it is. All right. We're going to snap that in here.  I'm doing this from the instructions. I'm telling you a kid can get it.  But what's nice is when a kid does this and gets the satisfaction of doing it right, there's this just great sense of accomplishment.  And that's kind of what you want. You'll also learn how this stuff works. Now, for this this little tickle machine to work, I'm going to need something they call the motor mate.  I'll put that right on here on the end. And now I need a feather. Let me just reach behind me and pluck one.  Where my feather go? I thought I had a feather here. All right. I won't I won't have a feather.  I'll take a little bit of the piece of paper here. How about this? And I'm going to put this on the end on that little motor mate.

And I'll just put the battery, the juice, juices loose.  The connector in here. Little Bits dot com. You can see all the different kits and there's a variety of price ranges and and kits.  And you can get the simpler kits, but it's nice as they all work with one another. All right. You ready?  Oh, and give me your chin here. I'm going to tickle you. Don't say that on air.  If everything goes well, Owen should laugh right about now.  You did it. I made a little tickler. Even a Leo could do it.  Isn't that cool? And you and but you learn what all these parts do, what all the what all the everything does.  There's no soldering, so it's safe. But it's I think it's the beginning of what could be just a really exciting adventure for your kid or yourself.  New customers get 20 bucks off purchases of 80 dollars or more when you go to little bits dot com and the promo code twit.  There is free shipping in the U.S. for our fans.

Transcript:  I wish I I wish it had been around. I mean, I did soldering as a kid.  My dad showed me how to like solder circuit boards together and that was really neat.  But soldering is also you get the trial and error of a little bit of burning.  Yeah, yeah, I definitely have like some scars from soldering gone wrong.

I got to say it right so you can find it little bits dot com.  All right. We have enough commiserating for the poor folks at Sony Pictures Entertainment.  Do you just real quickly?  I also don't want to reveal too much, right?  There's the real temptation.

Start time: 1846.34
End time: 1919.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's what Twitter's for. Twitter loves to snark hate.  And especially when you're going to put something on live, which is nationwide  for the entire you know, for people to see, they're going to they're going to go after the snarking.  Although I will say like in defense of live theater, live theater is something that is very difficult to to produce.  They were doing it in a theater with no audience, which I feel like they're just doing it for television cameras.  And I mean, some of these people have of course acted for for cameras before.  But you're talking about Walken, you know, Walken did a lot, you know, movies and he's he's done some SNL skits and everything else.  But at the same time, live audience is so crucial to having that, you know, having that connection  and being able to actually turn your performance into something static, into something into something real.  And I have to wonder NBC's decision on that front.  Like, yeah, sure, you don't necessarily want the clapping to come in.  But at the same time, acting to an empty theater and knowing that like 3000 miles away, there are lots of people being like, oh, I'm laughing at you and tweeting it angrily.  I mean, I do think that probably had a little bit of a it was weird.  It was weird. You didn't have your daughter.  Watch it. It was weird. We were watching football.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I agree with you.  I saw the sound of what they did sound the music last year.  That was exactly my complaint is like it's dead because there's no live audience.  Just doing a theater. What's wrong with people going?  I do it in a theater. Let people applaud.  Have a live audience. It would be so much better.  Here's here's Allison Williams as Peter Pan.

Transcript:  This is fair use.  We took a full screen either.  By the way, I did check and Sony should start letting the Pirate Bay have their movies ahead of time because then they know what movies they shouldn't release.  So so three movies, four movies, five movies were were leaked out.  And you can tell what people wanted to see.  Brad Pitt's Fury, which everybody wants to see, downloaded one point two million times in the first three days.  Annie. Fewer people want to see 200,000 times something called Still Alice 103,000 times.  But the winner in this to write love on her arms.  Remember, remember, Fury got one point two million downloads, 19,000 downloads for to write love on her arms.  I think that they should not release that movie.  We just saved them money.  We've probably saved them billions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the problem.  These were all pre-release and that's what I want.  Yeah, that's what you don't want.  But this is furious fury already out.  Or is that coming?  That's a Christmas.  It's been out.  It's been out.  So that's maybe people knew it was good.  And it's Brad Pitt.  Let's talk about the iPod lawsuit.  It was touchy go for the iPod lawsuit.  It was on that we were.  It was on Death Watch on Friday because they were down to their last plaintiff.  So to understand this, you have to go back to the dim dark years of I think 2000.  What is the year 2006 through 2009?  And we've all experienced this.  You have your music is on an iPod.  Now remember in those days, the only way you get it on was by connecting a 30 pin USB cable to a Mac or a PC running iTunes and synchronizing.  Right.  That's how you got the music on there.  Now everybody's done this.  You go to another computer, you connected to iTunes because you want to synchronize it.  And it says, wait, this iPod is associated with another iTunes.  Would you like to erase it?  And if you say yes, everything on your iPod is erased.  Right.  And I tell you, people I've for years got calls from people saying, well, I didn't mean to click.  Yes, but I did.  What do I do now?  It was erased.  Well, apparently this lawsuit is based on that.  And it says Apple is preventing music from competing services from working on its iPod.  I mean, of course, music from competing services works on the iPod.  Maybe it's also so that's one.  But the other one is like a real player doesn't work on an iPod.  Well, yeah, because it's got copy protection on it.  And so anyway, this is one of those lawyers put this together because they're going to make some money.  The class in this lawsuit is a lot of people, eight million people.  They're asking Apple for three hundred fifty million dollars.  But it's been going on for years.  And the way you know that is one of the witnesses for this is Steve Jobs.  They deposed this is this seems to me criminal.  They put they deposed Steve Jobs on his deathbed three months before he died.  The guy is really sick.  Remember how sick he was at the end?  And he has to spend his a few remaining hours testifying in this stupid case.  Well, they on Friday, they played the Steve Jobs case.  They did. They have one plaintiff.  They were found somebody who bought an iPod in that time frame.  And Jobs said, what everybody assumes.  Well, we had to do this.  The record companies would have in fact actively threatened us to pull all their music from iTunes unless we protected them.  And the record companies have always considered an iPod the ultimate piracy device.  Right.  You put a hundred as much as one hundred sixty gigs of music on it.  You go to your friend's house, say, hey, have my music.  So it had to do that.  They couldn't support others.  DRM because, well, that would be crazy.  Be like having two steering wheels in a car.  So that EQ Steve Jobs confirmed what everybody assumed in his sad to say deathbed deposition.  What do you think of this case?  What do you think of this case?  If even if they win half them and they got every penny, half the money gets consumed by the lawyers and the rest is about a million people.  You'll get a postcard with an iTunes gift card for 50 to 50 cents.

Start time: 2273.68
End time: 2335.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The thing to me that really just it makes me frustrated is this is not a lawsuit for something that's still a problem.  This is something that was a problem back in 2006 and really very shortly became a non-issue as soon as the DRM curtain was lifted and we got the iPhone.  Right.  I mean, now it's a lot easier to put music from competing services because they're all MP3s and they all you know, they're all copy free to a certain extent.  So I can buy music on Amazon and then put it on my iPhone or on my iPod or, you know, on my non Apple device if I want to like music has has grown and shifted in terms of how the record companies view it.  And it's same thing with movies to a certain extent that the copy, you know, copy protection is a little stricter on movies and television shows.  But there's still there's room and it's it's growing.  This the thing that they're suing about is no longer an issue.  So they're basically being like, you know, that thing that irritated us like five years ago, we want money for it now.  50 cents. I want my 50 cents.  This injustice cannot stand.

Start time: 2341.97
End time: 2384.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who even remembers anymore?  I mean, the law when they started the lawsuit, OK, fine.  But at this point, lawyers play this game and drag it out.  Eight million people, they get forty three dollars and seventy five cents each person after you take out the 70 percent.  I know lawyers you deal with it's more than 50 50.  Lawyers do like a 67 33 kind of whatever.  And then four percent goes to the magicians and the magic.  I don't know.  But at least 70 percent is going these lawyers.  So you might get like four bucks per person.  And who really cares about the money?  The lawyers care about it because they're going to get a lot more of that money.  So, I mean, just just squash it.  Yeah. Just for that reason.  You're not doing it for the people.  The four lawyers, whoever they are, are going to get that money.  Yeah, it seems like it's really just for the lawyers because no one else is really benefiting from it.

Transcript:  I mean, like Serenity said, like, there's no I mean, if people did have songs deleted from their iPods back then, chances are you don't even have the money.  And you probably don't even have an iPod anymore.  So, I mean, it's just something that people like Apple users aren't even thinking about.  You grew up with the iPod, didn't you?  I actually I had the iPod touch a few years ago.  But before that, I actually had the Dell Pocket DJ.  What?  Oh, my God.  She's a rebel.  What's wrong with your parents?  And it was horrible.

It's really big slab of glass, but it has, I don't know how much, but it has like a 512  or a gig storage on it and you can listen, but you can't plug headphones in because then  you'd be going like this every time you ran it.  So it has to be Bluetooth, right?

I used to buy Blu-ray or like DVDs and Blu-ray DVDs in a way to be like, like I do with my  book collection where it's like, I have a lot of books on my, on my iPad that I use  to read and via Amazon Kindle that I read.  But there are a couple of books that I'm like, I love these and I'm going to reread them  over and over again.  And I like having a physical copy to be able to lend to people.  So for a long time, DVDs and Blu-rays, that was, you know, what I did.  But I haven't bought a movie in so long.  I've digitally bought them and I've digitally read them and I've gone and seen them in theaters.  But I can't like the last time I bought a copy of a DVD was 2011.  It's been a while.  Right.  You know, it's, but it doesn't feel, especially because the media keeps on changing.  Like you've got DVD, then you got HD DVD and then you have Blu-ray and soon we're going  to have 4K.  And it's like, all right, time to rebuy all the movies, you know, and love every four  years.  You don't do that with a book.  You buy a book.  And the books is on your shelf.  Do you still buy books?  I never have to upgrade the books.  I buy books.  She's got books on her shoulder.  I buy physical books for things that I really, really...  She's got eight books.

And I even wonder, well, she's going to download stuff.  You get a Spotify account and you never start...  Even Amazon is now letting you borrow books.  I feel like the whole...

Books are cheaper now than they will ever be again in history.  Really?  Think about it.  I mean, they are going to become a rarity for people who can afford them.

This is a perfect example of why buy stamps at the post office  and you can buy a postage online, print it with your computer and your printer  right on the envelope. You don't even have to print a stamp.  Just, you know, print when you're printing the address.  Stamps.com will print the address, the return address, your company logo  and the postage all at the same time.  Any size package, media, priority mail, express mail, stamps.com.  You leave and save money that you can't even save at the post office, for instance.  They've got discounts.  The post office won't sell you on priority mail and priority mail express shipments.  One push of the button will give you package insurance.  Stamps.com fills out all of the, you know, customs forms for international mailing.  They will automatically email your recipient if they have a confirmation.  All of this makes you look like a postal professional.  And I'll tell you, if you're selling on eBay or if you're selling on Amazon or Etsy,  if you're doing business, the better your mailings look,  the more professional you look as a business.  Stamps.com.  You'll also save money because of the stamps.com scale.  It's a USB scale that makes sure you always have exactly the right postage.  You never have to put an extra stamp on so it doesn't come postage due or send mail to a client.  Postage due. That's like an insult.  That's like, don't do that.  Stamps.com will solve the problem.  You'll never have that problem again.  You'll never have to go to the post office.  This is the worst time of year to go to the post office.  This is not a story.  It's amateur hour, right?

He said, you checked in.  Oh God, never going to do that again.  Google is eliminating captures.  I like this idea.  In fact, sometimes computer technology really makes you go, that's great.  You've seen these horrible, horrible captures where you have to prove you're not a robot  by typing in something that a robot probably can understand better than you.  Weird text.  Well, you may see this on some sites soon, a checkbox that says I'm not a robot.  You don't have to type any weird text, no distorted words or numbers.  Google says it can, in many cases, tell the difference between a fake person trying to  like create automated accounts or whatever and a real person by watching how you move  the mouse, how you click.  Brilliant, brilliant.  Your IP address and cookies can also tell you tell them that you're a human.  Actually, some people might say, well, of course, Google knows you're a human.  It says, oh, hi, Leo, of course, you're not a robot, let you write.  In fact, what does it even need to click for?  Sometimes, though, and I do know some people, Sarah Lane would like this, when a click  doesn't produce a click, doesn't produce a conclusive response, they'll pop up a window  either with distorted text or with a little test like this one.  They show you a cat and say, select all the images below that match this cat.  And then they show a cat, a dog, a hedgehog and some parsley.  Oh, and even you could stop this one.

I think it was a Carnegie Mellon.  And what they did with this is one of the words was an actual capture  like to test if you're a robot.  The other one was a word that they were scanning in an automated book scans,  but couldn't really understand so that you're helping them out.

Transcript:  So you remember the L.A.  school district put on a 30 billion dollar bond  to buy iPads for every kid in the school, which, by the way,  about six months ago, it wasn't widely reported.  Everybody, you know, Apple really, oh, they're going to buy iPads  for everybody in the school and Apple.  And they didn't mention the fact that they killed that  when it was determined that super tenacious schools had a friend at Apple.  The whole thing was kind of a without bid.  But I think now for the first time ever, U.S.  schools have actually bought more Chromebooks than iPads.  That is the best thing I've heard, actually.  Google has shipped that this is IDC and Google's not giving out the information.  Certainly Apple's not, but IDC's research  reports that seven hundred fifteen thousand Chromebooks  were shipped to schools in the third quarter.  That's more than that.  Seven hundred two thousand iPads.  Chromebooks are a quarter of the educational market.  They're about half the cost of a discounted iPad, a school discounted iPad.  Yeah, I think that's good news.

Start time: 4008.10
End time: 4036.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My daughter has they use iPads in her class, and I had to request  for her to take computer class because I want her to learn how to use a keyboard  and type and not have me just drum it into her head.  But they give all these kids iPads and they think, oh, they're learning computers.  It's not the same as using a keyboard and a mouse.  Like you need to take a computer class.  They're learning Apple. Yeah, they're learning to touch things.  They're learning the lazy way out.  And the Chromebooks at least give you some kind of physical  tactile function of typing something and using a standard keyboard and mouse.

Start time: 4037.10
End time: 4062.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And even beyond like, you know, younger kids learning how to type and things like that.  I mean, if you're in college and you're on the Internet all the time  and you need to do writing or you need something like to toss in your bag  to bring around campus and you don't want to worry about it getting stolen.  You're keeping it in your dorm room like you can get a Chromebook.  That's like 200 bucks. That'll do the same thing.  It's super fast.  They boot up like insanely fast most of the time.  So like, you know, I never even shut mine down.

Start time: 4062.48

Transcript:  I just close it. Right.  It's yeah. Just open it up.

Start time: 4065.46
End time: 4172.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, they're they're designed in such a way that I think they actually make a good  choice for for schools, especially as you were mentioning before,  the fact that they're not instant theft targets.  Oh, I will say that IDC number was a little misleading the way that  the way that it was initially reported and they weren't taking into account  various things of Apple's education market versus Google's.  But even even that aside, like I generally I love the iPad.  And I think that the iPad is wonderful.  And I'm so glad that kids are getting training on it.  But at the same time, when it comes to your average school, again,  we're talking about, you know, the tech bubble versus the United States as a whole.  I think it makes more sense to be trying to get more computers  into the hands of kids than necessarily the best computer  for a vastly limited market.  It's like I had I had Apple like Mac pluses in my classroom growing up,  but only because my dad worked at Caltech and was able to like funnel a grant in there.  Otherwise, you know, of course, there are lots of dells.  And lots of Windows dos computers.  And you learn, you know, basic commands on that way.  No, I mean, it wasn't it wasn't the most fun thing in the world.  But if you think about it like a two hundred dollar or one hundred dollar laptop,  the fact if you can get that into the hands of almost every elementary school  children like child, that means that they're all getting access to the Internet.  They're all getting access to basically a wider world,  to multiple viewpoints in terms of their history lessons, in terms of biology,  chemistry, et cetera.  So it like as much as I love the iPad and as much as I think that it's  an amazing tool for education when we're talking about the vast majority of  of children, I think it's better to get as many people as possible online  and connected rather than, oh, they have to have the best experience  or no experience at all.

When I'm sitting home, my butt and there's no physical disc,  I didn't have to drive anywhere.  They don't have the warehouse or anything.  Why is it my game? Forty five dollars.

Like, it's not a lot per disk, but overall, they do have to spend hundreds of  thousand dollars.  The real problem is that they're still trying to meet multiple markets.  If it was a game that was only marketed online, you can cut a shit like you can  shave off a huge portion of the cost.  But because they have to pay for the manufacturing anyway,  because they are going to make a digital and a physical version,  they're keeping the price exactly the same because they're like, oh, well,  if we discount it, then I know why they do it.  I just don't want them to.

Transcript:  Well, from a one from one perspective, I understand it,  because from an insurance and from a safety perspective, especially given  all that we've heard about, you know, Uber drivers and women like in Boston,  I feel safe taking an Uber in other cities.  I feel far less safe because like especially, you know, in New York.  Why do you feel safer in Boston?  Well, in Boston in general, I've had a much higher percentages.  And I'm also when I'm taking Ubers, I'm usually taking Uber.  I'm usually taking Ubers with multiple people.  You wouldn't take an Uber alone.  I don't feel comfortable.  Would you take a cab?  I used to. No, I just I generally don't feel comfortable as a woman alone  and the city at night taking an Uber or how do you get home?  For that matter, do you walk home?  I drive, I walk and I take my bike like I despite the I mean,  I'm probably the safest.

End time: 6137.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, walking is a little scary in Boston, especially  because once you get out of the city proper, the lights are a little scary.  But like it's frustrating because I would love when I when Uber first started,  I relied on it constantly because I was living in San Francisco and and like it was  it was a really good way.  And at the time they had super discounts.  So it wasn't even super expensive for me to be like, oh, well, I'm working late at the office.  I'm just going to take an Uber rather than ride on the bus for two hours  and be slightly nervous about getting home.

Yeah, that's disgusting.  Like from like June until September, I will take Uber and I will spend that money because  it's hard for a brother to get a cab from time to time.

And I feel like for people, like when I do get an Uber, I very carefully like I double  check the license plate that it says with the person that I'm getting in the car.  And I feel like not everybody does that.  And I really worry about like if that actually if Uber trying to sneak under the radar here  might actually increase the risk.  Yeah, the risk. There we go.  I was like the unsafety and that is not a word.  But you know what I mean?  No, the risk, the calculated risk of saying, oh, yes, I'm an Uber X.  You just see somebody standing on the curb with their phone out.  I mean, all you do is open the door.  Yeah, I'm an Uber.  Come on.  Yeah, exactly.

Get ready because this is going to be a holiday season full of this stuff.  You remember the Target breach occurred between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It was during the top shopping season.

Almost all of the major credit card companies, like I know Citi does this  and I know Chase does this, they allow you to create virtual account numbers,  virtual card numbers, one-time use numbers.  Yeah, one-time use.  And I do that for all my online shopping, especially during the holidays,  just to be safe because if they do have a breach for whatever reason, then great.  They've got a number that can never be used again and you don't have to change your card,  etc.  And honestly, I would so much rather this is the first Black Friday.  I think I did not go out at all.  My sister and my mother usually like to do a post-Thanksgiving fun thing.  But this year I was here, so I was just like, yep, I'm not going to do Black Friday.  Instead, I got like a 40% off coupon from Lucky Brand Jeans.  And so I did all of my, all the things that I normally do.  I just like, I shopped online and it's getting delivered to my door tomorrow.  And I'm like, this is so much easier than fighting my way through mall crowds  and eating like honey and pretzels.

Transcript:  But it's like, yeah, you catch it and you're not liable for any losses.  But who loses?  Right.  Exactly.  The banks do.  Exactly.  And that's why the banks now say target.  And the new bill, by the way, the new chip and pin bill,  which requires that by October of next year, chip and pin everywhere.  Of course, you'll still be able to swipe and assign the old way,  but chip and pin will be more secure.  And it has rules in it that say the person who's responsible for the loss is the least  secure component in the system.  And that's the bank saying we want the retailers to suffer.  They better install these things.  And if they don't, they're going to be liable.  We're we're no longer going to foot the bill for this.  So I think it's going to get better, but it's going to get worse before it gets better.  And that's going to be in the next next month.  Ron Wyden had I just want to praise him.  It's not going to happen.  It's never going to work.  Ron Wyden has introduced a bill to ban FBI back doors and tech products.  If there were ever a bill more likely to fail, it's this.  I don't know what it is.  Wyden is from Oregon and he has been, I think, a good strong fighter for privacy.  It's called the Secure Data Act.  It would ban federal agencies from making manufacturers alter products  to allow easier surveillance or search.  Of course, FBI Director James Comey has requested that that be possible.  He says it's necessary.  Wyden says strong encryption and sound computer security, the best way to keep  Americans data safe from hackers and foreign threats.  That seems obvious.  Comey says it's the best way to help the terrorists.  The more this is the quote, the more we rely as a society on these devices,  the more important it is law enforcement and public safety officials have a back door.

Transcript:  One thing about the back door here.  When you put a back door in a product, ideally you're putting it for a certain market.  It's either the company itself being like, oh, we want to fiddle with this,  or you're giving it to the NSA.  But as we've seen, security, not so great when it comes to back doors.  You put a back door on my iPhone, what's to say that you don't have a talented black hat hacker  from Asia or Europe or even the United States being like, oh, I found this vulnerability.  Let me exploit it to the fullest extent.  It just doesn't seem it's not logical.

It was you.  And I also must point out, the chat room said like eight times,  Serenity Kowa doesn't sound like a real name either.  I'm going to have to check her social and make sure it's not on Sony.  You better hope you never apply for a job at Sony.  I'm going to make sure that that's you and that you're legit and everything's on up and up.  The chat room is correct.  That is too fancy of a name, too pretty, too perfect.
