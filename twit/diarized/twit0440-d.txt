Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the show formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show. Now it's just international  CES. John C. Dvorak is here. Hello.  In Plaid. The lumberjack Dvorak. Yep.  So thrilled to have Natalie Morris back from her beautiful New Jersey abode.  Hi. Did you go to Vegas this week?

Start time: 167.68
End time: 174.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I did not. Did Clayton?  No, actually we both sat this one out. That's how you know you're a senior technology

Start time: 176.44
End time: 198.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  correspondent if you don't have to go. If you don't have to go, right. It's mostly  the peons that go. Yeah, it starts if you're a little junior  cub reporter you don't get to go. And then the day comes, I'm going to CES. You do that  about 12 times and then you go, I can't wait not to go to CES. And then finally you get  senior enough or old enough that you don't have to go.

Start time: 198.46
End time: 200.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or unemployed enough if you want to put it that way.

Start time: 200.50
End time: 215.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or unemployed enough. That's another way to put it. You know who is here who was at CES  and I'm thrilled to have him on. YouTube star Marcus Brownlee. Ultimate frisbee player.  Hi Marcus. MKBHD. You say it so fast I got to get MKBHD.

Start time: 216.80
End time: 223.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I say it so fast in a lot of videos that I forget that people who are new don't  know what it stands for so I kind of slow down a little bit.

Start time: 223.88
End time: 243.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm thinking it stands for Marcus K. Brownlee in Hi-Def.  Exactly. I got it.  Yep. Already you filed, I don't know, five or six  reports from CES. Already more than 800,000 views on YouTube. The biggest one though was  my kit. 170,000 views for the bag of stuff that you brought to CES.

Start time: 243.52
End time: 270.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well I kind of teased that a little bit because I have changed a lot of the video gear  I've been using in the past couple of weeks. So I was going to show what video gear I use anyway  and I figured CES was a good time to do that because I was bringing a select portion of it  to cover the show. You used a DSLR to shoot?  I could consider a DSLR. I guess it's not a DSLR. The Canon C100 is the camera that I use.  I used to use a DSLR in the Canon 5D Mark III.

Start time: 271.70
End time: 275.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is their $5,000 or $6,000 kind of Mark III-like but it's intended for video?

Start time: 281.78
End time: 300.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, it's video first. As great as the 5D is and always will be at video,  it's a stills first camera. So having a video first camera with a lot of video functions and  video layout body and everything like that is really helpful for shooting, especially with  running on stuff you do at CES. But it does use the Canon lenses,

Start time: 301.96
End time: 310.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  which is great. It's kind of the best of both worlds. What's the model number again?  It's the EOS C100. Okay, got it. Yeah.

Start time: 310.34
End time: 329.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. And they announced this, I think, at last CES. Pretty sweet gear. I could see that the  YouTube videos are paying some money here. That's nice. You can get a good kit,  but Marcus is still in school. You're studying for an MBA, right?

Start time: 330.34
End time: 334.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm majoring in business. Business.  Yeah. See, this is a smart guy.

End time: 348.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's you're over the hill. Yeah. What?  Nothing. I didn't say anything. I'm over the hill.  No. Everybody's raving about how beautiful you look today, by the way.  She's a young woman. She's got plenty.

Start time: 349.02
End time: 363.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you notice this as you guys are going on and on about how gorgeous she is?  I think you're gorgeous too, Marcus.  I just want to be fair. John, not so much. Me, not so much. We're the old guys.

Start time: 363.56
End time: 367.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, John, we had all these talks in the pre-show about how not to offend women.

Start time: 368.97
End time: 370.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He doesn't care. That was not-

Transcript:  Brought to you by Dots. That was not offensive.

Start time: 372.58
End time: 376.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Kara Swisher and her... Go ahead, Marcus. You've got a bigger Dots. He's got a...

Start time: 378.00
End time: 381.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've one-upped him already.  Well, I...  Wait a minute. Hold up your Dots.

Start time: 381.88
End time: 390.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's a million ways I can go with this. That's the world's smallest Dots.  I refuse to go down that road.  He totally one-upped you.  Yeah. Well...

Start time: 390.84
End time: 397.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're 30 minutes, 30 seconds into the show.  He came from your studio.  It's not my fault, man. You show your little tiny Dot on TV.

Start time: 398.42
End time: 401.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The game we're playing is I hold up something and you have to hold up a bigger one.

Start time: 401.26
End time: 404.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apparently, Marcus won. He won't be able to eat the whole box.

Start time: 404.88
End time: 418.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I literally just got it. I had lunch. See, I'm on West Coast time,  so I forgot to eat lunch today, so I made the mistake of grocery shopping while hungry.  Not supposed to do that. So I ate lunch and then continued eating.  So now that's why I had lunch.

Start time: 418.16
End time: 420.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's when you buy the really big packages of Dots.

Start time: 420.20
End time: 421.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do know that's not food, right?

Start time: 422.80
End time: 429.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I had the real lunch and I was still hungry because it's 9 p.m. West Coast time.

Start time: 431.02
End time: 455.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Kara Swisher wrote kind of the article, I guess a lot of people wanted to write about CES.  I'd love to hear your opinion, Marcus, because you were on the ground,  in which she says basically it isn't where innovation happens, it's where marketing happens.  Really, you go here to get bombarded with marketing.  Were you able, Marcus, to find this is by the way on their new recodes.

Start time: 455.30
End time: 462.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  By the way, that's pretty astonishing. She'd come up with something so radical.  It's not radical.  Since it's a show for dealers, but okay.

Start time: 463.10
End time: 483.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, originally it was a show for dealers, right?  And by the way, she doesn't knock it.  She says it was a great show, but it's just loud.  Most important, the point I'm making, the most important point she's making  is you don't go there to see something new, particularly.  Marcus, did you see, was there anything you saw that you thought was particularly innovative?

Start time: 486.10
End time: 503.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would tend to say no, even though a lot of stuff there was really cool and advanced and  new in terms of the tech used, but I felt like half of the stuff that was really cool and new  was just there to get some press and make some noise and may or may not actually happen.  So I tend to agree with that.

Start time: 503.72
End time: 533.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that stuff never makes it to market.  Well, I'll give you a perfect example.  Maybe fall, it was when you asked, oh, what's the release date and the price on this?  And they say, oh, yeah, and you know, anything that's actually come to market,  this is my CES decoder. If they give you a date of May,  that probably will hit the market because that means that it's in the product development cycle  enough that they know something about it and it may not actually launch till October.  But anytime they say April or May, you're like, okay, this I'll actually see.  So if they say fall, you'll never see that thing.

Start time: 533.86
End time: 598.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Forget it. There's nothing there. There's no there there.  So this is one that was more in the fall category. It was at the Intel booth from a  company called Rest Devices. And I thought as the, because you have two young children, maybe you  have noticed this. It's a baby onesie that's a baby monitor. And this to me says everything  you need to know about CES 2014. It's wearable. It has an attached lily pad and turtle that connect  to your home's Wi-Fi and your kid wears it. It doesn't look, I think the kid's going to have  a pain in the hip from this because it goes on the onesie. It measures respiration, skin temperature,  body position and activity level and sends it all not only to a smartphone app, but to a mug  that mom or dad has at the table at breakfast table. And the mug smiles if the baby's happy  and frown. This is the worst thing ever. This is this gets the happy fork nomination  for the dumbest product at CES this year that got all the coverage, all the coverage. This is made

Start time: 598.36
End time: 605.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for TV. Right. Yeah, that's dumb and dangerous. And totally dangerous. I agree with that.

Start time: 605.96
End time: 609.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  100%. Apparently you could put it on teenagers too, which is kind of no, that's different. Oh,

Start time: 609.26
End time: 652.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  okay. You know, I didn't hear very much talk and I was looking for it. I was watching all the  coverage. I felt like if I took a shot every time someone said wearable, right, I'd be wasted.  But there's not very much research about whether or not that's safe to have on your person. And I  personally, I use the Wythens baby monitor that was announced last year at CES on my daughter.  And I just started to freak because it was a little too close to her. And I thought, I don't  know what the repercussions are. No one does yet about Wi-Fi being this close to our body.  And I stopped wearing the Fitbit for that same reason, because it's constantly searching for  my phone in order to send that data, which means it's going through my body. We just don't know  enough. I know I always sound like the hippie on the show, but we know.

Start time: 654.40
End time: 661.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We know enough. Wait a minute. Yes. Yes. I don't know.  We know enough. This is very low power. This is not going to hurt.

Start time: 661.86
End time: 664.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. But when it's searching, it usually has to spike.

Start time: 665.42
End time: 706.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exactly my point. It's searching for your device in order to send the data to the cloud.  It's searching for your router or it's searching for the device. So how many things can you have  on your person? And I carry my phone in my pocket all the time. And so that's sending signals about  where I am and what the weather is and all of that stuff. And then you've got the Fitbit on your  arm. I had the writings next to my daughter's head while she was sleeping and I just freaked. So  I put the I ended up using the drop cam and put it way across the room so that I can see the whole  room. So this thing about putting something directly on their hip that's sending a signal.  And there are already mattresses that do this. There are mattress pads that test their breathing  and test their movement and all of that. I think that would make you a super parent.

Start time: 706.76
End time: 725.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's no it's conceivable that there's an issue. There's no  I've looked at all of this research about EMT or not EMT, EMF and Wi-Fi.  Well, we're being bombarded by it. There is zero after many, many studies.

Start time: 725.28
End time: 743.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There is not. That's not true. There was a study that was done that  they showed some correlation with brain cancer and over. Wait, let me finish.  And the conclusion was that it wasn't the Wi-Fi at all, but it was it was a proximity creating a  buildup of heat. And you can't like, you know, which causes an irritation.

Start time: 743.84
End time: 751.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Microwave your brain. That's a bad idea. Yeah.  I don't think we're at the level of power. Well, there is getting heated up.

Start time: 751.70
End time: 758.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's apparently if you're on the phone all day is getting heated up a little bit. It's not cooking,  just getting heated up. But you can. I don't care.

Start time: 759.06
End time: 786.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the reasons I use speakerphone to not use not use not put the phone directly to our head.  That's even I mean, the chat room is going crazy and saying, yeah, they are.  They're they're they think you're crazy. Right. But this is because it's a pain point  because I'm suggesting that maybe we need to actually distance our.  But there have been many, many, many, many studies on this. So this is not.  But they're not conclusive. I've read the same studies.  That means there's no evidence. And that means there's no evidence.

Start time: 786.46
End time: 788.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're not conclusive because there's no evidence.

Start time: 788.34
End time: 791.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't have enough time, though. Even a decade is too is too short of a

Start time: 791.84
End time: 796.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  amount of a trial period. The show is brought to you by Motorola.

Start time: 797.22
End time: 830.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's not. It's just OK. Anyway, so Marcus. Yeah.  By the way, you just came back from the most Wi-Fi electromagnetic frequency saturated zone  in the world. If 20 years from now you get cancer, you know who to thank.  CES. CES.  What else was so no, no, like, no.  I mean, if the MIMO is the closest thing to innovation, I think that's safe to say.  Did you were there any wearables that impressed you at all?  That was the the term of the CES this year was wearables and the quantified self.

Start time: 831.52
End time: 848.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nothing, nothing too shocking. I saw there's the the new Pebble.  Most of it. There's been mostly positive impressions about the Pebble in general.  So the Pebble Steel and their new API and their new app store for Pebble.  So that's at least getting started in a way that may make wearables more interesting.

Start time: 848.36
End time: 850.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What do you think about the Pebble? Do you wear a Pebble?

Start time: 850.86
End time: 866.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't wear a smartwatch. I don't wear anything on my wrists.  I used to wear while I was using the Galaxy gear for a little bit.  And then it's dopey, right?  Yeah, it's just it got in the way. It's clunky the way that the electronics are laid out.  And it's kind of good looking at first, but it just wasn't for me.

Start time: 866.44
End time: 886.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's the idea of the steel. That's the idea of the steel is that  it's better looking anyway. It's still completely silly.  I don't people love the Pebble. I think there's a soft spot.  And I was a Pebble contributor on Kickstarter. I have my Pebble.  I think it's a little bit of a soft spot for people because of that.  It was one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns of all time.

Start time: 887.56
End time: 911.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And very focused about what it does.  Like some smartwatches I've seen tend to try to do either too much  or they try to be everything in your life. I guess the Galaxy gear has a camera on it.  I don't know why you need a camera on a watch, you know, but the Pebble  does a certain set of things that seem like good ideas really well.  And I guess they're trying to continue to focus on a certain smaller set of things  rather than spreading it too thin.

Start time: 913.44
End time: 924.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To me, I guess I'm with you, Natalie.  I don't see any of these wearables being particularly compelling,  whether it's Google Glass, the Pebble Watch, the Internet connected onesie.

Start time: 928.29
End time: 932.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I like the fitness slash smartphone type thing.  I think that's fine.

Start time: 932.56
End time: 934.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You wore a Fitbit, you said, right?

Start time: 934.32
End time: 942.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I did. I have before.  Like I said, I stopped.  I won't go into it again because the chat room wants to murder me.

Start time: 942.42
End time: 959.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the Fitbit works.  The Fitbit works because it inspires you to get your numbers up.  Just as the Jawbone Up did that.  I use the FuelBand because it did that nice little animation.  Your goal.  That's all it's for, right?  Just to kind of, oh, I got to get my numbers up.

Start time: 960.20
End time: 969.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess the quantified life.  It makes you go to sleep because you want to get your sleep numbers.  It makes you work.  It makes me walk more because I can't stand it when Veronica Belmont beats me.

Start time: 970.96
End time: 972.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  She beat you on what?  What game?

Start time: 972.50
End time: 981.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're friends on Fitbit, so we're always competing.  The health game.  So if she's walked more than me, I don't like it.  But that's good because it gets you working.  She kind of accepts.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 982.96
End time: 984.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although I'd be curious how many steps we took at CES.

Start time: 985.52
End time: 986.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You didn't count?

Start time: 987.02
End time: 990.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't have anything on.  So I didn't have a pedometer.  I should have probably installed one on my phone.

Start time: 991.08
End time: 993.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but there are apps that do that now.  You can put it in your phone.

Start time: 994.20
End time: 1021.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Galaxy Note 3 has, and in fact the GS4 has it too, has a little pedometer.  Scott Wilkinson, our home theater guy, was there.  He wears a pedometer each year to CES.  Logged 24 miles in four or five days.  Nice.  That's pretty typical, he says.  Yeah, I think it is.  A few miles a day.  Most of it's just uncomfortable because you're, you know.  In fact, you know you're in like the upscale booth when you get the really thick carpet.  Like Intel.

Start time: 1021.88
End time: 1029.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You ever bump it around the show and then you hit that carpet, it slows you down.  But it also slows you down like you're walking in sand.  It's like, oh, I can't walk that.

Start time: 1029.36
End time: 1031.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It slows you down because your feet are happy.

Start time: 1031.98
End time: 1040.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny, Fitbit had the one that you put in your bra for a while.  Didn't they actually have it like, the instructions were that a woman should wear in the bra instead of  Let's talk a little more about this.

No, but in this case it was on the pants and I threw it in the...  It just happens to me every time.  I've literally gone through four Fitbits.  Those are the clip-on ones.  The wristband is not so bad.

When I do, it's usually with a certain purpose.  Like I intend to record something.  And so the whole wearable tech thing...  Obviously there's a lot of talk about it,  but I'm just not really into it yet.  Trying to find some...  If I saw something from Jaybird at CES,  that was a little unique because it was actually...  It was a fitness band, not a clock,  but it was more flexible so you could actually...  It was more comfortable than I guess some of the rigid ones,  that clamp or clip.  So I feel like it would be a little less cumbersome.

Netflix did the best job of getting their message out.  They put their stuff everywhere.  And now they announced they're going to stream 4K.

You have to buy a base unit with a home base station and starter kit  and you connect them via Wi-Fi and you can talk to them.  They're RGB so you can do any color from the Hue.  There is a new app which John just showed me called Exoplanet for iPhone and iPad.  And what the app does, you'll like this,  it notifies you every time we've discovered a new exoplanet.  Great.  I need to get notified when that happens.  An Earth-like planet in another solar system is an exoplanet.  That's a practical use.  No, but this is the part I love.  And here's the big but.  It ties into the Hue and you can automatically see what light  on that planet would look like in your living room.

As long as we're talking about CES, they're really, you know, CES, frankly, if you ask me,  the biggest story at CES in the last eight years has always been televisions, right?  But not always successfully.  3D was the story.  3D's still around?  In 2008, remember the big story was mobile TV, the little Flow TV and things like that?  Of course, Marcus was eight years old.  He doesn't remember this.  But this was the thing that everybody would have a TV in their pocket.  Nobody bought it.  You had a TV in your pocket?  Then it was 3D TV.  Again, and that's a success.  In fact, it's interesting.  Vizio announced at CES this year they're not going to make any more 3D TVs.  Why?

Start time: 1646.16

It's been under 600 for a while.  It's pretty.  There you go.  Do you watch anything on that?  That one, no, because right after I got that, Black Friday happened.  And a TCL 50 inch went down to 799 and I bought that.  So that's just a prop behind you.  Until I find out.  I'm going to review it, which means putting it right here and connecting the Mac Pro to it tonight.  But yeah, right now it's so yeah, there's a ton of 4K TVs at CES.  I made a video about actually the 4K cameras of CES because there were a lot less of those  and they were a little more interesting to me.  But yeah, everyone had a 4K TV.

Start time: 1741.28
End time: 1790.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's very watchable.  It's just not the highest bit rate and it tends to fall apart with any sort of movement.  But I talked about the fact that that is a 4K sensor and you can record 4K video.  So Sony came out with their new Handycam, which is a $2,000 coming soon 4K Handycam  that you're basically holding your hand and can shoot 4K video with and really high quality.  They're pretty good at that.  They had a couple of other 4K cameras.  There were some 4K at the Canon booth.  Nothing really new or cheap, but they had the 1DC, which is $12,000 and the C500, which is $25,000.  So the whole point of the video was that CES is showing things that are expensive now  that will eventually with volume, hopefully become much cheaper and more available this year.  So with all the 4K TVs, you might as well have a camera that shoots 4K so you can enjoy that  to the fullest.

The only thing, as far as I could tell, the only thing about it,  you can't hang it on the wall because it'll roll back and forth.  You don't want to be sitting on the side because it's curved.  So it's dumb.  They did it because they could.  Did you see any advantage markers?  Did it feel more immersive?

Start time: 1924.46
End time: 1948.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not really.  In the 105-inch one, yes.  Maybe.  Because it's 105 inches.  So it would have felt more immersive anyway.  But I feel like it's another one of those things they did for the press,  and oops, so did everyone else.  They had one that you could actually press a button  and would mechanically go from flat to curved,  and then press it again and it would go back flat.  Yeah, there's a mechanical one.  It's a remote control.

Start time: 1949.20
End time: 1953.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You press the remote and it goes, zzzzzzz.  That's as bad as this.  You want to curve the TV, now you'll watch.

Start time: 1955.00
End time: 1964.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can get rid of the disadvantages of 4K or of a curved TV.  Maybe you want to watch with your friends.  You want to watch the game.  You don't want to curve anymore.  Flatten it out.

Start time: 1967.02
End time: 1983.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't there a distance at which there is some sort of advantage?  Right?  That's what I was reading.  Two feet.  If you get really far away from the television,  then a big crowd, it sort of does serve.  But in a smaller space, it wouldn't serve a small crowd.

Start time: 1985.24
End time: 2025.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess what they were trying to tout was that  if you're sitting in line with the center of the TV,  sitting a good distance away from it,  the wrapping of the sides would help to feel more immersive.  I don't even know what they mean by that word,  but it looked okay from the center.  But once you get off axis from whatever distance you are,  parts of the image that are curved will appear a bit distorted,  which could be good or bad.  You're watching football.  It's going to look like the guy just got twice as big  when he runs the side of the TV.  That's so silly.  If you're watching a movie, maybe you won't notice.  I don't know.  It depends on the content,  but I don't like distortion in the first place,  so I wasn't a big fan.

Transcript:  Netflix got the most mileage out of the UHD 4K story by saying...  They didn't have a booth.  They didn't need a booth.  No, they did very well for themselves.  They pointed out that House of Cards was shot in 4K,  even though it wasn't streamed in 4K for the first season,  but will be starting Valentine's Day, streamed in 4K.  The problem is the word streamed in 4K.  How much bandwidth do you need for a 4K?  I don't know what the absolute...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I haven't...  I like to...  Every so often, I meet with a guy...  I've met with him once, the Roku CEO.  And he gives me...  That's the first thing I always ask is,  what does it take to get the best stream?  What's the bitrate and all the rest of it?  And now I have to go have lunch with him again  to find out the absolute...  The perfect numbers for streaming 4K.  He used to be in Netflix.  Roku was a Netflix product.  Yeah, I know.  He actually...  It was an interesting story how he started.

Start time: 2082.80
End time: 2112.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So let me tell you what Netflix says about HD.  And we can assume that UHD will use roughly twice as much.  It's 2.8 gigabytes per hour if you're watching HD.  So you're going to say five or more gigabytes per hour of...  Now, first of all, if you've got 250 gigabyte caps,  you probably shouldn't be doing more than a few movies a month.  One.  Second, because you're talking 10 gigabytes of movie.  Second, I don't know anybody who has bandwidth like that.

Start time: 2113.12
End time: 2117.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That would be five because 3D would be this...  3D is 4.7 gigs.  And 3D is twice as...  Is 4K.

Start time: 2118.21
End time: 2127.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

In fact, very few people can really do a sustained 15 megabits.  Google Fiber maybe.  So it's not a practical solution.  I don't know why Netflix is getting so much coverage.  So few people can see it.  Sony also said, we'll be streaming for...

He said, go to LegalZoom, get an LLC.  99 bucks.  I said, okay.  Thank you.  You can also get a corporation, Chapter S or Chapter C Corporation.

But now interest rates seem to be changing so fast in the year 2014.  So anyone who might want to get any kind of loan should incorporate  because it's easier to prove when you've got an LLC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, this is it.  This is my Curve.  He keeps all his phones.  And then this is the first iPhone.  At first you go, well, wait a minute.  Where's the keyboard?  And there wasn't an app store.  Remember Steve said, oh, you don't need an app store.  Everything is all going to be web apps.  And then just to really highlight,  I think somebody in the chat room said,  oh, that wasn't an innovation.  Big deal.  And then I said, well, yes.  A year later, Google comes out with its first Android phone.  This is it.  The G1 from Google.  And it's like, it was horrible.  And it really underscored what a lead Apple had.  Seven years ago this week, I just thought it'd be worth it.

Start time: 3082.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I remember talking to Steve while he was in between jobs.  He was at Pixar.  And he said, companies catch up.  He said, we let Microsoft catch up.  We had a huge lead when we came out with the Macintosh in 1984.  10 years later, Microsoft had caught up.  He said, by Windows 3.1, which you could argue,  but certainly by Windows 9.5.

End time: 3172.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not because I'd expected.  I've watched pretty much every video on the internet of it already  while waiting for it.  I knew exactly how heavy it was going to feel  because everyone who takes out the box says,  wow, it's kind of heavy.  So I knew it was going to be heavy.  But I've started my videos about it  and my impressions about it.  So we'll see how that goes.

Start time: 3174.22
End time: 3221.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I did not know enough.  I think it was December 19th they put it on sale.  And if you happen to be up at midnight,  you could order it and get it in a timely time frame.  You must have done that, Marcus.  But if you waited till the next morning,  so I got up in the morning and I said, oh,  and I ordered it February.  So I said, well, I'm not going to order it.  Maybe it'll come out.  They said it'll be available December 31st.  Maybe I'll be able to walk into a store.  No, I don't think you still can walk into a store and get it.  Fortunately, one of our viewers, Ed Ingeberg,  I hope I'm saying your name right.  Thank you, Ed.  He actually had ordered one, got buyers or more said,  I don't really want it.  I'm going to get an iMac.  Would you like it?  I said, not yet.  He just gave it to you.  No, I paid him.  But it's exactly what I would have bought.  Basically, the base unit.  Marcus, did you load it up?

Start time: 3223.10
End time: 3231.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you look at the other 4K monitors?  Lenovo announced an $800 4K monitor.

Start time: 3255.00
End time: 3340.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I've looked at a lot of 4K monitors  because right now I'm using a 2560 by 1600 display,  which I like a lot.  But every time I come back from using the Retina MacBook Pro  to this, it just looks like I can see pixels.  And it's disappointing.  I was scouting basically all the 4K display choices  for when the Mac Pro would eventually come  because this is actually a DVI display  and it doesn't have HDMI.  It doesn't have display port.  And the Mac Pro doesn't have a DVI port.  So I was like, I'm not going to use this display  with Apple's terrible adapter.  I've tried that before.  So I ended up choosing the ASUS PQ321Q,  which is a 31 and a half inch 4K display.  Or 4096 by 2160, which will take display port actually.  So it'll go display port into main display port  or Thunderbolt on the Mac Pro,  which I think is the same panel as the Sharp,  which is also a 31 and a half inch 4K display.  I saw Dell was planning on releasing a 28 inch 4K display  for under a thousand.  I think it's somewhere around $800.  But it would only support up to like a 30 hertz refresh rate.  And that's a big thing is the refresh rate  that a lot of these support the site, this Seiki.  Yeah, they're 30, right?  30 hertz.  Yeah.  Terrible.  I had to narrow it down to one that would go at least 60 hertz.

Start time: 3341.62
End time: 3342.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So does the 321Q do 60 hertz?

Start time: 3345.32
End time: 3368.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does 60 hertz through a weird technology called MST  or Multi-Stream Transport where there's two controllers  in the monitor that'll take inputs  through the display port cable  and essentially it's two 1920 by whatever half the display is.  There's half a controller for each half of the panel.  Oh, that makes sense.  Through that it'll do 60 hertz at 4K.

Start time: 3370.78

Start time: 3375.38
End time: 3380.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's dropping a little more in price than the Sharp,  but I think I got it right under $3,000.  Yeah, the Sharp is $3,500.

Start time: 3381.08

Thanks, John.  I'm just saying, just pointing it out.  I really appreciate it.  Not much you can do.

Start time: 3406.56
End time: 3425.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This looks pretty nice.  Now, it's interesting because you got a 31.5 inch monitor  at 3840 by 2160.  That means pixel per inch is only 140 pixels per inch.  So we're so used to 300, even 400 dots per inch on our handsets.  Of course, you're at arm's length, I guess.  But do you think you're gonna be satisfied with that?

Start time: 3426.97
End time: 3449.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think so.  I'm currently using a 30 inch and a 20 inch.  So I think a 31.5 inch will not be too much of an adjustment.  The only thing is switching from two displays,  which I constantly keep divided and organized,  to one display in Mac OS X might be a little weird.  So I'm considering a second display,  but it could get funky or janky having a low display.  Quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  John, stop rubbing it in.  I already tried to hire the guy.  I can't.  He's too good.  So what you really need, Marcus, is two 321 cues side by side.  Yeah, that'd be perfect.

You can catch all of Father Robert Ballester,  Dickey Bartolo and Scott Wilkinson's CES coverage right there.  There was automotive news at CES, too,  but the big automotive story was Alan Mullally saying,  no, I'm not going to be CEO at Microsoft.  That was the drumbeat.  Although the way he said it and the way Wall Street Journal reported it,  I got the strong feeling that he actually did want the job,  but eventually decided against it.  The Journal says he soured on the Microsoft job in part  because of what he perceived to be leaks from Microsoft about the search process.  Journal also has been saying that nobody wants the job  because of the dynamics of the Microsoft board,  including the fact that Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates are still on the board,  so you'd have the two previous CEOs breathing down your neck and nobody wants that.  Is that, John, you can follow Microsoft.  Is that credible?  Do you think that Gates and Ballmer would be an inhibition on the next CEO?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're the one who said that he would be the guy.  Well, now that Mullally's out of the picture, you're looking at three insiders, at least.  Tony Bates, who came there with the Skype acquisition.  He's biz dev guy right now.  Bad.  Satya Nadella, who's an engineer, who's been around for a while.  And perhaps, and this would be kind of a dark horse, Steven Elop,  who was a former Microsofter, went to Nokia.  Maybe he could wreck the company.  Wrecked Nokia, then came back to Microsoft.

Transcript:  Okay, John, how much time have you spent in headhunting?  We don't know who's in the woodworks.  We have this illusion that it has to be a big name, which we've heard of.  I think it kind of does.  He groomed Tim Cook and molded him in his likeness.  No one's done that at Microsoft.  They have never molded him.  No, they have not done that and it's really bad for their goodwill.  But at the same time, we don't know what talent lies beneath.  We're not recruiters.  Chris Christie?  Queen Latifah.

Transcript:  Can I ask an intelligent question briefly here?  I don't want to interrupt the flow.  Right.  You don't want to.  I don't want to derail you.  How is this going to happen?  How important in a very public company like Microsoft is picking a CEO that is known,  that is somebody people.  And I think of Yahoo, which really with a master stroke said Marissa Meyer.  And that was about one of the few things they could do that could perhaps change their fortunes  because she was such a public face.  Isn't it the case that Microsoft needs to pick a name?  It can't be some gray suited guy.

Start time: 3974.84
End time: 4014.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, okay.  And then here's the next step of that question is do they have to have star power?  Yes.  That's not always the same thing.  A good politician doesn't always have good speaking abilities, but these days we  expect that and we undercut people who don't have stage presence.  And so do we want someone who's going to run around clapping and screaming developers  or who's going to do one more thing?  I know we were a little hard on Marissa Meyer this week because was her speech cool enough?  How much presentation do we really need?  We need execution in that role.  But I think when you look at Steve Jobs, when you look at that speech by Steve Jobs,

Start time: 4014.12
End time: 4037.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  there was a CEO who did it all.  He could help shape a product that really did transform a space.  And then he could market it in a way that no one else could.  Now, admittedly, there's no other...  He was a salesman.  He was a brilliant salesman.  And Ballmer's supposedly a salesman.  He really didn't sell very well.  Well, I don't know about that.  That's the...  I guess my question is do they need a front man or do they need a drummer?

Start time: 4037.56
End time: 4053.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He went to business school.  Right.  And don't you think...  I mean, the role of CEO...  And frankly, he's dry and dull.  Just my business books 101 say the role of CEO is more of the finance guy, the executor,  make sure all ships run on time, not the sales guy.  So is that role then changing?

Start time: 4053.70
End time: 4066.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess that's the question.  That's exactly the question.  Much better put, but that's exactly the question I'm asking.  Is that do you need star power or do you need a great administrator?  You can get a...  Your COO can be a great administrator.  Your president...

Start time: 4067.86
End time: 4088.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is a public company that's preoccupied with...  At least the shareholders are preoccupied with the price of this stock.  It has not done well over the last 10 years.  They're not going to put up with some dullard as you guys would have it,  that would come in and just be a good guy who knows how to dot the I's.  They have to have somebody that has some cred.  And that's only John Thompson.  There aren't a lot of people out there.

Start time: 4089.70
End time: 4097.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  You're screwed.  Well, it depends.  And if you've taken a little improv once in your life, you can just carry on.  I mean, you're like the perfect example.  I'll tell people.  I hate prompters.  He is like...  He gets deprived, watched him work with a prompter,  and he'll go off prompter most of the time.  And the prompter operator has to be very special.  Of course they do, but they manage to worm their way around.  They get you back on track and you come back into it.  But Bay apparently needed this thing to be right on the money.  If this is not a scam.

I don't know how much he was getting paid,  but he is going around now on tour  with this 105-inch TV  and clips of the Transformer series.  So I had heard a rumor, $1.5 million.  Does that sound...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would have done it for the TV, guys.  And if the prompter broke,  I could have kept going.  It's true.  You could have.  I couldn't.  I wouldn't have said anything important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Leo, why don't you flesh this out for us though?  Because the implications of having a content delivery system  means that they could charge you not the market price for it now  if they wanted to charge you for data.  So if someone's using the Twit app,  they're going to come back around and charge Twit.  And there's no guarantee that they charge you market price.  So this has to be something that makes you very nervous.

Start time: 4773.54
End time: 4815.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'll give you an example.  I mean, since you brought up Twit,  here would be an example that would be a problem for me.  What if Yahoo, which has deep pockets, says to AT&T,  we'll cover the costs of your customer,  any of your customers that watch any of our content.  In fact, something they're very likely to do, right?  I can't do that, right?  So when you watch Twit, you're using a bandwidth,  but when you're watching Yahoo, you're not.  Is that a fair use of the internet?  Is that how the internet was designed?  Is that, or is it just business?  I mean, you could make the case, look, AT&T is a business.  It would certainly be bad for me.  It's a marketplace.  AT&T could, you know.

Transcript:  That's the negative.  And I always felt like the internet should,  one of the important, you could even say  foundational principles of the internet is it's democratic.  That it gives everybody, look at Marcus.  Marcus is a great example.  Here's a guy, 20 year old guy, who says,  you know what, I'm gonna make videos about technology.  I'm gonna do reviews.  And because he does such great reviews,  he's built an audience based on free bandwidth from YouTube.  And he's got a business.  And that's what the internet's all about.  And what AT&T is saying, well, maybe if you have deep pockets,  you should be giving us a little bit more.  And the rest of you, you know, that's not,  puts us at a disadvantage.  Now, Marcus, you don't have to worry  because you got YouTube on your side.  You are on YouTube.  And of course, if somebody can pay, it'll be YouTube.  This is supposition.

Start time: 4875.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

It's a new year.  You want to start it off right, working smarter,  getting more done, easier.  GoToMeeting is the way to do it.  You can meet and collaborate with clients  and colleagues anywhere they are.  Even if you're miles apart,  it's as good as meeting in person  because you're going to see them  in crystal clear HD video.  You're going to see their screen  or they're going to see your screen.  If you've got a PowerPoint presentation,  boom, they can see it and they can see you.  You'll cut back on time and money  wasted on business travel.  Don't get stuck in the snow  like everybody did this year at CES.  Get it done from wherever you are.  You'll be more productive.  Your communications will be better.  And GoToMeeting works not only on your Mac or your PC,  but many mobile devices.  You can actually present from an iPad.  It'll use the iPad's microphone, audio, and even camera.  So you could be anywhere and meeting.  Start the new year right  with a free 30-day trial of GoToMeeting.  And when I say free, I mean free.  You don't even need a credit card to get started.  Just go to gotomeeting.com,  click the Try It Free button, and use our name, Tweet.  That's gotomeeting.com, promo code T-W-  I see you got to click that link to open the little window.  T-W-I-T.  Just do that so we get credit.  That's all.  You got to try it.  GoToMeeting.com.  Meeting is believing.  And everybody should also, as long as I'm plugging,  follow The Real Dvorak.  Yes, at The Real Dvorak.  Apple wins.  Motorola sued, saying, hey, Apple, Google has patented  something, I don't know what.  And six patents.  They won initially, but on appeal.  The patents were on, they've lost.  The control delivery of data to an application  on a wireless device.  Federal Circuit Court said the commission,  actually, they lost, I guess.  The ITC was correct to rule that Apple  did not use the same technique.  Apple did not infringe.  I don't normally report on patent cases,  but I guess it's kind of important to keep score.  I guess.  One for Apple.  Yeah, that's about right.  One for Samsung.  One for Motorola.  So right now, it's Apple two to nothing.  Late in the fourth quarter.  Did you see the new Apple ad?  Apparently, your iPad makes you into a poet.  See, this looks like your rig, Marcus.  Here we are out in the middle of nowhere.  And I've got, don't, please folks, do not do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Areo said it was our hope that the case would be decided on the merits  and not through a wasteful war of attrition.  War of attrition is almost over.  There's nowhere to go after the Supreme Court.  We have every confidence the court will validate and preserve  a consumer's right to access local over-the-air television  with an individual antenna, make a personal recording with a DVR,  and watch that recording on a device of their choice.  That's Areo's position.

Start time: 5558.02

Start time: 5564.32
End time: 5598.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They do the recording for you.  They say, no, the users have control over the system,  so the DVR feature is theirs, not ours.  I have to say, if the Supreme Court decides against Areo,  it is a miscarriage of justice.  On the other hand, if they do decide in favor of Areo,  ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox are all going to pull off their live over-the-air free broadcast.  That's idiotic.  They're going to say, well, fine.

Start time: 5598.94
End time: 5616.50

It's interesting because CBS and Fox and NBC all three, I think, streamed the playoffs with  various restrictions, and they apparently plan to stream the Super Bowl.  I don't know if...  I think some of them, I think at CBS, you had to demonstrate that you had a cable.

Start time: 5638.14
End time: 5671.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. That's very common with a lot of this.  But they can't pull OTA off because of this idea.  By the way, somebody in the chat room asked, well, what difference does it make to get OTA?  When you use one of their antennas, you can go to RadioShack and get an antenna.  That's not the scheme.  The scheme is, yes, first we get New York, and then we roll it out nationwide.  So I, in Berkeley, I can get this system, and I can watch New York television  instead of having local cable or whatever.  That's what the long-term plan obviously is.

We are gaming, and someone asked, hey, when this is over,  can we watch the game?  And I was like, well, I guess I'll check.  While the game was playing, I walked over into this room, opened up Aereo,  found the game on a channel, Chromecasted it over the TV,  and was watching a 50-inch TV over Chromecast without any cable bill.

Transcript:  It is also another anniversary, a sad one.  We're going to talk about the anniversary of the death of Aaron Schwartz coming soon  and how the internet is going to respond.  Because there, get ready, because there's another big internet disruption coming up.  Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.  A great resource for anybody who needs royalty-free images, pictures, vectors, video clips, illustrations.  30 million, actually the total is 32,538,948 royalty-free stock images.  They added over 200,000 this week alone.  Most of the images by professionals, photographers and artists,  they're of course each reviewed individually for content and quality.  You're going to have a huge selection.  They also have footage, 1.5 million royalty-free stock video.  Great stuff too.  Some of the stuff we've been using has, this is a snowfall loop with an alpha channel.  So you could use this to make, to add snow, Marcus, to your CES coverage.  No, bad idea.  But you could.  You could put Marcus in a snow globe and let the snow just fall down on top of him.  Shutterstock is, I love Shutterstock.  Now, one of the best things about Shutterstock is their search engine.  And I encourage you to sign up for a free account.  You don't have to give them any information or credit cards.  Just sign up for the free account.  Because then you can save the results of your searches in your own personal lightbox.  Searches are by noun, but also by adjective.  So I could search for football and get a lot of football stuff.  But I could also search for angry football.  And then I would get angry footballs.  I would like to see this.  Would you like to see an angry football?  All right, we can do this.  If you haven't seen their iPad app, it's Webby Award.  Look, there's nothing more angry than that guy.  I'd be angry if I were painted the Italian flag colors, too.

There's actual angry footballs.  You can narrow down by using their color picker  to give you exactly the shades you're looking for.  I only want red angry footballs.  And then you can do that.  Now, if you, if, oh, there aren't any red angry footballs.  Or at least not with the color FF245D.  I probably, I was probably too specific  in the angry football color genre.  If you would like to try this for free,  you can, easy to set up an account.  But when you decide you want to buy images  and they sell them as packages, but also subscriptions,  we have the 25 image a day subscription.  Great for publications.  Use our offer code TWIT114 and you'll get 25% off your subscription.  That is a very good deal.  TWIT114 for 25% off.  Shutterstock.com.

Eric, pardon me, Aaron Schwartz passed away,  committed suicide about a year ago.  A year ago Saturday, he was facing federal hacking charges,  really serious charges for something that was absolutely not hacking.  And Congress is now saying,  we want to know more about this aggressive prosecution.  John Cornyn of Texas, Ron Wyden of Oregon,  Jeff Flake of Arizona.  I like that.  My senator, Senator Flake.  US representatives, Daryl Issa from California,  Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin,  Alan Grayson of Florida,  Zoe Lofgren of California,  and Jared Polis sent Eric Holder,  the attorney general, a letter asking for more information  about that prosecution.  What the hell happened?  Good.  Good.  They should.  Yesterday was the anniversary.  And the internet is going to respond next month, right?  With another one of these internet blackout kind of things.  I'm trying to find this news story.  There's also a documentary showing at Sundance,  the internet's own boy.  Anonymous commemorated it by hacking MIT.  Remember, it was also MIT that aggressively pursued Aaron.

This is February 11th,  the day we fight back against mass surveillance,  using Aaron as inspiration to protest what the NSA has been doing,  of course, to spy on us.  This is kind of a sequel.  EFF is working with them on this.  Boing, boing, Reddit.  A sequel to the SOPA and PIPA fight of 2012,  more than the last year.  So add a banner, tell the world you're taking part.  You get to a point where you get a little fatigue on these things.  And they have a little bit of less impact.  And yet, I think it is probably a good idea for the citizens of the internet  to stand up and say, once in a while, this isn't good.  This isn't good.  And Aaron's honor.  So we'll talk more about that as we approach February 11th.

Transcript:  So I was listening to this funny story on the 404 and the podcast  and they were talking about the knockoffs that are beats,  the beats knockoffs.  The way that you can tell is if you can see the neck on the box.  Did you know that?  No.  Because the knockoffs in China, they have just the face.  But if you see the silhouette with the neck,  then you know that's a knockoff.  And then there are certain knockoffs that they don't use the name,  but they use the same branding and logo and design.  Especially in China, this one brand that's popular is called Sound by Steve.

Transcript:  Yeah, I've seen a bunch of different ways to tell whether your beats are true or not  because I sold my beats pros on eBay and I got a message from a potential buyer like,  can you take more pictures of the box so I can see this, that, and the other?  Interesting.  Oh, he's really, he wants to make sure that they're authentic.  And every time you do an eBay search for Beats by Dre,  there's always a huge authentic title so that you know these are real.

Start time: 8273.34
End time: 8316.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's probably true.  I will be interested to see what they would do with streaming music.  It seems like it's a little late for this.  Spotify, Amazon, and Google are all in the streaming music marketplace.  The $10 all you can eat music thing, Microsoft.  I don't know if there's room for another one.  They will have 20 million titles.  And they do say, and this is a problem with some of them,  we won't have any spam titles, cover.  A lot of times you choose an artist and you get the cover song.  It's really annoying on a lot of these.  No karaoke versions.  If they do that well, maybe that by itself would be sufficient.  So look for that January 21st.  Here come the beats.
