Micah Sargent and Udakta.  I'm going to introduce each of you.  I decided to do something a little bit different.  I'm going to read what you wrote about yourselves on Twitter.  So I'm going to start with Brian McCullough.  He's at Brian MCC and he says he's tech meme ride home podcast guy.  Internet history podcast guy.  2016 Ted resident.  He has a book.  How the Internet happened from Netscape to the iPhone.  I've got it right here.  That's available for preorder.  Brian McCullough, you know, you got a lot of stuff in there.  Tell us about the book.  That's pretty exciting.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Well, we're going to get into some of that.  I heard on one podcast this week someone said that the EU has lost the Internet.  So you're the guy to talk about this.  Next up, Micah Sargent, your at Micah Sargent on Twitter.  And there's so many questions that your Twitter handle evokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I don't know if this is the podcast to talk about that.  It's a it's a rather controversial topic.  I have been on a breakfast podcast where I talked about shower dining before.  Essentially, it's the idea that some people like to bring beverages and food into the shower while they're taking a shower and consume said beverages and or food.  And I happen to be one that does it and is only somewhat ashamed of the fact that I do.  And for some reason, it's just sort of stuck.  And now people constantly either ask me or tease me about the fact that I do that.

Start time: 249.72
End time: 271.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, the food that's least impacted by the shower would actually be well, it depends on your word for impact, because like if we're talking like impact in a negative way,  then I would say everybody should try having an orange in the shower because it's not impacted.  It's actually improved by the shower.  But people probably don't want to have something like spaghetti in the shower or pizza in the shower because things can get kind of complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I personally am a proponent of beer or margaritas in the shower.  And I'm yes, those two things really improve a shower.  So I agree. Oh, and JJ Stone.  Oh, doctor.  He writes, oh, my Lord.  We're looking at the memoji of Oh, doctor.

Transcript:  All right.  Well, I don't even shower.  I don't even shower.  I'm too big for that.  So I do.  I do have a snack, some grapes in the bathtub.  When I put the candle lights on, I have a glass of wine.  But even in the shower, I feel I feel bad about my size.  If I took food to the shower, I'm like, man, I'm already big enough.  I don't need to eat in the shower, too.

Transcript:  This is going to be a good panel today.  And we have a lot to talk about because it was a huge week for tech news with it being an Apple week.  I'm going to be you know, we started with the sports talk here with football players who've been catfished.  And I'm going to do play by play and have you guys do the color commentary about the Apple event.  I think the big headline for everybody was the Apple Watch 4.  They removed the bezel and they say the screen is 30 percent bigger on the watch.  It's 499 with a cellular connection, 399 without it.  Speakers now 50 percent louder.  They've moved the microphone to the other side of the watch to minimize echo.  The watch back is now ceramic and Apple says that's going to improve cellular connectivity.  But the thing everybody is talking about had to do with health.  It has an electrocardiogram feature.  They've put electrodes on the digital crown and on the back of the watch.  So you put your finger on the crown and using those two inputs, the watch figures out the electrical activity in your heart.  This whole process takes 30 seconds.  But they've gotten this cleared by the FDA to provide that ECG data.  It gets stored in your health app when you do one of these and it can be exported as a PDF for your doctor.  It also has fall detection.  The accelerometer is improved and the gyroscope so it detects involuntary motions.  The arms and body I guess do very specific things when you fall forward or you slip backwards.  And it'll make a call for help if you don't move within a minute.  So I think Apple laid it out pretty clearly that the watch is about connectivity, fitness and health.  Anybody think that the new features are a must get and that this is really going to change the game for the wearables market?

Start time: 528.90
End time: 648.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, this was an interesting moment for me.  The morning before, so technically the morning of, the like, whoa, it was like two in the morning before the Apple event.  I went to the ER.  I was having some stuff going on with my heart that I hadn't experienced since last year.  So I sort of thought it was over, came back again, went to the ER and they got me all checked out and said,  oh, yes, the AFib is popping up again.  We need to look into this some more.  And then I sort of tried to make light of the situation by joking about how then Apple was rumored to be announcing a watch that was going to be able to detect AFib and also have ECG and things like that.  I think this watch is incredible for many reasons.  Those things obviously are the things that matter most to me.  When I went to the ER in December, I shortly afterward upgraded to the Series 3 because there were improved heart rate tracking features and things like that.  And it was easy to give my doctor that information, say, hey, here's what my heart's doing.  Let's see what's going on.  So I absolutely am going to be upgrading to the Series 4.  I do want to note, as I've talked about this this week and been very excited about it,  I've gotten lots of feedback from people who want to tell me all about 12 lead ECGs and Holter monitors and things like that.  It's important to understand that, no, a device on your wrist is never going to replace the medical instruments that you are using in the hospital or a Holter monitor that you might take home and use for a week that's monitoring your heart 24-7.  However, this device is better than nothing.  And to have this with me everywhere I go is pretty great.  So I'm quite excited about having these extra heart rate tracking features.  But I am certainly not assuming that this is going to serve as a replacement for anything that I can get in the hospital or with my doctor.

Start time: 648.88
End time: 669.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got to be a piece of mind, too.  I mean, if you're having something with your heart, I mean, it is called the silent killer.  So it's scary because you don't know when your heart's out of regular sinus rhythm.  And so having that data.  One quick question there. How does the Series 3 already do that?  Does it keep a log somewhere?

Start time: 670.38
End time: 727.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the Series 3, of course, it doesn't do the ECG thing.  And with watchOS 5 and I think that this next feature is coming later this year, it's going to be better at doing rhythm tracking.  So I think it's all like algorithms based.  They've just figured those out.  They'll pop those in and it'll be better about tracking.  Right now, what the Series 3 does is it just has an improved heart rate sensor over previous models.  And so I was using the Series 0 Apple Watch way long time ago and upgrading the Series 3 improved that.  And it also offers a high heart rate detection.  So it's, of course, keeping a log throughout the day.  And then it's like, whoa, your heart rates over blank.  And you've just been sitting.  So it doesn't make sense that your heart rate is like this.  You watch in a scary movie or is there something going wrong?  And for me, that was important because that's what led me to the ER the first time around was having this heart rate that was above 140.  And I was doing absolutely nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the all those stories that popped out this week of like concern trolling and like this, you know, Apple claims this is a medical device, but it's not really a medical device.  Like that's I feel like that that was everybody like writing for headlines.  But, you know, I found it more interesting.  Like if you if you read in beyond the headlines in those stories, like, you know, Apple was very clear that it and even the FDA in giving them the clearance for it made them make it clear that this is not a replacement for actual, you know, doctor's attention or medical care or anything like that.  But I found it interesting.  Like in a way, Apple's doing it right.  Or is it at least doing it methodically?  You know what I mean?  Like, so this is technically classified as a class two device for regulatory purposes and like a class one medical device is a tongue depressor and a class three is an actual pacemaker.  Right.  So I think that actually what the interesting story here is, is that Apple isn't going whole hog into we're making medical devices now.  They're creeping in incrementally and they're doing all the steps right.  And they're and actually I think that that'll help them, you know, gain credibility so that maybe however many years down the road when it can do more serious medical monitoring, then they'll have this track record behind them of being methodical and taking it slowly and doing it the right way.

Start time: 814.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The specific information they say it's it's not for people who have heart conditions, that it's for people who are generally considered healthy.  And as you mentioned, it's not FDA approved.  It's FDA cleared.  So it is it's a step into the health aspects and the fact that it passively tracks all this and you can access it after the fact, kind of a black box, if you will.  It's great when you're going to your doctor.  I was talking to a cardiologist at Stanford and he had worked with a lot of the folks who make wearables.  And overall, he said that the technology is really accurate.  So it's you know, the calorie counts are all over the map and not very accurate at all, but that the heart rate monitoring is pretty good.  And the fact that you can now do that in conjunction with this sinus rhythm and finding out about tachycardia or any of the AFib that they're talking about, it at least gives you data to go to your doctor with.

Start time: 876.49
End time: 1001.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'll be the opposite of everyone.  We love you for that.  So the series three tells you if you had a high rate, the four series will actually tell you now if you have a low rate.  That's really nice.  But the way Apple presented it, the way regular people consume it, it's FDA approved.  Oh, my gosh.  People are losing their minds because they don't read and they just hear the way Apple presents things on stage.  So unless you're a tech person and you're reading in the articles, people think that it's going to be a solution to some of their problems.  I have heart problems, too.  I go to my doctor every three months.  And yes, I can use my series three wives to give her like an average update.  But usually when I'm there checking that versus what they're checking is usually not accurate at all, which I find.  But again, that's neither here nor there.  There's also things like this could be something wrong with the watch.  So, you know, the dependability of it versus the credibility that Apple gets is what concerns me.  The way people just gush all over everything.  Apple again, cleared, not really approved.  I love to get my hands on one because I do take medication.  But again, it's not really for me.  It's for a healthy person that might need to do something because if you're sick, they don't want you relying on this thing at all.  You need to rely on your doctor.  So, yay, we can do an EKG.  Maybe we get a defib in series five.  Recessing tape myself.  You know, that'd be cool.  You know, you know what would sell me on this?  You know, I would get my money off the bat if it had a glucose reader.  If it knew my sugar level up, I would throw somebody to the ditch and spend a thousand dollars on that watch right now.  If they tell me glucose.  But again, that's what Apple does.  They hype everything up.  Make sure you get by yourself there in this series and this watch.  They are ahead of the competition.  Bottom line, after all that yelling, I just said they are ahead of everybody.  So at least at least they're a step ahead.  I'm just saying don't go dependent on this watch to wake you up in the middle of the night and say, hey, you having a heart attack, brother?  You dreaming hard.  What's going on?  Wake up.

Start time: 1001.84
End time: 1019.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The watch ain't gonna save you.  Well, the chat room said that the new watch is going to be like the WebMD of heart disease, that everybody's going to have some sort of moment and freak out and that cardiologists are going to see their appointment schedules just fill up.  Is there an unforeseen consequence that we're not anticipating?

Start time: 1020.14
End time: 1057.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So two things real quick.  One, I fall in and I can't get up.  We got a slip thing going on.  Everybody's made that joke.  I made it instantly as soon as I saw the if you fall, it'll shut up.  My kid will fall every 30 seconds.  I think I'll be calling the cops five times a week.  Secondly, last year at the Super Bowl, guys watch was alerting him and bells was going off because he was excited about the super.  But I scored a touchdown and his heart rate was like one fifty six or something.  And the watch is like you're dying right now.  Is everything OK?  You need to go call somebody.  So, you know, he was in a situation where he wasn't freaking out because he knew why his heart rate was through the roof.

Start time: 1057.84
End time: 1080.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But again, I think they're so smart, though, in really identifying heart disease and falling because I don't know if it's just serendipity.  But my dad's been talking about getting an Apple Watch for a long time.  And that's where it's good.  It really becomes a replacement for that little thing that you know that you advertise.  I can't get up. Yeah.

Start time: 1080.90
End time: 1109.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, lots of people commented on that, how they're clearly targeting an older demographic.  There was the hokey pokey song.  There was I can't remember who pointed it out.  It might have been I'm sorry.  But that it wasn't a video of all thin, you know, young people.  Because people of all sizes and all ages.  And so, yeah, a lot of people commented that that that maybe this is targeting an audience that wouldn't have considered a wearable before.

Start time: 1110.84
End time: 1157.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One thing that Jason Snell was talking about earlier in the week from Six Colors Mac enthusiasts from way back is that finally Apple has figured out what the watch is.  That when it first came out, it was it was going to do everything under the sun.  It was going to be photos.  It was going to be a payment technology.  It was going to be everything that you ever wanted.  And now they have really clearly identified what the mission of the watch is.  And it's some connectivity and then the health and the fitness aspects.  And I wondering, have any of you guys had the watch with the cellular connection?  And do you think that is worth the extra hundred bucks in the ten dollars a month?  I mean, does any of that make sense?  And is that the future, too?

Start time: 1158.36
End time: 1236.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My next one is going to be the series four that I've ordered will have cellular connectivity.  It's not something that makes a whole lot of sense to me.  I think for a whole lot of people, because when I sort of look at my family is kind of like the I guess litmus test, I don't know exactly what to go.  But whenever I'm sort of trying to figure out, sort of get out of my own head and be more empathetic about what everyday people use instead of those of us in tech, I can just look to my siblings and family members and see sort of how they use technology.  And I don't see any of them ever walking out the door without their phone like that comes with them.  That's this thing that comes with them.  And so the benefit of the Apple Watch, of course, is to have those opportunities available to you without having the phone nearby.  So when it comes to something like health and potential emergency situations, that is where the cellular could come in handy.  But I don't think that those things happen enough that it's like, yes, go ahead and spend all this extra money to get a cellular version.  But all of that said, as the person who is steeped in technology all day and wants to try new things, I am looking forward to from time to time leaving the house without my phone and just having my watch and seeing what that's like and how it works for me.

Start time: 1238.23
End time: 1265.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The one place that it's made sense for me is in the water.  So like, if I go for a big paddleboard or if I'm surfing, it's the one time when I've actually gotten a call from my boss while I was surfing and had that conversation on the watch.  And, you know, it always amazes me that it sounds as good as it does.  But I can't think of many other scenarios besides the water when you're actually not going to have your phone with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So can I can I jump in on that? Oh, please. Shameless plug Avenue podcast called Raising a Ninja.  And the episode is dropping tomorrow is situational awareness.  And so last year, my daughter had two instances where there was a threat to the school.  One was they thought a kid brought a gun to school.  And the other one was something with violence in the school where the school was shut down.  The cops came out. You can't get hold of your kid.  My daughter, the day after the first time it happened, I went and got because I had the first watch.  I went got myself a series three. I got her series three.  She understands now that if she's in a situation where there's active shooter, there's a fire or anything like that, she presses the SOS on her watch.  I'll know what's going on. I can talk to her.  I can find her in that school because she was in elementary school.  They don't carry their phones around them all the time because they're not allowed to.  And even high school, they might not always have their phone if they're in gym or whatever.  With the watch on, she has her watch with her everywhere she goes.  We live in a walking district where she has to walk home.  Same thing. She's walking home.  She's got that watch on instead of having her phone out.  And for me, it is very important.

Start time: 1336.32
End time: 1355.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the chat room, they just said that their school has banned Apple watches from the classroom just like they've banned phones.  So that's a really interesting use case.  And the whole thing about parents and kids and devices, that's an interesting way of thinking about the watch.

Start time: 1355.90
End time: 1414.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I went to her teacher specifically and I said, you are not to remove her watch.  This stays on her at all times. This is her device.  She's responsible. She knows not to play with it.  She knows not to use it.  But for me, again, that peace of mind, her having that on her wrist, and I'm not trying to act like I'm Rambo,  but I'm not going to be like those people in Florida sitting there with cops not going in there because they're scared.  And I'll know where my kid is. I'll know what room she's in.  I'll know what part of the building she's in.  I want to know those things. I can talk to her if she's hiding or doing anything.  So not for nothing.  First of all, I got a deal. I want to buy one, get one half of my bill.  I only pay $10 for one line and $5 for the next. It's worth it.  People out there asking me about bulletproof backpacks for $500.  I'd rather spend $500 on this watch and $10 a month and have that kind of security than thinking your kid's going to walk around with it.  I'm going to walk around with a 40 pound backpack on top of the books and they're going to carry the bag around with them everywhere they go because they're not going to.  So that watch and that cellular service for me, well worth the investment for my child.

Transcript:  I did have one moment where I thought that that might work for my kid.  My daughter's and son are a little bit younger than your daughter, I think.  And so she was going on a bike ride and she and her friends were going to go down through the neighborhood and go to the trailhead and ride on the trail.  And she said, this is perfect. I'll give her my watch and she can call home if they need anything.  So everything's great. She gets home about, I don't know, 45 minutes later.  I said, that was so great knowing you had the watch.  And her face just goes, she had sat down when she was on the mountain bike trail, taking the watch off to show her friends and left it on the ground.

Again, if you follow me, you could get all my tips and tricks.  My daughter's had a cell phone since she was four years old.  She's never broken or cracked a screen or lost a phone.  Her watch is in perfect health.  Like I have a routine structure for her and for any kid to keep them on track for not breaking and losing their devices.  But you should have a boot camp for adults.

Transcript:  No, I think that that pretty much covers it.  I do want to one more time though reiterate and I think Odaka covered it quite well.  This is not a replacement for going to your doctor and having them strap all of those different pads all over your body and freak you out and then say,  we're checking you for a heart attack. And then you're like, I'm having a heart attack.  No, we're checking you for one.  And it's not a replacement for the very expensive Holter monitor that you have to wear for a week that you take home and you look like a robot with a battery pack connected to you.  This is not a replacement for either of those things.

So I wasn't able to go out on my birthday because heart stuff and also because I looked like a robot and didn't want to be out and about.  So anyway, Apple Watch is great.  I'm looking forward to having these features and having this information to give to my doctor.  But you need to know that it is not a replacement.

Transcript:  Right. All right.  Let's move on to the iPhones.  We saw an iterative release of the iPhone XS and the XS Max.  So let's go through the specs here.  So the XS is a 5.8 inch display.  It's as big as the 8 plus in terms of that display, but it's in a thinner form factor.  The iPhone XS Max is 6.5 inches.  They are a thousand and eleven hundred dollars respectively come in gold, silver, space gray.  They ship September 21st OLED screens, A12 bionic chip, the camera, the 12 megapixel camera.  It's got a bigger sensor, 2x optical zoom.  They really spent a lot of time on the camera aspects.  You really realize how much a part of their sense of what they're improving is based on that camera.  And it's obviously a huge part of why we upgrade our phones.  These have smart HDR, the two cameras, so that it can do, they say, a trillion processes per photo, four frames.  Then they create inner frames at a different exposure.  So what they can do then is combine them and maximize where the highlights and the shadows are.  There's a feature in the software that people are pretty excited about that.  Let's use use a slider to soften or sharpen the back focus so you can really mess with that depth of field.  So those are the the XS and the XS Max.  Now we'll get into that in one second.  The iPhone XR is the $750 model.  It comes in white, black, blue, yellow, coral, and product red.  The biggest difference, it has only one camera, so you don't have as much depth of field, you know, bells and whistles that you can play with.  It's an LCD screen, not an OLED, and it doesn't ship until October 26th.  So I want to start with the naming convention so we can just get that right out of the way.  iPhone XS, iPhone XS.  The Apple folks say XS.  Why is this even an issue?

My writing partner and I, I got done, I recorded the thing and I listened back, you know, before posting.  And I'm like, did I even get that right?  Like, I didn't even understand what I had said to a degree.  And you just like it's so hard to even encapsulate.  You just tried to do it in a minute, minute and a half.  And it's still it's fumbling, fumbling, fumbling.

Transcript:  Okay, let somebody say some positive stuff so I can get into ripping all the stuff that Apple did wrong again this year.  I think so somebody go and say something positive.

Start time: 1790.54
End time: 1830.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think we have any positive things to say about this in particular.  I've noticed that again, sort of going back to, okay, what do people when I take off my I'm a tech person and that's all I think about kind of thing and just listen to what everyday people say.  They say iPhone X and iPhone X interchangeably.  But one of the things like I saw this, I can't remember who was talking about it, but the like Roman numerals are hard enough for folks already.  And about the only time that it seems that the general public is interested in Roman numerals is when that big sports ball game comes around where there are lots of Roman numerals.

Start time: 1831.14
End time: 1838.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't remember which Super Bowl it was because I can't parse all the X's and L's and I'm too lazy.

Start time: 1842.38
End time: 1847.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then they added a C and an R. So like it's just begging you to call it the X at this point.

Start time: 1848.50
End time: 1900.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's what makes it hard because exactly you've already got a Roman numeral.  Then you want to add a letter afterward and people get confused.  And it's just at this point, it's like I don't know that any of it makes any sense.  But for me, it doesn't matter because I want to go in, you know, to look at what I'm going to get.  It's like I want the bigger one of this or the smaller one of this.  And I think that that is many times how I don't see my younger brother going in and saying, I want the iPhone XS.  I want it in 256 gigabytes. I want it in stainless steel.  He would go in and say, can you show me what you have here?  I know I want the bigger one and I think I want it in white glass.  And you know what I mean? Like we all use different terms to describe these things.  And so it's just kind of like Apple that does it this way.  And they have us in the tech industry have to go along with it.

Start time: 1900.90
End time: 1948.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have even complicated that because it used to be, well, the cheaper ones, the smaller one.  But let me say the request was for say something positive.  So on the one hand, that's gotten confused because it used to be the cheaper one was the smaller one.  And it also had the not as good camera.  And it still has the not as good screen, but it's a fantastic screen.  So here's a positive thing to say. You can buy any one of these three and you're essentially buying the same phone.  Like people have made that point that it is there is no high end Apple phone now.  They're all the best phone. I think Gruber or somebody said that that you go to the store and whatever one you pick,  you're going to you're not going to be jealous of someone that had a plus or whatever.  That that's gone.

Transcript:  The size aspect is, I think, a good thing because here's my iPhone eight.  And then here's the we the guys here, 3D printed the new iPhone here.  And you can see it's pretty much the same form factor, at least of my.

So when I spend eleven hundred dollars on a Mac and I only get sixty four gigs and I look at a note and it starts at one hundred twenty eight days because, you know, they live in America and the world as we live in.  And they know that nobody wants the sixty four gigs. Then they offer you a phone at five twelve for twenty five thousand twenty five hundred.

Transcript:  Well, it goes back to the whole idea that if it's there are thousands of people in the Apple marketing department who are working so hard on this messaging and if it's this confusing, if it's this obscuring of actual comparisons to other products, it's on purpose.  This is no accident. You know, it's not like they just rolled back to the Gilimiglio days where they had ten thousand skews and Steve Jobs came in and cleaned it all up and simplified it.  They're doing this on purpose. It's obvious, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, why wouldn't they simplify it? Why? Why? My thought is that the naming conventions are meant to confuse you.  It's the same thing they did with the iPad. The new iPad went from iPad. What was it? Two or whatever to iPad new.  It makes no sense. So if somebody in a meeting said that makes no sense and they said we know it's on purpose so that people know how new or how old or if it's iteratively improved or not.

Transcript:  Well, OK, I said on the TechMemes show this week that, you know, car companies figured this out 100 years ago.  Like originally they did model A, model T. After you do it for a decade, two decades, it gets too complicated.  And then it's just it's the it's the 2018 Honda Civic and then there will be a 2019 and there will be a 2020.  So, by the way, my personal theory is that when would be a really clean time to break convention and say it's the 2020 iPhone?  It might actually be next year because car companies do that. Like they release, you know, or announce the year earlier.  This is the 20. So what if next fall the new iPhone is the 2020 iPhone?  And then that would be a clean break from this sort of confusion and the old naming conventions.  And they just moved to the year model. I like it. Yes.

Transcript:  Well, actually, I would love to briefly, briefly, briefly touch on the advancements that didn't happen this year.  I think it's fascinating that so in years past, I have always had this like internal desire to get the new iPhone.  You know, it comes out. It's it could be the S series or it could be the normal series.  Always very into it. And this is the first year genuinely that I have not had that feeling that the these new phones don't.  Yeah, they don't. There's nothing about them that is so much greater or even like a small amount greater in my mind than the 10 that makes them worth it.  And I think part of the problem is that I was like madly in love with the 10.  It was a fantastic. It is, I should say, a fantastic phone.  It is it felt new. It felt fresh. It was exciting.  And these phones, they spent so much time on stage.  It was like I thought this was a consumer event because they had this whole section just talking about that H12 bionic.  Like, it's cool. It's got more cores and all of this other stuff.  And, you know, the image signal processor is improved, but that doesn't translate that well to your everyday consumer.  And there's nothing about these phones other than just like a larger screen that to me really stands out like faster face ID is interesting.  But I never really thought that it wasn't, you know, fast enough and the better waterproof stuff.  Oh, doctor already taught me not to drop my phone in the pool.  So I'm good there. It's yeah.  Like there isn't anything here that stuck out to me that if someone came to me and said, hey, should I upgrade?  And I say, do you have an iPhone 10? And then they say, yes, I'm going to say no, no, don't.

Start time: 2597.50

Transcript:  Please don't upgrade. That's that's what I'm going to ask. What phone does everybody have?  Eight iPhone 10. Eight.

Start time: 2604.82
End time: 2662.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have the seven and I was now I'm going to upgrade to the max.  And I asked my daughter who has my six S plus, I said, do you want the 10?  Because I was going to give it to her just to get it. I know I was skipping it.  And she's like, no, it's too small. I don't want it. And I'm like, are you insane?  Like this phone so much better. She's like, I don't care. I want a bigger phone.  So now, again, she's looking at me like if I if if if you she didn't ask for it, she's like, but if I can't get the bigger one, then I'll just keep this success plus or I'll take your old seven S plus.  I don't want that smaller form factor in my hand. She wants to be able to hold the bigger device.  And that's something that's interesting to me because, you know, that's her main device.  So she wants it bigger. But if you don't if you have the 10, there is absolutely no reason for you to upgrade at all at all.  And that and that's I feel like that's going to be a strike against Apple going forward.  And I guess they're waiting to see if this R is a big hit to get quote unquote cheaper sales.  But I so many people have this X. I don't know who's upgrading.

No, well, I'm not. But when we were, we use zip recruiter.  We we found out kind of as a bit of a shock a couple of months ago that our bookkeeper was leaving.  She gave us two weeks notice. But but this was a big crisis for Lisa because otherwise if she didn't find somebody right away,  she's doing the books and she doesn't have time for that. Ain't nobody got time for that.  We needed a bookkeeper fast. I was eating breakfast when we found out.  I said, honey, here's a chance to use zip recruiter. We used it before with great results, but nothing like this.  This blow blew my mind. So she put the posting up on zip recruiter.  Now, a couple of things happen first. Right away, zip recruiter posted on 100 plus job sites, including Twitter and Facebook.  So you're reaching out everywhere, every corner of the world.  Everybody who could possibly be interested in this job is seeing it. That's a good start.  But then zip recruiter does something remarkable.  With powerful matching technology, zip recruiter scans thousands of resumes to find people with the right experience.  And then invites them to apply to your job. It's like kind of like a automated headhunter.  They find the right people and they say, hey, you ought to look over here. There's a great job waiting for you.  And then you apply. And this was amazing. I mean, we did it at breakfast. Before lunch, we had four.  It was funny because they're coming in like in an hour. The first one. And Lisa goes, oh, oh, look, I got.  Oh, this is good. She's good. And then another one. Oh, oh, this person's perfect.  Oh, it was really fun. By lunch, we had three or four great applicants. Thanks to zip recruiter.  I've never seen anything like it. And as the applications come in, zip recruiter analyzes each one, spotlights the top candidates.  So you won't miss a great match. They format all the resumes so they're easy to read.  And it all goes into the zip recruiter inbox, not into your inbox, not into your phone.  It's all in zip recruiters interface. And they have screening questions of all sorts of ways to narrow it down.  Zip recruiter works so well. It's not just our experience.  Eighty percent of employers who post on zip recruiter get at least one qualified candidate through the site,  quality candidate through the site within the first day. Within the first day, we got four within the first five hours.  It blew my mind. Zip recruiter really works. No wonder it's the highest rated hiring hiring site in America.

Transcript:  Oh, Leo, we've worked together on and off for long enough. You don't need to hire me.  I'll just come and say hi every once in a while.  I'm Becky Worley filling in for Leo joined by a great crew this week on This Week in Tech, Brian McCullough.  He's the tech meme ride home podcast guy. Micah Sargent is at Mobile Nations.  He's the senior editor there, mobilenations.com.  And oh, doctor. Well, I didn't get to read. He's joining us in Memoji form with JJ Stone.  He says on his Twitter profile that he humbly tries to be Clark Kent.  And I mean, the humility in that statement is evident at all times, oh, doctor.  We are going to jump into it's so Apple heavy this week.  We always try and mix it up and we will talk about other things.  But this was the big news of the week.  I think everybody else knows that when Apple has an event, just don't even bother.  So I did just want to talk a little bit about the fact that OS 12 is going to be coming in September 17th.  That's this Monday. They say older phones are going to be 40 to 70 percent faster at certain tasks.  They specifically called out the iPhone 6 plus as benefiting from this upgrade.  And they mentioned things like the camera app will launch faster.  The keyboard will be accessible faster.  The other big thing that's coming in iOS 12 that I wouldn't say it's been promoted, but it exists is the screen time feature.  And this is not an app, but it's buried in the settings.  And it is something that Apple is doing in response to complaints and criticism from people even within their own organization about the addictive nature of phones.  I know that word comes loaded for a lot of people who think that gadgets and addiction that it's an overuse of the word.  But the fact that we are excessively checking our phones and using apps and using social media sites.  And so what the screen time function will do is it'll tell you how many times a day you pick up your phone.  It'll graph when those interactions happen.  It will monitor how much you use certain apps.  It can be used to set limits on each app so that after, say, an hour of Instagram, it pops up and says, hey, you said you just want to limit yourself to an hour.  It's been an hour. You can override that.  It also can put your phone in grayscale at certain times of the day to make it less appealing, kind of like the nighttime mode that we have now.  But I just it's interesting to me is a lot of different companies have received this feedback.  And I know I mentioned Instagram and they have talked a lot about the fact that they know that they have to do better at helping their users to limit their time and just the black hole that you can get sucked into.  Anyone think that the screen time feature is going to significantly affect the way that we as a population excessively use our gadgets?

Transcript:  I think it can help. I do want to say so psychologically speaking, there have been very real, very accurate comparisons between the effects of addiction to things like drugs,  food addictions, things like that, and the addiction that folks can have to devices, to video games, to these things where right now people seem to be, oh, you know, they've got Internet addiction.  They've got phone addiction. They've got this, that and the other.  I think a lot of people will claim maybe that they are someone they know does.  But there are real situations where that is a real thing.  And psychologically, it looks the same as other forms of addiction that we've seen.  So I just I don't think that it is a good idea to sort of wipe that off and say, oh, no, you know, these addictions don't exist because we've proven that they do.  When it comes to this, these new screen time features, I think they're fascinating because you have to sort of open yourself up to being nannied a little bit by by your device and being, I think, open minded.  And if you find yourself sort of annoyed and you keep shutting it off, like it's not going to work for you if you're constantly just saying no, no, no, no, no, it's not going to work for you.  With screen time, I haven't done any active screen time effects.  I have gone in and turned it on and I've checked in to see how my usage is.  And it's pretty kind of kind of horrifying.  What were your biggest surprises?  How many times I picked up my device in a day.  That was the biggest thing.  I was like, I don't remember picking it up that many times.  This is not OK that I am, you know, lifting up this phone.  And what's cool is that it's so integrated with other parts of the operating system that if you set up in your clock, if you set up your phone, you can actually see the effects of the device.  And it's really cool that it's so integrated with other parts of the operating system that if you set up in your clock, if you set up your bedtime, which is this feature where you set what time you want to go to bed, what time you want to wake up in the morning, and it will sort of let you know, hey, it's time to go to bed.  Then it'll play some music to wake you up and it asleep tracking in between.  But if you set your bedtime, then screen time will also shame you.  It's like, hey, you picked up your device after your bedtime that you set.  Why were you doing that?  So you just kind of can passively, I guess, more passively kind of confront these things.  And then maybe they'll make you change.  Maybe they won't.  But I have not activated any of the active features.  And I think for me, that's because I'm sort of in this space where it's like, if I can't control myself without these things, then maybe I just don't even need to have the device.  Or it's just I want to prove to myself that I can control my habits there.  And I have noticed a significant or rather not noticed.  I've made an active decision to be less active in certain apps and maybe pick up my phone less during the day.  But then I have this pesky thing on my wrist that lets me see things, too.  So who knows how good I'm being?

Transcript:  Well, they say you can't change what you don't measure.  Right. That's the big.  Amen.  CEO CFO kind of comment about how you affect your behavior, how you affect organizational behavior.  But Joanna Stern had an amazing column on this.  She's been testing it for a while.  It was in The Wall Street Journal last week.  And she said that what she just got in the habit of doing is whenever it told her she'd used enough of the device that she'd set a limit of, say, an hour or what have you, whenever it popped up that you've hit the hour, she just hit ignore.  And that she realized she it was just annoying her.  And she went to see a psychologist and he said that's because different parts of your brain are at work here is we have the gas and the brakes.  Right. And we're not so great at the brakes right now when it comes to our devices and our our thinking brain is going to say I should only use this for an hour.  But in that moment when you get a notification or you get a buzz on your wrist, your lizard brain says what's going on?  And those are two completely different sides of your brain.  And so this this monitoring is not going to change you unless, as you said, Micah, you actively decide to use it as a tool and you have to just the thing we suck at most as humans is self-discipline.  And so it's just nothing can there's no device that's going to make self-discipline happen.

Transcript:  Let me let me circle around back to the first thing you said.  Can we all just give an applause for Apple saying that older devices are going to speed up now instead of slowing down the update?  Isn't that like something just to applaud?  Like, I mean, really think about that.  They actually wrote it down, which they don't write down how long the battery lasts, but they wrote down.  It is going to speed up the success plus like that was impressive.  Apple did so no longer are we slowing down phones so you have to buy the new one.  We're going to speed up those O and for you broke people to keep.

Transcript:  And as far as the time limit that it gives you the same thing they did research on the watch because the watch would tell you to stand.  People would ignore it.  The watch would say to work out.  People would ignore it.  So the same thing is going to happen with this.  I'm most excited because on Tuesdays and Thursdays, my daughter is not allowed to watch YouTube and I usually have to log into her YouTube to make sure she doesn't do it.  So now I can just check her phone and notice she's not doing that.  But just a pro tip to people.  I set this up for my buddy on when it first came out because he wanted to make an emoji.  And then he's like, oh, well, what else does the phone do?  A couple of days later, I'm showing him stuff and I show him the thing.  And then Pornhub popped up.  Hey, you spent seven minutes on Pornhub.  He's like, what?  You need to check this because this is what it reports.  You can find out everything you did, every web page, every site, how long he was on the site.  So just be careful with this new update when you're out there to share with people and show them.  Oh, Lord have mercy.  And by the way, Instagram saying they want to help minimize time people spend on the wormhole.

Transcript:  I'm with you there.  I think that's hilarious and not true at all.  I do want to say I'm a big proponent of another feature that sort of ties into this screen time thing.  It's not screen time.  It's called Do Not Disturb While Driving.  And this is this feature has actually existed for a while, but it kind of ties into this whole new sort of what we're paying attention to and when we are.  And I genuinely think that it can make a difference for folks because what Do Not Disturb While Driving does is you depending on how you set it up,  you can set up to manual to where you turn it on.  I don't recommend that feature because you won't turn it on automatic to where it uses your sensors so that it can tell like when you're in the car and moving,  then it's like, oh, yeah, you're probably in a car or it can use if you have a Bluetooth stereo system in your car.  Those have a special profile to let the device know, hey, I'm connecting to a car with Bluetooth and then it will turn on.  In any case, what it does is it completely shuts down any notifications that you get while you're driving.  Your phone doesn't even light up.  And that's the important thing right there because lizard brain that's going, I just got a buzz.  I got to see what it is.  We have trouble not listening to that lizard brain.  We want to listen to that lizard brain.  And so if you aren't even presented with any sort of phone lighting up, any of that kind of thing,  then you're just less likely to want to go and unsafely use your device while you're in traffic or driving around or what have you.  And I've you know, I'd like to think that I am like, you know, I'm a good person who would never ever look at my phone ever while I was in the car.  But this feature helps make that a reality because I don't do it now because I don't see that there is a notification.  But in the past, it'd be like, oh, man, I saw somebody was tweeting at me.  Someone was sending me a message. Someone was trying to call me.  I guess when I met this red light, I better go ahead and look at those.  So I do think that there is some merit to these kinds of features if you let them work and if they kind of don't even give your lizard brain a chance to operate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's a really good use of it.  And I like that it gives you the option to do that.  It'd be nice if some of those things were a little bit more front loaded.  So you saw them as you were setting it up.  I got to get on that because, I mean, I just am so bad just while we were sitting here.  My watch is going crazy.  And I'm like, as a parent, I'm always worried.  Oh, my gosh, what's going on with my kid?  And so I'm checking the thing.  And just so you guys know, she's making cinnamon bread at home.  Emergency dealt with.

Transcript:  OK, when you set up a new device, it does walk you through the driving feature.  I feel like that's something that definitely has saved lives.  I don't know the stat on that. I don't know.  But I know it saved lives.  I remember a long time ago, I think it was like the second or third iPhone I had.  I was calling customer service and she's like, Oh, do you want to call me back?  And I'm like, excuse me?  She's like, well, you see you're driving, right?  And I'm like, how did you know I'm driving?  I'm looking out the window and she's like, I can tell by how fast you're moving.  I'm like, oh, OK, I'm a hang up now, big brother.  And they should have had that feature a long time ago.  I feel like if nothing else with it not lighting up is where it helps you.  Like if I set my timer for Instagram and I said no more Instagram after an hour  and it did me like an adult and said no more Instagram and I went to go to Instagram  and it just wouldn't load until the next time I said that would help me.  But the fact that I can just hit ignore and keep going in doesn't stop me.  But that driving feature is vastly important.  And I like the fact that they're doing that.  And again, when you set up your phone, new phone going forward, it should prompt you to that in the setup.

Transcript:  One thing that the screen time features will have that provides that kind of shutdown feature is  if you're setting up a phone and you indicate that it's a child's phone,  you can get more control now through Apple's internal controls as opposed to a third party app  to shut down YouTube, shut down Instagram or Snap.  So the parental controls have been beefed up.  They have again a nighttime mode so that you can turn it off at certain times.  This is a long time coming and it's kind of embarrassing.  I think that this is just now something that Apple is offering.  It has not been something that you can do in the past and they've made it really difficult for parents.  And I think this is going to help.  I still think that the Disney Circle product is probably the best option for parents  in terms of shutting things down on a sort of house wide aspect.  It can control your Xbox, your computers, your phones.  If you get the subscription service, it can control your phone when your kid is outside the house.  Oh, wow.  So that I think is probably the best option.  And granted, full disclosure, I was hosting a panel for them down at Mobile World Congress Americas last week  and got to know the features of it a little bit better and especially their integration with T-Mobile now.  But I think that it's kind of surprising to me that Apple is only just getting to these parental controls  and that they aren't offering even more of a whole home solution because this is a major pain point for parents.  I mean, everybody I talk to, you go to any party with parents and they just tear their hair out about  how much conflict is in their home around gadgets.

Transcript:  Just back to the screen time.  A couple of the things I want to mention that Google has this.  They have the Wellbeing app, so it's not just Apple.  And one other thing that I'm seeing in the chat room you keep mentioning,  and I just want to circle back on this before we finish all Apple talk.  Oh, doctor, you keep talking about dual SIM cards.  Dual SIM cards. So my understanding of this one feature that was brought out for the iPhone  is that it will allow you to have two phone numbers, one physical SIM card, one eSIM card,  except in China where it will have two SIM card slots because eSIM cards are illegal there.  Anybody have anything they want to add on this, why this is of value?  I don't really totally understand it except for international travel.  I mean, you wouldn't, you know, I know most people, like a lot of people that I work with,  they have a work phone that's provided by their employer and then they have a home personal phone.  And I don't think this solves that problem because you don't want to commingle the data on your phone.  Right. So any other use cases that I'm not thinking of this for this?

Start time: 3871.69
End time: 3878.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  So the way they say it is you're going to be able to know which number and which line are coming in.  For my criminal activities, I use my LG G7 ThinQ, which allows me to have T-Mobile digits.  So I can have two phones on it and additional imaginary SIM.  I'm doing air quotes right here, the eSIM or whatever it is.  So there's definitely a lot of usage for it. It just depends on what you're using it for.  I'm not going to incriminate myself any further, but I'm going to say that it is a useful thing, especially when you just also.  OK, so you're Becky, right? You want to go out, maybe you want to talk to somebody, but you want to give them your real number.  Wouldn't it be nice to have this backup number that still comes to your cell phone that you could get calls with, you could block them.  And you know, it's not your personal number that you have for 14 years.  I mean, there's there's a whole bunch of case scenarios for it.  I just we don't have time to break it all down right now.

Transcript:  I'll just agree that this definitely was a head scratcher for me.  But I can I can see, you know, for some folks who, for whatever reason, might need two different numbers, then it's available to them.  And yeah, I guess if you did a lot of international travel, we talked to Jeremy Burge from Emojipedia on the clockwise podcast earlier this week.  And he had mentioned that he's in the U.S. quite a bit.  And the way that our sort of system is set up, it's very difficult to keep a number here without getting shut down after a while.  And so to be able to bounce back and forth between those two is very helpful for him.  But I've heard a lot of complaints about doing partial e-sim and then the actual physical card and why Apple didn't just do the one that has two physical cards everywhere.  And I think it's fascinating because we have this sort of struggle, power struggle a little bit between the carriers in the United States and the phone makers in the United States.  And to do e-sims makes it a lot easier for people to switch between carriers and carriers aren't big on that idea.  So the physical SIM makes a little bit more difficult.  And I don't know, I again, I don't do enough switching.  I've been on AT&T for a bajillion years, so it doesn't really matter to me.

We we use Stamps.com because we send stuff out, right?  Checks, brochures, mailing stuff.  You know, we mail people bobbleheads and fezzes, all sorts of stuff.  We mail the host's microphone, all that stuff.  If you're doing mailing of any kind, you really need Stamps.com.  Stamps.com does everything you can do, all the amazing services, the post office at your desk.  And I'm not talking a postage meter.  You use your computer, your printer.  That's it.  And the Stamps.com site, you can buy and print official U.S.  postage for any letter, any package, any class of mail.  The mail carrier comes and picks it up.  You don't have to get up.

It makes you look really professional too because it can print right on envelopes, your logo, your return address automatically filled in.  It'll pick up the recipient's address from your address book, like Outlook or whatever you use.  Or if you're a seller, like on Amazon or Etsy or eBay, it'll pick it up there, put it on the label.  It'll even recommend ways to save money with more affordable mail classes.  They send you a digital scale so you always have exactly the right postage, no more extra stamps just in case.  And stamps don't, I mean, licking and putting a stamp on, it's much nicer with a label and the QR code and everything.  It really looks good.

And we have one fantastic audience member here.  And he has really helpfully informed me.  Jatosh says that in Asia, a lot of people have dual SIMs because they get better data rates with one carrier.  And then they might have better long distance rates depending on what country they call most.  And he says 90 to 95 percent of the people in Singapore and Hong Kong have multiple SIMs just for that reason.  So it's so great to have a live studio audience member who can inform me of these important things.  Our audience members are always so knowledgeable.  That's what's so intimidating for me filling in for Leo.  The audience is so amazingly knowledgeable.  You just don't want to be a total ding dong up here.  Luckily, I have three great panelists with me.  Brian McCullough is here from the Tech Meme Ride Home podcast.  Micah Sargent from Mobile Nations and O Doctor Owen JJ Stone.

Transcript:  Excellent.  We're going to move on to the interface of social media and politics and culture and society,  which could fill an entire podcast in and of itself.  The news, Facebook this week said it's going to use technology and human monitors to look at pictures  that contain text that may be fake news or in violation of their policies.  In the past, it's been very difficult to report a picture because they didn't have any reporting tools  to flag those pictures that fit into any of these categories.  As a result, a lot of the fake news propaganda that's been pushed aside in text form,  there has been a rising up of using photos for this.  So now they've got optical character recognition and some AI that's going to look at what is being said  in text over these pictures to determine if it fits any of the fake news or propaganda  that they're trying to squelch on the site.  It's called Rosetta and it's an internal program that just kind of pushes the ball down the hill  that says Facebook is looking at this issue.  Brian, I know you talked a lot about Facebook's problems in this space  and what Mark Zuckerberg wrote as they say they're preparing for the upcoming elections.  I just want to quote a couple of things he said in this article in the New Yorker that Evan Osnos wrote.  It was basically the concept is can Mark Zuckerberg fix Facebook before Facebook breaks democracy?  And what Zuckerberg said in his post,  I'm bringing the same focus and rigor to addressing election interference  that I brought to previous product challenges like shifting our services to mobile.  These issues, the election issues, are even harder because people don't agree on what a good outcome looks like  or what trade-offs are acceptable to make.  And I think this really signifies what he thinks Facebook's job is.  Our responsibility is to amplify the good and mitigate the harm.  Does he get it, Brian?

Transcript:  Well, you know, actually what I talked about this week in regards to this piece,  I'm going to take off that and go in a different direction.  The that specifically the the politics stuff.  That's what I think this piece illuminates is that that's the classic engineers idea  that if we just get enough smart people in a room and get some smart math together, we can solve this problem.  And so if he see he's seeing rightfully so that the political aspect,  the propaganda aspect is a problem that they didn't anticipate or maybe they should have anticipated,  but they didn't do enough to fix at the beginning.  What I found fascinating about this New Yorker piece is that I can see that Zuckerberg gets that stuff.  Again, it's the it's the engineers mindset of, oh, you've told me there's a problem.  You told me that this aspect of the product is is performing 30 percent suboptimally.  How do we fix it? That sort of thing.  What I found fascinating about this New Yorker piece is the it's rare.  You know, every they always tried out CEOs to do these profiles.  You know, they don't want to do it. Evan even says at the beginning, you could tell by his body language, he didn't want to do it.  But it's an aid of saying we get it. Heard you. I'm human.  I, you know, I'm a nice guy, that sort of thing.  What I thought that this piece illuminated is Zuckerberg feels like he can solve problems that are brought to his attention that are categorizable, that have metrics and things like that.  But I thought that this was an amazing profile of the best I've seen of Zuckerberg in years because Evan Osnos took sort of like this authorial position of there's a there's a trope in literature that's about the boy king  that's been brought up inside the castle and now he has to lead.  So he has to understand what how the outside world actually functions.  And I feel like that this piece had a little bit of that in the sense or a lot of that really in the sense that Zuckerberg is not a dumb guy.  No one's ever accused him of that. So he's smart enough to realize that he is in a bubble to a certain extent.  He created this company in 21, 22. He's been filthy rich, world famous for this whole time that Facebook's been around.  There's no one that's hired that he doesn't sign off on.  There's even a quote from from Sheryl Sandberg in there where he'll say sometimes in front of the company.  Well, I've never worked anywhere else, but Sheryl tells me so Zuckerberg is aware that there are things that he doesn't that he knows he doesn't know that he knows he doesn't know.  That he knows he doesn't grok is maybe a better way of saying it.  The question that this piece in my mind brings out is, is that enough?  I mean, thank God that he's self aware. Thank God that he knows he needs to learn things outside his bubble.  And he's always made a show of trying to improve himself.  But also maybe learning what you don't know isn't taking a media crew around the country and going to people's houses and having dinner with them.  And oh yeah, posting those photos for, you know, I I think that yes, thank God that they're that they're taking the steps that they're taking to address the political stuff.  They're getting out there ahead of it. Let's hope that they they've they're doing all the right things right now.  But I thought that this piece was more fascinating because it sort of revealed Zuckerberg's bubble in a way that I know piece had done before,  especially with the Roman Emperor stuff, which I'm going to quit talking now.

Transcript:  But if you want, I can come back to that. I want you to explain that a little bit because we'll get back to that.  He named his daughter August after Augustus, and it really indicates his perception of what his role is in not just society, but in history and in the long scope of history.

Transcript:  So the future. This is exactly the point that I made on the show this week.  First of all, there were 70 odd Roman emperors, depending on how you count.  There were maybe four good ones in terms of like being good, effective rulers.  The majority were psychopaths, actual psychopaths, and a lot of them were psychopaths before they became emperor.  But a lot of them became psychopaths because they had unlimited power and were basically gods on Earth that had life or death power over everyone in their realms.  So in a piece where we're trying to say, hey, I'm Mark Zuckerberg. I'm a nice guy. I'm a human.  I'm trying to learn the things that I don't know.  And also, I'm trying to assure the public that yes, me, this unelected emperor of my quasi nation state that has two billion citizens in it.  By the way, I really hero worship the Emperor Augustus, who aside from Julius Caesar is really the guy that brought down the Roman Republic.

Transcript:  But, you know, it gives you a sense of the scope that he perceives his his his role in in society, the world, the future history and and some of the comparative stats that were brought out blew my mind.  And maybe he's right. This is a couple of things.  If Facebook were a country, it would have the largest population on Earth, more than two point two billion people, about a third of humanity log in at least once a month.  I think they said at one point that Facebook has as many adherents as Christianity.  What more?  It's it's crazy.  And so, you know, he sees himself at this scale and he might be right.  And I would say that, you know, the central issue as he places himself and Facebook in the world and in the political environment that we're in right now is is Facebook going to be a decider of truth or are they going to be a venue for truth to be discussed and what is truth.  And I think, you know, the what was said that really spoke to me is that let me see if I can get this quote.  It had to do. It was the central issue about if he had to choose truth.  I'm going to find it for you.  Hold on a second.  I mean, I just the whole Alex Joe here it is between speech and truth.  He chose speech between speed and perfection.  He chose speed between scale and safety.  He chose scale.  And that's the takeaway that Evan Osnos has at the end of this really deep look at Facebook and Zuckerberg and the problems we have right now.  I think the deed has been done.  There's I don't know.

Transcript:  I honestly I I don't have much to say on this because I think that we have reached a place where it's like what what can we do with this site to or even like with the Internet in general.  And more importantly, with with human beings, because I think that we underestimate the level at which I can't think of the term right now, but the level at which we have trouble accepting new ideas and we have trouble letting those base beliefs and understandings that we have change.  And because of that, and we've created this this online place where election tampering can happen because a group can come in and sort of put out these ideas that they know are going to upset a certain group and then also feed into another group.  That is because of our evolutionary history and the way that we going back to the lizard brain, the way that we think like.  And I have to give so many of these props to Georgia Dow, who's been on this week in tech before, because much of this comes from from her.  She's a psychotherapist.  And historically, we lived in these little tribes, and it was very important for us to see what was ours and what was others and our beliefs and the things that we did.  They kept us safe and the things that others did.  We wouldn't want to be a part of those because they wouldn't keep us safe.  And at our very base level brain, because we lived so many years like that, we still feel that way.  We still think that way.  And so it's difficult.  It's almost like an actual literal pain for us to change our base beliefs, to be open minded, to experience change, to be open to new ideas.  And we have just created this this thing where connections can happen so quickly and to get so many people.  And it's like two things that come together at once.  We've got all these connections happening and so many people being able to see things all at once.  But then we also have this thing where humans aren't realizing that the people behind these usernames or these these profile photos or what have you, are actual literal human beings.  We have this disconnect.  And so all this can come together to like let us spill out the most disgusting parts of ourselves and really feel hatred and and badness and all of these things.  And then we take those and they become a part of us in our daily lives.  And we use that to influence how we feel about other people and the way that we think about other people.  So if you tuned out on to everything I just said, the TL, semicolon, DR is I think that the that we are not we we I don't know what's what it's going to take to fix it because I think that it's already broken.  And I think that until we look at things from a psychological perspective and from a human centered perspective, we're not going to get anything done.  Totally agree.

Transcript:  And I feel like very few people have had their minds changed because of something that was posted on social media.  And yet one counter narrative and an analogy that I can see is that Facebook is like Facebook in the in the most recent election is like airports and 9-11.  And that after 9-11, we changed the security in our airports because we wanted to at least we couldn't change everything with that.  But at least we could stop weaponizing planes.  And so are these steps to change Facebook and to downrank things that are perceived of as fake news or polarizing?  Is that the equivalent of trying to make social media less weaponized?  And is it at least worth fighting the fight?  And I think the answer is yes. Does it solve all the problems?  Absolutely not. Should they have been aware in advance?  Probably. But here we are.  And you got to do something.  And whether or not he's going to do enough is the question.  And this this profile left me uncertain.  I know why he did what he what Facebook did in the past, but I don't know what they're going to do in the future.

Transcript:  I see that this is what this brings me back to the whole concept of Zuckerberg is aware that he's in a bubble of his own making that he's he's hired the team that he wants.  He's making the product that he wants.  So the question is, is he is he the is he the qualifier in a weird way?  Is he the qualified person to make those changes if seemingly he's not capable of being aware of how these things work on?  For lack of a better word, normal people. You know what I mean?  Like Ben Thompson and Strutecary wrote this week that his concern is not that Zuckerberg believes that Facebook is a force for good, rather that he probably maybe doesn't even consider that it might not be a force for good.  You know what I mean? Like he refuses to maybe even allow himself to go there.  When you were when you were talking about that quote of choosing scale over safety, truth over speech, speech over truth.  Right. So he Osnos finishes that by saying that at a certain point, the habits of mind that serves Zuckerberg well on his assent will start to work against him.  So far, he's convinced himself he can solve problem after problem, no matter the howling the public may cause.  But and this is the key point. Osnos says that Zuckerberg is going to have to embrace the fact that he's now a protector of the peace, not a disruptor of it.  And I'm bringing it back to that being the the the boy king analogy.  If you're William the Conqueror and you take over England in 1066, great.  You've you've moved fast and broken things.  But then what the people that you now rule want you to do is not break a bunch of other stuff.  They want you to bring them peace and prosperity.  You know, so does he have the mindset and the tools to win the peace, to to make us all feel comfortable and like and wealthy and profitable and happy as opposed to, hey, here's a new feature that can do this thing that you never thought of.  Like in a way, the skill set that Facebook and Zuckerberg have to have now is keeping us fat and happy, not like wowing us with new stuff, maybe.

Transcript:  And I think one thing that underscores that point is a piece of news that came out this week about Alex Jones and all of his channels being taken down from the various social media platforms and the iTunes store, which was basically that Mark Zuckerberg admitted that they weren't sure what to do.  And it wasn't until Apple pulled all of Alex Jones material out of the podcast and iTunes store that Facebook felt like, OK, now we can do it.  And maybe to your point, what this says is that they're not leaders and they can't lead on this.  And I just don't know who's going to help them.  You know, are they going to follow Apple?  Who are they going to follow?

Transcript:  You know, Brendan, I read on the podcast, Brendan Nian tweeted that the problem is too many tech types fail to differentiate between technical problems and social challenges that can't be engineered away.  And he says that Bill Gates has moved up the learning curve on this.  But most of his colleagues have not.  It could be.  I mean, so how long has has Cheryl been there at least a decade, right?  And Facebook's what, 15 years old almost like there was a time when they shook things up at at Microsoft.  There was a time when Bill Gates took a step back and handed the reins to Steve Ballmer, which we know how that didn't go so well.

Transcript:  Is there is this the time for Facebook to do a real shakeup, bring in some new blood and like literal generational blood again?  Facebook's almost 15 years old.  How old is Zuckerberg now?  He was born in 84.  Like so like if maybe bring in and this might even aid them in terms of like, you know, people, young people don't use the main Facebook app anymore.  They're using Instagram for sure.  But like so maybe bring in some young blood, like bring in a new generation again.  I'm using Microsoft as an example.  They did that stuff, especially in the 90s.  They brought in that that generation X generation that came in after the Gates's and the Ballmer's and stuff that that ran things in the 90s.  And maybe this is that time for Facebook.

Transcript:  I got to lose my like perky morning television.  Good morning America persona and get my rant on if I'm going to step in for the great doctor.  But there was other news this week.  A couple interesting things.  I want to talk a little bit about Alphabet's project Loon.  This is Google Alphabet's project to use balloons to create wireless networks.  Past a big milestone this week they used seven balloons in the stratosphere.  They spread out a signal over 620 square miles.  The idea is not super new.  They're bringing wireless data to areas that don't have the infrastructure to create good data networks.  Facebook has done this before.  There have been planes and solar powered planes where people thought they could do this to create internet access in places where it's limited.  We always think of, oh, everybody has internet.  Not so much.  Where I think this is really interesting is that Project Loon was deployed in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.  They had to get an FCC temporary license to go in and provide this.  They worked with T-Mobile and Verizon.  As we're watching the Florence, Hurricane Florence hit the Carolinas right now, really interesting uses of technology going on.  We've seen next door the social network for neighborhoods be incredibly powerful for people who have emergency needs.  It's amazing how people do manage to keep connected.  Whether they have a cell signal or somehow still have Wi-Fi in some way, shape or form, it does happen even in these major storms.  Another one that's really interesting, I was listening to Zello.  Have you guys ever used that before?  No.  I've heard of it.  It's interesting.  It can work with incredibly low bandwidth on your cell signal.  It's kind of like a CB radio where they have channels that are articulated for topics.  They have a bunch of different Hurricane Florence channels, including one for the Cajun Navy where people are monitoring.  If you need help and can sign on to the app, you can state your location and ask for information to be relayed to 911 if you for some reason can't reach 911.

These low bandwidth apps actually are really helpful as they're trying to communicate with other people.  It's called Zello.  Then another one that was from, I think it was Harvey as well, Brian, was it's called Crowd Rescue.  This lets people who need to be rescued.  A lot of times it's the slow rising waters and people are trapped and then they can put their location on them and they can indicate where they are.  Then volunteers who have boats or trucks or whatever can try and get at them.  It's one of those places where you see technology and free markets and the existing device infrastructure that we have working when you can't rely on.  There's just not enough first responders to help everybody.  It's always good as we rant to talk about something good.

There is one interesting thing that I wondered about and I know this sounds crazy, but FireChat is another app that came out of Burning Man, I think.  Where there was so much pressure on the cell signals that you couldn't actually get a message through.  So it created these mesh networks through Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connecting up to other phones who had the app running and they relayed messages to other people in the network.  I thought, man, I wonder what it would take. I'm sure it has major security issues, but for that to be built into the operating systems that you could somehow create a mesh network if you wanted to with other phones without having to be a pre-installed app.  That's the thing about this. Who pre-installs an app for when you're in a disaster and you use connectivity.  Right. You don't think about it.

AirDrop.  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly.  And so if you had sort of like AirDrop chat where everyone could work together in those kinds of situations, I think that's a pretty cool idea.  And Apple being so focused on encryption and security, I imagine they figure out a way to try and make that happen without there being those security issues.

Transcript:  One more little weather item that I thought was kind of interesting is the Weather Channel did an amazing graphic, 3D graphic showing what the water rising numbers actually mean in real life.  So hopefully we'll have this posted. But it's un-wired.  Posted it. It's also in the Weather Channel's Twitter feed.  But basically they have this entire green screen room and they did an animation.  It's like if you scroll forward to like a minute into the animation, it shows the meteorologist standing, kind of doing like a standard, you know, here's where the rain's going to come.  But then it's like a carved out semicircle around her and the backdrop is this 3D graphic of a car and a street and a house and trees.  And you see the water rising behind her and you realize the scope.  I mean, it's like the day after kind of scary.  You know, you realize, wow, the power of water.  I just thought as as we look at the power of video, this is such a fantastic example of showing and not telling.  And it makes us realize how much more potential we have to tell stories.

Transcript:  And there's going to be a lot more of that because I did a whole segment on this as well.  And so, first of all, how did they do it?  They're using Unreal Engine.  So which makes sense if you look at if you watch it, it's actually like, yeah, that kind of does look like my favorite role playing game.  Right. Gaming technology.  But then also, so the Weather Channel has invested.  They only have the one studio now, but they've invested a whole bunch of tech money into creating more things like that.  They have a special studio with all the fancy motion tracking stuff, you know, to make Gollum and things like that and the green screens and all that stuff.  And they're apparently going to roll out over the next several months or years or whatever.  Many more of these. They wanted to get this one ready for the hurricane season.  And they want to do because that's their whole point is not only I think it's been viewed 10 million times on Twitter already.  Not only is it really compelling television, but, you know, I'm a Florida native.  So, like, you know, I've dealt with hurricanes every year for my whole life.  And the whole idea of is you always get those people that are like, why are not leaving? I'm not leaving.  Well, OK, here's what a 10 foot storm surge actually would do to your neighborhood.  And they're going to do more of these for things like how quickly a fire can move through a canyon or something like that.  So the whole idea is when people are watching these weather or natural disaster events happen  and they're not really sure how seriously to take it, they're trying to make people take it more seriously.  And I think it's fantastic. I agree that this is like, oh, hey, oh, Dr. Back.

But I remember the day when Anderson Cooper was sitting in a ditch pretending like it was four feet more water than it was.  Just the other day, we had that guy who was bracing himself against the wind with people walking behind him.  So that's why people don't leave their homes. That's why people stay there because they can't trust the media.  I'm doing air quotes again because they do silly stuff like that to play up storms.  And sometimes there is a real danger and you need to run for your life. But it's not every storm. It's not all the time.  So as cool as that is, as good as that is, you know, somebody's gonna be sitting at home. Well, that's fake water.  And that doesn't look real to me. It's just a witness. Now this guy right here.  This is why people stay in their houses because they want stuff like this. And they're like, really, bro, what are you doing?  And if you can find a clip, I know it's 10 years old, but this dude is literally he walked down the hill, stood in a ditch with waiters, did an interview.  Talk about how everything was flooding when literally was maybe up to his ankles.

Transcript:  Becky, what do you do to secure your passwords? Huh? All of you. All of you.  I hope you're not using monkey one, two, three or a lot of people I know.  I won't name names like we'll use a combination of their initials, their kids birthday, their dog's name and call it a day.  And then they use it for every site with maybe modifications, maybe not.  This is not secure. You know this. And maybe you do better.  But can I tell you something? Your employees are doing that right now.  And that's why you need LastPass Enterprise for your business.  Why we use LastPass Enterprise. You're giving your employees the keys to the kingdom.  You need a little bit of security, a little help.  LastPass is the password vault that protects you best at home and at work.  According to one survey, 32 percent of employees share passwords with others.  And by the way, not just the person sitting at the desk across from them, people at home.  Yeah. You got to protect yourself.  What are you doing to ensure those passwords are being shared appropriately?  Well, LastPass Enterprise, it makes password sharing easy for employees, but keeps access to corporate data secure.  It even allows for full customization of access.  Like you could set master password requirements.  So no more monkey one, two, three.  Enables password reset.  So because employees inevitably they'll forget.  But you have control of all of this.  And by the way, if an employee leaves or no longer needs access to get their work done, you can easily revoke access to a password.  They don't even see the password in some cases.  Generally, this is what we do.  They don't see the password. They just get a button to click the log on the site.  It fills in the password. All they see is dots.  So they can't share it. They can't tell anybody else.  They don't even know it themselves.  I love that.  LastPass has over 100 policies, access security reports.  You can create shared folders.  We use it for everything. Database logins, SSH keys, software licenses, other important business information at home.  I use it for my driver's license, credit cards, Social Security number.  Everything's in LastPass because I trust it.  Everything in LastPass is fully encrypted.  No one has access, even LastPass.  Only you.  Only you.  And with the LastPass Authenticator app, you get multi-factor authentication.  This is really nice.  Actually, they have many ways of doing two-factor.  But the LastPass app is not.  Employees like that because they don't have to copy a six-digit number or anything.  A verification button pops up on the employee's phone, and that guarantees that only they are accessing this resource.  That's very nice.  Even if credentials are compromised or given away or shared,  having that multi-factor authentication means outsiders don't have access.  Only authorized employees.  And of course, the password generator, which makes sure that you're always using strong passwords  and you don't have to write them down because LastPass remembers them for you.  And if you use Microsoft's Active Directory, you don't even have to remember the LastPass password.  You can use your AD credentials to log in.  So really, then that's it.  That's everything.  This is so good for business.  We've been using LastPass Enterprise for years.  I've been using LastPass Personal for years.  In fact, almost 10 years.  LastPass celebrated their 10th anniversary in July.  Isn't that awesome?  From easy onboarding to password autofill,  LastPass makes it easy for businesses to take control of passwords, reduce the threat of breach.  You need this for your business.  And it's very affordable.  Go to lastpass.com slash twit.  Choose from LastPass Premium for personal use.  LastPass Families is what I use at home.  Makes it easy to share passwords, have emergency access for spouses, things like that.  LastPass Teams for teams of 50 or fewer are what we use at work.  LastPass Enterprise.  I believe in LastPass so much that we actually give it as a benefit of employee to our employees  for their personal use as well.  And it integrates very nicely with the enterprise.  I just think it's that important.  I think you need to use it.  Lastpass.com slash twit.  More than 13 million people trust LastPass, including me and Steve Gibson.  It's the number one most preferred password manager.  Lastpass.com slash twit.  Have I convinced you? I hope so.  And now back to Becky Worley as we wrap up this week's twit.  I'll be back next week.

Transcript:  Becky Whirly here back on Twitter.  I was just checking Twitter.  My handle is at BWhirly.  Follow a sister.  That helps me out.  And LichMD had a comment about the DualSims.  He says, I've had a personal line and a Google voice line for business for close to a decade.  I've carried two phones to support this for years.  And now with DualSims on the Apple phone 10S, I can carry one phone and answer text, et cetera, on both.  And, you know, that's a good example.  He's a small business owner.  So he's not worried about Big Brother, the employer, checking in on all his stuff.  He just wants to carry one phone but have two numbers.  Makes a lot of sense.  We are joined by Mike Sargent, Brian McCullough, and oh, Dr. Owen JJ Stone.  Thank you, gentlemen, for being with us.  And this is kind of exciting news in policy.  But I'm a big policy fan because I think changes only happen with markets, free markets, with government policy, and occasionally with grassroots.  Maybe I'm a little bit fatalistic in my thinking.  But when a policy change happens, I think it's worth paying attention.  So this one is from the EU.  The European Parliament has voted to pass a copyright directive.  And the two that are in contention are Article 11 and Article 13, the hyperlink tax and the upload filter.  So I'll quickly hit the hyperlink tax because we don't need to get into that too much, although it does impact business.  It would require companies to pay news outlets for hosting their content on the platforms.  Basically, if you have a hyperlink, that's OK.  But if you excerpt significant portions of the text, sites like Facebook, Google, Twitter could be forced to pay those companies for the content.  And, you know, I think Megan and Jason were speaking with a guy from the EFF earlier this week.  And he basically just said, the EU is doing this because they're super mad.  That was his exact quote at Google, Facebook and Twitter.  They're super mad.  And it's because they're not getting any revenue from these companies.  And this is one of the ways that they can imagine bringing revenue back into European companies, media companies who are, you know, as all media companies are suffering from sharing.  It could be said.  Now, this is the one that's interesting.  And, oh, doctor, this is the one that's messing with your meme.  This is the meme killer.  It would require these big companies to automatically anyone who has user generated content to automatically filter copyrighted material, songs, images, videos, unless it has been specifically licensed.  Now, we know this exists already.  This you probably have seen this when certainly for us here at Twitter when we podcast, we upload material that might have a song or a video or something that's copyrighted.  It goes up onto YouTube and YouTube takes it down because they have AI that recognizes the algorithmic signature of the material and therefore can say, hey, that's copyrighted and they don't own the copyright.  But this has a ton of issues when it comes to fair use.  This could be a big deal if it passes.  It's not meant it wouldn't go into into play until 2019.  But this is a big deal.  This is a big deal if it if it goes in and also PR like it only has one more vote like everything I read about it.

Start time: 7029.84
End time: 7110.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a done deal, essentially.  And then there's a complication where each individual EU country can implement it in different ways.  So it's not it doesn't even have the advantage of it being one single law that you have to follow.  But the key part about this is so if you're thinking, well, this doesn't affect me.  I'm not a YouTube.  I'm not going to upload us.  Well, this could affect you posting an animated GIF or whatever to to a Facebook post, to an Instagram, to Twitter.  And the key part about it is, is unless I haven't read any piece that says this is possible, everything I've read says that the only way that they can do this is to put the filter in front.  Right.  So you could have a scenario where someone says funny something funny on on whatever platform you want and you want to respond with a funny future Rama animated GIF.  But whatever platform you post to would have to run it through the algorithm before it could post it.  Right. And if they reject it, they say, oh, this is not.  And then you would get all sorts of problems where it's like, but this is fair use.  I'm just posting.  This is just a joke or whatever.  And and and then the political implications of having those filters.  So it is potentially quietly like a huge, huge story.

Start time: 7111.28
End time: 7124.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's going to be implemented differently in different countries doesn't really matter.  I always think of it like a three legged race, because when we're doing things at a global scale, whomever has the most restrictive policies, you have to adhere to that globally.  Right. Right.

Start time: 7124.98
End time: 7172.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly. That's the big thing there that, you know, people might go, oh, well, here in the US, Twitter is going to be OK.  You know, we'll we'll still be able to do what we want to do in the United States.  But if the company is going to go through this entire policy change and implement these tools and set this up, you have to because you would be communicating with people potentially from the countries where this is and this is a law.  And you can't have it work in some places and work in others.  And so it is kind of scary in the sense that it will it will change the I think it will change communication on the Web in many ways.  If I mean, I don't see any other thing happening like this is going to happen.  Right. We've we've seen that these laws, like you said, it's pretty much through.  It's going to there's one more vote in January.

Transcript:  Look, first of all, if I was in the EU, I worry about Facebook, Twitter, everybody blocking me from not sharing my sites before you trying to get money out of me spreading the business.  Secondly, memes are a very crucial part of my bank account.  I make a lot of money with me. So they shut down my means.  We got a problem. Oh, this is why I'm saying quietly.  This is a big deal. Do you know, first of all, Kim Kardashian is Kim Kardashian because she was a meme before memes were memes.  OK, so when things happen, Drake has a song out.  The song sucks. One kid does a dance to it.  The whole world's got a hashtag. Do the Shiggy dance.  So you think you won't stop? OK, let's say they stop it.  The traffic will take such a hit from viral things not going around the web that all these companies are going to be like, look, what official we got to pay off to rewrite this month.  So it ain't gonna last long.  The the the wave of traffic that means and jokes and using the I want that Futurama, you know, I mean, take my money like that stuff helps the Internet.

Start time: 7262.94
End time: 7294.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It helps all these. Yeah, but ironically, ironically, that's the whole point is that the EU says it's doing this to protect the artists.  So what you just described with Drake, ironically, they would be taking down those memes in order to protect Drake and theoretically give him more money.  Drake might not think so because Drake's a modern guy that's like the game has changed.  This is how I get publicity.  But ironically, that's what they're trying to do.  They're trying to set up this regime to protect the artists and to protect copyright holders.

Transcript:  I watched the government sit there and tell Jack Dorsey that people are selling opioids on Twitter and he needs to stop it.  And that's what's the problem with the world.  Opioid addiction.  And he didn't want to talk about doctors writing prescriptions falsely for people like they're candy and all the other things are wrong.  The rules and regulations for pharmaceutical companies.  He wanted to put it at Jack Dorsey's footsteps on Twitter for the opioids selling on Twitter.  That's what those people are stupid.  They don't understand how the Internet works and what's going on and how things flow.  So, again, go ahead and make that law.  Everybody in the world is going to tell you I'm not selling as many albums as I have.  People aren't searching my old movie from 1976 because it somehow became popular again because some kid found it with his dad's DVD collection.  Like, oh, I'm so upset about this.  If it happens again, it's going to personally affect my bank account.  And that's going to be a problem.  Memes got to live forever.  But I feel like if they do shut them down, they're going to be right back.  Memes going to be back in like a year.  Memes can never die.

You know what I mean?  So, right.  Like, imagine a scenario where somebody posts something and you've got the perfect response and here's and you're scrolling through.  Here's that.

Transcript:  This is the only thing to me that has ever come close because we had the privacy regulations that got put into place and it makes it makes sense.  Wow.  It did make sense.  It didn't make sense, but it did make sense that we we sort of made those a more universal thing.  There were some companies and to this day that still don't have the exact same availabilities in the U.S.  that you have in other countries to download your data.  But for the most part, these companies were like, we're already doing this.  Let's just go ahead and do it everywhere.  This is something that everybody does want.  This this judgment goes against like Tumblr culture, Twitter culture, Facebook.  It goes against all of these.  Yeah, Tumblr would be gone.  I mean, Tumblr has kind of already had some trubs now that's with Yahoo.  But the point is, like all of these places exist because of those things and the way that we communicate with each other online using these different forms of media.  It's so it's it goes against not just these companies, but the users that are using these platforms.  And so this would be the thing that I could actually see being a segmentation like, oh, well, we know you're in the UK now,  so you can't send out any animated images while you're here because they all literally come from someplace somewhere.  And you're like, like everybody now has to hire a lawyer so they can make copyright fair use claims.  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.

The World Cup's going on.  A billion people are watching in real time and Ronaldo falls on his butt and it's hilarious.  Right. And so you want to go to Reddit immediately and find that that that Jeff.  Well, so that sort of immediacy could be completely killed because maybe eventually FIFA would say, OK,  it's fine to use that three second clip.  But someone as powerful as FIFA, theoretically, Facebook and Reddit and Twitter and everyone would have to go get permission first before they could even allow it on their platform.

But if we have to do it, we'll do it.  This just seems like a spanking for something that you didn't actually do or that doesn't really make sense.  Yeah.

I want to go to one other three legged race.  That's kind of interesting.  California is going to put into law state bill 327.  This is the Internet of Things security bill.  And the idea is that it's going to force IOT makers to put in basic security measures.  We know that it's the Wild West out there for IOT devices.  If the device uses a default password, the password has to be unique to each device.  That's kind of interesting.  Or it has to prompt users to set up their own password when they set it up for the first time.  Couple of different other security elements.  But again, you know, going back to the three legged race, the the the the paradigm for this is the California Air Resources Board passing the smog law, which forced car makers to reduce emissions.  And that really set in motion a nationwide and eventually improved global air quality standards because California started it.  And if you're going to sell to California, you might as well make all your products that way.  So, you know, I think this is just another good example of policy having an impact.  We don't have to talk about that one.  There's a couple other things.  This is kind of my take it or leave it section where you guys can decide if you want to talk about this or not.

And so I told her to watch this event.  I'm pushing the pixel because even though there's not a lot of small Android phones out there, I feel like if she could get the smaller, cheaper pixel that might satisfy her need for a pocketable small phone.  All right.

And I've seen some people being sad about inbox going away.  I understand.  Like you get used to using something each day and particularly when it's different.  It's not as if you can just hop into something new and it does the exact same thing for you.  These are typically designed in a different way and are interesting and you get used to them.  And then it's like, oh, I just have to go back to the default mail app.  What am I going to do?  So I feel your pain if you're losing inbox and hopefully the way the Gmail is designed now works for you.  But in any case, I'm pouring one out with you.  So sorry inbox.

Transcript:  Yep.  There you go.  Ikea has decided to get into the gaming market.  They want to create a chair for you to game in.  And the way they're going to make it special is they're going to 3D scan your butt and then they're going to make you a chair that is perfectly contoured to the top.  Contoured to every dimple and every shape distortion of your tush.  Is this the sign that the apocalypse is upon us?  No, not at all.  This is fantastic.

Transcript:  I think this is such a great idea.  People sit in chairs all day, every day.  They sit on stools.  They sit.  I mean, there's so many uncomfortable chairs out there.  This one is personally designed for me and I'm going to feel comfortable in it.  There's so many issues with folks who don't know sort of posture, the necessary posture for sitting in a desk and where their arms should be, where the screen should be.  If we can provide some form of relief by providing this perfectly shaped, perfectly contoured stool on which to sit, I think it's fantastic.  So I think this is the opposite of the apocalypse.  This is like as we improve in these new technologies that we're using like 3D printing, we can make things more custom for individuals and more personalized.  And so then they're less likely to get thrown away.  They're less likely to not be something that we want.  They're less like they're this was literally made for me and for my tuchus.  And it is the modern sitting on a on a scanner in the office and having your butt.

But if it felt your butt, I'll be great.  Man, this is a great idea.  I can't wait to get my butt seat customized and made for me.
