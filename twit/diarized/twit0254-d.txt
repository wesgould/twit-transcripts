This Week in Tech, our 254th episode in the continuing saga, trying to understand what's going on in the world of tech.  And I'm so glad one of the original Twitters is here.  Oh, that doesn't sound right.  One of the original people who tweeted, no, that doesn't sound right.  Oh, that doesn't sound right.  Kevin Rose, my old friend is here.  Hi, Kevin.  Thanks for having me.  Good to see you.  We've got some big announcements from Kevin today.  Semi-big.  One really big, one huge, and then one we don't know because you won't tell me.  That's right.  Also with us, oh, Dr. Stone is in the house.  Dig Four was my idea, even though you're wearing a shirt.  You like my shirt?  That's amazing.  Thanks to T-Shirts Plus for sending me that.  It says, Dig Four was my idea, because it was, Kevin, but I'll explain that later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hopefully it's everything you dreamed of on the radio.  Hopefully it's everything you dreamed of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm thinking it is, but we'll see.  We're going to take a look at, that's news story one.  We're going to get a look at the brand new Dig Four, and Kevin's very kindly offered  to do this for the first time.  Did I go in here first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In public.  I suggest people get logged in now while we're going through.  Yeah, I was going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you can start with us.  So the little announcement is we're opening it up just for the first time, just to the  Twitter audience right now.  So if you go to new.dig.com and then click on Request and Invite, once you do that, please  put in your Dig username and password and it'll let you right in.  And you are in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Request and Invitation, okay.  Oh, that's it.  You don't need to do anything special.  Nothing special.  And that lasts until 4.30 today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Until 4.30, yeah.  4.30 Pacific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's only for people who are watching live right at this moment.  Yep.  So I just always have to.  Tell a friend to come to the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh man, this is so exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me take it off here before I enter my password.  Wait a minute, enter my email address.  Oh, I see.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So click.  I don't need a password.  You should put Request and Invite and then.  Oh, log in now.  Oh, good, good, good, good, good.  There we go.  It might not let you in until you actually.  You have to request an invite first.  It let me in.  It let you in, sweet.  I think.  Is this new?  Is this the new one?  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's part of the onboarding now.  So tell me about the process.  What is Dig 4 all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So essentially, you know, hold on one second.  Let me just log in.  Get this done.  You know, and coming back into Dig, to give people a little bit of background, you know,  I started the company five years ago, but really kind of stepped out and let other people  run the show for a while.  And so I was busy.  You were doing other stuff.  I was doing angel investing stuff and just, you know, I don't think we know that you really  weren't part of Dig.  I mean, I was there a couple of days a week, but outside of that, I was busy just working  on other projects, helping out other entrepreneurs.  And you know, I sat down with Mark Andreessen a while ago.  He's one of our board members and investors and talked to him about some of the frustrations  I had with not being able to scale Dig.  And we had problems for years on scaling Dig.  Like we couldn't roll out any new features.  Finally, the new Dig, you'll see it's a lot faster because it's all based on Cassandra  backend.  We got to a point where we could actually develop new features again.  So I was like, well, this is great.  I can actually see some of these features that I've wanted for a long time.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you weren't satisfied with where Dig was.  You just couldn't change it because the technology wasn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We haven't rolled out anything new in the last two years.  Two, two and a half years, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Since the Dig Labs stuff that you did, the Flash stuff, that was cool.  Dig V3, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  About two or three months after that is when things started falling over just from the  traffic.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was that, was it a hockey stick of traffic?  I mean, was there a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dig still is, you know, 27-ish million people a month come to the site.  Uniques.  Uniques a month.  And so it's like, to scale that kind of traffic, it requires a special type of engineer and  backend.  And we're a very right intensive app with all the digs, obviously.  So finally, we're on a new backend.  And so when I came back into the company here a few, a couple months ago, you know, my whole  thing was let's pair this down to just, you know, three to five awesome features that  we've been wanting to do for a long time and get the release out there.  Just do something really simple.  And so what you're going to see is basically, you know, us fixing a lot of the problems.  So it's super fast.  When you dig something, your friends and followers actually see it.  Like, that was a big thing for a long time.  People would come in, they dig stories, but no one would actually see those digs.  So the new default view is what's called My News.  And My News is essentially a way for you to see what you're seeing right here is all stories  that have been touched by my friends.  So this first story here has been dug by my friend Daniel Burka.  That's why it says D. Burka right there.  The story underneath here has two friends that have dug it.  So you'll see little number two there.  And as my friends dig stuff, it just appears right here in this feed for them.  And if they dig it, it goes up to their followers.  So it's a really efficient way of spreading links, link sharing essentially, on the dig platform.  And then if you look in the upper right hand corner here, you'll see this is the hottest  news as determined by my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that is the biggest and I think that's why I'm wearing this t-shirt, the most important  change you've made.  Because the thing to me about dig that always made a little less useful is it wasn't people  I cared about.  It was everybody.  It was the universe that that's what determined whether a story was dug.  What I really would like to do is use a Twitter style situation where I get to choose who  I care about and let them curate my news for me.  That's what's so powerful about Twitter.  Right.  Exactly.  So this is the model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that what you're doing now?  Absolutely.  to see is something just like this.  You'll see a bunch of suggested users to you.  You're on here.  There's little report right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can follow Leo.  I'm following you.  I'm following Engadget of course.  Huffington Post.  You know what?  These are good suggested users.  Time, Trent Reznor.  These are some of your friends too, which is cool.  Some friends on there.  Lifehacker of course.  The Oatmeal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Oatmeal is a hilarious comic.  You got to check it out.  I'll follow it.  It's pretty awesome.  Cracked, I love, Mashable I love.  And then you can go on the left hand side here.  You can see all the different categories.  So if you just want to follow business sources, you can click on business over here.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you have effectively like Twitter lists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it'll allow you to filter them and find the sources that you want to follow.  But the cool thing is as a publisher, so like for example with your profile Leo, I think  what we did, let me go to, oh, we've changed, we now have vanity URLs too.  So your username is dig.com slash your name.  Oh, in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.  An error occurred.  It's 79.7% likely this is Aaron's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that Aaron's fault?  Aaron messed up.  That's when I went to my site.  You know what?  Did we break it?  No, no, it's up.  I'm on your profile now.  Okay, there it is.  Okay.  So check out your profile.  Oh look, these are all their shows.  So what we're doing now is that publishers for the longest time have said like we have  all this great content, but we have to go and manually submit all of these stories.  So you can link up your RSS feeds for it and claim your feeds that you own.  And so we've linked up here your Google Buzzfeed and your twit.tv feed.  And so every time a podcast comes out, it automatically submits it to dig with a single  dig.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  So no more submission and it'll go out to all of your followers instantly.  And then they dig it, it goes out to their friends and so on.  So just a lot of stuff that we should have done a couple years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you add comments like you could before?  Yeah.  When I dig something, it's the same process of digging something, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Same process.  It's a lot faster.  I mean, you'll notice when you dig something, it just instantly shows up.  This is so slick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, will all the dig bookmarks and all the other stuff, the widgets all still work the  same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, they're going to once we port over the API, which is what we're still, that's why  we haven't Sunset at V3 yet is we're still working on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should tell everybody you're getting special access right now.  This is early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If there's bugs, there's going to be bugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now after an hour and a half, are they not going to be able to get in here anymore?  Or is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, just for the hour and a half, just because we're trying to keep it.  From going crazy.  Yeah.  We still need to test out some stuff, but we'll open this up probably about, I'd say  another month or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What takes so long on stuff like this?  Where's the effort?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the backend is all Cassandra, which is one of those no SQL solutions, you  know, and we've got a few of the core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a database, but it's not seek, not my SQL.  And it's flat.  Is it flat file?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that?  No, it's not flat.  It's this weird.  You guys still do queries and all this stuff.  Yeah.  It's just a different way of storing data.  And we have it now in multiple multi data centers.  Like we have a East Coast and West Coast that we're serving out of.  And so there's a lot of, there's a lot of really weird little bugs that we're just trying  to work out.  Right.  So it's a, it's a complete refactor.  And we have to port all of our old data over.  So that's, that's a lot of work as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I should say when you say you guys, we have some other people in studio.  I dragged over here from, from food camp.  Let me see if I can figure out where their camera is.  There you go.  Tim Shea is here.  He's from next new networks.com, which is a great kind of twit like network really of  a aggregated, how many shows you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's like 81 channels now or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Huge next new networks.com and sitting to his left is the evil genius from a developer  at Boeing Boeing, Dean Putney.  Hey Dean.  Good to see you.  He's a junior at CMU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just finished my junior year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rising senior.  And also was at, where else were you at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Institute for the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cool.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you a maker or you're a web guy?  I'm a web guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So do you, do you, when Kevin says Cassandra and what a pain uses ring of bells?  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm familiar with that stuff.  I did a project at Carnegie Mellon using Mongo.  So sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So these are, are these servers or are they, they're databases?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the database system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, we did a thing on Mongo and Floss Weekly.  That's another NoSQL, NoSQL.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's a few competing projects right now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, there was even a session of Foo on NoSQL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  It's a hot topic now for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why?  What's wrong with MySQL?  Oh, it's not really, there are things wrong with it so much.  I'm in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm good.  I'm chilling with the people in the streets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought you were sleeping, dude.  I'm with the people in the streets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think he likes that chair a little too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys talk all nerdy for five minutes and I come back in on some regular stuff.  I'm trying to dig stuff right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, are you on dig?  Are you on dig.com?  Dig for?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dig in it?  Dig me.  File O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are O-H-D-O-C-T-A-H.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm alive.  Don't worry about it.  So why do they hate, why do they hate MySQL so much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think a lot of it has to do with relationships in the database and how you connect different  types of data to each other.  So I mean, example here, digs and users.  So I imagine that it makes it really easy for you to get all the digs for a particular  user in the NoSQL database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a lot of joins with MySQL and that's really heavy on the database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in the NoSQL system, you can just collect, does Cassandra use embedded documents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do not know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, I imagine it does.  There are much people, people smarter than me working on these problems.  Aaron knows that one.  Aaron actually does know that one.  Aaron and Chris.  In Mongo, when you get a user, all of the digs would come with it basically.  So it would be very easy to access that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was kind of the problem that Twitter had when it was trying to scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually Twitter engineers are working very closely with dig engineers on this because  they also have a cluster of Cassandra servers that they're working on as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You told me this and I thought this was really cool that there's this collaborative thing  going on.  You said this, the Twitter guys will come over to you and our guys and Facebook guys  and everybody's talking about, well, how do you solve this?  How do you do that?  How do you scale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's all open source too.  It's an Apache project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's so awesome.  It's interesting that there's this collaboration going on among erstwhile competitors in Silicon  Valley.  Everybody's helping each other out.  Yeah.  That's really cool.  It's pretty awesome.  Yeah.  It's really amazing.  So let's see more of a dig for Kevin Rose showing us for the first time ever.  If you want to, if you just joined us and you want to take a look just from now till  the end of the show, beta.dig.com.  Is that new?  New.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  New.dig.com.  And then click on request an invite, put in your dig username and password and we'll let  you write in.  All right.  So yeah, so basically we're also doing things like if you leave a comment, your friends  instantly see it.  So there's no more having to go into a story.  So this could be Twitter, right?  It's basically the thing about Twitter.  The funny thing is that people, I've been asked by the press a couple of times, like  how does this compare to Twitter?  How does it compare to Facebook?  And the way that I look at it is that, you know, on Facebook, when you like something,  when you click the like button, like it goes into that algorithm that they have and they  look at all your different touch points with all the different users that you know, and  then they determine like, does it have enough power to put it at the top of your newsfeed?  Right?  So there's no guarantee that your friends are actually going to see it.  Twitter obviously opposite of that, completely open, extremely easy to follow tastemakers.  You get a little bit of everything, including the stuff that you don't want.  So like you can follow Tony Hawk, but you're also going to get the fact that, you know,  Tony Hawk tweets about dropping his kids off at the park when all you really want are videos,  his links, right?  I want his damn links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you're absolutely right.  In fact, this turning out, that's what's valuable about Twitter, at least for a certain, I guess  you're right.  Sometimes I want to know what he's doing.  Right.  Exactly.  But mostly what I really want is the links.  So this is cool because you can map it to your Twitter graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can.  And so this basically just allows you to be a tastemaker of news.  And so we're always about the links.  We just want to make it as efficient as possible for you to dig and syndicate and spread content  to the people you care about.  So you can go and you can follow your friends.  You can follow the tastemakers.  You can follow the sources that you like.  And then all of that, you know, will come directly into your my news.  There's got Nate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody wants to compare everything to Twitter.  I mean, really, I ask what how is this better than Reddit right now or something like that?  A service that's trying to go after your throat.  Like that's who I care about.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What the difference is.  That's the most direct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter and Facebook is like a smokescreen of a question because really it's not the  same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just very different than Reddit, don't you think, Dr. Definitely, especially right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  now, the way this is.  I really like the way this is set up right now.  I think this is going to be so much more useful thing for me is the RSS feed out to because  I'm one of the guys.  You know, I do my own show, so I may at least be the first submitting person all the time.  So I always feel like it's cheating, but you got to do it because it gets the ball rolling  and it's just habit.  But now I don't have to worry about that anymore.  So that makes me happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Top news from people I follow.  New iPhone arrives.  This drummer's at the wrong gig.  The iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's the funniest video ever.  Have you seen that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right now.  See, this is going to be awesome.  I'm so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So now if you dig that story, it instantly goes out to all of your followers and look  at the top of their My News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So stuff can go viral so fast.  Yeah.  That's pretty powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got to watch that drummer video.  It is epic.  The guy looks like you've seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This drummer is at the wrong gig.  I'm so into it too.  Yeah.  You got to fast forward to like, I'd say a third of the way in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is at like some county fair, right?  And these guys are just like, cover band.  He's the only one I've ever met.  Yeah.  All of a sudden they realize how awesome he is and then they just start like zooming in  on him once he starts going crazy.  He's like too good?  Yeah, he's just way too good.  I like his...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  His arm work.  Hold on.  I'm not going to fast forward a tiny bit.  He's just kind of going chill right now.  Oh, here he goes.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little choppy.  You got to watch this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's choppy on mine because you've got the good computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's going Chris Parley.  Look at that.  Much more interesting than the band.  The camera guy is like, look at this.  And he keeps rolling the sticks down his sleeves and catching them and twirling them and everything.  Did you see the next song after this they play?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  The lead singer comes behind and starts grabbing the sticks with him and drumming with him.  So they totally know he's like a star.  They jump in with him.  It is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has like 4 million views, that video.  It does.  It has 4.7 million views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, every time I do this, I get a...  Tim, you can just slide that lens just a little bit to the left.  I don't know if Kevin moved or the camera moved.  Nice.  This is what a professional operation we have here.  The guests become the camera operators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm on sandwich duty in 25 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  Oh yeah, you've got to get sandwiches for the gang.  I'm on sandwich duty.  So this is cool.  So I never would have seen that video.  But that's not so different from other sources.  The key is that you're going to give me stuff that's super relevant now because I'm following  people that I care about and not people I don't care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was a problem for us.  I think that when you look at the dig front page, you get people like my mom that would  come to the site and say like, this site isn't for me.  Because it was a combination of political news, cats jumping off of diving boards, like  all this random stuff.  In this case, she goes in, she follows Oprah, she follows a few of the other accounts that  she really cares about and it's custom news for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the future of, in my opinion, this is the future of all of this stuff.  It's curation by your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that what we're working on next and some of the bigger stuff, I think this is  a lot of the low hanging fruit stuff that we want to do for a long time.  The bigger stuff though is how we can figure out user reputation.  So that when you dig stuff, you're building a reputation for yourself around different  topics.  So kind of a Quora style.  When you go in and you try to build a reputation around different subjects, we want to find  the same type of users.  Who are the tastemakers in Audi cars or tea or different topics and how can we build a  reputation around that?  So that's going to be releases later, but that's kind of the bigger picture stuff that  we're working on after we get this launch out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when people like you dig something, like 23 people can go write a blog post about it  because you found it credible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well and how many people dig after you?  So if you dig something and it blows up, then you've just earned a little bit of credit  as a tastemaker under that particular topic.  Because you were really one of the first influencers to find that piece of content.  Exactly.  I always try to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm never the first.  Never.  I'm a follower, not a leader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good to piggyback Uncle Leo.  I do.  I'm just hoping you push on my content and you make me look better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  But that's the neat thing is it's okay, right?  You don't mind if I retweet you or I dig you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially when it's your friend because I'm going to follow you and the things that  you find credible, I find credible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin Rose is here.  Owen Stone is here also joining us.  Dean Putney from Carnegie Mellon University.  He's a developer at Boing Boing and I dragged him here from FooCamp.  Actually Tim Shea did.  He's with the next new networks.  We're going to take a little break.  Come back with more.  Kevin Rose has two more big announcements.  Oh boy.  One you're not anxious to do, I know.  And one that you're excited about but it's a rumor that's kind of a mind boggling rumor.  You haven't heard it yet.  You don't know what I'm talking about or do you?  I kind of know what you're talking about.  We'll see.  I might.  I might know what you're talking about.  Does this have to do with the Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe.  You know, there were like all these Google people.  Did they say, did you ask them?  They didn't say a bloody thing.  Did you ask them?  Did you even intimate?  Well I didn't because I didn't know about it until I got here.  So I didn't.  Did you?  Did either of you guys know about this new Google thing?  No?  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're looking blank at me.  Yeah, we're completely oblivious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh good.  This is good.  Yeah, see this is one problem being at FooCamp.  You're completely out of touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You kind of always feel like there's something else going on in the next room that's even  better than what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the problem with Foo.  Like you're sitting there like, is this the best talk that I should be in right now?  Oh, it's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just because you just feel stupid all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's just the smartest people in the world are there.  I wanted to talk to Tim.  Every time I went close to Tim, he'd turn away and talk to somebody else because I think  he knew that I was coming.  I was like, I was going like this.  It was very intense because I want to talk him into letting us broadcast it.  And I know that's antithetical to what FooCamp is, but they should.  We should start LeoCamp.  And just broadcast it.  Why not?  Because I think it's cool to get through these great minds together.  It's uncool to hide the output.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, I mean, just don't do it at the same time.  Obviously don't compete, but we could do a really fun...  Oh, I wouldn't compete with...  I think camping is a great idea though.  Camping is awesome.  I did a tent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even though I'm half an hour away, I did a tent.  Wasn't it cool?  Yeah, it's really cool.  A couple of problems.  First of all, I have a four-man tent.  So there's everybody's in one-man tents except me.  I have like a skyscraper.  I have a porch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, Uncle Leo has to have a car.  That's the party tent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a massive freaking tent.  It was very embarrassing.  And then second of all, it's next to Scoble, who by the way is in a one-man Google tent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he's going to be talking all night long.  Oh, he didn't go to bed at like four or five.  And then he talks in his sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he snores and he talks and it's like, oh God.  You need an isolated tent.  So what I did is I just got up at 730.  I made a lot of noise taking my tent down.  Did you take a shower there?  Yeah, that was a little strange.  It's kind of communal, right?  I didn't take a shower yesterday and I really had to take one today.  Fortunately, I have this nice white dig was my idea shirt.  Hey, very quickly, I'd love to talk a little bit about our friends at Squarespace.  I know you know them very well, Kevin Rose, because that's your blog.  And do you know Anthony and Dane?  I do.  Yeah, I figured you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anthony is a brilliant guy.  He's so smart.  It's insane.  I just, all smart guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what they're doing is great.  Squarespace is the place to where exceptional websites begin.  We're starting to put some of our stuff on there.  We've got the Inside Twit blog there and I'm going to move the Tech Guy blog over to Squarespace  because it's just so easy to set up a great looking site with a couple of clicks of the  mouse and then, but then you get complete customization control to the point where you  can drag and drop widths of everything.  I mean, it's just incredible.  You've got great stats.  The iPhone app is killer.  It's just got all the features you're looking for.  It is Hosting Plus, Hosting Plus the software.  And by the way, it's easy to import your WordPress, your blog or your movable type or your type  pad blog right in and they're big believers in round tripping.  So you're never stuck.  You can export it right out too if you decide you want to go somewhere else.  You're never stuck.  Built-in search engine optimization, permission access handling means you can have multiple  editors and it's in the cloud and they're using a virtual server technology that allows  them to add, it's kind of, the state of the art allows them to add bandwidth as needed  so your site does not ever go down.  So if you get dug in the new dig for you.  I can attest to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've had my site on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get dug all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've had a couple of homepage stores and they've been able to handle them.  No problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I want you to take a look at it.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  If you go there right now, you could try it free for 15 days and if you'd like 10% off  for the life of your new site, all you have to do is use the word twit at checkout.  T-W-I-T, squarespace.com slash twit.  So Kevin, I'm going to give you some time and space to compose yourself and bring us  the news.  What's the news, Kevin Rose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I wasn't going to talk about this actually and then I realized it's being picked up on  a bunch of different blogs and sites out there.  So it's like it's too late to keep it because I got a request to take down the tweet that  I tweeted about it and I took down the tweet and now...  So you tweeted it.  I tweeted it last night.  I had a couple glasses of wine.  So first of all, let's say this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You had a great party last night, which I couldn't come to.  Friday night.  Revision 3's fifth year anniversary.  Five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Crazy.  Isn't that great?  It's nuts.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Congratulations on that.  I'm bummed you couldn't make it.  There was comedy.  There was magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was drama.  Yeah.  Great band.  My girlfriend's, my boyfriend's band or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did a killer Michael Jackson cover like their third set and it was awesome.  Who, the Dizzy Balloons?  Yeah.  Did you like them?  Yeah.  Michael Jackson song and they covered it and it was an awesome band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought they were really good.  I asked her if they're signed.  She said, well, they're on iTunes.  That's what signed is now.  Her generation, no idea what that means.  Yeah, they're on iTunes.  What do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have a record, yeah.  They're making money.  They're signed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what that means.  Someone's by their money.  By their album.  So it went well.  You had a special dignation with Alex and you did a lot of great things and then you  got drunk and tweeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that was actually last night that I had wine and tweeted.  Last night.  Because you were sad.  The day after that.  Yeah, but so essentially what happened is I got leaked a rumor from a pretty credible  source I believe.  Oh, you're going to talk about the other thing.  Oh, you want to talk about the other thing.  The Google thing.  Yeah.  Do the Google thing.  Okay, so essentially.  You had to take that tweet down?  Yeah, I had to take the tweet down.  Who?  Who?  Who called you?  Let's just say.  Eric Schmidt says, hello Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have been tweeting again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We follow your Twitter account.  So yeah, basically the rumor was that Google is launching a Facebook competitor soon.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so happy.  And then it's going to be called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not our could.  It's going to be called Google Me.  Google Me.  I like it.  That's a good name.  And this is a very credible source.  So we'll see.  Facebook competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dean's going hmm.  You're surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it sounds interesting.  Sounds great.  Especially after the buzz thing with trying to take over Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and there's an opportunity here because I think I'm not the only one who's a little  bit skittish and fed up about Facebook, but I do trust Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google had its own little privacy problem too with their buzz.  So I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem I have with Google is the usability thing.  Their products outside of Gmail, I can't point to really one product where I'm just like,  wow, this is a killer user experience.  I thought I'd go to Orkut, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because that was their Facebook.  Right.  It's not usable.  It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has no feeling behind it whatsoever.  Everything is like it's like Google made for a machine.  I am on Orkut and so are my friends.  I'm soft and cuddly.  Please tell me how are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you up to today?  You can make me different colors.  And however, here's why Google does not scare me on their business model as an alignment  with my interests as opposed to Facebook.  So Facebook's business, in my opinion, Facebook's business model is all about the more they  can reveal about me, the more the better.  Right.  Google's business model is the more you use the web, the more we make.  So in my opinion, Google's model is speed up the web, make the web more usable, make  the web better, make it friendlier, give us great tools, give us YouTube, all this stuff,  because the more we use it, the more they make.  Right.  I respect that answer.  Does that make sense?  Yes.  Whereas Facebook, that's not Facebook's deal is make everything Facebook.  The like button is about drawing you into Facebook.  It's not about promoting the web.  It's about drawing you into Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in 10 years, you're going to be the first person lined up to get Google socks and Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  deodorant because they're going to take well, if they take over the world, then we'll talk  I'm not saying I love them forever.  I'm not marrying them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're just slowly infiltrating every orifice of your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'd like to see some competition, but I think that one of the reasons you can't  leave Facebook right now, one of the reasons it was painful for me to leave Facebook is  because I'm disconnecting and there's nowhere else I can send.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what happened.  Well, you had Myspace and then Facebook came and you could leave Myspace.  You could leave Myspace.  So there's nowhere for us to leave to.  So you have a very valid point there.  But again, it has to look good.  It has to feel good for me to use it.  For the regular person to use it.  I don't care that Google did it.  It doesn't matter.  I mean, we're in here.  I'm not a nerd.  You guys are smarter than me.  But for you guys, maybe you'll try.  But for the masses, Google has to finally break down and say, I need a supermodel.  I need somebody that looks good and feels good.  And I want to take home to my mom and impress everybody.  Can they do that, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's hard for people to make the jump at this point because the news feed is very addicting.  You go there every day to see what your friends are up to.  All your friends are already there.  Your family's there.  I mean, I have aunts and uncles and brothers.  How am I going to get my aunt to change to Google Me?  It's like she's not going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give yourself a little bit more power than that, Mr. I tweet stuff and shit up the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, here's the deal.  Do I want to call my aunt up and teach her how to make the change?  And the answer is no.  Especially if Google doesn't make it appealing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because then it's even harder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's even more hard for you.  I'm not going to use it unless it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does Google have to do to make Google Me compete with Facebook?  I'm not saying beat Facebook.  I'm saying be competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In my mind, it's going to have to be like a Bing-like experience in that it has to be  beautiful.  It has to have some features and functionality that are above and beyond what Facebook can  do.  It can't just be a clone.  I think that so many clones fail just because they're copying feature for feature.  There's been thousands of dig clones over the years.  The ones that scare me the most are the ones that aren't copying us but actually innovating  in different ways.  Right?  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Reddit doesn't scare you as much as somebody who's doing something different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Exactly.  Like a different take on what you're doing.  So, you know, I'm curious to see what it is, but it's sad they lost their...  Who was it?  Doug Bowman that was their main creative director for a long time.  He went to Facebook.  He went to Twitter.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Twitter.  Yeah.  And so he is brilliant.  That guy was one of the best designers.  And he just got fed up because he said they wanted to test 54 shades of blue with an algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A very famous blog post about why design sucks at Google.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so I just don't have the faith.  I mean...  Google Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  Amazing.  Google Buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  Double amazing.  I like Buzz.  You don't like Buzz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like Buzz.  I'm a buzzer.  I'm the only one.  I'm their post-a-bore.  I mean, there's only a few of you.  That's what I'm talking about.  You need something for regular people.  And Google just doesn't get that.  They have the smartest people.  If you go to a Google office, you'll be amazed at the creativity and the beautifiosity of  everything that they do and the colors and the toys.  But if you go look at their products, it's like, look, dude, like a three-year-old coder  could have made something that looked better than this.  And they just don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have a three-year-old too.  You should get her to do designs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google hire me and my daughter.  We'll make everything beautiful, Ossity, and hire me.  I'll do that.  I'll sit in this chair and make stuff look good like I do for myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I could say right now.  I really did disconnect myself from my family and not my close friends.  My close friends, of course, are my friends.  I talk to them.  I have a relationship with them.  It's the second-tier friends.  It's like my first girlfriend in high school.  There's no way she can poke me anymore, right?  Which is not so bad.  But Cathy, I love you, but stop poking me.  But it's those second-tier friends that you wouldn't have been in touch with without Facebook.  And Facebook gives you a way to loosely engage with them.  You don't have to email them or call them.  You just kind of know what they're doing.  You see their pictures and stuff.  You see their random birthdays, things like that.  And so you feel like you're connected.  And that was the only pain of withdrawing from Facebook for me.  It wasn't a business issue because we have a lot of presence on the web.  We don't need Facebook for that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you still have a fan page though?  Do you have a Twitter fan page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I killed them all because it was tied to my account.  So if I kill my account, it's all gone.  It's all gone.  That's okay.  For my business, I don't think our audience, it's like being on AOL.  I don't think they care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only thing I have, I mean, did you consider just stop using them?  Like leave them be.  I did.  But don't use them because that way in case they ever correct their ways down the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had this conversation and apologize to those who've heard this before, but I had this conversation  with myself.  Can I just stay here?  I know how to use Facebook.  Can I just stay here?  I know how to be private on Facebook.  They're not invading my ability.  I know what I'm doing.  But by being there, it's coercing other people, including family and friends to be part of  Facebook.  I'm not the problem if I'm on it.  Your kids still?  Yeah.  They're still on it.  That was when it really hit me.  It's like I try to explain to them why it's dangerous.  I said, don't put anything on Facebook that you wouldn't put, that you don't want family,  friends, future employers to see, teachers.  Future employers is the big one.  Yeah.  And they didn't get that.  They said, no, it's private.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And I said, nah, yeah, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the thing about the internet.  Once you step foot on the internet, privacy is not the problem or the issue.  It's about control because you should, anything you put on there, you notice somebody has  access to.  I was talking about earlier using better.  It's all about control.  Someone can get a hold of your information at any moment.  As soon as you go on the internet, you're putting yourself out there to be exposed.  So watch what you do.  Your mother told you that when you were two years old.  Wear clean underwear in case you get hit by a bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty straightforward, isn't it?  But kids don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they don't.  They get a cell phone in there, take a picture of themselves, a party, he's drunk, and then  leave it up there.  And then somebody searches it on Google Me 20 years later and it still pops up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're still in college, Dean.  Yeah, that's right.  Everybody's in Facebook.  Yeah.  CMU, I mean, these are a bunch of geeks.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Still on Facebook.  Well, yeah, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no, is there any backlash at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there are a lot of people who are unhappy about things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they don't leave.  Well, you know why?  Because Facebook is how you score, isn't it?  It's how you meet girls.  I think really seriously, that's the real point of Facebook for college-age kids anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There have been so many situations where all you need is my name anymore.  Right.  It's literally my address book on the internet.  And that's fantastic.  You meet somebody at a party, you catch half a name.  Say I'm on Facebook.  Yeah, or even like, you see a cute girl and you don't really know what's going on.  Just stalk her later.  Yeah, but you know her friends or something.  By the way, this is exactly why Mark Zuckerberg designed Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know that, you're friends with Mark.  That's exactly what the point was.  Well, it started at the colleges.  How to meet girls.  Yeah.  It was a big college thing.  How to follow, or how girls can meet guys.  What's wrong?  What's wrong with it?  If Google did a credible alternative, you wouldn't go there because they wouldn't all  be there.  It's got to be where everybody is, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a tipping point that has to happen.  That's going to be pretty difficult.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if they make something that looks good, people will try it.  And that's the biggest thing.  Like Google Buzz, I couldn't get away from it the first week.  After a week, it just died out.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dan Shapiro is here.  He said, here's his claim to fame.  I beat him at werewolf.  Let's squeeze Dan in somewhere.  Owen, can you share that chair?  I can share that chair.  Share my chair.  Share the chair, baby.  You can have my chair.  Hey, Dan, have a seat.  Do you know Kevin Rose, Dan?  Hey, how's it going?  Kevin Rose.  Dan, the serial entrepreneur.  Also a four.  We're going to make Owen leave.  We're going to continue on.  Actually, while we're doing that, go ahead and get in there.  I want Kevin has one more announcement to make.  One more announcement from Kevin, and we're going to do that in a second, but first.  But first.  Owen's not gone.  He's just.  If you have anything to say, come stand behind me and say it.  Just come on.  Literally, just come on over.  Just listen and come in here, and he'll be in the chat room too.  I want to mention iStock Photo.  A great place.  If you're a blogger, you do content of any kind and you need images, look at a blog post  with text is not as good as a blog post with a picture.  It's just simple.  It's just simple.  But sometimes you don't have that right picture or don't steal the picture.  You can go to iStockPhoto.com slash.  Is it twit stock?  I think it is.  That's strange.  Slash twit stock and try out iStock Photo.  This is the original source for high quality stock images, and now it's media and design  elements to royalty free.  You pay them a simple fee and you get to use it forever.  Illustrations, vector images, videos.  This is cool for podcasters, music and sound effects.  We've got flash files, 3D renders and logos coming soon.  Get creative, say what you want to say.  I'm not a designer, but iStock Photo makes my blog look much better.  And images as low as a dollar.  As low as a dollar.  I want you to try it out.  You can give 15% off bundles of...  What you do is you buy credits that let you buy images or music or whatever.  If you're buying in your buy-man bundles, 15% if you buy bundles of 50 credits or more.  One 5% off if you buy 5-0 credits or more.  iStock Photo slash twit stock.  They've also got a Microsoft Office plugin which makes it much easier to embed stuff  in your presentations and your documents.  And coming soon, the iStock Photo iPhone app.  Not sure how you'd use that.  I'm going to tweet and have stock images in my tweet.  Here's the chick I met last night.  She's beautiful.  I don't know what I'd use that for.  iStockPhoto.com slash twit stock.  I did tweet a few images from a food camp including the Death Star made out of a watermelon.  That was truly awesome.  Wasn't that amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If anybody's doing an Ignite at a food camp or otherwise, there's no better way to fill  out your slide deck than iStock Photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you know about it.  Oh, you said all the time.  Oh, for decks.  I didn't even think of that.  You bet.  Fantastic.  And again, give me a lower third.  You want danshapiro.com or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Danshapiro.com.  That's easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Easy to remember.  So you missed our conversation on Dig 4, but I'm very excited about that.  You missed our conversation.  Maybe you have something to say before we move on to the next story about Kevin's scoop.  You say you have it on good authority.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Someone that is very closely connected to the project, yes.  So whether it'll see the light of day, I don't know when.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We know it's real because they made you take it down.  I took it down.  If it were fake, that tweet would still be up there.  You know that.  They made you take it down.  So he says it's a Facebook, Dan, it's a Facebook clone from Google called Google Me, a Facebook  competitor.  Oh, I haven't heard this yet.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that a story?  Is that juicy?  It's got to be better than Buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Man.  Hopefully.  Well, that's the trick, isn't it?  Why does everybody mention Buzz when Google says we're going to do something new?  At least it was Wave and now it's Buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not like they're getting any credit for Android.  Look at Android.  Yeah.  One of the things we were talking a lot about, I think, at Foo this weekend was this idea  of can things anticipate better your needs?  Some of the guys were there from Doppler that's now part of Nokia and we were talking about  how well Doppler did some of that.  Doppler's Nokia now?  I believe so, right?  When they purchased by Nokia.  I have no idea about that.  I assume so because Matt Biddlef isn't.  Maybe I'm completely wrong.  No, I think that sounds right.  I think that sounds right.  But what I loved about Doppler was when you got in the city it just said these are your  friends that are in this city and wouldn't you like to send them all an email message  right now?  And there's the beginnings of that in the new Froyo where I just installed it this weekend  and I saw that my emails now, there's a little avatar for my friend.  If my friend's also my friend on Twitter, it pulls in their avatar and when I click  on it I can see their latest tweet and I can move over to Twitter and retweet.  I'm starting to anticipate that I might want to respond in different ways than email.  I don't understand if that's really just a geeky thing with Android that we like that  or if that's the beginning of a way that if they had something like, what did you say  it was called?  Google me?  If they had something like that maybe that's an area where they could outperform Facebook  is if they just think about the way.  A lot of the things we were also talking about was that as you start to have more and more  friends and family do you need to have concentric circles of friendship?  And that gets really complicated the work of sort of you can do it on Facebook and you  can sort people into different lists and share different things but that's a lot of work  and things like phones or the social network you log in every day it should know enough  about just you respond to people at different times a day and there's some people that you  always respond to, some people you only respond to during business hours.  Can it be intelligent about that and anticipate your needs and help you sort people?  I'd love to see more features like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to see that applied to the inbox.  That's what I need.  I get too many emails and I want them sorted by importance and there's never any sort like  that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Social graph is so powerful.  It's so powerful and nobody's doing anything really, not nobody but there's a real opportunity  there.  Yeah, absolutely.  I know that's what Mark's all about.  I know that's what Facebook really wants to do.  That's why they have to expose your information because until they can use your social graph  they can't do all those exciting things that they want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They want to use all that public data to expose that in aggregate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People think it's about marketing and about marketing it's about what they can do with  this stuff and frankly what they can do for you, admittedly.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If somebody can figure out how I can take the hundreds of people out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dan, I'm going to have to ask you to talk right into that microphone.  It's a very sensitive microphone, a very insensitive microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If somebody can figure out how to help me take the hundreds of people who I'm loosely  connected to, Twitter, Facebook, probably thousands altogether and get the best of that conversation  So I'm not relying on the serendipity of a single person, you know, having to see this  or logging in at the right time and bring that brilliance to the front.  That's what I want.  That's what I crave because there's such great opportunities to connect with interesting  people.  How do you find the best of the best today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's almost like Dig Four.  You missed Dig Four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly what Dig Four is all about.  I think Dan, you'll be very impressed with Dig Four actually.  So Kevin has one more announcement.  We should say Kevin Rose is here from Dig.com, Dig Four and Dig Nation.  Dan Shapiro, who is, what do you call your investment banker, I guess, Dan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I call myself gainfully unemployed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, even better.  He's not working for a living.  Serial entrepreneur.  Is that OK?  Fair enough.  Is that fair?  Yes.  Is that fair?  So you're going to sit in that throne there.  He's in the throne.  The lucky one.  Yeah.  And you can say yes or no to all business ideas that come across the show today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fail.  Massive fail.  Dean Rodney, Putney is also here.  Rodney.  Dean Rodney.  Dean Putney is also here from Carnegie Mellon University.  He's a developer at Boing Boing and at Make.  And Mustard Hamsters is his Twitter.  What is Mustard Hamsters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a long story.  OK, I don't want to hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really don't want to hear it.  Yeah, but that'll get you everywhere.  Mustard Hamsters.  That's all you need.  Because you can Google that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody else has it.  I own the domain and it's Twitter, Gmail, AIM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just think about a hamster that's slathered with Gouldon's yellow mustard.  That's my favorite flavor of hamster.  And then you'll think of Dean.  Tim Shea is also here.  He's at Moth on Twitter and at nextnewnetworks.com.  And we've been talking about Dig Four and everything and Dignation and Dignation's fifth, Ray  Vision 3's fifth anniversary party on Friday night.  And when is your last Dignation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, that's something the chat room has been going off about.  I've been seeing it over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They knew exactly what you're going to talk about.  Yes.  It's been rumored for a while, but you have never confirmed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  So basically, I think that Alex and I got together several months ago and just decided  that it's been five years now.  And I think that we're just kind of tired of traveling and we're still going to continue  to do the show through the end of the year.  Oh, that's a long time.  Oh, good.  All right.  Through December, a bunch more live shows.  Good.  And then after that, we'll do live shows, but only live shows and probably like once  a quarter or something like that.  And I'm going to do another podcast.  So you're not leaving Dignation?  You're just going to go through the...  We're scaling back.  It's not going to be like a weekly show anymore.  Scaling back quite a bit.  But it's a lot of travel.  I mean, Alex lives in LA.  I'm in San Francisco.  It's a weekly show.  It's just, you know, we wouldn't want to do it over Skype or anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if anybody's never been to a live Dignation, it is incredible.  You have to go.  Crowd surfing was awesome.  That's the most fun I've ever had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That might be my number one favorite part of Dignation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was the most fun I have ever had.  I have to say it was so much fun.  And it was such an honor.  The look on your face is epic.  I was happy, wasn't I?  But also the other thing that made me happy is, I mean, and I was saying this like I'm  backstage and I'm going, this is a freaking podcast.  And there's twenty seven hundred people out there screaming crazy.  It's like a rock show and it's a podcast.  And so I find it really validating.  I mean, that's exciting that people get that excited about a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's exciting for all of us.  It shows that finally, you know, we can get more viewership on our podcasts on the Internet  than we ever could when we were doing cable television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We knew that when we were doing tech TV.  We knew that that power was there.  And yeah, it's really great.  So congratulations on great success with Dignation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And dude, how about you remember when we did the first show like you had this little tiny room.  You had us on the floor, I think.  Sitting on the floor upstairs.  And now you have the whole place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The whole building, ten employees.  I'm broke. That's OK.  It's OK. It's good.  So there is other news in the world this week.  I guess the biggest story of the week we're kind of ignoring was this little thing, the iPhone 4.  We're lucky.  What do you mean? You don't have one?  Get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know. You need to take my Apple fanboy card away.  You. You.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You didn't. So have you handled it?  I've touched it. I don't want to touch yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm still obsessed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anybody here? iPhone 4s?  I don't have one.  Don't have one. You're an Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm on the 3G.  3G.  I went to the keynote for that. That was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was fun. Yeah, yeah. Dan, you're an iPhone 4.  I'm the next to one guy.  See, OK, OK.  And as am I. I'm liking my Nexus One.  I really think the Android operating system is great.  In fact, that's what you were about to say, Tim, is how good Android is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I ordered an iPhone 4 and it's coming.  And all weekend, especially since I upgraded to the Froyo, I've been like, I'm going to miss.  There's a bunch of things I'm going to miss on here.  And I'm not sure I want to give it up.  Isn't that funny? I had the same thought.  There's this bifurcation starting to happen where we're still in love with the hardware.  And a lot of things about Apple iOS or whatever it's called.  iOS 4.  But you're just hoping they're learning from each other.  But just how I mean, I use Google Navigate to get here from, you know, to drive down here from.  Right. Turn by turn.  And it's free. It's free. It's amazing.  It's better than most dedicated GPS.  Yeah. And Google SkyMap.  There's all these things that are just really nice on here that, you know, they haven't made available on the Apple Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, you know, there's something you were touching on before, which was the notion of devices  responding to and being smarter about us for better or for worse.  These are this and the iPhone are both tri quarters.  But that one's off all the time.  There's no continual relay. There's no network.  You're not talking to the cloud.  This is the capability to be on all the time, which is both delightful and terrifying.  This can this can know where you are. This can know what you're doing.  This can report back for better or for worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that was one of the big stories this week was that I in the new iOS 4 terms of service,  all 45 pages, if you had the patience to read it on your iPhone, you would want two things you'd read.  One is that you could opt out of IADS, which is good news.  Simple click, I think was zero dot IADS dot com.  And you put a cookie on your browser, on your on your on your phone or your iPad and you wouldn't get IADS anymore.  But the bigger story was Apple said we will be tracking you.  Now, Android's been doing this for some time, but that it's in the terms of service that your data is being collected,  aggregated. It's not being sold to anybody except trusted third parties or something like that.  Trusted. Who trusts them? Who trusts them?  Who's trust the trustee? It's like the NSA. Yeah.  But, you know, I was talking a little bit about Facebook was I don't know if I can talk about this.  Facebook had a I can't probably at food camp.  They had an interesting technology that was designed.  It was a check in technology kind of. And I said, I don't want Facebook to know where I am.  And somebody said, do you have an Android in your pocket?  I said, yeah. Do you have an iPhone in your pocket? Yeah.  I said, well, some people know where you are.  So it's something we have to live with that we are.  This is a homing device. Daniel Suarez was at food camp who wrote my it was just my two favorite novels,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Demon and Freedom TM. I chatted with him and I had no idea who's the guy wrote Demon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll be darned. He's like just he's like my personal hero.  And one of the one of the central plot points of Demon is that.  You got this. You're being tracked everywhere you go.  So Daniel actually is very political and and those books are really political and they're about all of this stuff  written in science fiction, science fiction way.  So what do we think of the iPhone for any opinions, any thoughts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's beautiful. I played with some friends and I got it to do the antenna thing.  And that kind of bugged me a little bit. But then I also got my three G.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to do it as well. Well, that's the point is all cell phone.  OK, so let's talk about this real quickly.  It turns out that if you look at the iPhone, it has, first of all, kind of crazy to build a device  that you drop frequently and have it have glass on both sides.  So not only glass on the front glass in the back, they say it's Gorilla Glass is stronger than plastic.  B.S. I fixed it, dropped it and it shattered. Of course, it's glass.  Sorry, dudes. But so it's beautiful, though.  It's beautiful industrial design of glass on both sides and then a unibody aluminum  cast aluminum bar, you know, a stripe all the way around it.  The left hand side is I think the left hand side is a three G antenna.  The right hand side is the Wi-Fi antenna. So there's a reason for these bars.  At the bottom, there are two black plastic insulators that insulate those antennas  from the U shaped piece at the bottom. That's the cell phone antenna.  If you cup the iPhone, it's very easy to demonstrate this.  I'll show you, Kevin, right now. I've got five bars on my iPhone.  All I have to do is cup it in the in the left hand.  And I'm a lefty, so that's exactly how I would hold it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But do you actually hold it like that when you talk on the phone?  Yeah. Do you hold it that tight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, maybe not. I don't know.  If you look at the ads, you know, of course, somebody sent an email to Steve Jobs saying, dude,  and Steve's response, one line. Well, don't do it.  So you see that went from five bars to zero bars just that fast.  So it's it's it does. It's absolutely true. But you're right.  You can do it with a Palm Pre. You can do it with a three.  And so I'll see if I can find this article.  An RF engineer wrote a story. Did you read the story, Tim?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or either of you? Yeah, I did see that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. He wrote a story saying, look, I've designed cell towers for AT&T.  I know a little bit about RF. Here's the deal.  He said all cell phones have to have an antenna.  Their radios used to be you'd have the antenna, you'd pull it up.  Remember that Motorola realized nobody was pulling up the antenna on their Star Tech.  So they built an internal body antenna.  If you pull it up, you'd use the external.  But if you didn't, at least it would have something that have the body antenna.  And I remember holding those antennas.  And yes, you would absolutely attenuate the signal just like you do with this.  So he said all cell phones have the antenna in the body.  Here's another thing he said, he said, when the FCC tests a cell phone,  they're not required to test it with a hand, just with a head.  So they test the cell phones. I've seen this.  We went to remember with screensavers, we went to the FCC's testing lab  and they have a clamp with a robot on it and they have the phone and it's clamped.  There's no hand clamped to a robot head.  It's filled with goo that simulates human body goo.  And then they fire that they put a receptor in the goo and they see where the,  you know, the RF characteristics and so forth.  He said, since they don't test with a hand and all the manufacturers know this,  where do they put the antenna where your hand would be?  Because it's not being tested there.  And so he said, this is going to be a universal problem.  Every phone has somewhere you can hold it and attenuate it.  However, still bad news, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks bad in the fact that all these videos are leaking out there.  And then, you know, it's very easy, like you said, to duplicate the problem.  Anybody can do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got an experiment for a listener to try.  You know, those cheap little antenna boosting modules that they used to sell for old school cell phones.  So I worked at a startup that built a cell phone and I talked to the RF engineer and I said,  so these are Hocum, right?  And he said, no, no, no.  They do go through a lot of effort to go optimize the radiation,  all different directions for these cell phones.  And when you put one of those stickers on, you're hitting the random number generator.  May get something better, may get something worse.  So I put it out there.  I want somebody to grab a couple of these stickers, these cheap ones that you can find.  And, you know, they give away for free.  Stick them all over the iPhone 4.  Let's hear what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See where the best place to put a sticker is.  But see, that's part of the problem is you don't even want to put a case on this.  I think that the confirmation that Apple knew about this is that the Apple does,  for the first time, sell a case for the iPhone.  Guess what it is?  It's a piece of rubber that goes around the antenna.  It goes right where you would hold it.  That's the case.  It's called their bumper case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, apparently that pretty much eliminates the issue.  And it fixes it.  Yeah, it eliminates the antenna issue.  So.  Keeps your fingers away from it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So would it be cheaper to just give those away for free than do a recall?  They can't. They're not going to do a recall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is it the fact that it's just that the metal isn't coated with anything?  I mean, if they put a slight thin plastic coating on the outside, could they not solve this problem?  Yeah, maybe.  Or paint it or tape it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  Some people say it's because we're shorting the top antenna and the bottom one.  I'm not sure if it's that or just we're blocking it.  But I'm sure you could fix this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if you put a paperclip between those two and touch?  Should I try it?  Yes, try it.  Hack this thing.  Let's read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the dark tipper I know.  I love.  So.  It wouldn't be such a problem, except that AT&T has such a crappy reputation for dropped calls already.  Right.  And this is just going to play right into what people think about the iPhone.  Do you want to try it?  Yeah, let's see if we can.  I don't know if you've got to.  I have this clip you can try.  Penny would be better.  Yeah, copper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just a damp finger probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we know.  Yeah, but we want to test it with like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does anybody have a penny on them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, nobody has a penny or a gold chain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's a penny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, do I want to go on record as handing you my wedding ring for a science experiment?  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can use my wedding ring.  It's gold.  Oh, here we go.  Gold is the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if they just didn't charge $30 for the bumper?  What if they just didn't charge $30 for the bumper?  And not even give it away, just charge a reasonable price.  It's the thinnest case you can get.  And it still costs as much as the most expensive case you can get.  I mean, really, fix the problem.  Solve $10 for the thinnest piece of rubber available.  I mean, Apple is the best at saying, look, this is pretty.  You're going to pay for it no matter what, idiot.  Just make it cheaper.  If you don't fix the problem, I'll pay $10 or $5.  $30 for a rubber strip and I drop it in a glass still breaks.  They're crazy.  I still don't want the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, doctor.  Oh, doctor.  This is what I love Owen for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, totally.  He just comes in, gets pissed off and walks out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, Owen, you can use the room like too.  If you any time you want, just come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yeah, I got it down two bars with the with the gold ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, not with your finger, just a ring.  So it is shorting it then.  That's it.  Shorting a little bit.  That's what it is.  It does take a while.  It takes about a minute or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's down.  It's down to a couple of bars there.  Yeah, there you go.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's only because it has to go and say, are you there?  Are you there?  Are you there?  It's talking to the tower.  Right.  To figure out that, no, there's no tower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  We couldn't demonstrate this at food camp  because we didn't have any signal anyway on AT&T.  It's part of the fun of food.  It's interesting.  One of the things that surprised me,  and somebody was telling me, you've  been to previous foods, Kevin, that was pretty typical  at these events for everybody to have a laptop out  as they're listening to the event.  Is that the case?  Yeah.  I mean, people have had the laptop.  No laptops.  Really?  No laptops.  Why is that?  Barely even phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There were a couple iPads around,  but it was like really, everybody was just talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have never been in a conference.  And it wasn't like everybody colluded.  Just nobody brought in a laptop.  I didn't even bring one.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  I don't know what that heralds, if anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there are also a couple of talks about,  they're all about turning off technology and getting,  there was one about like,  Slow technology.  Yeah.  There was one called slow technology.  There's another one about the new affluence  being having leisure time.  And all kinds of, there's a real impulse  and I think it was from a lot of the people  that have been there a lot.  They were like the alumni's and they were all just,  they're all looking for a way to sort of disengage  from all the glut of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If anything, the people at an event like this,  we're talking about Bill O'Reilly.  Tim O'Reilly.  I don't want to go to the Bill O'Reilly food camp.  Bill O'Reilly, who, Tim O'Reilly.  I didn't sleep.  I literally did not sleep for three days.  So you'll excuse me.  Tim O'Reilly, who is the publisher at O'Reilly Media  for years published all these great computer books  with the animals on the cover.  And they do a number of big, big conferences.  Started about eight years ago, I think, to have these,  he called them friends of O'Reilly camp  where to bring about 200, 250 of,  not friends of his necessarily,  but really interesting thinkers together  in a variety of disciplines  in a kind of semi-private environment.  They all camp.  And it was the first unconference, I think.  Yeah.  So it was the first conference without planned agenda,  keynotes, without speeches,  but everybody who goes was kind of expected to participate  either by engaging in an event or by putting one on.  And there's people with Van de Graaff generators.  We toasted a marshmallow last night  with a Van de Graaff generator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tesla coil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that was a Tesla coil.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, nevermind.  More fun.  It was loud.  It smelled like the state of marshmallow, man.  I thought it was going to explode.  It also smelled odd.  Ozone.  Yeah, it was pretty ozoney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was amazing.  I learned something that I was not expecting to be educated  in this category,  but one of the talks I went to was Linda Stone,  former researcher,  used to be with Microsoft Research,  and she was doing a study on email apnea.  So I have mild sleep apnea,  and my doctor scared the tarnation out of me  when he showed me some of the numbers.  You stop breathing, right?  Sleep apnea is where you stop breathing.  I have a mild case.  Severe cases shorten the lifespan by five to 10 years or more.  That's not good.  It's tremendous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you stop breathing and you don't breathe,  you don't breathe,  and then suddenly with a gasp, you start breathing again.  Is that basically it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  And she discovered that people have the same behavior  while they're checking their email.  That people will actually-  Hold their breath.  Slow away.  Stop their breathing and hold their breath  while they're doing important emails.  It was finding stress levels going up,  cortisol and so on and so forth.  And this is amazing and terrifying at the same time.  So I guess she bugs at lindastone.net  and found some tools that you can actually  put a little clip on your ear  and have a little glowing orb in the corner of your screen.  And when your blood oxygen level or whatever it is starts to drop,  it turns red.  It will remind you to take a breath.  That's pathetic that we actually need to be told to breathe by technology.  She was talking about practicing breathing  and I'm thinking I've been practicing breathing for 34 years.  And if you weren't breathing, wouldn't you know it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess I've been doing it wrong.  This is the reason these things need to be taped and put online.  I would love to watch that talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that's my contention is it's great to do this kind of in private  because I guess people feel free to talk.  But this is like Ted.  I mean, these are many of them spoke at Ted.  This is like an amazing event and it's a shame.  I celebrate the fact that Ted decided to put everything online.  And that's a huge boon.  And I think O'Reilly should probably do the same thing.  Here's a picture of the Tesla coil making a s'more.  And that was taken with the iPhone.  And I have to say the camera on the new iPhone 4 is unbelievable.  It is as good as a 5 megapixel point and shoot.  Are you happy with the video?  Dops the Nexus One.  And the Nexus One is very good.  I'm not knocking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hardware is great.  The software is terrible.  It takes tremendous video, but it usually mis-exposes the still photos.  So I come out of my most recent company was OnTela, then Photo Bucket.  So you know a little bit about this.  Way too much with camera phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I thought the Nexus One was pretty good.  But now the iPhone 4 is dramatically good.  I mean, it really is spectacular.  That's going to change things.  In fact, I think it's going to put some pressure on Cisco.  They flip camera.  Who would buy a flip camera?  Mm-hmm.  Right?  If well, maybe somebody doesn't have an iPhone, I guess.  But this is as good as a flip easily in the video.  And shooting that Tesla coil in low light at night.  And it looks spectacular.  Here's something Google brought.  They call it not quite the holodeck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  What is that?  It's like Google Earth on eight screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was just Google Earth on eight screens,  but just the immersive experience of having it around you.  And a really, really great controller.  Yeah, a great controller that you can just tilt and pan  and move around.  And we actually did some fun stuff with it.  You can fly around the moon.  You can go around where the moon landing is.  And you can actually, if you get good at the controller,  you can sit yourself down right on the rover  and look around and see the horizon as they saw it.  There's another really cool area.  I forget what it's called.  The canyon that's right off of LA, off the LA coastline,  the underwater canyon that's deep in the Grand Canyon.  Marianas Trench.  The Marianas Trench.  You can actually go under the water  and fly through the Marianas Trench, which is something  no one's ever seen before.  And so it's like this godlike power to fly around and zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then when you're over the earth,  you see all the buildings because people have actually  gone and built the buildings in Google Earth, uploaded them,  put them in the proper locations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've wrapped the photos around the buildings too.  So we were going through Western New York,  like I was flying to my apartment to look in my window.  And there were some that are so lifelike wrapped.  I saw a little garage shop that was there.  And it's just the experience of having it  on the huge screens around you.  Yeah.  I got motion sickness behind me and had to leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We actually flew through third world countries, Vietnam,  Tokyo.  All the buildings are there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When is the, I want, there needs to be like an MMO  for Monopoly, like with Google Earth.  They were working on that.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was one where you could buy your town  and you could buy your street and stuff.  Like you could buy buildings, like those 3D buildings,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and then own them.  And that would be amazing.  There was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, then there's my town, which is, that's kind of the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, isn't Second Life, don't they  let you do that very much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's not based on real world stuff.  It's their own universe, right?  It'd be awesome if it was like Google Earth based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The impulse was definitely to play.  I mean, once you're, so I hope they make that available  because as soon as you're on the moon,  you want to actually, everybody wanted to drive the rover around.  And so that's probably the next step,  is to just have a massive Mars game or something.  We could all go terraform it or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That'd be pretty sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think, actually Robert Scoble and I wanted to do this,  and we didn't, it was a debate, iPhone versus Android.  And I think it would have been an interesting debate.  And I was going to debate the Android side,  although Robert pointed out, and I think he was accurate,  I could flip easily.  Like halfway through, he was going to say,  okay, now switch.  So I think you could make a case for either.  But I have to say that almost always when I hear people  extol the virtues of the iPhone, it's things like,  it's just better, it's just easier, it's just prettier.  It's a very subjective thing.  It features Android kills with features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I've got this theory that I have,  I think it holds true is that if you're an iPhone user,  and you have the iPhone and you've used it  for more than six months, to go to Android seems  like a step down from a UI standpoint.  And it just doesn't feel as clean.  There's certain buttons that you wouldn't expect.  You just get so comfortable with the iPhone,  it's hard to make that jump.  So when I went and bought the Nexus One,  or they sent me one, I started playing with it.  I'm like, oh, I could make the jump,  because there are some features and some apps  that they don't have on the iPhone.  You can dictate anywhere.  But I just, it didn't feel as clean and cool.  You know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think we're gonna, next month's gonna be  a very telling time.  First of all, at the announcement for DroidX this week,  on Wednesday, Rubin and Andy Rubin of Android said,  we are now installing 160,000 handsets a day.  That's five million a month, Android handsets.  So that, I mean, when Apple goes,  hey, we sold three million iPads in the last three months,  they're selling five million a month of Android.  But also, we're gonna see, and by the way, 58,000 apps.  At that point, I don't think whether you have 58,000  or a quarter of a million, I think you're close enough,  right, does it matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is one big difference though,  which is that the big businesses are investing  in fantastic experiences on the iPhone,  and they're not doing that yet on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You definitely kind of feel like you're an exile on Android.  Still?  Yeah, you get apps like,  it feels like when it mattered to buy software for the Mac,  and before everything was on the web.  It did, right.  We're used to that as Mac users.  We'd be like, oh man, six months to get the new game,  and it feels like that with apps on the Android.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a great way to put it.  On the iPhone, you get the Pizza Hut app  and the Taco Time and this and that.  On Android, you get a metal detector.  Somebody actually went and hacked up the sensor  so that you can actually use it as a real metal detector.  What do you want, Dan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pizza time or a metal detector?  Exactly. That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It all depends on what matters to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're right.  I mean, Mint's on there now.  Every program that I really needed on the iPhone,  in fact, they have a much better,  the Audible app on Android is killer,  and there is no Audible app on the iPhone.  And people say, well, you don't need an app.  That's the point on the iPhone, it just plays them.  But on Android, you've got a list of every book  you ever bought on Audible.  It gives you stats.  They have badges, four square style badges for listeners,  listening ship.  I think that, I don't know,  and I think if I'm a developer,  don't you think you'd be scared to develop for iPhone  these days and much more comfortable developing for Android,  especially when you know there's five million handsets  a month being sold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems like a short-term problem, the app store thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  DroidX is the next Motorola Droid.  Looks pretty sweet.  Looks like the EVO, a little bit, 4.3-inch screen,  eight megapixel camera.  But I'm putting my money on Samsung's Galaxy X,  which comes out, no one knows, but we think next month.  Have you seen it?  Did you see the CTIA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did, and Samsung's in an interesting position  because they have this new operating system, Bada,  which is their mid-range or cheap smartphone.  Their feature phone.  Their high-end feature.  And they are paying developers scandalous amounts of money  to go bring brilliant experiences to Bada.  Oh, that's interesting.  And from what I've heard of people  who've actually lived with the phone,  they're wonderful phones.  They have the iPhone sensuousness.  I've heard, I haven't got to play with one yet.  So that's gonna be really interesting  when suddenly you have feature phone pricing  and build materials and design and great applications  outside of the smartphone ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Samsung's one of the few companies  that really could do that.  I mean, they really have the clout to do that.  They make the AMOLED screens that are in the Galaxy S 4-inch,  which is not as big as EVO Android X,  but I think bigger than the iPhone.  I think just about right, actually.  Yeah, when is too big?  Because I have a hard time imagining  too much larger than this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The EVO looks a little uncomfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like if your phone needs a kickstand,  it's probably too big.  That's one of the things EVO has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to reinforce the lining of your pocket.  Burns a hole in your pocket.  Well, here's the good news.  If you like smartphones,  and I think anybody who listens to this show  likes having a computer in their pocket,  this is a great time.  I mean, you're really...  So you're still on the 3GS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know, I'm going for soon.  How retro?  Yeah, exactly.  Doesn't it look kind of retro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It kind of looks a little retro compared to the 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I still want to buy the original iPhone,  like sealed in box and save it.  That'll be worth something someday.  I have the original iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you?  First gen?  First gen.  I have a Newton.  Still works too.  I have a Newton too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's awesome.  You know why it works?  Because you put real batteries in it.  Acryline batteries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I haven't used it much.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How's the handwriting recognition?  First generation iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First generation iPod.  That's the little museum behind it.  I forgot what the original iPhone felt like.  Look how big the original iPod was.  That was five gigabytes.  That thing's like a deck of cards.  And that's got the actual hard drive inside of it.  Yeah, you can almost feel it spin up when you just hold it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could feel it spin up.  Remember that you feel the little...  That's amazing.  I forgot it was Firewire.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's the port right on it.  That's awesome.  I was working...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could use a Firewire cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was working at Microsoft when this came out  and everybody was clustered around one of the first ones  that somebody brought in.  And the thing that got everybody just their heads  spinning around was they put a speaker in here  just so that they could make a click when you turned the wheel.  That's right.  That was what blew up our business.  And everybody around the table said,  we would never do that here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  It's bad engineering.  It's crazy.  And yet it's great UI.  It's brilliant UI.  All right, we're passing around the hardware  while we do that.  Dan Shapiro is here.  Serial entrepreneur.  Do you want to talk about your latest project?  What are you working on now?  I don't know if I knew what it was yet.  You're just in between?  I'm toying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm playing with some things in e-commerce,  some things in online education,  some things in mobile app stores,  and we'll see what...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think?  Okay, so you have your choice.  So what category you think is the next big thing?  Oh boy.  Apps?  No, apps were the last big thing.  Location, mobile?  Those are all old.  Those are all pretty...  You need to be the next thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Well, one of the things  that I'm really excited about right now  is the problem of e-commerce is 10 years old,  and I feel like we are where search was  before Google looked at it.  10 years ago, Amazon looked at the problem  of how to buy things, commodities,  a laptop, a DVD player, et cetera,  and said, we're gonna go do this,  and they built this idea of search.  So you're looking for something and you go search for it,  and then they added to it the idea of serendipity.  So I'm looking at this thing  and they say, what about that thing?  So there's been a renaissance around serendipity.  You've got Woot and you've got Groupon  and you've got these people at flash sales saying,  here's something you might not have known you needed,  but it's entertainment shopping.  But nobody's gone back to that original concept of,  I have a problem.  I've got 200, 300, $400 in my pocket  to go solve that problem.  Help me solve that.  So I've been spending some time thinking about,  what is the solution to that look like,  and how do you help people shopping to solve problems?  So I know what I need, how do I get there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kind of like Cat Arena's Hunch.  It's Hunch a little bit, yeah.  I like to think of it as- Hunch for Commerce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kayak for Commerce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  So you, okay.  Maybe you give them, it's a recommendation engine.  You give them some parameters  and it gives you some ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That'd be an interesting way to go about it.  So I'm prototyping a few different approaches right now.  Simultaneously being secretive  and don't know the right answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm playing with a few different approaches too.  You sound like you know what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To see what feels right and what works best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin Rose is also here.  Always a pleasure to have Kevin,  one of the original Twitters.  Episode number one.  Episode one, actually episode zero too, for that matter.  Somebody said, oh, I'm disappointed  he got Kevin on and he didn't get all the rest  of the guys on.  We could do a reunion.  We should do that.  Yeah, it'd be really fun to do that.  Maybe have a, you know what?  I could get a barbecue out there, I'll have a cookout.  Yes.  Wouldn't that be fun?  Awesome.  My friends of Leo, there are five of them.  It's a small group.  But a nice bunch of people.  We'll do that, we'll definitely do that.  Also Tim Shea is here from nextnewnetworks.com  and Dean Putney from boingboing.net.  He's a developer at Boing Boing.  We'll be back with more in just a bit,  but I wanna tell you a little bit about audible.com  and a very special deal from Audible right now.  They call it the big summer listen.  If you go to audible.com slash summer,  you can get a book absolutely free.  And when I say free, I mean no strings.  You don't even need to give them a credit card.  You don't even need to, you know, nothing.  Just take a book.  They only do this once a year,  so this is the time to do this.  Audible.com slash summer.  You're gonna choose from one of,  well it looks like, they said eight books,  but now it looks like 12, 16.  There's quite a, it's an unlimited number.  It's a huge number.  It's a free audio book giveaway,  but you cannot do this if you're an Audible member.  So Audible members don't go there.  And if you wanna become an Audible member,  then I can get you three books free.  How about that?  Look at all these books.  This is great, The Lost Fleet.  Master and Commander, that's a great way.  Boy, Audible's smart.  They know if you read Master and Commander,  they're gonna get you for 21 more books  for the whole series of Patrick O'Brien books.  That's smart, first one's free.  It's one of my favorite things.  I Am Legend, The Good Earth,  Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,  The Next 100 Years by George Freeman, a really good book.  Jane Austen's Persuasion, so there's a lot of books in here.  The Time Traveler's Wife, I just read this.  I loved it.  The Life of Pi, maybe the best audiobook ever made.  The Road, another great one.  Outlander, wow.  Stiff by Mary Roach, the story of death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that a great book?  And Boink, it's companion.  Stiff and Boink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just finished Boink.  It's all about science and sex.  Is Damon on there?  Damon is not, but you know, okay, so here's the deal.  Actually, this is how we're gonna do this.  If you go to audible.com slash twit two,  you can sign up for the Audible Platinum account.  That's two free books.  And absolutely get Daniel Suarez's two books.  They're really one book written in two different volumes.  There's Damon, D-A-E-M-O-N,  and then Freedom TM.  So you get those free, but don't do that until after  you've gone to audible.com slash somewhere  and picked a book there like Stiff.  David Sedaris live at Carnegie Hall.  Little B, tons of books here.  So pick a book, get it free  for the summer audio book giveaway.  That's audible.com slash summer.  Then go to audible.com slash twit two  and you have scammed them out of three books, my friend,  at no cost to you.  Three free books.  Go to audible.com slash twit two  and take advantage of the summer of reading  because they do this once a year and it's really great.  And it's only good through, I think, July 2nd.  So if you're listening to this after July 2nd,  oops, I should have warned you, there's nothing there.  Audible.com slash summer, then audible.com slash twit two.  And as always, we thank Audible for their support.  And by the way, if you do have a Nexus One,  the Audible app on here is just great.  It gives you everything you've ever listened to.  Because once you buy a book on Audible, it's yours for life.  You can take it off, you don't have to leave it  on the device.  So every book I've ever bought, I mean,  there's 300, 400 books here  because I've been an Audible member since I started.  Is there an Audible iPhone app too?  No, I wish they would do this for the iPhone  because it's really fantastic.  You don't need it for the iPhone  because the iPhone you just listen on the iPod.  Right.  But I like this better because you can bookmark,  you get these, like I said, badges.  They give you stats.  Like, here's the stats.  It's like, I'm a rank beginner.  No, Audible master, Audible newbie, novice, pro, scholar.  Then they show you how many hours you've spent their badges.  See, like four square style badges on there.  This is in beta right now, but it's really sweet.  Listen, the amount of time you spent listening.  Very, today, monthly, daily.  Oh, here's a graph.  This is for nerds who love stats.  This is very smart.  Yes.  Audible.com, we thank them so much for their support  of this week in tech.  So what else?  You know, I haven't really been paying attention  to the tech news.  Any other big stories that affected you?  Kevin Rose, I think the big story is Dig Four.  I'm really excited about this.  Well, thank you.  You only have a, like, it's done, actually.  We just turned it off.  It's 4.30.  Is it done?  Yes, we're up 4.30.  Man, I hope you got a chance to play with it.  And how soon before you think it'll come out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're gonna start inviting people probably tomorrow  or the next day at about 10,000 or so a day.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Until launch.  So go there anyway.  Go to new.dig.com and just sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, sign up and we'll put you on the list  and then we'll send you an invite very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is gonna transform Dig  and I'm gonna use it more.  In fact, I'm thinking I'm gonna start using it  to bookmark stories for our shows.  We wanted to do that ages ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but I think this is the time to do it.  Submitting content is much easier now.  It's like two clicks.  Yeah.  It's awesome.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see, iPhone we talked about.  We talked about Android.  Dan, anything that's on your mind these days?  Any big tech stories you thought were interesting?  We've just been like locked up in a room  for the last three days.  I don't know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, totally off the grid.  It was kind of a fun.  It's kind of fun, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, I was at NewsFoo.  Steven Levy, who writes for Wire,  but was at Newsweek and wrote Hackers.  By the way, I got the 25th edition of Hackers  and I got Steven to sign it.  I'm so happy.  It's awesome.  Yeah, smart, huh?  He's just great.  We were talking about this Rolling Stone article.  I thought this was quite interesting.  And I kind of wasn't paying attention  because of the Apple thing and then going off to a food camp.  Rolling Stone, not known for its political reporting,  sent a reporter out to interview General McChrystal  and got him off the record, on the record rather,  saying all sorts of things.  He got fired on Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I don't think it's true  that they're not known for their political reporting.  I think they do that once every.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Once in a while, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And when they do, it's great.  Gonzo reporting was born there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right, actually.  That's not fair to them, is it?  They had Hunter S. Thompson.  So that was a topic of conversation this week.  Anything on your mind, Tim?  Tell me about Next New Networks.  What's the latest for you guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we had a big week  where we put up a new site called nextnewbillion.com.  It's really just for our fans  and sort of changed the end card on all our videos  where we're passing a billion views.  I think like you said-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You passed a billion views?  Holy cow, that's like Lady Gaga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's us and Lady Gaga and a couple other people.  And yeah, so it's pretty cool.  It took us about 8,000 videos to do it.  So the backwards way we've been thinking about that  is if your average video on the web  gets 100 lifetime views,  the average video we've put out has gotten about 125,000.  And people haven't heard of Next New Networks so much,  but we're the people that did the Obama Girl videos  and we've spun a lot of political comedy off of that.  And we've got all these other channels  like Indie Mogul and Threadbanger.  And now we're starting to move into things  like Food with Hunger Nation  and a fitness network called Click Fitness.  So that whole way of just locking up  with independent producers and just helping them succeed  is really starting to pay off.  So Next New Billion, if you don't know what we do,  you can just go there and there's a playlist  of about 80 videos with over 100,000 views  that sort of give a sort of show.  You might have seen one of them over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was talking to Dina Kaplan at Food Camp of blip.tv.  She was saying,  and maybe you've seen this at Revision 3 as well,  that advertising support for video,  IP video networks is jumped  at the end of last year and this year.  That's been our experience as well.  It's been pretty crazy.  This is very good news, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've all kind of known each other in the industry forever.  We've all been struggling for years  trying to put this together.  We've all shared info along the way.  The hard thing with online video  is that we're not actually competing with each other.  It's not like someone goes,  I really wanna advertise in web video,  but I just can't decide between Revision 3 and-  I can't wait to that day.  We're trying to compete with every single website  and piece of content on the web.  The same RFPs that get sent to us  get sent to Facebook and Google.  So every time one of us goes out there,  and I talk to Dina a lot about this  and I've talked to Kevin's colleagues at Revision 3  is that we're not only trying to sell ourselves,  but we're trying to sell the whole medium  every time we go out the door.  It's been three years of really hard work  getting it up to a level where we're all,  if not profitable, I think pretty close to profitable  across the board, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty crazy how the advertisers have changed too.  Initially it was tech brands, things like that.  Now we just did Ford sponsor Dignation last time.  Wow, that's awesome.  And it's crazy.  Yeah, Ford's one of our big sponsors too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's really exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is mainstream.  When you see a billion views,  that's 50 million views a month,  and we've had five renewals with Warner Brothers.  We've done, it's real brands that are coming in,  Samsung, American Express,  that they're starting to realize  that audiences are moving here.  And all we need is, I did some conference the other day,  and all we need is just a small percentage  of the advertising come over,  and we'd all be able to do so much more.  So we're seeing some really interesting things

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  at PhotoBucket, and we've been user-generated content  forever, a little bit of video, mostly pictures,  and about 160 billion media views a month.  And what we're seeing is,  the interest is coming up exactly like you're saying.  The other thing that's really fun is we're starting  to see the interest on the mobile platforms as well.  People saying, how can we connect with people  wherever they are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's where you have an advantage, right?  Because, I mean, I guess,  I was watching this World Cup on my iPhone though,  on Moby TV.  I have to confess, I was in a very boring session.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it was everything I could do.  Is that why the Wi-Fi network was so slow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly, we were all watching the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're starting to see a lot of viewers  should come from the YouTube mobile app.  And there's not a lot of space in the YouTube mobile app,  but if you're one of the featured videos on YouTube that day,  one of those first four that are on the front page,  that means you're also on the mobile app,  and we'll see just a huge percentage of our traffic  for the day come from there.  So people are using it.  We're not exactly sure who or how,  but I think that we've all been waiting for like 10 years.  We've always said people are gonna start watching  a lot of video on mobile phones.  I think it's finally starting to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Couple other big stories  that I actually did neglect to mention.  One is there's a price war between the Kindle and the Nook.  Big drop in the price of the Amazon Kindle,  down to what is it, $159, $189?  $50 drop.  And the Nook, if you want Wi-Fi only, is $149 now.  I thought it was free with a cup of coffee.  Practically.  Is that in response to the iPad  or is it in response to each other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they fighting?  The worst of all worlds,  I mean, they're just getting jumped on.  On both sides.  Yeah, so now you can spend a lot more money  and get the iPad, which is the sexy version of the Kindle,  and you've got them competing with each other.  And it turned out, I will never understand  why Amazon did not decide to be the bookstore  instead of trying to be the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I was told, here's the deal,  I was told there's two divisions.  There's a hardware division  and there's the book division, the software division.  And that's why I was surprised  we saw such a great software app on the iPad  because I thought, well, that's gonna kill the Kindle.  It's different divisions.  And actually, that's smart of Jeff Bezos.  They're fighting each other, that's fine.  Each your own young.  Each your babies, they say at Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was an angle to a story that I just heard about  that was really exciting to me,  which was I've heard about the Kinect,  formerly Project Nutau, this new controller,  and I didn't really get what all the fuss was about.  So this is a webcam, this is some new algorithms for it.  And finally, I got somebody at Microsoft  in the research group to explain to me  what all the fuss was about and it's fascinating.  Am I the only person who doesn't know how this works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it about the locking in on the skeleton thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's how they do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it turns out-  Kinect is a bar that you attach to the Xbox 360.  It'll be out in November at 150 bucks.  It's got an RGB camera in it, a depth sensor in it.  It looks like a microphone array and it's three sensors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was the depth sensor that's the magic.  So the trick is, how do you find depth?  Well, you put two cameras and you see how deep it is.  Well, how do you know what the same thing is?  Because if I know that's your head,  then I can figure out how far away,  but is it your head, is it the book behind it?  And the magic is that the second camera, it's two cameras,  the second one is an infrared camera  and they're projecting a grid onto you in infrared.  And the infrared camera is scanning the grid  so it can actually determine how far you are,  it can triangulate and find.  So that's how they know where you are in the room  and the rest of it's all just software.  They also have an array mic,  which will help them do voice recognition at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's cool, you jump in and it knows it's you,  it puts your avatar up.  If one person's playing a single player game  and you jump in, then it becomes a two player game  automatically and playing it is actually surprisingly fun.  I was very skeptical.  I saw that, I like everybody else,  Felicia Day jumping around like a goon last year  and I thought this is stupid.  I hate the Wii, a Wii never did anything for me  and this is not the Wii, this is really, really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you get to play?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I did and I liked it.  E3 went to E3 and I really liked it.  I thought it was a lot of fun.  Another, let's see, another big story.  How about the domains?  X, X, X, sexy.  Oh yes.  And you know what's funny, I love it.  Anything that both porn producers  and the religious right hate has got to be different.  It's got to be interesting.  The porn producers don't like it  because I guess they're afraid of being censored  like being a ghetto on the web.  The, of course, the right doesn't like it  because it tells people exactly where to go to get a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's going to be very expensive for them.  Yeah, if you're playboy.com,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  are they going to force them to go to playboy.triplex?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they just have to, now they have to buy playboy.triplex  but more to the point, they have to go buy  all the misspellings and for playboy.com  that might not be such a big deal  but I built this porn site in my basement.com.  That's a big deal.  That's a big deal.  Or so I hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wouldn't know anything about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I've got an interesting little anecdote.  Fire away Dean Putney.  Last night, the iPhone 4 was jailbroken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right, Saurik was at the food camp  and he was very excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this was at like four o'clock in the morning  and I was sitting there with Chris Poole and Saurik  and he's working on this and did the jailbreak  of the second iPhone 4.  While at food camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually others were doing it but he was part of the.  The 18 year old did it and then he said.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and Siddiya, and by the way,  it's pronounced Siddiya, I found out  which I never knew and I thought it was Siddiya.  Siddiya is now on the iPhone 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's amazing.  It's amazing that you have one person too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a 17 year old, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well I mean it's Saurik, right?  Siddiya is Saurik and it's just one guy.  It's just him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He demonstrated something that blew my mind.  He showed a way to take running code on an iPhone  and inject your code into it.  So you could, for instance, like if you know him  and you press and hold an icon on the iPhone  and they jiggle, jiggle, jiggle,  you can have it instead go transparent and jiggle.  You could take over a program and running program  and inject your own code into it.  I don't know what the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was fascinating because he said  that he could actually overwrite any C function  on the iPad or the iPhone.  And so he was connecting to it over WiFi  and I guess they had written a protocol  that used very simple object transfers  and it was all sort of like similar to JavaScript  or JavaScript based.  And so it was like he was just changing things on the fly  and it was immediate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I asked him, but he said part of it is because Apple  uses such consistent naming of its variables.  It's very easy to figure out what's going on,  what it's doing, simple thing.  F forward, Kevin, tell me about that.  That's a new show you guys are doing on revision three?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's gonna be my next thing after Dignation.  It's just, I'm just calling it forward.  There's two Fs.  Yeah, I couldn't get forward.com or FWD.com  or any other things that I wanted.  So it's just FFORWARD.com and that will be coming soon.  So it's only a newsletter sign up form right now.  But what is it?  It's gonna be just kind of a new show  that I've been wanting to do for a while  like we were talking about before.  Something that it's gonna be a combination  of kind of geek culture type show.  So not really tech news, but more kind of just  having these different entrepreneurs  that I meet all the time in the Bay Area  come on and talk about what they're doing.  Demo products.  I'll have people come on and talk about geek fashion  or I know this guy that's really passionate  about cooking the best steak.  Have him come on and explain how to make the best steak.  I mean, just a little bit of everything.  Is it a revision three show or are you just gonna do it yourself?  Yeah, it's gonna be a rev three show.  Cool.  And so yeah, it's gonna be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Revision three also added Callie Lewis and Geekbrief,  which is very exciting.  I'm really happy to hear that.  Yeah, it was awesome.  She's the greatest, so that's good.
