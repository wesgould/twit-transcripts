Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  No, it's, it's great.  If you have a dishwasher, which I did in Brooklyn, but it was not a full size was like the half  size dishwasher, which is almost worse than no dishwasher at all because like you can  maybe get one pan in it.  Yeah.

End time: 283.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  I did.  They had, remember Bob, the mini dishwasher at, no, that's not it.  No, wait a minute.  Let me see if I can find it at CES last earlier this year.  Oh yeah.  It was a personal dishwasher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 303.58
End time: 308.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, that is what most of us wind up doing because we don't have a dishwasher,

Start time: 308.08
End time: 315.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but yes, this dishwasher holds three dishes and a casserole.  You could wash it and half the time it would take to load the damn thing.

Start time: 315.87
End time: 324.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's true.  I have two important points to make.  One, you should always hand wash pans, knives, things like that.  There's no reason for them in the dishwasher.  Very important.

Start time: 325.26
End time: 327.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  However, do you put your silverware handle up or handle down?

Start time: 329.30
End time: 329.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Handle down.

Start time: 330.91
End time: 333.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  I do mind handle up.  It's controversial.  I know.

Start time: 334.58
End time: 337.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  Well, my wife and I, she throws everything in the dishwasher, including my beautiful

Start time: 337.92
End time: 340.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  knives with the wooden handles.  Oh no.

Start time: 342.45
End time: 364.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to the point where I buy wooden spoons by the dozen now because I know they're going  to get warped and ruined and everything goes in the dishwasher.  But then we had a fight when we first got together many years ago, handle up or handle  down.  So that's why I'm asking.  My personal feeling is you put the tongs down so that you can remove them and hold them  by the handle.  You don't want to pick it out with the...

Start time: 364.20
End time: 364.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.

Start time: 365.20
End time: 369.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have to sterilize myself to get my silverware out of the dishwasher.  You agree?

Start time: 370.30
End time: 372.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not a person with you.  Apparently someone does not.

Start time: 372.28
End time: 375.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or you're putting tongs in the dishwasher.  Those are hand wash.  No, no, just regular silverware.

Start time: 375.32
End time: 376.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, like putting a fork down.

Start time: 376.44
End time: 381.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't want to tie yourself.  Oh, the tines.  Tines down or tines up is the question.  I do.  Kitchen knives.

Start time: 381.36
End time: 382.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't mess around with that.

Start time: 383.67
End time: 397.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  That is you don't...  I've broken her.  Yeah.  I think the real question...  Oh, go on.  I think the real question is, do you have a knife?  I don't have a knife.  I don't have a knife.  I think the real question is...  Oh, go on.  No.  Yeah.  Move on.

Start time: 398.52
End time: 398.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Move on.

Start time: 403.97
End time: 408.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The real question in my mind is how much is this going to be like Rocket?  And how much is it going to be like...

Start time: 408.82
End time: 411.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could talk about washing dishes for literally the whole three hour show.

Start time: 411.32
End time: 412.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're trying to turn this into Rocket.

Start time: 413.52
End time: 416.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've literally never once talked about housework on Rocket.  Oh.

Start time: 417.24
End time: 420.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We actually haven't, even though it's my favorite thing.  Wow.

Start time: 421.28
End time: 436.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's your opportunity, Simone.  Rocket is a wonderful podcast and relay FM that talks about really a lot about news,  right?  In fact, I'm going to apologize because I think we're going to kind of rerun your last  show a little bit.  That's completely fine.

Start time: 436.32
End time: 447.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because there's...  Well, no, but look, there's been more stuff since...  There's been more stuff.  We had to record on Tuesday because I was going out of town and everything that happened  between Tuesday and now, it's a whole other show.  Elon fired everybody on Friday.

Start time: 448.28
End time: 475.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  saying on Thursday, don't come in.  By the way, I love it that it was signed Twitter.  Elon, we know it's you.  Don't come in.  We're locking the office because we're going to lay a lot of people off.  All of you.  This is cruel.  All of you are going to get an email with a subject line, something like your future  at Twitter.  And then we'll read the mail and learn whether you are staying or leaving.

Start time: 476.12
End time: 486.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it would depend on where it went.  If it went to your personal mail, that means that you're gone because you've been locked  out of everything.  But if it went to your work mail, then congratulations, you are still employed for the moment.

Start time: 486.82
End time: 493.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't imagine anything handled more poorly.  Me either.  The worst layoff in history, worse than the guy who fired everybody on Zoom.  I was...

Start time: 494.04
End time: 523.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so you think it's worse than that because I was having this debate with some people  in like a signal chat where we were trying to decide, I think overall this is worse because  it just helped.  There was no communication for the whole week that he'd owned the company.  Those poor people were just twisting in the wind.  And I think the uncertainty was so bad.  But I do wonder, I think that also just being called into a group Zoom meeting and being  told you're fired and then the meeting cutting out halfway through because they were cutting  everyone's access.  Regardless, it's terrible.

Start time: 523.86
End time: 579.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this was my question too because we were talking about this a bit, Christina,  and when I initially read the story, of course, first it was the Washington Post reporting  that there might be 70% of the company laid off.  Then it was a slightly lower number, I think, when we recorded on Tuesday.  And then it ended up being a ton of people.  And I was reading about how this was done, which does seem very cruel.  I did start wondering, what is the right way to do this in a world where so many people  do work from home at this exact moment?  And that question was kind of answered for us by the Stripe layoffs, which we talked  about, Christina, which like obviously layoffs are terrible and one would hope that you would  never have to live through them.  And they're hard for people who are laid off.  They're hard for the people who remain behind at the company.  But when we compare the Twitter email with the email that Stripe sent out to their employees,  there's just a huge difference in the clarity of the communication that happened to the  people who were laid off.

Start time: 580.49
End time: 582.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I think you're exactly right.

Start time: 582.92
End time: 595.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm also really struck by the methodology that they used to decide who they were going  to fire.  They went through and for the engineering talent, it was like who had the most like  lines of code that they submitted.  That's crazy.

Start time: 596.16
End time: 599.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They asked people to print out their code.

Start time: 599.86
End time: 619.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, Leah Culver tweeted a picture of her with the code she'd committed.  And then a couple of things weird about that.  First of all, they brought in Tesla engineers to talk to you about your code commits.  Engineers working on a completely different product.  By the way, they already don't have the best track record.

Start time: 619.20
End time: 631.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, not only that, but like are not JavaScript engineers.  Twitter is like a...  Not front end.  No, exactly.  Twitter is largely a JavaScript shop.  So, you know, if you're working on hardcore things that Tesla does, like do you even know  how to evaluate that code?

Start time: 633.08
End time: 653.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also, I mean, I doubt, I can't believe that...  It just boggles the mind that it's possible for somebody to buy a company on Friday and  within a week, fire half the staff, knowing who to fire and who not to fire.  I don't understand.  What metrics are you looking at?  Right.  Well...

Start time: 655.48
End time: 701.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You wouldn't.  Now, from what I've...  There's been some reporting about this and then I've heard some things independently  that the previous executive team...  They already had a map.  They already had listings and they'd already been asking people to make lists.  Now, in my opinion, this actually is even more frustrating because the severance packages  from some of the reporting things we've heard was not as good as what it had ever been at  Twitter beforehand, which means that if you knew that layoffs were coming, the humane  thing to do would be while you still have a job as an executive to lay off those people  the right way, to do the right thing.  And then if more people needed to be laid off, fine.  But instead, from what I understand, they basically just wanted it to be Elon's problem  and wanted to close the deal.

Start time: 701.66
End time: 735.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you come into a company, fire all the leadership and then use their roadmap for  who else to fire, it's kind of saying, I don't trust these guys.  They didn't do a good job running Twitter.  Oh, but by the way, let's look...  Let's use what they...  No, it's madness.  So I find it hard to believe that that was a value.  What's the deal with the lines of code?  Why print out your code?  There's a famous story.  This is Andy Hertzfeld.  Oh, yes.  Yes, I love this.  I love this.  About the early days of the Macintosh, he's writing about Bill Atkinson, arguably the  greatest coder of our era.  One of them, certainly.

Start time: 735.30
End time: 741.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One hundred percent.  One of the quintessential, like, of the modern kind of gooey era people.  Like, yes.

Start time: 741.88
End time: 792.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He wrote Quick Draw.  He wrote the graphic primitives for the Macintosh.  Andy says, in early 82, the Lisa software team was trying to buckle down for the big  push to ship the software within the next six months.  Some of the managers decided it would be a good idea to track the progress of each individual  engineer in terms of the amount of code they wrote from week to week.  Sound familiar?  So they asked every engineer to submit a form.  Bill Atkinson, legendary Bill Atkinson, had been working on optimizing Quick Draw, had  rewritten the region engine using a simpler, more general algorithm.  So on his form, he said, I wrote minus 2000 lines of code.  He cut out 2000 lines of code.  Wow.  Now, if you're asking me, I say that's a guy to hire.  I agree.  But that printout is a little short.

Start time: 793.14
End time: 819.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  Yeah, 100 percent.  But it's just such a dumb metric to base things on.  And we don't know.  There's a lot of mystery.  We don't know what happened.  I was going to say, I've heard a lot of conflicting things from people who would be in a better  position to know to say that maybe that was part of it, but that wasn't the entire thing.  Regardless, if that plays any role, you know, just shows just what a disaster this whole  thing has been.  I think, you know, there's been no communication and that's that allows narratives.

Start time: 820.18
End time: 852.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When there's a vacuum of information, that's when your conspiracy theories and all the  weirdness starts.  And I'll add one more weird piece that just came out this morning.  People are saying this is Matt Navarro, who tweeted, confirmed Twitter is now asking some  fired workers to please come back.  Yeah.  Some were laid off by mistake.  Some were let go before management realized their experience is needed to build the features  Elno or as you call him, Brianna, I believe Elno is planning.  Elno.

Start time: 853.20
End time: 861.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Elno.  I made a typo with that.  I'm like, no, this is actually better.  It's catching on.  Like a viral tweet about that.  No, it's great.  I love it.  I love it.

Start time: 862.26
End time: 869.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it also has the advantage that if Elno is looking for his name, which he is undoubtedly  spending most of his day doing.  Yeah.  You may not find Elno.

Start time: 870.08
End time: 926.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you all see about like how the how a lot of this stuff leaked was that when he added  some of the new lieutenants and some of his new like henchmen into Twitter's Slack instance,  they did not realize that the channels they created were not private by default.  And that's why people were able to then monitor what was happening, find documents which were  also not private.  David Sachs's calendar was open to everyone.  So if he was able to see the people were able to see, oh, we're having meetings about  layoffs here, here and here.  I mean, just the level of incompetence the whole way around is just so I feel I feel  so bad for every person who's still there.  Every person who was there.  I know that it was my heart goes out.  I know it was a messy company, but to have it happen this way and then for it to be so  public and to just then have a certain contention of the Internet gleefully like rejoicing in  this, it's really gross.  I really feel for everybody.

Start time: 926.80
End time: 955.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because Twitter is it's one of the loudest pieces of social media we have, like tweets  get printed in so many other like news stories on articles all over the Internet.  And everyone on Twitter is very opinionated.  And I think we'll talk about this a little bit.  But like, it's not the biggest social media, but it contains some of the biggest like wind  bags that we have.  And I include myself among them.  So amplification, as you say, for this to be happening, it really goes out to the world

Transcript:  I just wanted to, but going back to who they fired, I wanted to say we do know a lot about  which teams they fired at this point.  We know that one of the teams that worked on accessibility for people with disabilities,  they're gone.  We know one of the teams that dealt with misinformation, they are gone.  We know that the Twitter right feature, something I've been really, really eager for them to  unveil finally, like I've been talking to them in PM forever going, please bring this  to market.  I want to use this.  Like Elon is announcing that you're going to be able to do long form things on Twitter.  And then he goes and fires the entire Twitter right team.  And it's just, it's all the moves he's making.  It's like, I understand that there need to be layoffs here.  I don't think Twitter is the only over-staffed company in Silicon Valley.  And I think it can make sense sometimes to like take a step back, look at what you need  and refocus in a moment like this.  I don't think anyone reasonable would have an issue with that.  But the thing is they came in here, they're getting people from outside the company to  make these decisions.  It's haphazard.  You've got legacy.  There was a great thread on Twitter yesterday with someone who works on the reliability  part of Twitter talking about how he is really worried about the threats to the service from  here forward, because there are people that understand all this legacy code that they  count on to keep the thing running for high frequency events like Queen Elizabeth.  And they're just gone now.  So like, say, the midterms next week, this week rather, like what's going to happen when  that part of Twitter goes down or needs someone to understand that to look at it?  It's just going to plummet.  So think about the reliability of Twitter going down in the same period of time that  you're asking people to pay $8 a month for it.  It makes no sense.  It's just it's it's if you had to do this, there was a much smarter way to do it.

What's new?  We're adding great new features to Twitter Blue.  We have more on the way soon.  Get Twitter Blue for $7.99 a month if you sign up now.  Is that actually then I heard that it wasn't everybody wasn't getting that option, that  they're rolling it out.  Blue checkmark, colon, power to the people, colon.  Your account will get a blue checkmark, just like the celebrities, companies and politicians  who already follow.

At which point advertisers literally pause the meeting, types to their their CMO.  Let's not buy any more ads for a little bit.  Oh my God.  So half the ads, but much better ones, according to this anonymous writer.  Since you're supporting Twitter, Twitter in the battle against the bots.  Oh, I didn't know that.  That's what the eight bucks did.  We're going to reward you with half the ads and make them twice as relevant.  Okay.  Post what?  Post longer videos.  You'll finally be able to post longer videos to Twitter.  By the way, there should be a dot dot dot.  That's not in this update, but you know, we're going to do that eventually.

But just ridiculous, stupid things will happen that only happen on Twitter.  And there is some cultural thing.  There is a cultural thing going on.  Even now, as it's breaking down, the fact that it's happening on Twitter is in and of  itself like the car crash you can't turn away from.

Transcript:  You'll be dancing on the deck of the Titanic.  I have thoughts about this because I while I absolutely I am very sad about everyone  who has lost their job at Twitter.  I do think there's something very special and interesting about a website that is  fundamentally broken.  And Twitter has been that in a lot of ways for many years in ways that Twitter itself  has been actively trying to fix when it comes to addressing harassment and misinformation  and all of these incredibly important things that make the website more humane to be on.  However, as a person who is on Tumblr right now, a website that is fantastically broken  and has a strange community that feels like they've been through something together,  there's something in me that is excited for that era of Twitter, because I don't think  it's going to die. If it dies, it won't die right away.  Like the people who are in it for the long haul like you, Christina, they're sticking  around and until they go away, Twitter will continue to exist in some form or other.  And I think we're just going to see it kind of evolve in strange and fascinating ways.  And I'm interested in that not in a car crash kind of way, but in like what happens to this  community? What does it turn into?  And I think maybe it only becomes a problem because there are so many high profile people  there and because there's so much potential for misinformation.  So like it's not all fun and games, but I do think it's fascinating.

Transcript:  Oh, see, honestly, to me, I think that so a week ago when we were when this stuff happened,  if you had asked me, what are the chances of Twitter literally kind of catching on fire  and a lot of people moving off and it dying very quickly?  I've been like, look, I'll see you all in two days.  Everybody's moving to Massadon.  I'm like, see you in five minutes, right?  Like you're going to be back on in half an hour.  You're going to do the same thing that as we were talking pre-show, all of us have done.  We sign up for these services.  We use them and then we go back to what we know.  But seeing how this was handled, seeing some of the changes that they claim they aren't  making, but now there's no one to kind of keep things running, knowing things that I've  heard about how like the internal code bases of Twitter has been handled, I do have very  real questions of which is, is this site going to be able to remain up and where's the  institutional knowledge and what's going to happen?  And, you know, even though they laid off fewer people on the trust and safety team, that  doesn't mean that there aren't still other people on like, what are you doing to prevent  fraud?  Like, Alon says he wants to get rid of the bots, but are you employing the people who  were going to do a good job with that?  Right.  Or is this going to become overrun?  So I don't know.  I think that you're right.  I think there's a very real possibility that it could break down technologically.  I also think, and this is a total 180 from where I was a week ago, that it is much more  likely that things could get worse much more quickly than I thought.

Transcript:  A hundred percent.  I think, I think, you know, Twitter, just like Tesla is facing a huge amount of competition.  I think TikTok really opened up the door that, you know, you could have people come in with  a better product and get a real foothold.  You know, TikTok got a foothold by not just focusing on Gen Z, but by making it a pleasant  place to spend time.  If you're on TikTok, there's not just this barrage of negativity that you get with Twitter.  I think if you had those half of people that quit at Twitter and they went and started  something that was just like, look, Twitter is a technical product is utterly fungible.  And they said, we are going to put trust and safety first.  That is our primary mission objective.  And on top of that, you know, we're going to verify the journalists and we're going to  tweak the algorithm.  So it's more about broadcasting current events other than, you know, quote, tweet dunks on  everybody. Right.  I think the real problem is Twitter is not a pleasant place to spend time.  It's a tool that all of us need.  And, you know, for major events, it's a lot of fun.  Like there have been like days on Twitter.  It's just the best thing that's ever happened when someone makes a huge mistake.  Like, do you remember the Will Smith slap thing?  That was a great day on Twitter.  Well, do you guys remember the greatest day in the history of online, which was when the

Transcript:  In fact, one of the reasons I pulled back from Twitter was I realized.  And I think some of you have not yet realized this, that the only thing you can  do on Twitter is get in trouble, that it's very hard not to get in trouble,  because what happens is Twitter is designed to get you in trouble.  OK, and and what you put on Twitter feels like it's quick, it's fast, it's gone  immediately, and it's not it lives forever.  So I think for most people, Twitter ends up being a dangerous place.  And I include Elon Musk in this.  I include myself.  I stopped tweeting on Twitter because I got in a fight with somebody.  You know, it really wraps you up and winds you up and you get in a fight.  And then then a day later, you go, what have I done?  You don't have those experiences.

Start time: 1767.38
End time: 1832.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you definitely do.  But I will push back a little bit because all those things are accurate and are true.  But I think that and this isn't exclusively true of Twitter.  This could be true of any other network where you can really build relationships  with people, but I've genuinely met people like Mike Sargent, who is in this room  right now in the audience.  He and I are our friends and started doing a podcast together and got to know each  other because of Twitter.  Brianna Wu, Simone de Rochefort and I, like because of social networks,  I built real relationships.  I've gotten jobs.  I've had really in-depth conversations with people that I would have never  otherwise had a chance to meet, even through things like Twitter spaces.  When that debuted during the pandemic, I met a great group of people that I talked  to all the time because of Animal Crossing and a Twitter DM group.  There are people that I used some of them.  I worked with at Microsoft, some of them I didn't.  We all got to know each other like there are, I think, real community and relationship  things that happen in addition to the fights.  And I do agree with you that, yes, it's probably as optimized to get you in trouble.  But there's really good things that are part of this, too.

Start time: 1833.60

And the problem, of course, with all social networks is the bigger they get, the more  wild and unmanageable and problematic they get.  I've seen this again and again.  And once a small social network, we were talking before we began the show about  prior failed social networks like Path or Pounce or Jaiku.  And they were all great because they were small.  And but if they had gotten to the size of Twitter, they would have been as bad as  Twitter, of course.

And there's the problem because they're trying to make these websites continually  bigger and bring more users so they can make money, which does make sense because  websites need to make money.

So there's two things that Elon could do with Twitter.  Try to get his money back.  Not going to happen, but he could try.  Polish it up.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I genuinely believe some team is going to come forward and they're going to do the  things that the reasonable people on Twitter have been asking for for years.  Better trust and safety, more transparent policies, lowering the toxicity, tweaking  the algorithms, so it's less about outrage and more about positive conversation.  There is definitely a space for a product like that.  I think journalists generally speaking are interested in getting their stories out to  people and looking at sources.  And I think that the credible people that Twitter is basically provide the content  that makes Twitter worthwhile.  I think increasingly they're going to look at the way Elon is running this thing.  They're going to be looking for alternatives.  And I think there is ample space for a competitor there.  There is one yet though, right?

Transcript:  I do want to say, I signed up for Mastodon on a whim.  And look, we've criticized it plenty on our show.  It is hard to access the onboarding gets an F minus, but I have to say the  conversations I'm having on there because of the technical barrier to signing up for  it, it's like app.net again.  Like it's a good conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been really impressed with it.

Start time: 2251.34
End time: 2307.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm a little nervous about actually enticing people from Twitter to come over.  I don't want it to turn into the next Twitter.  I think that would be, in fact, I've kind of tell people, you know, tone it down.  This isn't the same place.  Get to know the culture before you start doing the same stuff.  I'm a little nervous actually about Mastodon attempting to become Twitter.  It has some structural things that will keep it from that.  The federation is great.  I run an instance, you run an instance, they run an instance and you can block  instances you don't like.  You can choose who to follow.  You can have different rules.  You in a way you could do what I was saying, which is create a small, kind of  more personal space that still connects to a larger global space.  So there is, and that's what Blue Sky, by the way, Jack Dorsey's attempt to create  a federated Twitter is all about.  Do you think Blue Sky is going to be come along and be a replacement?  I signed up for the beta.  I don't have an invite yet.

Start time: 2316.50

Transcript:  Jack said, I grew it too fast.  It's my fault.

Start time: 2320.08
End time: 2324.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I basically said that that was a little bit too little too late for the  thousands of people that were laid off.

Start time: 2324.14
End time: 2329.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But anyway, Jack has a massive stake still in Elon's Twitter.  I know he does.  I know he does.

Start time: 2329.80
End time: 2384.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And anyway, like I, that anyway, so I hope I had, look, I think that things  like Blue Sky and Mastodon and others have a lot of potential.  I think that, I don't think Jack was wrong when he said that he'd wish that  Twitter had always been a protocol.  I do feel like that's a little bit of a false, like looking back, you know, what  he's saying doesn't really match with the reality of what his decisions were when  he was CEO of Twitter both times, right?  Because he made decisions.  A lot of revisionist history.  That's the word I was looking for.  He's a lot of revisionist history, but I'm not opposed to those things in theory,  but it still doesn't, the challenge we'll still have is even though you can have  these big, you know, these multiple instances, there will be one instance  that becomes the centralized place.  Just like with anything else, there will be a centralized hub.  There has to be, right?  Always.  I mean, same thing with like with Bitcoin, right?  Like Coinbase and Binance.  It always happens.  Always.

Start time: 2384.34

Transcript:  For NFTs it was OpenSea.  Exactly.  It always happens.

Start time: 2386.72
End time: 2406.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so the problem with that is that once something becomes the de facto home or  the largest place, you still face the same challenges that you would face it  with Twitter, right?  With how do we moderate?  How do we enforce things?  How do we grow?  How do we keep different opinions without allowing harassment?  It's complicated.  Do we have to have somewhere like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  What do they call it?  The public square.  I don't know if Twitter is the public square.  It's the closest thing to the public square I guess we have.  We used to have Walter Cronkite, right?  We used to have three television networks.  Everybody watched the same TV shows.  So there was a certain community within the US.

Start time: 2425.98
End time: 2427.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And a certain hegemony too, right?

Start time: 2428.11
End time: 2463.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it was bad because obviously it was CB, if you watch Walter Cronkite, he  famously was the guy who ended the Vietnam War because he lost faith in  President Johnson's plans in Vietnam.  And he said it on his broadcast.  And that was that.  Uncle Walter said, it's a bad idea.  Everybody changed their mind.  Protests had gone on for years.  I marched in them.  It was a big deal.  Didn't change America until Uncle Walter said so.  We don't have that anymore.  Right.  We don't have a central place.  Do we need one?

Start time: 2467.24
End time: 2501.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am torn because obviously I dislike the idea of any particular organization  like holding the keys to America's psyche.  On the other hand, what we have seen over the internet over the last 10 years or so  is just a fracturing into different realities where you can completely curate  what you believe and ignore, curate the facts that you're ingesting.  And I really, I don't have anything positive to say about that.  I don't really see.

Start time: 2502.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 2521.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a big corporation that decided that.  That's obviously not.  Maybe it's going to be a guy like Elon Musk that's going to decide that.  Is Walter Cronkite still alive?

End time: 2585.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I completely agree.  I think we have a TikTok story today that we're going to talk about, but okay.  So there's a phrase that flies around on the internet now, which is like, our  parents were radicalized by Fox News.  Gen Z is being radicalized by TikTok.  And I think in some ways that's true.  I like TikTok as a platform.  I think there's a lot of good stuff on TikTok, but it's true that there are large  parts of the population that are getting news and other recommendations from TikTok  and from people who are incentivized to make the loudest and most divisive  content possible.  And that's another problem that I don't have an answer to.

Transcript:  I mean, I think if you want to zoom out and look at this issue from 30,000 feet,  we are in a global information war that is taking place every single second of  every single day.  And we are losing that war.  You know, there are four billion.  We meaning democracy.  Like it is so the incentives on social media is exactly as profitable for Facebook  and Twitter and Reddit and YouTube to pump out false information as it is true  information.  There's nothing there to fact check it.  And because of that, you have these strongmen all around the world that are  weaponizing these incentives and our ideals against us.  I mean, democracies fundamentally depend on a free flow of information so people  can make decisions.  We have so much garbage in the zone today because of, you know, what are  essentially information weapons factories that I mean, this is why it's not just the  United States struggling with this point to a democracy.  We're all struggling with this.  And I think, I mean, I've been saying this for years, Christina, I disagree on it,  but I think you've got to aggressively regulate social media.  I think there has got to be some questions at some point.  Is this good for national unity?  Is it good for democracy?  But isn't that what the other territory is doing is regulating?

Transcript:  I don't know what the answer is.  I understand the conflict.  And you're right.  The only way we as a society have of exerting our will is through government and law.  But that seems to Brianna, I think it feels like it's failed.  And it's in the process of falling apart.  And so you can't be sure which government is going to do that.  And as a result, I mean, I don't think the corporations should do it either.  No, I don't know.  I don't know if there's an answer.  That's the problem.

Transcript:  I'm not saying I agree with this necessarily, but Scott Galloway had a really interesting  piece out last week.  I'm not made up.  He's on mastodon now.  Let me check his mastodon account here real quick.  So he was talking about how one of the ways we've combated the financing of terrorism  around the world is through know your customer laws.  And he was talking about how maybe it's time for social media companies to know their  customer. It's not saying you have to use your real name.  It's not saying they're going to out you.  It's saying that there's some check along the way to make sure that you're a real,  authentic person there.  I'm interested in that idea.  That's interesting.  I don't agree with this premise that, look, it's complicated.  It's difficult for free speech.  Anyone that understands this issue agrees with that.  But I don't agree that the best course, the wisest course of action is to continue doing  nothing. We are F'd if we stay in this course and we've got to try something.

This is the cutest little thing.  What do you think?  That's a computer.  It's adorable.  This is an industrial computer.  You are.  So this is what's changing in the world.  Right.  It's not a one desktop, one computer world anymore.  Right.  It's computing at the edge.  It's computing everywhere.  OnLogic makes computers you don't even see.  An entire hidden world of computing that's changing everything from sustainable  agriculture, smart cities, in factories everywhere, increasing manufacturing  efficiency.  That's where you'll find OnLogic's distinctive orange industrial and embedded  computers.  These are amazing.  No fan in here.  You see all the fins on it.  It's a passive cooling.  This thing, you could throw this a hundred yards.  Your quarterback, what's his name?  Simone could throw this.  I don't know if Kenny throw a hundred yards.  He could throw this.  He could throw this, bounce it down the field.  Absolutely no problem.  OnLogic is the first choice.  Here's another one in industrial computing for innovators around the world who  need computing power that can survive and thrive where traditional hardware  might fail.  Look at this.  I've got six wifi choices on here.  That's because I'm in a factory, right?  With multiple wifi access points.  OnLogic designs and creates computing solutions that could fit in the palm of  your hand while powering everything from advanced robotics and AI to  manufacturing automation to digital media solutions, smart agriculture  technologies.  These are passively cooled.  They're ventless in some cases, so no dust, no dirt.  They're engineered for reliability.  No airborne contaminants can get in.  They've removed the fan, so it's a completely solid state device.  Bang it around.  Be great for a truck, right?  Doesn't matter.  Shock and vibration do nothing.  Other design features and specialized components protect systems from extreme  temperatures and interference.  These are just two examples.  There's an OnLogic for whatever need, whatever IoT or an industrial or  embedded system you need.  They run all kinds of processors.  They're extensively tested to operate reliably wherever they are.  A remote mining operation.  You know, I don't hope you don't see it, but you might see this on a  crash cart in a hospital.  OnLogic extensively tested to operate reliably no matter what.  The team at OnLogic is so committed to making a product that is tailored  to your unique challenge.  They love that challenge.  They can't wait to hear from you.  They partner with leading software companies like AWS to enable rapid  evaluation and deployment of edge computing solutions.  They have in fact, a line of AWS IoT Greengrass compatible computers  approved and vetted by AWS.  So for Greengrass, what a great solution.  Gives you the peace of mind that's going to work right out of the box.  It's certified.  If you need a computing solution that can easily be configured to your  particular needs, supported by industry experts who are just a phone call, a  website chat or email away, delivered to you quickly, the team at OnLogic is  ready to help.  I love these guys.  I, you know, I, I'm sure they're going to want these back, but I can think of  so many things that we could do with this.  Just so cool.

Transcript:  Apparently Benito is a LOL fan.  Did you?  Oh, this was your beat.  Yeah, because you were a Twitch, right?  So I'm very fascinated by esports, partly because my generation,  I'm an old man, my generation, you know, we're the Walter Cronkite generation.  We watched baseball for crying out loud before it was broken.  I don't know.  I think it was always that way.  It was just it's very slow.  I think that there's a whole generation under 30 that doesn't know or care anything about  nightly news or or even the NFL or F1.  This generation is much more interested in YouTube and Twitch and TikTok.  And I think eSports is very, very interesting.  And I think many, many networks, the worlds were sponsored by MasterCard.  The big event was at Chase Center, which is a massive, it's where the Warriors play,  I think 20 or 30,000 people there.  Benito, did you watch the opening ceremony?  Oh my God.  I had not.  Now, apparently they do this every year.  There was a big deal because they hadn't been able to gather in person.  Can I play this or am I going to get in trouble?  Oh, go ahead.  You can edit it out later.  So, John, this is where we saw Roger Waters just a month ago.  So we know the kind of arena they did the similar thing they had.  I'll turn off the audio, but except the audio is kind of the fun part.  I don't know.  So this is a giant arena.  Yep.  And it's a huge arena.  And it's a huge arena.  And it's a huge arena.  And it's a huge arena.  And it's a huge arena.  And it's a huge arena.  And it's a huge arena.  They have a screen that is covering up hiding where the gaming is going to occur.  They're doing a countdown.  They have three major celebrities to sing the song.  At the end, Lil Nas X shows up.  Of course.  And then flies out of the arena in the palm of a hand of a giant mech.  I mean, this is like the Olympics.  Opening ceremony.  Totally.  I saw the stats.  I mean, they have something like 40, 30K projectors.  They have hundreds of cameras.  They have holographic projection.  They have a real live musical audience.  I mean, a musical orchestra.  This is a big deal.  And it kind of blew me away when I...  I'll skip ahead a little bit.  They've got dancers.

I think the team rises up out of the stage here and shows up.  Let me scoot you ahead a little bit to the...  I don't know.  Maybe I've gone past.  Here they are.  Here's the nerds.  And what they're trying to do, obviously, is turn these guys, who have probably  very little social acumen, into...  But probably F1 drivers are equally nerdy.

Transcript:  I guess...  I've watched the World Series.  Some of these baseball players are disgusting, actually.  Literally.  This is why baseball is dying.  Yeah, I think so.  It says Lil Nas X singing a song that he wrote specifically for League of Legends Worlds.  I should turn this off because this will definitely take it.  It is taking down.

Transcript:  So this is kind of a continuation of the question earlier.  Is there going to be an NFL in 20 years?  A central sport that we all follow?  Or is it going to be fragmented?  Because people who follow...  I don't know.  What's the other game?  Dota or Counter-Strike or Dota or Overwatch.  Are they caring about League of Legends?  You have to watch these...  There he goes.  There's Lil Nas X going up into the roof on a giant mech hand, which actually is just projected on here.  But still, that's pretty cool.

Start time: 3745.80
End time: 3757.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's always going to be fragmented in a way...  Gaming is much more fragmented, isn't it?  It is.  Because you're always going to have a new developer coming out trying to put a product to market that's just going to push things forward.  I'm sorry.

Transcript:  No, I was just going to say Call of Duty Modern Warfare, which is essentially a big dumb movie.  I'm sorry.  This new one, Modern Warfare 2, the remake, reboot, whatever you want to call it.  That made $800 million last week.  That's Avengers end game level money, 100%.  This is huge business.  So if you're looking at League of Legends, don't look at this as like an extravagant silly thing they're putting on.  This is big business.  I can see that.  Keeping people hyped up.  One of the reasons I spend so much time speedrunning to the point where I have a PVM that I bought,  nice 20 inch PVM, one of the reasons I spend so much time speedrunning is that is exploding  as a legitimate sport.  I'm trying first spot with GDQ, Game Stone Quick, which is the Super Bowl speedrunning very soon.  I have an excellent shot of getting in.  So I think all these esports, it's always going to be more fragmented than  pick football, baseball, basketball.  It's never going to be like that, but there's certainly going to be these  towers where you have real competitors, people respect.

Start time: 3854.82
End time: 3890.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would not bet against it.  I think that the NFL puts a lot of money into things.  What's interesting about the NFL, basketball has become a very international sport.  The NFL is-  They're trying.  They're trying.  The NFL is trying, but it hasn't really gone that way.  It hasn't had to, to be frank.  There's still something compelling about it.  I think it depends.  I think that if things aren't handled right, it could fall off, but I would not bet against them  because there's still, even when you look at the ratings now, which are down,  honestly, the worst thing the NFL could do would probably be to do more things like the  Amazon Prime deal.  You think that was bad for them?  I do.

Start time: 3890.42
End time: 3893.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 3893.32
End time: 3904.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they did.  I think they will need to do things like that in the future, but I think that siloing  the thing into saying only people who are part of this can watch, I think that's the problem.  I think that they probably would need to syndicate across some of those things.

Start time: 3904.96

Transcript:  You have to have Amazon Prime to watch a football game.

Start time: 3908.93
End time: 3919.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  Which is different.  It's kind of what we were talking about with Twitter Blue and paying for a checkmark.  It's hard to ask somebody to pay for something that they're used to see it,  to having it in a totally different context.

Start time: 3919.98
End time: 3949.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Especially when the NFL also offers Sunday night tickets and other sorts of premium  products for people to get more games if that's what they want and to see more things.  I think that then when you say we're going to put this one game, it's one thing if it's on ESPN,  right?  Or if it's on Fox or ABC, you can make the calculus there, but then to say,  I have to be on this specific streaming service, I don't know.  There is a little struggle going on right now between Apple and the NFL.

Start time: 3949.94
End time: 3976.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple wanted the Sunday ticket, which is a thing DirecTV currently has.  Yes.  A billion and a half dollars they spent for this.  They lost their shirt on it, by the way.  They didn't make any money, so they said, we're not going to bid for this again.  Apple, Google, Amazon all have deep pockets from other sources, so they can afford to  spend a billion and a half a year or two billion a year on this thing, which is basically the Sunday  games.  Yep.  So you can watch any game.

Start time: 3976.56
End time: 3982.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  And now that they have a streaming app, NFL Plus.

Start time: 3984.80
End time: 4006.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's where maybe you could get better.  That's going to come down to certain broadcast licensing things, but those are things they'll  need to overcome, I think, if they want to survive in the decades will be to get out  of their own way.  They could mess it up.  They could mess it up.  But if they fix that, I think that the game is compelling enough and has a large enough  of a fan base that people would continue to be into football.

Start time: 4006.98
End time: 4033.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The battle between NFL and Apple is rumored to be, and we don't know exactly what's going on,  certainly Apple's offered them as much money as they could ever dream of.  But the battle apparently, according to sources, is that the NFL doesn't want to give up control.  Apple wants to be able to do more and interesting things as they should.  They're a technology company.  They want to play with streaming.  This could be very good for Apple TV Plus.  And the NFL says, well, I don't know.  I don't know.

Start time: 4033.70
End time: 4039.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Major League Soccer and Major League Baseball has made some connections too.  Nobody watches it over here.  But football, and part of the reason you could argue that the NFL has been so dominant in  American sports over the last 30 years is because the league has had such control for everything.

He said, there's Ed Sheeran talking to somebody from F1.  But he didn't know that standing in between them was Eddie Q.  I'm going, yeah, and?  Oh, no.  And?  They didn't know.  But Apple was there in force.  And I don't think Apple was there by accident.  No.  It was the same day ESPN announced.  Maybe they do have a documentary coming on Apple TV+.  I think Apple was also saying, we could help you guys.  We could.  We could do something with this.  Because it's a very technical sport.

Start time: 4120.84
End time: 4136.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a very technical sport.  It would be a lot of great things you could do with that.  And I think that, look, the reason that it has taken off in popularity is because of Netflix.  And because of ways that other people could come into understanding the backstories and get into it.  Because this was something that I was only tangentially...

They got so much freer time on the, you know, whatever network they had the relationships with.  That people would get sucked into the stories.  Right?

Transcript:  I'm interested...  Going back to the question of Riot and League of Legends, I feel...  The comparison to the NFL is interesting because I feel like  whatever form esports takes if it becomes massively popular like that...  I mean, it is already massively popular,  but I don't think it will be popular in the same format that football is.  I think that we have to envision a new way for these sports to be consumed.  And Riot is really doing a good job of making a game that is...  I was impressed.  ...completely inscrutable.  Yeah.  Interesting.

Start time: 4275.26
End time: 4282.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  I know...  I've been watching the play-by-play on League of Legends for about a decade  because it's gotten very professional, by the way.  It is...  The announcers are a hundred times better.  They are as good now as major league sports announcers.  They add excitement.  They know what they're talking about.  They sound like something exciting is happening,  even though it just looks like I don't know what.  And so they've improved that.  I notice they don't cut away to the players' faces very often anymore.  They all have cameras, but they don't show the players  because mostly the players are going...

So I do think they're improving a lot.  I'm very interested.  The only problem is if you're a League of Legends fan,  then you're not a Dota fan.  And if you're a Dota fan, then you're not an Overwatch fan.  But do we need to be?

Start time: 4360.58
End time: 4410.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because clearly there are huge audiences for these games.  Yeah.  They're all successful in their own way.  I would say Riot, what they've done really well is they have Arcane,  the animated series that's on Netflix.  It's a League of Legends show.  This isn't created by them,  but the American Vandal creators have a series called Players,  which is about a League of Legends team, an eSports team.  That's like a parody.  And Riot signed off on that.  It's not like a League of Legends show.  Do you think they want to DTS?  They are finding these different venues to make it accessible.  I think that'd be very interesting.  I mean, because these guys, they live in houses and train together.  It's like K-pop, essentially, where they're living in a dorm.  I understand there's probably reasons they wouldn't want to  televise that because I don't think it's a great standard of living.

It's like reality TV.  That being said, I do completely agree with Grant, Christina,  that it is the most effective onboarding tool for a sport that is very technical.  And it does allow people to understand what it's about  and then to go on and learn for themselves why I care about freaking tire compounds  and why that's something they never talk about in Drive to Survive.  But once you start watching the sport after being onboarded in this very gentle way,  you learn about these things and it becomes interesting to you.

Transcript:  And then, yeah, we've got an exclusive.  Because of the GitHub event coming up, I have got my GitHub badge, a hackable programmable badge.  Wow.  Martin, you created this for, this is kind of in the DEFCON style where you have a badge  that is more than just a piece of plastic with a name.  Yes.  I can't wait to find out what's in this.  That's exciting.  Thank you for bringing me this.  We'll show you this in a little bit.  But first, I want to show you something else.  My rocket money.  Have you, you guys know Truebill?  Yes.  Truebill is the greatest thing.  I subscribed to Truebill years ago.  Truebill finds your subscriptions, tells you what you subscribe to.  And often it's a surprise.

Start time: 4662.76
End time: 4669.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Truebill found it.  I inadvertently checked a box that said, make this a recurring campaign contribution.  Oh, no.  Literally thousands of dollars later.  And Truebill found it.  Thank God.  They saved me so much money.  Well, Truebill is now rocket money.  And I tell you, it is even better.  I am a huge fan.  Everybody watching this show, I guarantee you, is wasting money on a subscription they've  forgotten about that automatically renews.  And it's just kind of slowly drip, drip, drip drain in your bank account.  80% of people, according to Rocket Money, have subscriptions they've just forgotten about.  An unused Amazon Prime account, a Hulu account that you forgot you even had.  Maybe a magazine or a newsletter you subscribe to.  There's a great app.  This is the greatest app for tracking my expenses.  More than just, by the way, recurring expenses.  It does it all now.  Which is really good.  I get my net worth.  I get my recurring expense.  I can hook up all my accounts to this.  But it pays for itself because you're going to save money on subscriptions you've forgotten.  Most Americans think they've pulled them and think they spend about $80 a month on subscriptions.  The actual amount is closer to $200.  So that's a lot of people wasting more than $100 every month on subscriptions they don't  even know about.  You will see them and there's a button.  And you can cancel it.  It's so cool.  It'll find subscriptions you didn't know you were paying for.  Maybe you're getting double charged.  It'll find those too.  Just press cancel.  Rocket Money takes care of the rest.  And now with Rocket Money, I not only know about all my subscriptions,  I kind of have my budget done here.  I know what I spend.  I know what categories.  I get graphs.  I get how much I got paid.  It's all in there and it's fantastic.  I have to recommend this so highly.  It's so fantastic.  Thank you.  I think Rocket Mortgage people bought TrueBill and they've made it even better.  How many times have I found or canceled a subscription that saved me money?  So many times.  Don't cancel your ClubTWIT subscription though.  That's not okay.  But any other subscription or your Rocket Pro.  You keep that subscription.  That's a good thing.  There are things you want.  So it's good to know what you're subscribing to so you can get rid of things you don't want.  Like your Twitter Blue subscription.  Rocket Money, formerly known as TrueBill.  You can download it right now for iOS or Android.  You must have this at least to get rid of those useless subscriptions.  RocketMoney.com slash twit.  It could save you hundreds of dollars a year, maybe more.  Rock it saved me thousands.  I don't even know.  It was from 2018 that I've been paying this.  You know how they do this in ActBlue where you check the box and you kind of...  Oh yeah.  They're recurring and you forget.  And I forgot and it was a big check.  I was writing every month.  It wasn't my intent.  Rocket Money, thank you.  RocketMoney.com slash twit.  Cancel your unnecessary subscriptions right now.  Everybody listening, everybody watching, just get it.  RocketMoney.com slash twit.  It will pay for itself.  All right.  Brianna's been planning something.  I'm gathering it's a quiz.  Yeah.

Start time: 5196.69
End time: 5201.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5201.70
End time: 5213.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  So Christina, Leo scored a point free and fair.  So now we come to the complicating factor of this game, the Simone chaos questions.

Start time: 5215.10
End time: 5219.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Simone, she's unpredictable.  Is there garlic soup involved?  We don't know.

Start time: 5219.92
End time: 5247.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because that would be chaos.  It could literally be anything.  It could be anything.  So I've seen these questions.  I personally wouldn't ask any of them, but you can opt for the option and ask Simone  for a chaos question and ten points are on the line.  So you either get ten points or you will lose ten points based on-  What if we don't ask for a chaos question?  Then it just goes on.

Start time: 5249.28
End time: 5263.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So like at any point we can beg for a chaos question?  Is that out?  Yes.  Like a lifeline?  That's correct.  So like will you ask a question and then say, well, I don't want to answer that.  Give me the chaos question.  Is that-  No, it's after someone else scores.  Okay.  So you could ask now-

Start time: 5263.40
End time: 5279.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can now ask for a chaos question.  Yes.  Or I can ask for a regular question.  Yes.  All right.  How many points am I at now?  Am I at eight points now?  Seven.  You're seven points.  I'm at seven points to ten.  All right.  Let's go for a chaos question.

Start time: 5283.42
End time: 5286.79

Start time: 5288.52
End time: 5302.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would ask them in order so it's-  I'm worried about favoritism.  Okay, sure.  It's up to you.  Let me say about that.  I've done a show with Christina for a long time.  I asked, I put together questions that we have not talked about on the show  and I took that very seriously.

Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't actually know.  But before we do that, let me tell you about ITProTV.  And I hope you know how much we love ITProTV.  Don Pezet and Tim Broom founded ITProTV back in 2013  after going to an event at NAB that I was on a panel with Adam Kroll and others talking about  the future of video podcasting.  And Tim and Don were already trainers in a classroom, IT trainers.  And they said, wow, this would be a really cool way to do IT training.  Not tied to a school, not tied to your location.  You could watch it from anywhere.  It could be always up to date.  ITProTV was born.  That was nine years ago.  They've grown like crazy ever since.  Now they have that beautiful facility in Gainesville, Florida.  Seven studios operating all day, Monday through Friday,  creating new content because IT is always changing.  But with ITProTV, you're getting the best, latest training for people working in the field  who are real experts who share their passion.  If you've got a business, you've got an IT team,  this is a great thing you can give them to keep their skills and knowledge up to date,  to give them new skills to help your business on its way to success.  They will love it.  It is a benefit they will totally value.  And they will do it.  And that's the other thing.  I know probably there's some concern.  Well, I'm going to get this for them.  But are they going to do it?  Well, yes.  80%, more than 80% of the people on ITProTV who start a video actually finish it.  They're engaging.  They're fun.  People love them.  And your team is going to really value this.  You can monitor too.  They have a great dashboard which lets you assign seats and team members,  access monthly usage reports.  You get beautiful visual reports with information like logins, viewing time,  tracks completed.  You could justify it to the higher ups with these reports.  You'll get immediate insight into your team's viewing patterns.  And they've got training for everything.  5,800 hours of training in Linux and Cisco and Microsoft and Apple and security and cloud,  everything.  Not just technical skills, compliance skills, soft skills like marketing,  all the training, all the certs for your team in one place for one great price.  This is something that your team will appreciate  and you'll get the benefit of.  ITProTV.  They've got individual plans too if you're looking to get into IT.  But I really want to talk to the business people out there who have that IT team.  This is something that will keep them happy, keep them learning,  make them more valuable to you.  And that's a win all around.  ITPro.tv slash twit.  Give your team the IT development platform they not only need but they want to level  up their skills while enjoying the journey.  For teams of 2 to 1,000 go to ITPro.tv slash twit today.  And we thank them so much for their support and encourage you please to use that address  because that way they know they had some impact on you from this show.  And that helps us a lot.  ITPro.tv slash twit.  Another way you can help us a lot, Club Twit.  I know Rocket, you guys were just talking about Rocket Pro.  Yeah.  A great way to be a participant at Rocket.  We have something similar.  I think it was somewhat inspired by what you were doing and Mike's doing at Relay FM  and other people, especially these days.  Independent podcasts are under a lot of pressure from companies like Spotify, Amazon,  Apple who are creating podcast tiers where you use their apps to listen to podcasts.  Advertisers love that.  They love it.  That's why they charge so much for Joe Rogan, for instance,  because it's a Spotify exclusive.  That means they know exactly what you listen to, when you listen to it,  how much you listen to it.  They know who you are.  They know what your credit card number is.  Advertisers just love this.  And it makes it hard for us as any independent podcast that's RSS based to woo advertisers.  We're seeing a real decline in advertising.  We're very worried frankly about next year.  We're also getting pressure from Amazon which just announced  they're going to offer free podcasts, free ad-free podcasts to all Amazon Prime members.  We're getting squeezed on both ends.  Here's a way you can keep Twit going well into the future.  Just join Club Twit.  It's seven bucks a month.  You'll get ad-free versions of all the shows.  We don't need to sell ads to you because you've already given us the seven bucks a month we'd make.  That's a benefit for both of us.  It means we don't track you.  You also get the Twit Plus feed with a lot of content that doesn't show up in the shows.  There was a great conversation before this show that we'll put in the Twit Plus feed.  Plus podcasts we don't put out.  Micah Sargent does Hands on Mac with Club Only, members only.  We have Hands on Windows with Paul Thurrock, Club Only.  The Untitled Linux Show with Jonathan Bennett, the GizFizz with Dictee Bartolo,  Stacey's Book Club which we just did on Thursday.  All of that is for the club.  And the reason is we can't sell ads to it so we let the club support it.  You as a club member, you're supporting it.  You're making it possible.  Many of those shows we hope will eventually become big enough that we can  put them out in public.  That's what happened this week in space.  We were able to generate advertising revenue over time.  So you're supporting us in the development of new shows.  You get ad-free versions.  You get special shows.  And I didn't even mention, to me, the number one benefit is access to the Club Twit Discord  which is the most fun.  You maybe you heard me before the show.  People come on our shows, all of our hosts but also all of our visitors.  Oh, there I am getting a pie in the face.  All of our hosts and all our visitors have membership in the club.  And it's a great way to talk to people not just about the shows and the content of the shows  but everything geeks like to talk about because we have a huge number of sections on everything  from anime to autos to Linux to science to sports.  I bet you there's a little F1 conversation going on.  We've got TikTok Corner.  Thanks, Brianna.  All of that in the Club Twit Discord and you have exclusive access to it as a club member.  I think it's worth seven bucks a month.  A couple of cups of coffee.  We sure appreciate it if you're already a member.  Thank you.  And for those of you who aren't, just go to twit.tv slash club twit.  Be a great holiday gift for the geek in your life.  I just want to say there's also yearly plans and there's even corporate memberships  if your business would like to do that for your employees.  Twit.tv slash club twit.  Thank you in advance.  All right, Brianna has done the calculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Tony LaRusso, who was the manager of the Cardinals, I think, at the time.  But before that, the Oakland A's.  He sued Twitter because there was a Tony LaRusso impersonator.  Not illegal.  Nope.  There were a lot of people impersonating you and me and Jeff Jarvis and all sorts of people.  But he sued and Twitter said, we're going to win this one.  And I think they got the judge to drop it because there's just no.  It's a dumb thing.  It's a public figure.  But the very moment that they did this, they announced the blue check.  And it's thought that this was really because they realized there is a problem with the  impersonation.  And it should be the case that if you are following somebody on Twitter, there should  be a way of verifying that's really who they say they are.

Start time: 7293.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what, the website was much smaller at that point.  Was the tenor of the impersonation like different?  Did it feel different than it is now when there's like millions of users and the person  who's doing that is probably a bad actor.

Transcript:  No, we were there way before.  Like Twitter we were on like.  2006, 2007.  Yeah, so this is literally like for some people like a lifetime ago.  And it was, but Twitter was small then.  And so, you know, if you were able to grab the username, I guess you could pretend to  be someone that you weren't.  But also back then it seemed funny.  Like why would Britney Spears or Oprah or, you know, the president, why would they be  on Twitter?  Right.  Like I think like when the Tony LaRusso thing happened, like it wasn't as if there were a  lot of people who weren't, you know, early adopters in the tech space who were on this  thing.  Yeah.

Start time: 7361.46
End time: 7375.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of what I'm wondering about it.  Like because now it would obviously be a parody or something malicious.

I don't think there's any value to it because it goes by.  Right?  Who sees it?  And if you see it and you know what it is, then you're already listening to our shows.  I don't see any point to marketing on Twitter at all.  And I really baffles me that brands take this so seriously.  I always tell on the radio show, I always tell the audience, if you want to get action  because you have a consumer problem with a brand, just tweet at them.  They take it really seriously for no good reason.  No one's seeing that tweet.  It's not damaging their reputation.  Is it?  They see it because you're at them.  I don't know.  I think it can be.

Such a mistake.  No, it was great because people...  It was much faster to get in touch with people rather than calling.  You could tweet and you could get in the DMs and it was pre-ChatOps.  Right now, ChatOps is the thing that you would do.  You would do things on WhatsApp or iMessage or whatever the case may be, but you could  use Twitter for that and it was a great way for them to deal with customer complaints and  you could do things a lot faster than otherwise.  Also, there were moments because people would...  Things would go viral and this still happens where  customer service, customer fail incidents go viral and that's a nightmare for a company.

I feel like Twitter has somewhat lost its credibility.  Maybe I'm wrong.  By the way, this is going to happen to Facebook this week.  Thousands of employees will be laid off.

I hope certainly for anyone who's impacted by Facebook's layoffs that it goes is much  more similar to what Stripe did.  I think that it probably will be.

Transcript:  They've also hired.  There is the argument to be made that they were over hiring to a degree beyond.  Lyft just laid off a bunch of people.  Lyft, that's who it was.  It's interesting because we'll have to see how this shakes out.  It's harder when you see some of the really big companies doing it, but  there is still a shortage of tech workers.  We don't have enough people to have tech jobs, but that, I realize, is not at all  solace to anyone who's lost their job.  I'm not trying to say that it is, but we're in this weird situation where  you might have some of the bigger companies that have to get smaller,  but the industry itself is still throwing enough people.

Start time: 7818.20
End time: 7850.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a mix.  I think it depends on how long people have been in the industry and what their focus area is,  because it's obviously a really difficult time right now.  There's a lot of unease in the economy and I think everybody feels uncomfortable.  I don't know if anybody feels safe.  I think there's that sense, but I do also think that one of the reasons we've seen a  lot of people move into tech and upskill, you were mentioning one of your sponsors earlier,  teaching people skills, and this becomes a really important thing to continue learning  and continue growing so that you can take on jobs at other places as they come up.

Start time: 7850.44
End time: 7864.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to think in the long run, you have, as a developer or an engineer of any kind,  you have such a high level of skill and training in most cases, unless you're really junior.  You've got to be valuable to an economy that's run by technology.

Start time: 7865.04
End time: 7872.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  100%. But again, I think it comes down to how are you willing to continue learning and upskilling?  And this is what I tell people all the time and this is what I've tried to do myself.  You have to keep up to date.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you might. But also keep in mind that if everybody just stayed with COBOL and hadn't  learned other things, then we'd have a glut of people and not enough jobs for them.  Now it's very specialized. It's very specialized right now.  Whereas 20 years ago, that might not have been a great place. So I think now it becomes,  if what you're doing is, if you've become maybe overly comfortable, maybe just work on  upskilling if you need to learn a new area they're not familiar with or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think new frameworks, but also making sure that you're up to date on one of the latest  practices are. The development practices have changed a lot even in the last decade.  That's the good news. It's constantly changing.  That's one of the things I say to people too is that show that you're willing to learn. Show  that you're willing to evolve because even if you are going into a job and you don't know the  language, if you show, hey, I have the experience being able to pick things up really quickly and  I'm willing to put the work into it, that goes a long way.

Transcript:  Kevin Rose, his ears must be burning by now, always said that he hired somebody more for  their ability to learn, their interest in learning, not for their existing skill set,  but their desire to get...  Their intelligence, right? Because then you know you can learn another skill.  So if you're a Ruby developer and we're doing Python, but you have this desire to learn and  grow and you've always stayed up to date, then I'm going to hire you because I need somebody smart.  That's more important than somebody who knows Python because you can learn Python.

Start time: 7971.66
End time: 7986.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can learn Python. I think it becomes, are you willing to be agile in that way? Are you  willing to evolve? And some people...  Are not.  Right, which is okay. But I think that that's the thing that when I talk to developers,  we try to encourage, we want to continue learning. I know that's how I feel about my own career.

Transcript:  Finally is at the end for the fax machine. There is a, the UK telecoms regulator, Ofcom,  is considering whether to remove fax services from the list of technologies that requires  telecom communities to support. We've also heard a Japanese agency which used to require faxes  starting to think about maybe we won't require faxes anymore. There are still plenty of industries,  banking, home loans in the United States. It's amazing you buy a house, you have to fax a lot  of stuff. There's still companies that like those faxes. Is it the end of the line for the fax  machine?

Start time: 8058.11
End time: 8095.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  God, I hope so.  I was really confused by this piece because I guess I didn't understand. So you've got the  fax protocol, right? That's out there. What support do we need in 2022 from the telecom companies  for to support fax? That was the part of it I didn't understand. Is it mandated that certain  emergency services have to have a fax machine? I just, I don't like the, the protocol is mature.  I don't think it's probably being built on today. What do we need from telecom companies on this?

Start time: 8098.04
End time: 8141.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, that's the thing. But it's frustrating. I think the service went out of business,  but I subscribed for well over a decade, a fax to email system where basically I could email  to a certain number and they would fax it. So I would basically just say,  it was similar to that, but it costs less than those. But it was one of those things where I  could just say, okay, I can send you an email with the PDF attached and what number I need.  And then they would fax it for me. But yeah, at this point, I understand, I guess in theory  saying, oh, well, we all have these machines and it's this protocol, but can we all just use like,  you know, whatever the doc you sign or whatever those things are like.

Start time: 8141.24
End time: 8211.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wish more people would use that. I don't understand. That seems more secure.  A signature is not a very secure way to verify identity. I'm looking at the OFCOM,  the British regulators bulletin on this and they don't say what specific technologies,  but they point out that the many networks are migrating to IP technology, which means fax  services will no longer work in the same way on an IP network. So fax was always designed to work  as a sound over a voice network. Apparently, there's something about IP based networks  that doesn't work as well. The OFCOM says it doesn't, you don't have to, if you're moving IP,  that's fine. You don't have to worry about faxes. It reflects that the use of fax services in the  UK is very limited and there are a range of free or low cost alternatives available. Faxes were  created in Japan, I think, because you didn't have an easy way to print a document in Japanese.  So you could write it and then send it. I could also see it with like,

Start time: 8212.24
End time: 8225.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's plausible. There is that issue of not wanting to disadvantage people who don't have  a high level of technology. Australia tried to kill fax machines in hospitals two years ago.  Doctors would wait around to receive documents in the fax machine because at the time they  weren't computerized. They didn't have practice management software. They didn't have computers  in their room. Two years ago? Yeah, well, 2019, three years ago. Okay. I mean, it's weird that

Start time: 8253.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Brendan Carr, one of the five commissioners at the  Federal Communications Commission, told Axios in an interview that we should ban TikTok in the  United States. Fortunately, Carr has just won five. But does that seem FCC? I love Mike Madsen's  response, which is Carr, who has resolutely refused to do what the FCC is supposed to do,  which is protect privacy and safety with the telecom companies, instead wants to ban TikTok,  which he has absolutely no oversight of. The FCC has no authority to regulate TikTok.  Yep. Or should they? Or should they? You know, who does though is CFIUS,  the Council on Foreign Investment in the US, and he's saying they should ban it.  We don't agree with that. We were talking about TikTok and propaganda.

Transcript:  It's so... I think it's all Red Scare BS, frankly. I don't downplay... I think there is maybe an  ideological danger there, but I think it is massively overplayed. And I think honestly,  at its core, this is a reaction. So many of our large social networks in the US are US founded.  Obviously, that's very different in China, where there's a lot of state-owned social networks that  are massive that we don't have access to over here. I think this is a knee-jerk reaction of  fear to being like, oh, wait, this is tangentially... This is related to their social networks. We can't  have that here. And I don't know. It's very silly, I think. Yeah. I have to say I agree.

I do think there's national security stuff we have not thought about with social media. I was  talking about it earlier in the show. I think it carries over to TikTok. I also have to say,  I'm married to someone who has Chinese parents. I have Chinese relatives. I was just hanging out  with them this week. And just in China, there's a completely different approach to how they see  privacy and the way that... They take pride in their companies in a way that I don't hear us  talking about Facebook and Reddit. It's just not in the same way. And it is synonymous with the  government to a certain extent. So I don't want to dismiss those fears. I just want a standard  Facebook and Reddit and all these other sites are held to as well. I do think we need to start  thinking about NatSec. I do think we need to start thinking about your control of your own data over  there. And I just think there's a wider conversation to be had here. Fair enough. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of the bothersome things to me about TikTok is that there has been some evidence that it looks  like it's essentially kind of a keylogger. A lot of the things that the app does to track you,  which I think is really gross. Do I think that the government should be getting involved in  banning it for whatever reasons? That I don't really agree with. But if there are things,  for instance, happening on a platform level where they're doing things that they're not disclosing,  then honestly, that is a great opportunity for Apple or Google to kind of step in and saying,  hey, you're not disclosing this or this information that is getting to you.  To ban them from the app store.  Well, yeah, because here's the thing. If you're essentially doing a keylogger and doing everything  that people are doing within that app and capturing every minute option, you're not  letting people know that. That I think- That violates the app store rules.  Exactly. So that to me is really problematic. And I understand that there might be some concerns  about the way that these platforms could be leveraged and used by foreign parties. But I  don't know. I'm not ever going to think that our government has the capability to enforce these  things the right way or understand the technology well enough. Or that we want to give them that

And I do see it, as you said, Christina, as a related problem,  because it's a social media wide problem where we are choosing to get our news from  these very niche non-expert sources and it's not TikTok specific at all.

Transcript:  It's funny. Carr is scared because TikTok is owned by the Chinese government,  but I'm more with you, Christina. I'm scared because the algorithm is so spot on.  Yes.  I was talking to my daughter who was 30. She said... I said,  people don't use TikTok for search.  Yeah, they do.  She said, oh yeah, they do. She said, try it.  Oh yeah.  I said, well, look, what if I want to know how old the Golden Gate Bridge was?  She said, just try it. I searched TikTok and I found a bunch of videos on the building of  the Golden Gate Bridge, how old the Golden... So yeah, so I could see why maybe the same way  you'd search YouTube for some information, you might search TikTok.

Start time: 8847.12
End time: 8854.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

In China, you can use Douyin at discounts at restaurants,  and you can find restaurant recommendations and read reviews all through the app.  And it is used for search in that way.  That is a China-only...  I think a potential development of TikTok. Yeah, yeah. Sorry.

Start time: 8874.56
End time: 8896.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She also pointed out that, and I'm talking to now a number of people who have multiple  TikTok accounts because the algorithm is so good that if they want to see cooking videos  on their one account, that's all they're going to ever see.  So if they want to see something else, they'll have another account that's for the car videos.  Do you do that, Christina? You're not.

Start time: 8902.44
End time: 8923.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so good that anything you do on it... My daughter says, oh, if you see a video that  doesn't have this content free, don't waste, don't mop for one second. Swipe immediately,  because the algorithm will know that you watched this, even if it's for a second.  And that will prioritize some kinds of videos by doing that.

Start time: 8924.52
End time: 8945.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's interesting to juxtapose that with YouTube, which YouTube is basically based on  what you're recently into. It has some historical things, but YouTube will show you similar things  to what you've been searching for in the last few days, few weeks. But it will change over time,  because as you search for different things, it'll show you those new things you're obsessed with.  Whereas TikTok, yes, it does seem to keep you in the same...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like a flywheel. It's instant, it's fast, and it's strong.  She says she thinks she notices different response depending on the time of day.  Like, if you had one account, what you watch in the morning, you're to see again in the morning,  what you watch in the evening, you're to see again in the evening. And I wouldn't put it past...  Maybe it's too good an algorithm. So I'm more afraid of that than I am of China.

Transcript:  Can I posit something from a 30,000 foot video? If you think about humans through all of history,  we are overdosing on dopamine in a way in modern life, in a way that is completely  unprecedented through all of human history. Think about just access to looking at beautiful  people online. Like you would have had to be a pharaoh or a queen in Egypt to have anything  compared to what a 12 year old boy can get today online all the time. We have so much dopamine.  The Twitter algorithm is like wired. The reason Christina and I are so addicted to it is because  it is fine tuned to addicting us. What you're talking about with TikTok, this is so awesome  at getting you to stay in this flow and watch these cute videos. And it's not a negative  experience in the same way. Dopamine, dopamine, dopamine. At some point, we have to start asking  ourselves, okay, so the algorithm, we can tailor this to give us tons of dopamine. We know that.  At what point do we start asking questions like, is this good for society? Is this affecting  national security? Is this leaving us lonely? Or does this make us vulnerable for misinformation?  I do think that there needs to be more transparency with the way these algorithms are used by these  companies because right now they're geared for one thing, addiction. And it's not serving our  culture well. And I do think it's time to take that seriously. How would you do that if you were  going to enact a law? I ran for Congress trying to do this. I wanted to serve on the Science,  Space and Technology Committee and have hearings on these algorithms. I would like to bring in  smart people to look at more public disclosure about how they tweak those things. I do think

So you just keep going forward in time  for however many seasons you can do that. It's so much easier now to sell that limited content,  six episode, 10 episode thing. And if it does very well, you'll come up with an excuse to bring  it back for season two. What was that? That Watcher's Show on Netflix, which is terrible.  Don't waste your time on that. But it's just a trend with rather than moving towards these  extremely expensive shows like Westworld, something that's smaller in scope, cheaper to produce.  That's just like everyone involved is telling me. That's why we're streaming this going.

Transcript:  It's really changed the equation because it isn't ratings driven, it's subscriber driven.  Right.  So apparently Netflix is going to offer this ad-supported tier, which is smart because  then it's only a $5 a month subscription instead of $15 a month and you get ads.  Although I did see that they are not letting some of their most popular shows on the ad,  like The Crown, will not be available on the ad-supported tier.

Start time: 9570.84

Transcript:  They're also not going to be doing, at least they're not going to be doing ads in the middle of  films, but some of their creators like Shonda Rhimes, they don't want because they're not  creating shows to be interrupted. Ryan Murphy, who's very smart, I think, and a very good producer,  creates his shows with a three act structure. So he's said that he's okay with it.  I actually think that's been a problem with streaming services. HBO again is different here  because they've still made shows with a beginning, middle, and end. But when you go to an era where  the amount of runtime could be inconsistent and when you were creating shows to be streamed and  binge watch and watch the next episode immediately after, I think that that does not play well with  ad-supported content because it ruins the flow. And so this is now going to, I think a lot of  showrunners are going to have to learn what the previous seven decades of television producers knew,  which was, okay, we have to make things that can have break points.

Transcript:  Let's take a little break because we're going to go to act 18 of this show. It's great to have the  Rocket Crew on and I hope you listen to their show at Relay.fm. We've introduced a whole new  group of people to something that is really a wonderful show with  Simona Rochefort and Christina Warren and Brianna Wu. And we're so glad to have you,  the three of you. Coming up, I will get hit by a pie. So I know you're all going to want to stay  tuned for that. Our show today brought to you by Podium. It's pretty clear among the others.  What we talk about on all our shows is how technology is changing our world very dramatically.  And sometimes it happens and you don't notice it. Then you suddenly wake up and for instance,  who makes phone calls anymore? We text. We text. And more and more businesses are realizing  this is the way to interact with our customers. Customers prefer this. Maybe COVID taught us a  little bit when you would make a place an order and then they would text you your order is ready.  And then I'd say, I'm on my way and pick it up on the curb. And we just got easier and easier  and easier. If you own a small business, you really need to look at Podium. It is a way to  keep ahead of the curve by using the tools your customers want you to use, modern messaging tools.  So it's easier for customers to connect with your business. It's easier for you to connect  with your customers. You know, I will tell you as a customer, I don't want to call a business,  whether it's a plumber, a landscaper, a restaurant, a dentist. I hate playing phone tag. I hate  leaving messages. I'm never available to talk on the phone. I'm always available for a text message.  So if you're a business that communicates with me via text message, you're going to get my business.  If you're running a business today and the only way to get in touch with you is a phone number,  I guarantee you, you're losing customers. Customers who get that answering machine  get that service and go, yeah, no, nevermind, hang up. Podium gives businesses the tools to compete  with the convenience already offered by, you know, Amazon's already doing this.  The big businesses are doing this. But now as a retail business in a small town like ours,  you can make such a huge difference. You know, I know that many of the people I do business with  now are using Podium. My dentist, when I'm leaving, they say your next appointment and they give me the  date in a way that I can click it. It goes into my calendar. And then this is so smart. Leave us a  review on Yelp or Google or whatever. I click it, I leave the five stars. It's fast, it's easy,  it really works. But it isn't just reviews. It's not just information. One car dealer actually,  in fact, I think this happens all the time, sold a $50,000 truck and four text messages. You see  this all the time now where a dealer will text somebody, hey, I just got the new Mustang Mach-E  in stock. Are you interested? It works. A jeweler sold a $5,000 ring coordinated curbside pickup all  through text, not once on the phone, right? A dentist sent out payment requests through text,  got 70% of their outstanding collections in just two weeks. Yeah, you can actually get payments  through Podium. And your employees will like it because instead of a variety of different ways  to communicate, you got one inbox, everything goes into it from your website, from text messaging.  You can do more than chat. You can get those online reviews. You can collect payments. You  could send marketing campaigns that get a response. It's so easy, it's so fast. And your customers  want you to communicate with them that way. See how Podium can grow your business. You can see  a demo today right now at podium.com slash twit, P-O-D-I-U-M dot com slash twit. And give it a shot.  I think you will see this will change the way you do business, change the way you interact  with your customers. Over 100,000 local businesses now use Podium. You should too. Podium, P-O-D-I-U-M  dot com slash twit. Podium, let's grow. Let's grow. All right, I got to open this. I can't,  I can't put this off any longer. This is so cool.

And Apple's  decided that putting more gambling ads in the app store is really the way to make them.  That went really bad, really fast. Mark Armens twitted, now my app's product page shows gambling  ads, which I'm really not okay with. The app store has corrupted such a great company so deeply. They  make so much from gambling and the manipulative in-app purchases. They don't even see the problem

And right now it's almost too close to call. They're going up and down,  but it really seems too close to call. So I hope your team wins. Lady, lady, I hope your team wins,  whatever team that might be. But I think the most important thing to tell everybody is you need to  vote. You need to vote. And I think we, as geeks, we often think, cause we're smart. It doesn't  matter. It's all rigged. Most of these people are awful anyway. There's all sorts of rationales.  It's too complicated. It takes up too much time. I don't want to, but honestly, if you don't vote,  you don't get to complain. If you don't vote, you don't have a say. It may not be a perfect system,  but it's the system we've got and we need you to vote, please. Every one of you. So,  except if you're under 18. So go ahead. So if you, it's too late if you haven't registered,  but if you have and you've got that ballot in hand, everybody in California gets mailed a ballot,  but if you get that ballot in hand- Washington State as well. Yeah. So I've already voted,  even though I'll be here. Good. So I've already sent mine in. In fact, John, looks like you sent  yours in. He's got his big sticker. I'm going to wear mine on Tuesday, but you can save your  sticker, John, and you wear it on Tuesday. But I can't say how important this is.  If it goes really bad, this could be your last chance to vote ever. So please, I beg of you,  exercise your right to vote. And I'm not telling you how to vote. You vote your conscience. You  vote what's right. Do your research. Really, don't listen to other people. Don't listen to  propaganda. Do your research. Find out who's best, especially in your local election, because that's  where it really counts. But do absolutely please, I beg of you, vote. And I know, Breanna, you feel  the same way. I sure do. And I will be listening on SiriusXM on Tuesday, because I'd love to hear  what you think. It'll either be a celebration or- Yeah. Or something. Hey, Simone, I'm sorry  about the fingers, but I'm so glad that you are so creative. It was so much- I love those chaos  questions, even though I don't understand them at all. I mean, that's the beauty. Nobody understands  me. You're great. Thanks. You work, supervising video producer Polygon. What kind of videos you do?

We've had some fantastic ones this year.  My colleague, Pat Gill, made one basically looking at the entire history of the Call of Duty franchise  and how it evolved from this Steven Spielberg-esque World War II story into something that is  intrinsically tied to the military industrial complex or more accurately, the military  entertainment complex in the United States. Some really interesting stuff there. And since we're  such a small team, we now have a lot more leeway to spend time on these projects and really make  them special. So I hope that you enjoy our videos. Are you just on camera or do you get to-  Listen, pal, we're such a small team. We pitch, research, write, shoot, edit, and host our own

Transcript:  Darn right. Thank you. So Leah, before we end the show, I wanted to make you aware of something.  For me, I'm really big into speed running. I know you're a big Valheim player. I was looking at this  for the speed run category for Valheim. There are only four people, only three people who have ever  bothered speed running that game. So if you record yourself playing,  beginning to end, the fastest time is three hours and 38 minutes. I have 600 hours now on  Valheim. I haven't finished. I'm just saying if you record it, you can submit it and you will be  one of the leaders there. Okay. And what do I get? Do I get pie? You get pie. Yes. Notoriety, fame.

We are now in standard time.  You can watch us live, live.twit.tv. Chat with us live at irc.twit.tv or in the Discord if you are  a Club Twitter member. After the fact, on demand versions of all our shows available on the website,  twit.tv. There's a YouTube channel for this week in tech and all of the big shows as well. You can  watch shows there.
