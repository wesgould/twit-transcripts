Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We do not want to dilute the fine bourbon.  So, I think Ohm, you get to pride a place for the scoop of the week.  Earlier this week, you announced that TechCrunch was going to be sold to AOL.  That was a week exactly a week ago because the next morning,  Mike Harrington takes the stage with some AOL suit and confirms.  How did you know?  It's my job, isn't it?  It is.  Are you happy to see TechCrunch go to AOL?

Start time: 211.72
End time: 231.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm very happy for Michael.  I think he's worked really hard for it.  So, yes, definitely happy.  I don't think they're going away.  You know, unlike a lot of people, I don't believe, you know, that's the last we've heard of TechCrunch.  This is just a different, you know, parent company.  Just, they'll be business like people there.

Start time: 231.98
End time: 254.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, in their defense, they have Engadget.  They own Engadget.  They haven't ruined Engadget.  It's still the same great place it always was.  Joystick.  Joystick.  Yeah, they've got a lot of content.  TMZ.  There's a blog you'd like to change, but they haven't.  Nevertheless, you wonder how Mike is going to get along with the suits.

Start time: 256.13
End time: 266.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny.  The night home broke that story.  I had dinner with the third shareholder in TechCrunch, Keith Teer.  He says he thinks Arrington will do very well in a big company.

Start time: 267.22
End time: 270.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's been blogging already about the meetings.

Start time: 272.21
End time: 273.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's sort of funny, you know.

Start time: 273.88
End time: 330.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no, and Mike has a great sense of humor.  I hope he has a great sense of humor.  You saw the geek culture Joy of Tech comic on the day it went down.  It says, Mike Arrington's first day at AOL.  Hey, do you have any stolen documents I can post up?  By the way, his t-shirt says, you've got Mike.  And when can I start work on the AOL pad?  Sheesh, you mean to say you jerks only work 10 hours a day here?  What slackers?  Holy crap, there's some people eating lunch together.  This is collusion.  AOL must be planning to control the flow of the Internet.  It's AOL gate.  What a scoop.  Tim, he's talking to the CEO.  I'm just reading my contract.  I see obnoxious, arrogant and a-hole are on the OK list.  But can I still remain an Internet blowhard?  Finally.  Screw this, I can't wait three years.  He kicks them out.  Of course, that's fiction.  But I think a lot of people are saying,  I wonder how long before Mike just rubs somebody in the wrong way.

Start time: 330.08
End time: 333.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he has quite a few million reasons to stick around for three years.

Start time: 333.85
End time: 334.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How much do you think?

Start time: 335.08
End time: 341.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the rumor, and tell me the latest rumors,  but the rumor was 25 million cash and 40 million with the earn out.

Start time: 342.20
End time: 343.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Total of a 40, not 25 plus 40.

Start time: 344.04
End time: 353.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does that sound right to you, Om?  That's the rumor I've heard, but I don't know anything.  Isn't that a lot?  It could be a lot more.

Start time: 354.12
End time: 358.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, other people are like, wow, Mike could have gotten more for that.  I don't know.

Start time: 359.12
End time: 368.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, I don't know the exact value, so I wouldn't even say  that's the right number.  It could be higher, it could be lower.  I do not know, so I probably would speculate.

Start time: 369.12
End time: 373.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't see Mike going for less than Jason Calacanis sold Weblogs, I think.

Start time: 373.38
End time: 375.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Weblogs went for 130.  No, it's 28.

Start time: 376.12
End time: 378.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the 28 round.  Oh, OK, I thought it was more.

Start time: 379.20
End time: 400.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's a very simplistic view of thinking about things, Robert.  I think Michael is, at the end of the day, a smart businessman,  and he would have made a right smart business decision with this sale.  I don't think he's sitting there, and it's not as much of an ego sale,  but it's more of like, what's the maximum return I can get?  Right.

Start time: 401.24
End time: 415.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Talk about ego.  Cringely says, well, I think it's 7.5 million,  because that's all I was worth when I was talking to Eoin.  I don't know, I think that sounds like rank jealousy.  What is Mike saying his revenue is on TechMachines?

Start time: 415.28
End time: 418.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in Ink Magazine was saying 10 million.

Start time: 418.30
End time: 420.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow, that's a lot for a blog.

Start time: 420.36
End time: 422.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if that's true.  See, that's the kind of thing.

Start time: 422.30
End time: 452.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like unreal fake money.  When people throw out numbers like that, at the end of the day,  what's the value that they're going to get back?  I mean, a lot of people say they make $2 million in ad revenue,  and Leo, you sell ads, and you have an audience,  and you know how hard it is to get that ad revenue coming in.  So, I mean, it's still blogged at the end of the day,  and AOL being behind it, great.  We'll see what happens.  I mean, he got his paycheck, he worked hard, he busts his butt.  He's walking around, bags underneath his eyes all the time,  like he has no sleep, and you know.  He didn't look good at the disrupt city.  Hopefully now he gets to take a nap or something,

Start time: 453.48
End time: 457.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because he really looks very tired.  He walks around like he's on his deathbed.

Start time: 457.46
End time: 463.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if this check gives him some peace of mind,  then good on him, at least for that.  But the value of things, I mean...

Start time: 463.58
End time: 467.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this the beginning of a land grab, a gold rush for content?

Start time: 468.44
End time: 477.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think Ohm?  Most of his revenues came from events.  It was events, like disrupt.  And like Ohm is building, you guys have lots of cool events, right?

Start time: 477.54
End time: 490.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do have events, we have research,  you know, we have advertising,  so we have three different revenue streams.  So, you know, definitely not banking on just one revenue stream  to grow our business.  Yeah.

Start time: 491.54
End time: 499.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Inside baseball, I want to spend a huge amount on it,  but since you broke the story, Ohm,  and everybody here knows Mike  and has some sort of relationship with him...

Start time: 499.58
End time: 519.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mike was actually pissed that you broke the story,  which was funny.  He wanted to break it, I'm sure.  Well, he told me they were planning on announcing it  the night afterwards.  So he had to announce it at disrupt.  Yeah, well, they had to announce it in the morning  and they had to move Tim's flights around  and all sorts of fun stuff.  So congrats, Ohm, for disrupting disrupt.

Start time: 520.76
End time: 521.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nice job.

Start time: 522.37
End time: 603.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody had to do it, right?  If not me, somebody else would have done it.  So I think the more important thing is this is good for his team,  it's good for him.  It's a validation for this market more than anything else.  I remember five years ago,  Leo, you know this really well,  that five years ago people kind of joked about blogs  and I didn't take them very seriously  and everything was just,  especially the mainstream media dismissed them  as just a bunch of hoo-has and here you are,  you know, and a few million reasons to think otherwise.  I think that is what is the key takeaway from this.  I think between Mike and Rafat Ali,  who built and sold paid content,  I think we've proven that there is an opportunity  in this new kind of media,  you know, that some of us are trying to create  and I think it's working.  Because, you know, I mean, look,  at the end of the day,  AOL wouldn't have bought TechCrunch  if they didn't think there was value in it.  Nobody likes to spend money,  especially somebody as smart as Tim Armstrong  would spend money on something without really thinking through,  through the financial upside to that.  So I think, you know, people are being pretty dismissive  of the intelligence of the people involved in this transaction.

Start time: 604.53
End time: 612.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not the people I talk to.  Most of the entrepreneurs I've gotten around to this last week  have said this makes AOL very interesting.  Oh, really?

Start time: 612.84
End time: 617.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So was it good?  I'll tell you, 40 million to make AOL more interesting,  it's worth every penny.

Start time: 618.84
End time: 650.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was the platform, was it Newsweek,  that sold for like $5 million?  Yeah.  And you look at that and you're like,  wow, it's Newsweek.  Like, you know, I can go to my grandmother  and I can say TechCrunch and she'll just keep walking  and not know what I'm talking about.  I say Newsweek, she's like, oh, Newsweek,  I'm going to go to my grandmother and she'll just keep walking.  And that's the thing that gets me about the evaluation of things.  I mean, not that he doesn't deserve  the amount of money that he got.  It's just how do you go from a staple in a natural culture  and an icon of a company?  I mean, granted, that is the dinosaur paperback, whatever,

Start time: 651.92
End time: 668.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but, and then you go in triple, quadruple,  quintuplet, the value for a block.  Well, Leo's talked a lot about this,  that the disruption that's happened in media  in the last 10 years is extreme.  Which is nothing compared to a television studio, as you know.  Yeah, on tech TV you spend a million dollars on a set.

Start time: 669.06
End time: 672.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a million just for a set.  A million for a control room.

Start time: 673.30
End time: 685.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this represents a huge disruption in media, right?  The fact that Mike, out of his bedroom,  can write a blog and build it into something  that now is worth more than Newsweek.  That's pretty amazing.

Start time: 686.02
End time: 687.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a great stado.  And Olin has a company.

Start time: 688.10

Start time: 690.67
End time: 690.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  About 25.

Start time: 692.17
End time: 699.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  25 people are working for Olin.  He started in his bedroom.  You quit your job out of mainstream news  and started writing a blog, right?

Start time: 699.69
End time: 739.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  June 2006.  I think my answer to that comment is that, you know,  50 years ago, Lifebuoy was a great brand.  Kodak was a great brand.  Well, great brands have shelf value  in historical and cultural context.  And I think the cultural context is the internet  to digital media.  And from that perspective, you know,  TechRange is valued more than Newsweek.  I mean, Newsweek hasn't really done anything  to be valued higher, right?  Like, it's been on the wrong side of the media equation  for a very long time.  So that just is it.

Start time: 740.38
End time: 744.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's why AOL starts buying stuff  because they're pretty much dead  in the mindset of what they do.

Start time: 745.16
End time: 747.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've made themselves relevant.  You know, they may not be done.

Start time: 748.56
End time: 762.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not done, but I'm saying to that point  of older companies that aren't really doing that much  as far as the AOL branding.  They are buying things.  They do have properties underneath of them.  But I mean, when I tell people I still use AIM,  they laugh at me.  And I'm like, a lot of people still use AIM.  Seriously.  People do.

Start time: 763.36
End time: 768.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm like, whoa.  What do you use AIM?  What?  Now you're cool, man.  AIM?  TMZ and...

End time: 786.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look, nobody bothers me on AIM.  I got my high school friends on there,  and I got close friends.  There's some big important people, Uncle Leo,  that still use AIM.  No, I have an AIM account.  People come stalk you on Skype and everything else.  Nobody's looking for me on AIM.  I'm in a cocky room.

Transcript:  Ohm, what do you think about this?  Because I have my iPad in front of me.  I have 22,000 people flowing into my iPad.  And I can refresh it and read those people.  That's a huge disruption of itself, right?  The fact that we can listen to people all over the world  that we want to listen to,  and we can see tens of thousands of them on the screen  and...

Start time: 833.62
End time: 947.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I want to talk actually about...  You're right.  And this is going to segue into Larry Lessig's  really, I thought, great article in The New Republic.  He published it on Saturday.  It's his not exactly review of the social network,  the Facebook film.  I think we should talk a little bit about that.  But he says that Aaron Sorkin, David Fincher,  missed the point of what happened at Facebook.  And it's relevant to this point.  So I want to talk about that in just a second.  Before we do, I also want to talk about our friends at Ford  and the incredible Ford Fiesta.  I thought we were going to talk about the Edge today,  so I went out and drove the Edge.  I'll tell you what.  Ford is crushing it.  They are knocking it out of the park.  I drive a 2010 Mustang.  Couldn't be happier.  This is a car that is solid.  It feels good.  It is great to drive.  And now they've got this incredible Ford Fiesta.  40 miles per gallon highway.  And it's not a hybrid.  It is a gas engine.  It's this 1.6 liter Duratec.  I'm going to say this because I always hate it when Connie Chung says  that was the best dose.  And I'm going to be like that because I don't know anything about engines.  But I'm going to read this.  Duratec TI-VCT I4 engine.  Does that sound right?  I'll tell you what.  I got in the car.  I drove the Fiesta.  It is peppy.  It is so cute.  I'm a little bit better to judge that.  It is so cute.  And it is a great car.  Standard features like the easy fuel capless filter.  I've got that on my 2010 Mustang.  I love that.  You never lose the cap.  You just press the thing and it opens up.  And you put the thing in and the thing goes in the thing.  This is standard.  4-inch multifunctional display with LCD screen.  This optionally heated leather trim seats.  Power shift, six-speed automatic transmission.  And my favorite.  And you got to get this.  The Ford SYNC.  They call it my Ford Touch now.  The in-car communications and connectivity system.  Have you tried it?

Start time: 949.56
End time: 960.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Mine on Android will read my text messages.  It's pretty fun.  I've got to record this so you can hear it.  I've got somebody send me a dirty text message just to hear  what it would sound like.  It's a female voice.  Oh baby, oh baby, I love you.  It's great.  I was laughing all the way home.  I love my Ford Mustang.

The 2011 Ford Fiesta with a package that looks good and  mileage you won't believe it is.  I think, let me check.  I think EPA said this was the highest estimated highway  mileage of any compact car.  There's no other more fuel efficient compact car.  I presume that includes the hybrids.  40 miles to the gallon.  Drive one this week at a dealer near you.  And if you haven't seen the YouTube video, the Lamborghini  versus Fiesta, go see that on YouTube.  It is hysterical.  I'll put a link in the show notes.  Stop by a Ford dealer this week and drive the all new 2011  Ford Fiesta.  I think I'm supposed to say this from the legal department.  EPA estimated 29 city, 40 highway, 33 compiled MPG,  automatic SFE.  I don't know what that means.  I know you are.

Even if you're not getting a good education, you're not learning a second language, you're  also not learning a trade or a skill because there aren't trade and skill jobs for us to  do.  We sit here and I can run my mouth and make money.  That's not really a skill.  If the world came falling down, I can't put together a car or engineer anything.  That's our real problem.  We don't build our own stuff.  We don't take care of our own.  We outsource everything for cheaper and better.  We don't even talk on our own phones anymore.  We send it to India.

Transcript:  So he's the internet generation.  He's the digital generation.  He'll never know a world without the internet.  Okay, so what do we do?  What I'm telling our local high school is teach kids to be entrepreneurial.  Teach them, they cannot, as we did, count on a job when they get out of school.  They may have to make their own job.  However, the good news is, and this is the Larry Lessig article, there's never been a better time to be entrepreneurial.  He says the story, as a story about Facebook, the movie is deeply, deeply flawed.  He says this after saying what a good movie is.  As I watched the film and considered what it missed, it struck me that there was more than a hint of self-congratulatory contempt in the motives behind how this story was told.  Imagine a jester from King George III's court charged in 1790 with writing a comedy about the new American Republic.  That comedy would show the new republic through the eyes of the old.  It would dress up the story with familiar figures and aristocracy or wannabe aristocracy with grand estates, but none remotely as grand.  As England.

Transcript:  And basically that's what that movie was.  It was old media saying, don't worry about the internet, it's a bunch of anti-social creeps.  They're fighting amongst themselves.  It was very anti-geek, it was very anti-woman.  But this is the thing.  And this is what I'd like your comment on.  Again, Larry Lessig writing in the New Republic.  The most frustrating bit of the social network is not, or is I should say, it's failure to even mention the real magic behind the Facebook story.  In interviews given after making the film, Sorkin boasts about his ignorance of the internet.  Boasts! Colberry said, I don't know anything.  This ignorance shows.  This is like a film about the atomic bomb, which never even introduces the idea that an explosion produced through atomic fission is importantly different from an explosion produced by dynamite.  What's important in Zuckerberg's story, not that he's a boy genius, he plainly is, but many are.  Not that he's a socially clumsy relative to the Harvard elite boy genius, every one of them is.  And it's not that he invented, it's not that he invented an amazing product through hard work and insight that millions love.  That's the history of American entrepreneurism from 1776 on, with different technologies.  Instead, what's important here is that Zuckerberg's genius, this is the key, I know there's a lot of words, but this is the key.  Zuckerberg's genius could be embraced by half a billion people within six years of its first being launched without asking permission of anyone.  He didn't have to go to Harvard and said, can I start this? He took a thousand dollar investment.  He did not have to get permission. He did not have to work his way through a distribution system.  He was able to start Facebook because he felt like it, because he thought of it, because he could do it, because he stole it.  And that's the other side of this that I hated about the movie.  I'm just asking, when you have lawsuits and you pay people money, people are paid money for some reason.

As soon as you get on top, everybody wants to take you down, Uncle Leo. You know what it is. I'm coming after this cottage.  Lesick says to his credit.  That's what I'm talking about.  We're taking over, Leo.  Me and ScobleTron.  We're kicking you out.  I'll just leave. That's fine.

Transcript:  I'm spraying it all behind the curtain.  I'm taking my ball and I'm leaving.  We're painting the cottage black tomorrow.  Lesick says to his credit, Sorkin gives Zuckerberg the only lines of true insight in the film. In response to the Winklevoss lawsuit, he says, does a guy who makes a really good share owe money to anyone who ever made a chair?  No.  And to his partner, to Eduardo, who signed away his ownership in Facebook, you're going to blame me because you were business head of the company and you made a bad business deal with your own company.  Which is true.  The point is, and it kind of goes back to the school issue, is we have, this is an amazing time, an amazing opportunity.  That's what I'm doing.  I started in mass media when you had to get permission from somebody.  You had to go to a radio station owner or a television station owner or a movie company.  He says, why don't the movie guys should know this better than anybody?  The movie industry, you can't go one step without permission from some idiot capitalist who's holding the checkbook.  And that's what's amazing about this internet generation is that you don't need permission.  You just do it.

Like where between, you know, like for every Facebook and Twitter, there's a lot of companies who don't make it.  For every TechCrunch, there is a lot of companies who don't make it.  Let's not get too carried away by the upside of the entrepreneurship, right?  There is a downside to it.  But I do agree there is a lot of tools out there.  There is much easier.  There are more standards.  The open source software is out there.  There is a lot of things which make it easy to go and start your...  You got to agree there is more opportunity than ever before.

I mean, back in 2000, 2001, you had everybody that was an email marketing specialist.  And then the economy bounced back a little bit and people went back to their jobs.  I mean, in a way.  Now everybody's a social media guru, specialist, living in the town's basement.  Well, that's pathetic.  That's just pathetic.  Come on, Leo is the social media guy.  That's just pathetic.  But all those people go away when the economy gets a little bit better and they'll go back and have a job.  You know, heaven forbid social media is giving people some money.  Do people.  As much as it's pathetic, I mean, people are making money from that.  And if you don't know how to drive a car, Leo, and I tell you how to drive a car, now you get in a car and you drive it.  It's so easy.  But you didn't know how to drive a car.  No, that's true.  So, I mean, as much as you say it's silly.  I mean, trust me, I'm in that industry a little bit.  I'm trying to get out of it fully.  But there are people that don't know and they're willing to pay to learn.  And as long as you don't treat them like a little child and say, let me tweet for you because it's too hard.  You know, if you can just educate them and send them on their way, take your money and go, that's fine.

There's been a lot of stories that have been written about Facebook that are fiction and make it seem like what we did were interesting in different ways.  But what I tell everyone at the company is we shouldn't be that focused on things like that.  We can't be focused when people try to say things that aren't true.  It's one thing to say that, it's another thing to know that a movie is coming.

And so I celebrate that.  And when I'm critical of Facebook, I'm critical as we would be of anything.  This is part of our life, but we want them to do better.  It's interesting.

It's a Stanford graduate student.  It's smart people, right?  One of the guys who started Cool, which failed.  So they're really expert at search engines.  And it's beautiful.  He won TechCrunch Disrupt.  So a lot of people were around me going, my God, that's the coolest thing I've seen.  And I was like, it's cool looking, but I don't know that I'll use it after the first five minutes of playing with it.  And so I had this argument with this guy.  But he was just like Mark.  He was trying to explain what his company does and why it's cool.  This is called creativity.

Everything that happens that's interesting in the world is going to have haters.  The New York Yankees has haters.  I hate the Yankees.  And I think when you do a company or when you do something in the world, if it's interesting, you're going to cause a blowback.  And I think that's where you came in with Facebook.

Do you think Quickie is not interesting?  I think it's interesting on the surface.  Why did it win Disrupt?  Because people are fooled by UI.  When I first saw Windows Vista, when I saw Longhorn, they showed me a smoke and mirrors demos.  It looked like the coolest thing I've ever seen.  I said, oh my God, Microsoft is finally going to be Apple.  They're going to finally do something really interesting.  And then it came out and it and demos.  First of all, it didn't it didn't come out.  So and second of all, what what when we see UI on the screen, it can fool us.  I mean, friends of mine are arguing that I was wrong about Flipboard.  I don't think so.  But I love Flipboard.  I love it.  But Steve Gilmore and other people are like, Flipboard is like all UI, no, no cattle.  All hat, no cattle.

There's a lot of focus on consumer web things when there's a lot of interesting stuff still going on in the valley.  We don't pay as much attention to it because it's a little difficult to understand and explain to people.  We do that all day long.  I mean, that's we made we made that our focus for a very long time.  And but I do agree with Robert.  I think that is that is something we need to stop doing as a collective industry.

So at least you can get a look at it.  And like you said, Robert, sometimes you're fooled.  I mean, perception is everything.  And sometimes when someone puts something on your plate that looks really good, you want to eat it and then you taste it.  And it's not so great.  You don't know until you dig into it.  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, looking at it looks great.  But until you get the chance to actually get your hands on it and get into it, I mean, you can walk away saying, oh, the iPhone looks great.

Magicians call it misdirection.  A new Senate bill.  That is really all smoke and mirrors.  This would be a good example of how the mainstream press would probably jump on this, get all excited about it.  But we have a higher duty to explain why there's nothing to get excited about before we do that.  Though I want to talk a little bit about backup.  This is infrastructure, but I think it's important to everybody backing up your software, your data, your most important stuff is absolutely critical.  And my friend Peter Krogh coined the term three times.  One copy of something is not a backup.  Two copies even isn't really a backup.  You got to have three copies of everything.  Two of them on two different types of media and one of them offsite.  That's the real important one.  Carbonite is offsite backup.  Done right.  Makes it easy for you to do.  Very simple.  All you have to do is install.  In fact, you can do it right now.  Go to carbonite.com.  Install it for free.  No credit card.  No credit card.  No credit card.  No credit card.  No credit card.  No credit card.  No credit card.  No credit card.  For free.  No credit card needed for two weeks.  Instantly, carbonite starts using your high speed internet connection to back up your critical data.  Free for the next two weeks.  I want you to give it a try.  There's a couple of things you're going to want to know about.  First of all, 128 bit SSL.  So you can be even at an open access point and not worry about the backup happening.  You even have access to optional AES 256 bit encryption.  So if you want to keep this private, you really can.  It's completely secure.  Here's the great thing.  You can restore anywhere, anytime.  You don't even have to be on the same machine.  You just log on to your carbonite account.  You can even do it on a free iPhone or Blackberry app.  And there's your data available.  Get it back instantly.  Carbonite.  $55 a year if you decide to buy.  For unlimited backup.  All the personal data on your internal drive.  Mac or PC.  Take a look though if you're a Windows user.  The new 4.0 version.  It's light.  It's fast.  It's just awesome.  Carbonite.com.  It's no surprise that Carbonite was just named the fastest growing US company in the IT services sector.  It happens when you really find and even fill it.  And they did.  Carbonite.com.  Oh, Doctor.

He's got picture frames.  He's got a 27 inch...  He had a 27 inch monitor in his house that just strained pictures.  And he lost all of his pictures.  Because he had a safe and he had it backed up.  The blaze went for too long and it just corrupted the data.  So now he has it sent out and he's trying to spend thousands of dollars to get it recovered.  And I mean, Lord knows if you could back up offsite for less than five bucks a month, get on it.  Because I'm backed up offsite.  You got to do it.  You have to do it.

You gotta see this.  What it does is you run the program.  I think it's a couple of bucks for the iPhone.  You pass your iPhone or you just swipe.  It's not a photo stitcher.  It makes a photo montage of everything.  So I'm going to swipe here.  It makes a really cool photo montage.  I mean, it's a kind of one purpose thing, but I just really like it.

Transcript:  So Tom, I can't think of his name, but let me get his name right.  Tom Udall, who's a senator from New Mexico, Democrat, has proposed the Cell Phone Bill Shock Act of 2010.  Now, on the surface, this sounds like a great thing.  You know, in magic, they have a term called misdirection.  The magician's about to do something with one hand.  He gets you to look over on the other hand, thinking that that's where the action is.  It's called misdirection.  And of course, while you're looking at the other hand, the real sleight of hand is happening.  That's what, to me, this bill is.  Let me just tell you what this bill is.  It will require cell phone companies to notify you via a free email or text when you've used 80% of your monthly cell phone minutes, text, or data.  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  The idea being that people are getting shocked by cell phone bills where they've used way too much data.  It's costing way too much.  And so thank you, Tom Udall.  He is making sure that the cell phone companies are taking care of their customers.  They will send a text notifying you that you're about to go over your limit.  That's going to be the law of the land.  Meanwhile, cell phone companies charge you $275 for early termination of your contract.  Even after five years, they're charging you minutes for the 15 second.  Please press one to leave a message.  Press two to leave a fax.  They're charging you 1500 bucks a megabyte for text messages.  But no, we're all going to be happy because of the cell phone bill shock act of 2010.  They're going to send us a text message.  To me, that's misdirection.  I'm not getting you excited on this one, am I?  I'm going to move on.

Start time: 3420.09
End time: 3484.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, I am a little bit foxed by this nomination to the CEO's position.  Mostly because if they were looking for somebody, you know, to replace Mark Hurd, they didn't  have to replace him with somebody like Mark Hurd except less well-known and with a less  successful track record.  So I am not sure what they are thinking.  I think there may be some issues because of this hiring.  There is a lot of people within HP who might be looking for new jobs, people who are there  who had an eye on the top position and they might be looking to do.  So I think that would be a more interesting story to watch.  But from a larger standpoint, I don't think, you know, HP is completely out of the woods  as a company.  I think there is a lot of things which are beginning to go wrong there.  I think the firing of Mark Hurd was just the tip of the iceberg.  And there is a lot of...

Transcript:  You agree with Ellison that it was a dumb move?

Start time: 3488.44
End time: 3567.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, it's like, you know, they like to think, you know, HP likes to think  it's an company all about innovation.  And when you really look at it, what was the last thing they really innovated on?  Yeah.  Ink jets.  They do great printers.  I mean, but, you know, they are not really an innovation company.  Yes, they have a lot of smart people which work for the company, but that doesn't really  mean that they're really changing the game per se.  So I don't think, you know, they were an innovation company.  So from that perspective, Mark Hurd was doing the innovation of the bottom line, right?  He was basically innovating on the financial aspect of the company, making it more lean,  more, you know, extracting, you know, blood from the stone, so to speak.  But he was doing what he needed to do.  And, you know, I think that's the reality of HP.  And I think somehow they just don't seem to quite understand that that's it.  Like when you buy a company like EDS and when you overpay for a company like 3PAR, you kind  of are telling the rest of the world that things, you know, are coming, you know, the  wheels are coming off this wagon.  That's what I feel.

I mean, it's like, you know, it's like Pard calling the kettle black.  I mean, his company isn't that innovative either.  Yeah, they bought Sun and so they have some interesting technology.  But what really it is, is just it shows how much of, you know, an opportunity there is  for HP's competitors to take market share from it.  I think that's the big picture there.

Transcript:  I agree with you, Robert.  I had no problem with agreeing with you on that one.  No, I'm joking.  But Robert, I think you use video a lot.  So you might actually have some thoughts on it.  But the way I see it, Logitech needs to come out with a remote,  which is actually optimized for internet video,  which is not about buttons.  It's not about some stupid navigation key.  It has some kind of touch capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't sell your remote for $400.  You sell it for $50 or so.  That's what the world needs, right?  Harmony is very expensive.  Right.  So you need to come up with smart remotes, which are cheap,  and they're optimized for this large internet video content.  And they need to focus on that before they focus on making television.  I think what Boxee needs to do is absolutely nothing.  I mean, I installed Boxee.  You like it.  Yeah, I think I installed Boxee on one of the new Mac Minis,  the brand new Mac Mini, and it works like a charm, like this.  I haven't had to do anything.  It finds the...  You know, I have a tablet, you know, storage, network storage device.  It found that.  It found my online server where I keep backups to all my music.

So I'll run through a bunch of stories.  You give me your reactions.  Google buys a company called Blind Type.  We saw the demo of Blind Type. Very cool.  It was a way to type into a phone  without actually having a keyboard.  You just kind of roughly get it right,  and it figures it out.  Which is better, Swipe or...  I love Swipe, and I haven't tried Blind Type,  but I imagine they'll make that as an option on an Android.  But my Motorola Droid X has Swipe on it,  and it's so easy.

Transcript:  You know, I think BlackBerry has lost a lot of momentum,  especially in the enterprise.  I mean, not because they're making a bad product.  There are just more options for the enterprise now.  I think that's the key thing, right?  Initially, they were just the only game in town.  Now there's a lot of people like to use different devices.  The actual end users are more in control of the game.  They're in control of their buying decisions on the enterprise equipment.  So I think they have a little bit of a challenge.  I think Windows Phone, which I saw a few days ago  at our Mobilize conference, is actually pretty good.  It looks awesome.

And it's somewhat of a disappointment.  I think the playbook, whenever it comes out, will be an interesting product.  But it remains to be seen when they come out with it.  To talk about it today and not come out for another 12 months, that's a different story.  I think that's when you start to lose attention.  My view is that this market will be a lot of...  It will be around the Android tablet action, like just the enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't say they will win. I think they are going to make things very interesting. They have a half a decent product.  I think there is a big difference from declaring a winner and saying this is a competitive offering.  There's a huge difference in that.  So I think similarly, N8 is a very competitive offering. Whether it wins the market, we don't know.  From that perspective, I think both the PalmPad and PlayBook seem like a bit of a stretch because they don't really exist and everything is just all talk.  So that's the key thing. But definitely one needs to kind of keep an open mind on various different things.  I love the iPhone. I wish they were not on AT&T.  I mean, if they were not on AT&T and on any other network which actually could make phone calls, I would switch back to the iPhone.

And that's a really good feeling to have.  And I haven't had a feeling like that about a Windows mobile product since they were the first ones on the market.

If you go to the XMark's blog, they're saying,  well, you know, when we started this, we thought it might be a freemium service,  and 0.001% of our users paid for it. Okay, scratch that off the list.  So they said, well, now I know what we're going to do. We're going to collect a billion Bookmarks in this service.  We'll come up with then services that massage that data, do some data mining,  and it'll be incredibly valuable. They said, yeah, we collected a billion Bookmarks.  We never did come up with anything that we could do with those billion Bookmarks.  Now they're trying to get people to pledge. If you go to Pledge Bank,  they're trying to get 100,000 users to say, we will pay $10 to $20 a year to pay for XMark.  And if they get 100,000 people saying they will pay, and I'm sure, does Pledge Bank actually take the money if they go ahead with it?  So it's like, are you just promising to pay or are you actually committed?

I think this, the episode, the sad story of XMark also ties to our earlier comment about our discussion about,  you know, not some of the startups, you know, getting started for very little money and getting, you know, going.  But the problem we have right now is that many of these interesting web services never think about the option of being a business, right?  They never really think it through. And in the end, they meet the fate of XMark.  I think it behooves us to remind all entrepreneurs to think about, you know, that there's great things to build,  but there needs to be a business which needs to be built alongside your ideas.

And every year I tell him, no, I can do that myself for my business. I'm on the Internet.  And he's like, but you don't understand how important it is to register your website with all the browsers.  And I'm like, it's in the Yellow Pages. People will find that they're in there. I don't need your Internet service.  And they don't even know how to sell their own Internet services properly. It's very interesting.  I'm like, they send these guys out there and they get people or entrepreneurs or business owners that don't know any better that will just fork over, you know, 200 bucks to do whatever, register their website.  It's just it's bad. So somebody needs to go and re-register these guys how to use the Internet.

So we do our own kind of marketing with that business and they don't they just want to sell what they want to sell.  They're not looking at Yelp or anything yet. They're just we want you in the Yellow Pages and we're going to do it digitally.  We're going to register you. And that's their bottom line pitch.  They haven't even looked at other opportunities to actually get people revenue and business that they can help them with and make more money for themselves.

And there's a lot of interesting things which which are going to happen when you start to combine social location and other, you know, ways of, you know, context.  And and starting to, you know, add and, you know, mash up, you know, web and data services.  So that would be pretty interesting.  I think the more interesting thing you we need to watch for is this whole emergence of flash social commerce.  I think that is very, very interesting.  You know, when I say flash social commerce, it's like what people like Groupon do, but only from a mobile perspective.  I think that's what is going to be a very interesting aspect of the of the industry from a location standpoint.
