Transcript:  really have outgrown this so it's kind of this is kind of in any ways I think  this is kind of fun to do though as a kind of almost a last farewell.  Certainly by next boot camp we better be in the new studio. I'm thinking even sooner maybe like next  month we'll be in the new studio. So thank you for being here. It's great to see you.  Thrilled to check out the original cottage. Of course Gina is a founder of Lifehacker and is at  smarterware.org and is the author of ThinkUp at thinkupac.com which is a great  Twitter analyzer that was used by the White House and a regular on this week in  Google every Wednesday on the TWIT Network.

Ben's been on before he on our social hour show.  We've talked to you but it's great to have you. Thanks. And it's kind of funny  because returning from from Foo Camp like he did last year. Dan Shapiro's with  us. Now last year you were doing something you couldn't tell anybody  about which you called I think at the time the kayak of consumer electronics.

Start time: 307.54
End time: 311.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that was actually more than I'd said to anyone at any time. So your listeners

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  get the first. You opened the kimono. Since then that company was started and  sold to Google yes or no? Two weeks ago. Two weeks ago. That's what I call  turnaround. Yeah. Less than a year. I love it. Efficiency. So officially now you're  at Google. I am. But we won't we won't ask you about Google because Google  doesn't know you're here. Because I still have no idea what I'm doing. Lean into the  mic when we talk but it's good to have you back Dan. And Dan is a really  great serial entrepreneur and has a number of other very interesting  investments which we should talk about because some really interesting stuff.  That's one of the things at Foo Camp that happens is people go around and say  what what did you learn? What did you see? Any interesting new startups or  ideas? Joining us a little later Kevin Marks will be here. He'll wander in. And  we're gonna I think let Ben go in a little bit because a lot of a lot of  folks have to fly out but it's just it's just so nice to get some of the brains  over here. Gina this is your eighth Foo Camp. I don't know if it's eighth. Maybe fifth.

Start time: 372.04
End time: 390.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's my manyth. I've been to Foo East. I've been any day that I get the Foo  invitation is a lovely day. There have been years that I haven't been invited. It's  hard talking about Foo you know because. You feel a little elitist. It is you know  and I saw some chatter on Twitter about it being sort of the nerd the nerd elite  and there's this feeling of exclusion at least I felt very excluded when I wasn't

Start time: 390.84
End time: 416.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  invited. But it's not the elite it's not elitist in the sense of Ted is for instance. No  it hasn't it's a different feel. For one thing it's not a conference and you  can't pay to get in I guess then someone's right there's no money. There's no  money exchange you just you are invited or not. You're invited or not and you can  sleep on the floor. And it's not it's not done to invite yourself to beg to plead  to say can I come back. It is done not successful. Right it's not right. So what is it.

Start time: 419.00
End time: 426.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well it's an unconference meaning that the sessions aren't planned. I think it's the  original unconference. I believe it is and it kind of spawned the bar camp movement as

Start time: 426.56
End time: 434.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well. Because Foo people weren't invited Foo said oh we're going to do our own  thing which is bar. Although Tim has said that he loves the idea of bar camp he

Start time: 434.40
End time: 439.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  doesn't mind. Yeah I know he doesn't mind. Tim like. It is very Tim like. This is the thing about Tim

Start time: 439.24
End time: 452.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  like not only is he a great thinker and leader in our community he's like he's  like a truck he's a tribe leader he's very much he kind of he recognizes the  the geeks he has lots of great connections and the whole point of Foo  is to get people together he thinks who should talk in a place to talk. So an

Start time: 452.98
End time: 469.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  unconference means that you don't go with you aren't a speaker and the  attendee there are no divisions like that. Right. Everybody is invited to speak  kind of ad hoc in a very informal way. And then really even the sessions are

Start time: 470.64
End time: 492.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  not kind of hierarchical. They're very egalitarian. That's what I love about it you don't have a  speaker in the front of the room like wah wah wah wah with attendees kind of  dozing off or on their laptops. I mean at this Foo and I don't know if you guys  felt the same way I mean there are very few people on their devices during  discussions people were fully focused and arguing there's a lot of arguing in  fact. In part because there's no reception in Sebastopol. Yeah well they probably did have to do with that.

Start time: 492.88
End time: 504.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember last year everybody had an iPad or not everybody there were a number of people had iPads but  but very very few people had any electronics at all this time. Very few this year. Yeah. And they  discouraged that they don't want people to be doing that. They want to pay attention. Yeah they

Start time: 505.40
End time: 510.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  pretty they outwardly encouraged us to be present. On the other hand the

Start time: 510.26
End time: 527.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  people who are there and Tim said this time there was about 35% new people so  about a third of the people were new. The people were there are kind of kind of a  big deal in many cases. Marissa Meyer was there so she showed up last night.  Apparently you missed it when Larry Page flew his helicopter into the... Oh if you

Start time: 527.88
End time: 542.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  look at Google Maps and you zoom in to the O'Reilly offices from like the  satellite view. I was at that Foo. You'll notice that there's a large patch of really high definition like  tents. And you're like why is that there and everything else is blurry and  that's because they shot it from their helicopter from what I heard. They did a fly over

Start time: 542.70
End time: 554.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  one year when they were doing the Google Maps photography. I think I was  asleep under a desk when that happened as well but I was I was on site as I'd  stayed up too late playing werewolf. It's a reoccurring theme. It is a reoccurring theme.

Start time: 557.09
End time: 564.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As Gina and I were talking this is the only time really you get to play. Where do you play?  You'd never get to play any other time do you? I do. Do you play in your office? Actually we do at game nights at our company.

Start time: 565.28
End time: 577.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This explains a lot. He's really good at it. I play everywhere I go. I did it at South by Southwest.  We hijacked a couple of conference rooms in the middle of the night from one  named the 6 a.m. and it turned out to be a pretty big event. Ben pretty much made a total fool of me during werewolf.

Start time: 577.66
End time: 594.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean not only was it like lessons in extrovertism it was also like lessons in taking out Gina or engineering a way to take out Gina in the second round.  It was kind of amazing. It wasn't me all the time. Well you were in cahoots with Harper basically. Well Harper is just crazy anyway.

Start time: 594.78
End time: 622.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He is just crazy. So that's a perfect example. Harper is the in charge of digital strategy for the Obama campaign or the President Obama.  Barack Obama's CTO. He's just the point of CTO. He was also there. CTO of the United States. US CTO. Oh CIO.  So to sit there and be playing werewolf with the CTO of the United States of America is pretty bizarre.  And by the way you and he are like trying to kill each other and I mean it's hysterical. I didn't know who he was.

Start time: 623.06
End time: 645.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So half the time I don't even know who I'm killing. And that's the fun of it. And later I find out it's like oh well you know that was the funny thing at South By.  It was like we're playing werewolf and a bunch of entrepreneurs are getting more and more into it and they're literally screaming at the venture capitalists who they're trying to get money from and calling them idiots and morons.  And you know you see the whole dynamic play out and you're like well that's the bed you made.

Start time: 648.98
End time: 662.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's the image of a food camp from Google Maps and if you zoom in you can see that this is what happens is that this is the O'Reilly media headquarters.  This is their offices and they people camp. I camped this year. Gina you are you going to point out your tent Ben? I see you.

Start time: 662.88
End time: 677.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No but look at how high def that is. Yeah. And the rest of it. They know they did a really close flyby. Where are we?  You can't tell. If you go to the right over there.  That's a little soccer field where there are robots. Yeah.

Start time: 679.57
End time: 691.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was a robot soccer game in the upper left hand corner. What are these people doing?  Yeah they knew that yeah those are robots right there. Yeah.  And I feel like if you go down I thought somebody made like a Google AdSense.  Welcome to food camp? Yeah.

Start time: 692.28
End time: 704.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's hysterical. Apparently there's one guy off in a tent over on the side here just by himself.  There's always that guy. One of the things that's interesting about going to a conference like this which is really fairly social is that most of us are

Start time: 706.41
End time: 708.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  with the exception of Ben are pretty introverted.

Start time: 709.10
End time: 711.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't understand your accusation here.

Start time: 712.04
End time: 712.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I second.

Start time: 717.65
End time: 717.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Introvert!

Start time: 719.37
End time: 756.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Extrovert!  Actually that's the game next year we should play introvert extrovert.  That would be kind of fun. You're awfully quiet I think you're an extrovert.  Yeah.  Alright we're making in jokes that's a bad sign.  Anyway Friends of O'Reilly is what FOO stands for and it is I think it's a great thing that O'Reilly does because it is a rare chance for people like Vivek Kundra  to let their hair down to hang out with  entrepreneurs people who are doing creative stuff in the in the nonprofit space  and really exchange ideas in a free fashion.

Start time: 756.62
End time: 759.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a FOO bar also. This must be mentioned.  BAR as in drinks.

Start time: 762.75
End time: 791.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As in drinks but it's labeled the FOO bar.  I was drinking Baratunde and I were drinking Absinthe last night.  Absinthe did you know makes the heart grow fonder?  And discussing this is what Baratunde's session was on.  Utopia versus dystopia. Is the world about to end or is technology going to save us all?  And it's just great we're standing there holding Absinthe and drinking and discussing this and it's like going to college again.

Start time: 791.70
End time: 795.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo it's entirely possible you had that imagine the whole thing.  That was after the Absinthe.

Start time: 795.28
End time: 840.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Actually Baratunde wasn't there at all was he?  Yeah I didn't even know who that guy is.  So Leo was standing next to a tree talking to him last night for about an hour.  See that tent off in the corner? That's me and I enjoyed myself.  One of the best sessions was it had Tim O'Reilly, you had Nick Bilton from the New York Times and you had Vivek Kundra who's our CIO talking about privacy.  Incredible.  Tim was talking about how he lives in public and thinks it's underrated.  And I'm on that obviously that group.  You had Nick talking about good heavens, the companies are pimping out our privacy information to everybody what's being done about this.  And you had Vivek furiously taking notes and asking really smart questions and you know where that's going.  Isn't that exciting?  Yeah.  Isn't that exciting?

Start time: 840.44
End time: 933.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tim said I thought that I kind of like what Tim said which is essentially that yes we have problems with privacy.  In fact it's the very nature of technology that all this you should just assume all this information is going to leak out or get out or somehow be figured out.  So the real issue is not to legislate again in draconian fashion to kind of protect us but to do what we've always done with privacy which is to set standards and mores and taboos about privacy.  We have windows, we all have windows, but it's so taboo to come up to somebody's window and look in that we don't do it.  It's actually against the law but even the taboo, everybody has locks but a lock is more, in fact this was another great session I took on lock cracking.  Even locks aren't just a symbol of please don't come in here because they're easily circumvented.  And so Tim said we don't want a chilling effect from legislation saying companies, for instance I think Nick suggested there should be a standard security model so that things like the PlayStation network don't hack, don't happen.  That every company that holds consumer data should by law require to use this standard security model.  And Tim said well then you've anointed a winner, there's not going to be any innovation in that space, you have a very chilling effect by doing this.  Yes, maybe people are a little more secure but probably not.  And what you really should do is you should establish, you should figure out where is the harm in privacy violation.  What is the harm?  Not every privacy violation is harmful.  Don't assume there are harms.

Start time: 934.18
End time: 941.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So let's take that case and talk about the girl who made her birthday party public by accident in Germany with 1500 people showing up.

Start time: 942.16
End time: 943.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On Facebook she invited people.

Start time: 944.36
End time: 951.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well she made it open 1500 people RSVP or 15,000 people some crazy number.  The harm on that, how do you quantify the harm in that?

Start time: 952.52
End time: 955.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say the harm is de minimis, that she had to move her party.

Start time: 956.85
End time: 959.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, she had to hire security, the police showed up.  No, well that's dumb.

Start time: 961.24
End time: 963.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She shouldn't have had the party at the same place, she should have moved it.

Start time: 964.55
End time: 965.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well people showed up anyway, it's their house.

Start time: 966.97
End time: 974.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh she gave out her house.  Okay that was kind of dumb.  But that's a foolish thing to do.

Start time: 975.72
End time: 975.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.

Start time: 975.84
End time: 977.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you saying it was too easy?

Start time: 978.14
End time: 990.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm saying development of software needs to reflect the societal norms of what privacy is in order for what you're suggesting to work.  Right.  How about Andrew Weiner?

Start time: 991.02
End time: 1002.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's talk about Andrew Weiner.  How can we?  No, but I'm just saying that was a dumb thing to do with some harm for him and if you are an Andrew Weiner fan for you.  The name Weiner is just too good for this.

Start time: 1002.94
End time: 1003.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that was his mistake.

Start time: 1004.00
End time: 1006.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well that's what I'm saying.  Just like it was her mistake, it was his mistake.

Start time: 1007.06
End time: 1008.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what are we going to legislate?

Start time: 1009.44
End time: 1052.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the interesting thing here is when you have products that for example disclose a whole bunch of information to people or hide information poorly.  And then, this is one of the examples we were talking about in the session, you have something like the Burmese junta or the Chinese government mining all this available information.  Think of it another way, which is yes we have windows, no you shouldn't look in them.  But imagine if the entire government of Burma or China can look in your window, take notes on everything you do, and you'll never know they were there.  And that's where it starts to get a little fuzzy because yes you make silly mistakes, your life leaks a little bit and you can say that's up to you.  But the problems here are life threatening in some cases, real and there are enemies.  There are bad people out there who want your personal data.

Start time: 1052.14
End time: 1067.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That actually was Nick's point, was that we're all good people in this room so we're assuming everybody's good.  But there are bad actors who will use this data in a bad way.  Well, you can see why this is a challenge.  I mean I'm on Tim's side but you've raised some issues.  Yeah, it's an interesting discussion.

Start time: 1067.50
End time: 1088.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The problem is that privacy used to be a gradient, meaning that if somebody came to your house and actually took a photo of what's happening inside,  there was no place for them to actually post it and make it public that would go basically binary all over the world.  Now, privacy is binary.  Either you have it or you don't.  The moment you post a photo that's out in public, you can never take it back.  And that's the problem with privacy is that we've come to this extremist world.

Start time: 1092.42
End time: 1140.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  While we were sitting in one of the sessions actually talking about all this,  this news crossed the wire and probably somebody should have mentioned it and brought it up because it's an interesting story.  The United States is underwriting a detour around sensors.  The Obama administration has agreed to help deploy shadow internet and mobile phone systems for dissidents in repressive areas.  I kind of applaud this.  At the same time, it's kind of an interesting idea.  The effort includes secretive projects to create independent cell phone networks inside foreign countries.  I guess this is better than military intervention.  This is maybe even better than having a spy network support the resistance.

Start time: 1141.40
End time: 1150.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that what we did in Afghanistan back when?  Isn't that what we've done in all sorts of really upsetting military situations?  Does it work the same way for communications or is it different?

Start time: 1150.40
End time: 1157.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hope this trickles down so that I don't have to pay overage minutes on my cell phone.  No, no, you are paying overage minutes forever.  That's probably what funds this, right?

Start time: 1157.70
End time: 1175.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The funny thing is it was $2 million.  It was a $2 million State Department grant.  It's not even that expensive.  But it's an interesting policy decision.  Would you say, based on the fact that Harper was there and Vivek Kundra was there, that we have a government that is technically more savvy?

Start time: 1176.02
End time: 1196.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you have politicians who are coming from the technology age.  I would say Barack Obama.  Finally.  Yeah, finally.  Barack Obama being able to use the internet during the campaign was a massive, massive advancement in government understanding technology.  But from what I can hear about the political structure and how campaigns work, they're still very, very much in the dark ages as to how the internet works.

Start time: 1197.04
End time: 1222.30

Transcript:  Well, Gov 2.0 was one of Tim O'Reilly's big interests and there was a big presence in Code for America.  I think there's a big focus on civic hacking.  What is Code for America?  Code for America is a nonprofit organization of fellows basically who get paid very little to do some civic hacking,  which means to build tools, software tools that companies have, but to give those to government.  Open data and tools that help citizens help themselves.

Start time: 1223.24
End time: 1255.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They call it a new kind of public service.  And this is what Tim has talked about.  We've actually did a special on Gov 2.0.  You can go back to our Twitter specials feed and read all about it with Tim.  But one of the things that Tim was talking about is the idea of a government as, and this is very 21st century, a platform as, just as Facebook would be a platform,  or Windows would be a platform, a platform for people to write software that makes government work better.  Exactly. Be more efficient.  To do that you would need APIs into the data?

Start time: 1255.78
End time: 1262.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Open data, APIs, and hackers who are willing to spend time to build tools that make things easier for citizens to help themselves and help one another.

Start time: 1262.80
End time: 1267.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is really all, the Code for America is one part of the tripod, the hackers, but you also need to get APIs and open data.

Start time: 1268.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the neat things I think about the way this is being done is back in the age this would have been a $100 million contract to some large consultancy,  but there's really cool companies. There's a company called Socrata up in Seattle for example.  Startups, small companies that are getting small pieces of access to this data and then using that to grow and make more information available to the greater public.  And that's something that I think that partnership with entrepreneurialism is also an exciting feature that we're seeing now.  Definitely.

Start time: 1295.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's interesting is that Foo, you get to recognize patterns. You get to recognize what's actually happening in the technology world, what people are thinking about.  And as you see all the Code for America fellows who are there, and somebody came up to me and I forgot who it was, and said,  wow, it's like Code for America is the new Facebook.  Wouldn't that be awesome.  Yeah, that was pretty amazing.

Transcript:  Yes.  So Colin, who is one of our newest employees, he came from Philadelphia, he pointed out this site, this is OpenDataPhilly.org.  And the data on the Philadelphia region is plentiful.  Search and find that data with OpenDataPhilly.  It gives you a chance to scrape and get information.  There's an API, a Scraper Wiki API, SQLite database.  That's kind of cool.  That's kind of neat.  One of the big things I saw, and you're right, Ben, you start to see threads come through all of the sessions.  You can see that this is what these people anyway, and I think if these people are representative of the people who are really doing some interesting thinking globally,  and I think Tim does really make an effort to do that, that these threads are important because these are not just here, but what everybody's thinking.  One of them is big data and what we can do with big data.  What is big data, Gina?

Start time: 1391.78
End time: 1400.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Huge, large aggregate sets of data that can give us insights into behaviors and make life better through those insights.  I guess, I don't know.

Start time: 1400.54
End time: 1418.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It used to be basically called data mining because if you had a huge set of data, you would go look for nuggets of information that's actually useful.  What's happened is in the last 10 years, the amount of data has exploded where data mining no longer is actually the right way to look at it.  You don't mine for little things out of it.  You look at the large aggregate data set and see what comes out of it that can power your entire business.

Start time: 1419.38
End time: 1441.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing that's happened is it used to be the only way that you had big data was a large company would go and have the data on its customers and its functions,  but there was no access to small companies, to individuals, to government data.  Now we're actually entering an age where anybody can go access massive data sets across different disciplines, bring them together and build something new out of that.  Finally, the walls are coming down around some of those data stores.

Start time: 1442.32
End time: 1456.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's the interesting part is that the walls are actually coming down.  It used to be that you were siloed in your data set, that you could actually only mine the data that you had, and to get other people's data to work nicely with you was really hard.  But now data works really nicely almost across every single social and internet company in the globe.

Transcript:  There's a huge emphasis on just measuring everything.  Geeks are just enamored with data.  Measuring and visualizing.  Measuring and visualizing.  Geek fitness was another big theme.  A lot of that was just getting the metrics, the devices that measure your heart rate and the steps taken and your sleep, the Fitbit.  Like Nate and...

Transcript:  One of the guys I talked to, Jason, who is RunKeeper.com, they announced an API.  They call it the Health Graph.  They've been keeping people's run data for some time.  Now they want to keep all your health data in an open database with an open API.  Have all these devices write to it.  Because when you know what your heart rate is and what your running was and your stress level was and maybe your cholesterol level and how much you slept, you can collate all that data.  You can learn a lot about yourself.  The quantified self.

Start time: 1511.54
End time: 1526.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  APIs is a method of accessing data.  The reason we have APIs is that we're a very limited pipe and connection in which we could access other people's data.  Imagine a world where the pipes are cheaper, the data storage is cheaper.  You don't need an API anymore.

Transcript:  This was the issue with Twitter was that they would never let anybody have the fire hose, which you of course would love, Gina, which is everything.  You have to buy it.  They gave you an API so you could ask for stuff.  Right. It's a limited resource.  You'd like to have the dump, the whole thing.

Start time: 1547.60
End time: 1560.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The reality using the Twitter API now is that you request a page of 200 tweets, one at a time, on the whole API.  It is really limiting.  You're talking about a time where we could query the entire Twitter database.  I don't think it's even a query. It's just there.

Start time: 1561.86

Transcript:  This was actually an issue for my previous short-lived company, Sparkby, where we were trying to make it really easy to go and find the best consumer electronics item, answer questions like, what's a great Red Dell laptop that's Photoshop compatible?  We wanted to go and we wanted to know everything that was on Amazon, but because they would only give us API access, because they'd say you can only talk to us once a second.  You have to ask every time, not the raw dump.  We had to jump through a lot of hurdles in order to make that work.  Companies are coming to terms with the balance between you can have everything and we're just going to drip feed you.  I think that's an ongoing evolution.

But before we do that, I'd just like to mention our good friends at Citrix who make a product  that everyone who is in support ought to know about and ought to be using.  Of course, you know I'm talking about GoToAssist Express.  We started using it on the screensavers back when it was just GoToAssist.  It was kind of cool on TV.  It was a neat segment we would do.  Most of the time it would be a phone call and we'd talk you through it.  And every once in a while we could actually say, okay, we're going to fire up GoToAssist  and get into your computer.  Well, that was almost 10 years ago.  They've come a long way.  And it was good then.  And it is even better now.  Citrix, you know, because they do the great backend for remote access on Windows machines.  Both for enterprise and consumers.  It's just a, they're just the best.  128-bit SSL, great 24-7 support for you.  If you are an IT or software consultant and you have clients and colleagues who need to  be supported, this is the easiest way to do it.  Much better than phone support.  Certainly a lot better than traveling across the world, across the country, even just walking  down the hall.  We always knew when the IT guy at Tech TV was coming because he wore a keychain with  a lot of keys on it.  And you'd hear him go, jing, jing, jing, coming down the hall.  It wasn't Santa.  Usually he was there to yell at you.  You can, you can do it yourself.  What do you mean you put chocolate in the keyboard?  I seem to have a big problem with that.  You could do this yourself.  Remote support.  It's just the easiest way to do it.  And you could do up to eight sessions simultaneously, unattended sessions, just all the features  that a support pro is looking for.  Drag and drop of files from your computer to the support ease computer, whether they're  hot fixes or patches or installs.  It's just so easy.  You can even show them your computer and say, this is what it's supposed to look like.  Dude, you could get an assay of what software is running, including all the security software  with operating system version.  I can go on and on.  But you know what?  Better than that.  Try it free for 30 days.  PC or Mac.  Visit go to assist dot com.  Geo Tio assist dot com slash twit.  We love Citrix.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech and all of our twit show.  So Ben, what do you tell us?  Because I know you're gonna leave in about five or 10 minutes.  What is Moby Dick?

Start time: 1844.94
End time: 1895.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the Moby Dick project was an idea that came from actually Foo Camp and ORD Camp,  where we talked about what's wrong with the way newspaper news articles are presented  today.  And the problem that we see is that one, the article format's been around since like the  1800s.  And so basically we've been consuming the same news product for hundreds of years.  And that has led to just being ported to the web the way people think about articles.  So imagine a breaking news story, let's say the Chaman earthquake, and you read the same  article over and over again when they update the first paragraph.  And halfway through the article you're going, hey, haven't I read this before?  I read this, yeah.  And it's a real waste of your time.  Second, you know, the collective social memory of front pages of newspapers.  If you walk down the halls of the New York Times, you'll see these collection of amazing  historical moments that you no longer see because the Internet just wipes everything  clean every time.  It's hard for you to get that.  It's possible, but it's very difficult for you to get that.

Start time: 1895.62
End time: 1899.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, easier than paper.  I mean, to get the paper, you have to go to a library or go to their archives.

Start time: 1899.64
End time: 1911.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But at least it's available and at least we remember it.  And when we actually remember those moments, it's a part of who we are.  Imagine like what did the newspaper look like when you were born in your hometown?  Right.  Those are really interesting memories that you will never get on the Internet.

Start time: 1911.64
End time: 1915.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a point.  You can get it now, but if it's on the Net, it doesn't...  It's hard to find.

Start time: 1915.80
End time: 1934.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The newspapers don't organize it themselves.  You actually don't know how news forms over time.  And third, I think there's not enough diversity of opinion in the way news is presented.  There's a handful of large media outlets and they try to be quote unquote unbiased.  But what's happening is they have a bias.  You just don't know it.  Hidden.  Yeah, it's very hidden.  We should be transparent about it.  We should say what the bias is.

Start time: 1935.02
End time: 1940.72

Start time: 1965.80
End time: 1973.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you did a little mock-up.  This is what you showed at Foo Camp.  It's kind of a wireframe.  You want to give us a little tour.  First of all, it's got tags up at the top.

Start time: 1974.15
End time: 1976.78

Start time: 1977.10

Start time: 1979.00
End time: 1988.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A little bit.  So it's edited by a handful of people who work on this page and about this topic.  So there are selected editors for the page.  Well, you self-select.  You want to create a page, you can do it yourself.

Start time: 1988.88
End time: 1992.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how is this different from a Wikipedia topic?  I mean, Wikipedia has great breaking news coverage, actually.

Start time: 1993.58
End time: 1997.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does, but it doesn't help you scrub and it also doesn't provide you with the details  as it's going on.

Start time: 1998.18
End time: 2003.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2004.42
End time: 2013.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And also this is not about facts.  This is not about the actuality.  You can insert opinion.  You can insert perspective.  You can insert basically...

Start time: 2014.14
End time: 2020.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's a place in it for facts, but also a place in it for opinion.  Yes.  So on the left, that's the facts.  Right.

Start time: 2021.08
End time: 2047.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here you have a mock-up of a page with a headline that's probably from the pro-revolutionary  side.  You could potentially actually have a government-centric voice that says, you know what, those are rebels.  They're just criminals.  Interesting.  Which you heard out of Egypt.  And I know that it seems awkward and weird to actually encourage diversity of opinion  when you believe the other side is false, but I want to trust the public to make that  opinion for themselves.  I agree.  Not to be filtered purely by journalists.

Start time: 2047.30
End time: 2050.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So on this page, would you have on the other side of the page the pro-Egyptian government?

Start time: 2051.40
End time: 2068.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, actually what's interesting about this page is if you scroll to the right, so the  left has the facts, the middle has media.  I'm using the entire 1080 space.  And if you move to the right, there's unconfirmed stream of tips and news that's coming in where  the crowd actually helps you sort and...

Start time: 2068.26

Start time: 2071.12
End time: 2080.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 2081.12
End time: 2099.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you could say, this is speculation.  This is opinion.  This is credible.  That's fantastic.  And so the theory is if enough people use this, the crowd source...  I mean, I believe in the crowd.  Yeah, absolutely.  There are problems with the crowd.  You look at DIG, for instance, and the crowd can be gamed.  The crowd can be wrong.  Yeah.  But you trust them to do something like this.

Start time: 2099.68
End time: 2111.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would trust the crowd to be no more smarter than being able to pick our own leaders.  Which is to say...  Which is what they do.  Which is to say that we are able to run ourselves.  And if that's the case, why not news?  Run our news.

I think I want to think about this outside of the scope of journalism.  I want to think about information, not how journalists think.  That's interesting.  And I want us to actually try to kind of get out of that.  Every time I've gone to a journalism conference, it's been very difficult for them to get out  of the problem of, oh my God, journalism is no longer paying the bills.  What do we do?

A lot of building a company or a product like Facebook is just about determination and believing you can.  Everything that's worth doing is actually pretty hard.  That's kind of good.  That's kind of something you don't hear people say very often.  Great relationships are the most important thing.  Focus on building great things with people that you love.  Know where and ever does anything alone.  Great friendships make life fun and meaningful.  I think that's true.  And do what you love, which is probably the best message you can give.

And the folks who do some of our, we're going to be doing our bandwidth at the Twig Cottage,  who will be charging us, I think actually a fairly good rate, I think somewhere around $1,000 for 35 megabits symmetric,  which is kind of stunning since that's what a T1 cost not so very long ago,  are putting in gigabit fiber in Sebastopol.

Transcript:  We've been on another planet for the last three days.  So some more details coming about iCloud and in particular iTunes match.  iTunes match is the service that allows you to, in iTunes, say, you know, I have this.  Can you make a copy available on my iCloud for $25 a year?  So interesting article on the infinite loop column.  Chris Forsman writing in the Orange Technica website.  He says iTunes match will let you mirror up to get this.  What is it? What is Google? 20,000? 20,000 songs on Google Music. I think it is.  Yeah, yeah, that's 25,000 for it. It's like they. Yeah. Yeah, we got you.  Twenty five thousand. How about that, Google? See you on.  It's just it's just a coincidence, right? 25,000 tracks in your iCloud.  The songs can be pulled down, downloaded to any iPhone, iPod touch or iPad,  as well as synced with Macs or PCs running iTunes.  This includes tracks that you have ripped from your CDs or downloaded from the Internet,  even those you've obtained in a less than legal manner.  So actually, I think this was the I'm just channeling Steve Jobs,  but I could see him going into the music executives offices, saying,  do we figure out a way for you to make money on pirated music?  You know, and I bet you Apple's given most of this money back to them, right?  You know, so they can do the service, dude. Yeah, at that price, there's not much money there.

Transcript:  I actually thought the most interesting thing just was the news that snuck out after WWDC,  which was about the subscription pricing. Did you hear about this?  They're going to do that? So there was this big thing about subscriptions had to if you want to do a subscription,  it was actually really something. So the news, iPad subscriptions.  Yes, you had to pay 30 percent to Apple and you couldn't price it any higher than any other source.  And it was the death knell to a lot of publishers who just couldn't afford to take their thin margins and a lot 30 percent off.

Start time: 2767.16
End time: 2813.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we were screaming about it. I mean, it was seemed like such a stupid thing for Apple to do.  It seemed like such a grab. And they backed down. Complete about face.  I got somebody tweeted me and said, see, Leo, maybe you'll think about this next time you whine about Apple's policies.  And I had to tweet back, dude, if people hadn't complained, you think Apple would have backed down?  No, nothing changes. They backed down because people whined.  They wanted to get they tried to get away with it and they didn't. So it's interesting.  They obviously pay attention to that. I agree with you, Dan. That was kind of a shocking about about face from Apple.  So what else did they announce? IOS 5. Anything exciting for you in the new?  You were really an Android person, Gina. Yeah, I'm pretty fully Android at this point.  I mean, you're surrounded. It sounds like you to. Yeah, well, me too.

Start time: 2814.40

Start time: 2825.84
End time: 2852.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It looks similar, yes. Very similar. The only difference is there's widgets in the notifications.  Right. That's true. That's true. I just I have one less argument for people.  When people ask why do you use Android over iOS, it was it was often like it was notifications, voice input and turn by turn directions.  So now I have one less thing that I can say kind of differentiates the two platforms.  I mean, not that listen, it's not a holy war, folks. I'm not I'm really not trying to sense the trolls.  But no, it's great for iOS users who have this great experience. Notifications are terrible.

Start time: 2853.16
End time: 2892.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's a long time. It was a big it was a big thing. And I think still this was a little bit of a surprise.  I think everybody thought that Apple would announce a partnership with Nuance and that they would have dictation everywhere,  which is another your second feature that you really like about Android phones.  And they did not write. And there have been some rumors that perhaps they were going to that this was an this happens sometimes in Apple Keynotes last minute poll.  Maybe they couldn't do the deal with Nuance.  Nuance is notoriously tough to deal with, really tough negotiators.  And some people thought, you know, if Nuance got word or rumor that Apple was interested in doing this,  they might have made it very difficult for Apple to agree without, you know, buying the farm.

Start time: 2892.86
End time: 2921.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When they do this with Nuance and I think it is when I think they will do it.  It's going to be interesting because Nuance is a different religion than the Google approach to voice.  So the Nuance approach, if memory serves, is that they're going to do it on the phone,  which means going to be very fast, but they don't have giant Google server farm to help them with the processing.  Whereas Google sends your voice back to Googleplex, analyzes it and then does shockingly good voice analysis  because they're doing it at the Googleplex, send back to your phone.  But it only works when you're online. It's a little bit slower.

Start time: 2921.84
End time: 2924.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. You need data and it's slower. Right. You need a connection and slower.

Start time: 2924.84
End time: 2958.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The interesting thing is the guy who founded Nuance is at Google.  I think his name is Mike Cohen. He's the voice guy at Google.  But the Nuance he founded was a very different company from the Nuance.  Nuance today is really a holding company that took the name Nuance after they acquired Learn Out and House Speed.  They acquired all Dragon. They acquired everybody.  And then they wrapped it around the Nuance name, which they also acquired basically.  So I don't know if it's the same technology or not. I'm not sure.  It doesn't send to the server on the iPhone. You don't have to be online for the dictation to work.

Start time: 2958.84
End time: 2964.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. What I know is that Nuance has a lot of products, maybe even all the products.  All their products are locally. They don't do it in the cloud.

Transcript:  Right. I guess this is all so it doesn't exist.  That would probably be the biggest thing is that it doesn't exist.  They also bought Siri, remember, which was a very interesting natural language app for the iPhone  that allowed you to say book me a table for two for Sunday night at Il Fornayo and it would do it.  It would hook into OpenTable and other things. You could tell it all sorts of stuff.  And they own it, but they didn't implement that either.  I believe that uses Nuance. As I remember, I talked to the Siri.

Start time: 3008.08
End time: 3016.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe Siri just did the analysis of the language once you'd already figured out what the person had said.  Right. And they were using Nuance or just about anything to convert the voice.  It didn't really matter. Okay. Got it.

But first a word from our friends at FreshBooks.  FreshBooks.com is the place to go if you do invoicing.  Anybody who's been, well, you probably still do invoicing, don't you?  Occasionally.  Yeah. Anybody who's been a freelancer or a self-employed knows about the pain, the horror that comes on the 31st day of the month  when you have to make invoices and get paid for all your clients.  I was doing it and hated it until Amber MacArthur, and this was I think 2004.  Told me about a company called FreshBooks.  In fact, I remember when I first saw the site, I said, wow, this is like the first Web 2.0 site I've seen.  It had the Web 2.0 look, the big buttons, the big text, very friendly, very readable.  And you know what? Here we are some years later, and I think 2 million people since have signed up for FreshBooks.  It changed my life. Their tagline, love invoicing.  Love invoicing, that sounds, yeah, right. I will never, no. You might. Seriously.  For instance, if you do time and hours, they have a tracker on the Web or on the iPhone  that automatically puts those hours and numbers right into the invoice.  If you use multiple currencies, I did. I had to bill Canada. It'll automatically do the currencies.  The thing I like is you can have automatic invoicing.  If it's the same invoice every month, it'll do it automatically for you.  Your clients can even set up auto pay.  Now, that's how you get paid quickly.  They can press a button on the email that says pay by credit card or one of 11 different online payment services like PayPal and Authorize.net.  If your clients are the other kind of client, the ones that take a while to pay,  automated late payment reminders will make sure that they don't forget about you.  Some clients even still want paper invoices. They'll do that too for an additional fee.  They'll print, stamp, and mail your invoice. It really is a great service.  Here's the best part. Free for the first three clients.  Many of us, that's all you need.  It's not a temporary one time only. It's free for the first three clients. Period.  I think you're going to love it. I did it. I've done it. I love it. I highly recommend it.  I encourage you to try it. Yes, they're still giving birthday cakes every week to new users.

Transcript:  You don't. You don't sleep at Food Camp because there's so many amazing people and there's no, you cannot get to everybody.  They make it so you can't, there's no way you get to all the sessions. There are at least.  Eight at a time.  Something like that. More than that. Ten. Yeah. There's quite a few simultaneous sessions.  So it's impossible to get to every session.  And one of the things people do at Food Camp, besides sessions and having playing werewolf, is talking a lot, a lot to different people.  And you actively look for new people that, you know, if you're smart, you look for new people.  Which is why, my excuse for not talking to you anymore, Gina.  I should have talked to you more, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the activity stream stuff and so on. And Salesforce is very much involved in big data.  We were talking earlier about big data and how interesting that seemed to be one of the threads of conversation that was going on there is what do you do with data?  How do you learn from it? I was talking to Andreas. Is it Vigant?  Who's a professor at Stanford and a big data whiz. And he was eating a hot dog at the time.  And I said, so what do you do with big data? Do you is it do you ask it questions and it gives you an answer?  And he goes, I said, oh, it's iterative. Yes, it's iterative.  You ask a question, gives you answer and ask another question, gives you and you iterate.  Oh, I got it. So this is good. He's a good enough lecturer that actually could learn with sign language.  For those of you listening, the sign was he made his finger go around in circles.  Yeah, but we're going to get him on. Actually, it was very interesting. I asked him to be here, but he couldn't.  But we'll get him on. There's another conference this week.

Transcript:  Yeah. In fact, you did a session called, which I thought was fascinating, Cloud versus Pocket. Right.

Start time: 3571.24
End time: 3619.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're there. Well, the challenge is we are simultaneously putting all information in the cloud and having it there for reference.  Steve Jobs said the truth is in the cloud. But we're also actually say the truth is in the cloud. That's scary.  But at the same time, we're carrying around more and more stuff with us all the time. We have more local storage.  Right. And that used to be a thousand songs in your pocket. Now it's twenty five thousand songs in the cloud. Right.  So the question becomes which should be master, which should be right.  And the trend has been the cloud has the right answer and the stuff in your pocket is just a local cash for it.  That's Apple's vision, I think. But it's the way Google was built too. With Android, you get a new Android.  All your contacts appear from the cloud automatically. And you don't really know when you save it, where it is.

Start time: 3620.32
End time: 3640.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple did seem to be a little bit less focused on the cloud, a little bit more interested in local storage.  They emphasized again and again that it will go up to the cloud, then come back down to your other devices.  Yes, that's true. Responding, I think, to a concern some people I don't share, but some people have that, oh, if my stuff's in the cloud, is it safe?  I want a local copy of it as well.

Start time: 3640.98
End time: 3690.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is value in having, and then it works offline. So that's, you know, Apple showed off their Docs integration with the cloud,  which means that you can edit histories and have old versions and those get persisted.  But it's only for you. It's not collaborative editing like Google. The presumption is you'll edit and then a copy will be saved.  So it's more like source code control than it is like that. So that is one of the models.  One of the problems we've got is the presumption that you have two classes of device now.  You have service and you have clients again. We're back to that model.  And as we start engineering stuff for the net, there is a danger that we build things with this very split view of things.

Start time: 3691.08
End time: 3695.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an old view and an incorrect or a view we don't want to carry with us.

Start time: 3695.90
End time: 3832.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's weird in that I had this when I was trying to, a couple of years ago, I went to the W3C thing,  was talking about the social standards, was talking about OAuth and talking to Tim Berners-Lee about that.  He said, why do you need this? Why do you need one server to give permission to another server?  Can't you just run something locally that talks to them?  And the answer is no, you can't really anymore because the thing locally hasn't got a persistent IP address.  So the remote thing can't call back to you. You have to poke out and establish a connection first.  It has to be pulled every time.  And if you think about what Tim Berners-Lee was able to do with the machine he had,  that was because it was globally routable and anyone could connect to it and get stuff from it.  So there's a tension there, which is quite a subtle one in our engineering thinking,  which is that we tend to think, oh, there are server to server protocols and then there are all the clients that talk to the edges.  And you either write something on the server or you write something to the client.  I think you have that with ThinkApp to some extent because you have to post it on a server.  And it's interesting to see some of the developments around that.  So there's a thing called the Locker Project. I don't know if you've seen that.  The Locker Project, it's by Jeremy Miller and some others. Jeremy Miller was the venture of Jabba.  And the idea is to have your own information stored on your own device and routed around there rather than stored on a server.  But it doesn't rely on a central database to connect things.  It uses a distributed hash table so that you can discover other people without there being a central server to look them up in.  So you can send messages across the edges that way.  And that was one of these interesting pieces that's trying to move this the other way.  And the other thing that we touched a bit on there was the idea of we're starting to use, if you look at the node.js in the way that's come through,  people are starting to write server software in JavaScript and client software in JavaScript.  We're using the same data structures on both sides, not from the same code.  And we're just migrating bits and pieces back and forth as needed.  And so it suddenly becomes straightforward to package up a bit of information, some code, and send it to somewhere else to process and bring it back again.  So there's a bunch of these trends that are sort of happening together.  And I think we may be due a swing back to more stuff at the edges again.

Transcript:  From the point of view of a user, because I mean really that's, I mean this is kind of inside baseball talk from the developer point of view,  what it looks like from the point of view of the developer.  What does the user wants?  And now, and by the way, I distinguish this, the user, not enterprise, not businesses.  But now with iCloud and with Google, we're all using the cloud as end users.  What does the end user want? What should it look like to us?

Start time: 3860.86
End time: 3874.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What it looks like to us is we get to share things with each other without having to post them to the large service.  That's the, if you've got an edge-driven vision.  That's what Apple's saying.  Apple's saying they're going to set up their own large service.

Start time: 3877.37

End time: 3908.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean Apple sells really shiny devices with big hard drives.  They have an interest in making sure that you have a local copy.  But I think there's like, there's a really good user.  I mean users benefit from federated, distributed, decentralized data stores.  It means that they can get to their data when they're offline.  They can get their data when that service is down.  They can share.  And they actually have the bits on them.  I feel better about that.  We talked a little bit about federation.

Start time: 3909.34
End time: 3922.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The notion that you could have multiple servers that talk to each other.  And that in some way, do they federate to form a single, or looks like a single data store?  Or are there conversations going in between all of them?

Start time: 3922.94
End time: 3931.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a very interesting move.  We're talking about the news of the week, but also throwing in some FooCamp stuff too,  which is a lot of fun.  In some ways I think FooCamp should be the news of the week.  Story, we missed, because we were incognito at FooCamp,  Spain arrested three anonymous members for the Sony hacks and the bank hacks.  Three people being suspected of being involved in attacks against Sony, Spanish banks,  BBVA and Bankia, Italian energy company, NL, and the governments of Egypt,  Algeria, Libya, Iran, Chile, Colombia, and New Zealand.  These guys have been busy.  They've been arrested in Spain.  All three claimed, the police claimed, were the leadership of anonymous in Spain.  I don't know how you would know that.  I don't know what that means.  I don't even know.  The individuals are accused of performing and organizing large DDoS attacks.  They also were claimed to have attacked the websites of Spain's central electoral board on May 18th.  That's where you get in trouble by the way.  We've learned.  Don't attack.  I was talking to Erasmus Lerdov, the creator of PHP,  and he talked about how he got in just the slightest,  we're going to fix the mic there for you, Kevin,  just the slightest bit of trouble when he was in Australia.  He was in Tasmania doing a talk and he was demonstrating cross-site scripting.  It happened to be that one of the government websites in Tasmania was vulnerable to a pretty good cross-site scripting.  So he just demonstrated it.  It's just a demo.  He was arrested.  He was and he found out, in fact, that, well, first of all, he was arrested and everybody was up in arms until the Hobart police in Tasmania said,  and we're going to cut off internet access to the conference, at which point, he said,  Rasmus, you suck.  And then, go take him.  We don't want to.  And it turns out it could be 10 years in prison.  And Erasmus, he says, I don't know how I got out, but I managed to get out.  He says, I can't go back though.  So don't do it.  He said, the funniest thing is that he's trying to describe to them what, you know, what he, you know, it's a cross-site scripting hack,  which in fact doesn't it doesn't in any way affect the server, the computer it's running on.  It's a way of getting to somebody else's computer by, you know, on a cross-site scripting.  And he said, they were asking me, should we format our computers now?  Have you have you breached our security?  Are we what should we do now?  He said, No, no, you don't understand.  I did nothing.  I did nothing.  Anyway, so that's interesting.  I don't know if these guys are from anonymous.  This would be kind of a shock.  It seemed like anonymous pretty much had covered their tracks.

Start time: 4136.26
End time: 4158.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the thing about anonymous, right, is that it's a lot of decentralized.  Who is it?  It's a lot of people.  And people are individually quite silly sometimes.  So it doesn't surprise me at all that there were some subset of anonymous maybe not even in anonymous who claimed or claimed to be or they just chat room just messed up.  Right. They brag somewhere or didn't use Tor properly.  There's lots of ways to to not do a good job of being anonymous.

Transcript:  Yeah. It could have just frankly been a couple of guys who were using that low weak tool, a low IC tool and got caught.  You know, they didn't protect themselves well enough or whatever.  And of course, the police are going to say we have the leaders.  We have arrested the leaders.  By the way, anonymous ops vow revenge.

Actually, there's a picture somewhere of Brian Brushwood and me.  We saw Duke Nukem forever.  It exists.  It's going to be out next week.  Holy cow.  You see, you guys are looking at me like blank, but that's exciting.  It's been a little while in the making.  Oh, little, little, little, little bit.  You got the picture.  All right.  The chat room has pulled up the picture.  So at the Duke Nukem forever forever booth, they have apparently there's a scene in the game where Duke sits in a throne surrounded by two schoolgirls.  And so they had a throne with adult women dressed as schoolgirls in the plaid skirts and the whole thing.  Classy.  Yeah, classy.  And imaginative.  Well, I thought I'm going to sit in the throne, but I'm going to do something a little different.  I'm going to have Brian sit in my lap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 4326.90
End time: 4328.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that the phonetic?  Well, let me put it this way.

Start time: 4330.18
End time: 4364.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're the kind of person that's pronounced Wii, Wii, then you have to say Wii U.  It's a strange name.  WII space capital U.  It is a new...  It will be out next year.  We don't have a price announced for it.  It is a new successor to the Nintendo Wii.  High def, finally, which is good.  And a little bit more aimed at the hardcore gamer.  But the thing that was interesting is it has an iPad looking device with an accelerometer  and a gyroscope and game controls on it and a full screen, touch screen that you use as a controller  in addition to your Wiimotes and your Nunchucks.  Something that wasn't totally clear to me.

Start time: 4364.98
End time: 4369.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4371.84

Start time: 4377.88
End time: 4419.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gotcha.  So you could walk around like that or you could have it like a DS experience where this is a controller that you touch  or there's a map there as you wander in a dungeon.  It actually was kind of cool for multiplayer because now we don't know how much this is going to cost,  but if each person has one of these, they all have their individual screen and then there's the big game on top on the big screen.  It was interesting.  Sony also announced a new product.  They call it the Vita.  It's basically the successor to the PlayStation Portable.  And I had to wonder, is there a market for this now that we all have smartphones that we can play games with?  Does anybody really want to buy a portable gaming thing?  Dedicated.

But the story was they were traveling around the world on their honeymoon and they got  to Morocco and they were kind of not feeling well and it was Ramadan, so they couldn't  go to, and they were kind of in an area where they couldn't go out to eat.  So they had to rent an apartment and they were in this apartment not feeling too well  for three, four weeks.

Start time: 5050.51
End time: 5055.97

Start time: 5056.46
End time: 5058.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Functional as opposed to decorative.

Start time: 5058.52
End time: 5073.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, decorative ends up being a really important part of human history, but the functional  was my main interest.  So what would that be?  Well, you see, this is the thing is I started out looking at things like the magnetic implant  to get yourself a sixth sense for electromagnetic fields.  But when I started.

Start time: 5073.82
End time: 5076.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5110.26
End time: 5115.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Something magnetic.  Yes.  So it gives off an EM field.  It makes you magnetic.

Start time: 5115.26
End time: 5120.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5121.74
End time: 5123.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can feel the pressure then on your fingertips basically.

Start time: 5123.92
End time: 5143.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not really a pressure.  It's a kind of a, it's actually a very, very profound oscillation.  I didn't know people did this.  There's no skin in the way.  Well I usually recommend that people don't do it because the magnet failed.  It's in a bio-neutral sheath.  That sheath breached my body attack magnet when it was originally, but when it was removed,  it was removed by a hand surgeon so that I could get an MRI.

Start time: 5145.72
End time: 5164.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, see, there was a fast way to get it out and a slow way and I went for the slow  way.  Oh.  So, although I did point out that no one was ever going to sneak up on me with an MRI machine.  And I had a sense for that sort of thing.

Start time: 5165.06
End time: 5169.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That sounds cool.

Start time: 5171.26
End time: 5182.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, I kind of started out looking there, but in the end I found that the most profound  from a society point of view modifications tended to be things like vaccination and birth  control.

Start time: 5183.15
End time: 5183.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well that makes sense.

Start time: 5184.38
End time: 5203.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And really we live in a world that birth control had a great deal of effect on.  And then looking back further, I was kind of inquiring about how the new generation  of drugs might affect society and the best model I could find for it was the introduction  of coffee into Europe.  And it had tremendous effects, the coffee house culture in Europe, and it was tied to  the story of the Enlightenment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there was a couple things that just clicked together for me in one beautiful aha.  We talked about privacy earlier.  We talked about big data.  And I suddenly had this...  Oh, I see the problem, which is right now, our lives are becoming more public and the  government is still very private.  And in fact, we want it to go the other direction.  We want the government to be public.  Yes.  The whole big data thing, the whole privacy thing, these are aspects of the same thing,  which is we want the curve to go, we control our data, but we have access to the workings  of our government and our companies.  And in fact, right now, it's the other way.  And so there's in many different ways, aspects and directions, there's a movement to go reverse  that trend and push it so that we know the people who are running our lives and they  don't know about ours.

Start time: 5465.26
End time: 5481.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, that was one of the things at that privacy session that we went to that somebody  said that I thought was quite true is that we don't maybe mind if businesses have our  information.  The only one is the government to know that information.  And they said, what did they say?  What was the line?  Why the government shouldn't have our information?  Oh, right.

Transcript:  There were a couple.  One was a very interesting session that Kathy Sierra put together on gamification and why  it's evil.

Start time: 5500.78
End time: 5505.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, that's interesting because last year, Jane McGonigal was all about gamification  of everything, right?

Start time: 5505.86
End time: 5522.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  But the problem is it's now been through, passed on from hand to hand and lost all the  Jane-ness from it.  Right.  And what we have instead is people just adding leaderboards and badges and nonsense and basically  doing little skinner boxes instead of actual games.

Transcript:  As anybody who's played Farmville, as anybody who's been addicted to Farmville as I have  For We Rule, I agree.  Gamification is an evil and Zynga is evil because they suck you in, don't they?

Start time: 5536.52
End time: 5585.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  But it's also become, suddenly it's the trend for marketers to do.  So every site is getting badges and you get a badge for going to our website and suddenly  it's all turning into nonsense.  So she had a very good argument to that.  And the thing that she was particularly worried about was people talking about gamification  for education and doing this because it has this initial increase in affect and then it  drops off to lower than before.  Oh, is that true?  So this is the actual research.  If you start giving people extrinsic rewards for doing things that are actually challenging,  not trivial, then the reaction is that they value the task itself less and do less of  it.  Education already has that problem with GPA.

Transcript:  There is some learning possible.  The thing is, yes, there is some value here.  And if you are actually a game designer, you can use those processes.  But now people are making sort of cargo cult versions of this where they take the trappings  of games and actually end up polluting the sites and making things that aren't games  either.

Transcript:  There's some wonderful studies in child psychology of – I'm remembering this, so I might not  have all the details perfect.  But they took a group of children and they gave them crayons to color with.  And then they paid one portion of the children like a dollar for their drawings and then  brought them all in the next day and gave them crayons to color with.  And the ones that had been having a great time yesterday coloring, colored again.  And the ones that had gotten paid wouldn't do it again until they found out if they were  going to get a –  And now they weren't having any fun doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, my brain is still processing.  But I think my overall takeaway is that we as geeks have sort of the power, a lot more  power than we think that we have.  And that the tools that we create creates culture and influences culture.  And then it's important to sort of imbue our ideas and our values into the tools that we  create.  And that we just can't sort of make things and be like, oh, let's just see what happens.  I think that we have to be, that we have to kind of use our power for good and be more  aware of our power.  That's very true.  And I feel just very, very privileged to be alive at this time and to have the kind of  access that we got at Foo Camp and have access to folks like all of you.  I'm thrilled to be here.

End time: 5761.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, let's talk about that, Kevin, because I wasn't at that session, but you talked to  me about this morning.  And I think it's very important.  This is a call to action for everybody who watches this show.

Start time: 5762.01
End time: 5770.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, the problem is we haven't got a concrete call to action yet.  But there is an act being put through Congress called Protect IP.  I think you know some more about this too, right?

Start time: 5771.48
End time: 5827.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Actually, I've been working with and watching a little bit the Demand Progress campaign to  try and stop Protect IP, which is the new name or the other name for COICA.  It's interesting, like one of these things gets out, it's given a name and then it gets  a bunch of bad press and they like change the name and continue to try and do the same.  Protect IP, COICA, it's all an internet blacklist.  And for me, like one of the most chilling things about this is this is in the backdrop  that have been done by ICE and DHS alleging criminal copyright infringement, contributory  criminal copyright infringement, which is not a law.  They're already doing these seizures based on something that not only isn't a law, but  was rejected by Congress a few years ago.  And they announced last year, they announced those raids from the Disney headquarters.  Yeah.  Isn't that nice?  Just kind of cheeky, I think.

Start time: 5828.00
End time: 5830.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now we know who's running the show, right?

Start time: 5830.90
End time: 5861.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So COICA and Protect IP would expand those powers.  They'd legitimize what's already going on and they'd allow more domain seizures and they'd  allow the government to create a list of websites that you couldn't access in the US.  And every ISP would be compelled to go get that list and block your access to those things.  And there's no profound judicial review on what goes on to that list.

Start time: 5861.46
End time: 5876.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So basically it's to protect big content companies and they get to say, we don't like these guys,  take them out.  And then ICE or other federal agencies, the DHS will take them out and we won't be able  to get to them.

Start time: 5877.12
End time: 5881.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's really unclear where the edges are, the edge of those things are and I think it  really runs into a lot of First Amendment problems.

Start time: 5882.12
End time: 5892.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's clearly contrary to the internet.  So the question is how can we, as geeks who understand this, make lawmakers understand  it?  And Kevin Marks, you have some experience with this.

Start time: 5893.10
End time: 5968.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it is a challenge.  The problem is that the lawmakers, it's very easy for the Hollywood side to tell their  story because that's their job.  They're professional storytellers.  They're storytellers.  They're good at creating narratives and getting glamorous people to present them well.  Whereas from our side, that's not what we do, most of us.  We're sitting here just building things.  And it's very hard to make Common Carriage sexy.  This is an assault on the principle of Common Carriage, which is a very old principle of  common law that says if I'm transporting something for you, I'm not responsible for the contents  of it.  So this is why we're able to build many of these websites that host staff, because the  liability is not passed on to the host.  It's the person who put it up there who's liable.  And there's another piece called Safe Harbor, which was part of the Copyright Act, which  is one of the reasons the US was able to build so many of these sites and it was trickier  in other countries.  Without which you could have no YouTube.  Right.  Without this you couldn't have YouTube, you couldn't have photograph hosting, you couldn't  have things like that.  And this isn't an assault on that principle.  This is saying, okay, we are going to hold you liable for this and we're going to take  your entire business away because you're hosting, because somebody on your site updated something  we don't like.  And that's scary.  And we need to fight back against that.  Have you got some direct?

Start time: 5969.34
End time: 5996.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, right now, like I said, most of this footwork is being done by demandprogress.org.  But there's always the most direct option, which is calling your representative, calling,  emailing, writing paper letters to your congress creator and your senators and so on and so  forth.  And those things, especially if you take the time to do them, not just sign a petition,  those numbers do build up and they do listen to that.  It's not the only thing they listen to, but it does make a difference.

Transcript:  I actually spent a summer back in high school as an intern in Congress or in college, I  think it was.  And it's funny, we were talking earlier about Apple reversing their subscription stance.  And the one way Congress is like Apple is they do listen if enough people squawk.  And so it's very true that if you call your local representative, call your local senator,  the one who represents you.

Somebody answer the phone, there'll be a staffer you say, my name is so and so, I live in so  and so.  That's important.

And you know, Kevin, Kevin had a great little bit of great strategically with this, which  is that every constituency has a reason not to like it.  If you're a libertarian on the right, obviously government intervention is a bad idea.  If you're a, if you're in the Christian coalition, you wouldn't like it because it would impact  churches as much as anybody else.
