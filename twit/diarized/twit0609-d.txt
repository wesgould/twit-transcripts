What a good show and what a weird week in the news  I don't even know where to start, but I'm gonna start with Tuesday and Apple  a really interesting thing I think unprecedented Apple brought in  Five  Bloggers not five no no Walt Mossberg. No Wall Street Journal. No New York Times. No gizmodo  They brought in  John Gruber from daring fireball arguably one of the most popular Apple blogs. Mm-hmm. They brought in  Ina Fried from her new  Excellent place is axios. She's a very good tech writer from Mashable Lance Yulian off your former boss  Yes, Christina  John Pachkowski, he's he was at Rico's  now buzzfeed, yep, and  From TechCrunch Matthew Panzerino, so that's that's basically five blogs. I mean well-known big blogs gonna say

End time: 255.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know until very recently it would have been the Wall Street Journal in there  The establishment it would have been the New York Times USA Today

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and  What was really they brought them all to the design lab they had stuff covered with black cloth  So I'm sure I could just see you know going we're gonna see something today  No, in fact right off the bat Phil Schiller is their senior vice president worldwide marketing Craig Federighi is in charge of software engineering and  John Turnis who's vice president of hardware engineering?  So you got some you know, no Tim Cook, but you've got the people and no Johnny I  But you got the people in charge of it and by the way all these pictures are not from the journalists  But from Apple they do not allow the journalists to take pictures  But we also don't know is what ground rules there were were there were there for instance some off-the-record things

Start time: 298.86
End time: 307.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We do have one they were preaching to the converted on this one. I mean with the exception of I know  There's a lot of camp follower stuff around. Well, certainly Gruber

Start time: 308.32
End time: 312.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, but Matthew Panzerino is pretty independent. I think I haven't seen that many

Start time: 313.84
End time: 318.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is definitely independent I haven't seen that many daring fireball stuff which really lays into Apple in the way that sometimes no

End time: 334.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is rubers. I probably overstated it on Tuesday. I said he was the Fox News of Cupertino  But he's and he's not  Attention to facts more of a fan, but he's a good journalist and he's very accurate. He's always accurate

Start time: 334.76
End time: 348.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's always been a fan, but he will call it like it is when there's a problem  He will be I agree he will  Which is probably why they chose him because he's and I would say of the five  He has been the most outwardly critical of the professional Mac strategy

Start time: 349.30
End time: 402.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well get ready because that's what this was about and the unprecedented part besides well  It's all unprecedented was the very first thing they say is we blew it  The trash can Mac the Mac Pro the one I you know that lots of people including myself  Three thousand dollars three years ago never updated  The the up the quote update that they announced was well, we're just gonna make the high-end version  No, it's a dog. Yeah, we're in effect cutting a thousand dollars off the high-end  Version they said we blew it. It wasn't designed in a way that we can upgrade it now  Of course Phil Schiller starts with all the Mac is doing really well. We're really proud of you know, blah blah blah blah blah  but really  The the I think the takeaway is when we designed  You know remember he was the guy who said can't innovate my ass  Look at this

Start time: 403.42
End time: 426.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, we didn't eat those words over social media over the over the following week  I mean it was just he was trying I don't know if we can say this on there  But trying to polish a turd is a very English expression. Yeah  Actually, there was quite highly polished that particular. Oh, yes, they put a lot of elbow work into it  It didn't work did it which is why they've now had to say  Guys, yeah, sorry didn't quite work out this time, but we'll get it right next time

Start time: 426.66
End time: 451.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, I'm this is something new that we've got now from Matthew the transcript of this  So we have the full transcript, which is nice  But but but I think the most important statement was when we designed the Mac Pro the trashcan Mac  We didn't we thought that the future was gonna have dual graphics cards for instance  We didn't we didn't make it in such a way that we could reasonably upgrade it for pros  so

Start time: 452.86
End time: 479.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're they didn't see USB C coming. Yeah is what I took out of that  I mean they didn't explicitly talk about that  But the big thing that I took from that was that when they designed it they were thinking the GPU would be the most important  part and that Thunderbolt 2 would be the new process would be the new bus and they didn't foresee that in a matter of you know  Four years or whatever that the next big IO  Advancement would be coming through USB C and funny because Apple was part of the team that developed us. Right? Yeah

Start time: 480.68
End time: 490.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody on the campus knew all about USB C and for max they seem to love USB C  Yeah, the Mac team has USB C everywhere now anyway

Start time: 491.30
End time: 506.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But this is a fundamental problem that app has got with buses and then it can't decide what connection technology  It wants to use for the last couple of years and as a result  We've now got users left with 17 different dongles  They've got to carry around in a bag with them just to make the bloody things Craig Federighi says this is a quote

Start time: 506.80
End time: 589.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's fair to say part of why we're talking today is that the Mac Pro the current vintage we introduced  He doesn't call it the trash can Mac. We want to do something bold and different in retrospect  It didn't well suit some of the people we were trying to reach. It's good for some. It's an amazingly quiet machine  No one cares when that's it's a beautiful machine. No one cares  It's under the desk, but it does not address the full range of customers. We want to reach with the Mac Pro  Turn us says the fun one of the foundations was dual GPU and for certain blah blah blah  But the way the system this is the key the way the system is architected  It just doesn't lend itself to significant reconfiguration for somebody what might have different might want a different combination of GPUs  That's when we realized we had to take a step back and completely  Re-architect what we're doing and build something that enables us to do those quick regular updates keep it current keep a state-of-the-art  Now at that point they said we do not we are working on a new Mac Pro it will not be available  This year they didn't say when it'll be available and I've saw a  story  Repeated by Mac rumors from a blog that said he talked to a number of people and it may not be till 2019  The reason he thinks that is his people told him and on the Apple people told him that they started working on the new design  a few weeks ago and  It's not unreasonable to say it might take them as long as two years

Start time: 591.99
End time: 609.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Certainly over a year to make a new well they've dropped the ball on this on this sector for so long now  They're playing catch-up constantly. I said because they had the cheese grater Mac  Oh, yeah perfect and now Microsoft is eating their lunch with designers and you know  I think that so this is as I'm gonna say in my opinion by the way

Start time: 609.86
End time: 657.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have the surface studio  That's what I use and I think that a lot of designers would look at this and say that's what I'm doing  Look at this and say that's what I wanted a Mac to be touch screen by the way Apple said at this meeting no touch screen  They said at this also we're gonna continue to update the iMac there'll be a pro ish iMac later this year  They said pro iMac later this year that we are gonna make new Mac mini's gonna be a little taller  Maybe and they said not this year, but sometime  Which makes it to me a vaporware announcement there will be a new Mac Pro trust us on this one  It'll be coming it seems to me. This is to staunch the bleeding of people  They're hoping that pros listening, and I don't know why a pro would do this would say oh all right  I guess I won't make this shift to Windows this year and all  I'll survive till the next Mac Pro comes out

Start time: 658.80
End time: 662.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean which some pros might do I mean if they're if they're workload depending on what their software work

Start time: 662.38
End time: 664.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's gonna be very devoted to Macintosh. Yeah

Start time: 667.06
End time: 701.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And some people are and it would say if you are looking at your budget, and you don't have to make a  Hardware decision right now if you think that you can make that decision a year from now  Or if you think that the new iMac might be able to fill in the the gaps that might be useful  But yeah, you're right. I mean it's it's basically hoping you know that the pros who are already kind of eyeing  Professional you know Windows desktops  Are going to be convinced to not to do that because they know that something new is coming and whether that works or not  I don't know  But I mean that's obviously what they're hoping is that they'll be able to prevent people from making those decisions

Start time: 702.94
End time: 750.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Up until the time they made this announcement  It was quite kind of eerily reminiscent of almost 20 years ago when the Mac was really bottoming out and there are all these intensely loyal  Mac users who were trying to decide whether to move to Windows which seemed to be the only option at that point  And some of them did it fairly quickly and a lot held on and eventually the ones who held on actually were rewarded because the Mac  came back and  But you saw this conversation on the web until they made this announcement that maybe there will never be another really  Powerful Mac aimed at creatives and people who want expand ability and a lot of horsepower  So that  You know they just took the can down the road a little bit because it's entirely possible that when they do reveal  The new Mac probe people will grumble about that too

Start time: 750.54
End time: 760.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But I mean the Mac came back because Steve Jobs came back and he actually had the balls to sit down to do  I've and others and say look this is how it needs to be the famous quadrant

Start time: 760.24
End time: 792.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said there's yeah pro and consumer. There's desktop and mobile. We're gonna make four  products one in each quadrant  This is a very different Apple this is not Steve Jobs Apple this is  For Apple to say we screwed up with our top-of-the-line product  And we're gonna have we haven't updated in three years, and we're never gonna update it  This is Thomas whole word of writing in OS news, and I don't know how connected Thomas is he's saying you don't you think?  He's maybe make I don't think he's making it up, but he says I don't think he's making it up

Start time: 792.92
End time: 797.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just don't think his sources are as good as maybe they maybe not but he says and so maybe we'll take

Start time: 797.46
End time: 809.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With a grain of salt you know 2019 although I will point out if Apple is making a new Mac  If Apple thought it would come out in 2018 they would say 2018 all they said was not this year

Start time: 809.44
End time: 815.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they'd rather pleasantly surprised people then have exactly disappoint or they'd rather keep these people strung along as long as possible

Start time: 817.62
End time: 896.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says what made Apple do a 180 well after the in that this is what his sources tell him after the announcement of  The new MacBook Pro with touch bar orders for the refurbished old MacBook Pro supposedly went through the roof and by the way  I did that I had a touch bar hate the touch bar  Sure ended up trading it in for the touch bar list the function key lower end model which I'm in love with which is a great classic  Macintosh laptop  He said and after the initial batch of reviews came out they shot up even higher the the refurbished orders  This response to the new MacBook Pro with touch bar took Apple completely by surprise  Combined with the problems surrounding the LG ultra fine 5k display remember Apple's it kind of implied  We're not gonna make displays anymore  We'll let let LG do it but then that LG display broke the internet  Because if it was anywhere near your router your router would stop working and the constant negativity from professional Apple users the company  This this is a Thomas again can decided to double down on professional users as a result will be getting a new Mac Pro and an iMac Pro  iMac Pro this year new Mac Pro not this year and  In addition, he says I don't know if this is true. This would be another big retrenchment from Apple  they're exploring additional retina MacBook Pro models without the touch bar and  Maybe hooking up an iPad Pro to a Mac to use it like a Cintiq

Start time: 897.10
End time: 901.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm, which you can do now with third-party software to it does that not very well

Start time: 908.82
End time: 952.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder though, you know to me when I think about when Apple started to lose some of the Pro market and obviously they still  Have a lot of and I'm not trying to say that they've lost pros because that's that's not accurate  But when I start to see when there was the shift  When you note about like when they kind of regained things, you know in the in the late 90s with Steve Jobs coming back  You could also predicate that on the creation of a final cut and logic and kind of this professional software  Apps they made but when Apple released final cut 10 back in what was it like 2011 at NAB, you know that was  A big switch away from what how video professionals have been using software and it wasn't a positive one  And in fact the the industry reaction was quite negative. We made that shift here to it

Start time: 952.58
End time: 959.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We replaced all our Mac Pro great cheese graders with Dell workstations and  Adobe Premiere  Yeah

Start time: 959.16
End time: 1010.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  You're not alone many many places to that many many many shops that that I was at NAB both the year that it was  Announced and I was at NAB the subsequent years after and it happened and in seeing the shift just you know  Anecdotally amongst you know on the floor of seeing places that had gone from being, you know  Mostly supporting even hardware external hardware supporting final cut to being, you know, premier based things was extraordinary  And so I do wonder how much of this is kind of tied together  Where are you in addition to obviously add by their own admission not making the right sort of professional computer with the the trash  Can Mac Pro and and it not being extensible and maybe not being future proof in the way that they would have anticipated  They over  Emphasized and thought the GPUs would be important in a way that ultimately it turns out that there was  Different connectivity standards and different sorts of things that were more important mistakes can happen, right?

Start time: 1011.42
End time: 1013.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you could screw up that way without a doubt

Start time: 1014.04
End time: 1080.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but but I wonder how much of it was kind of a combination of both that design decision and then also the switch and  software where you had a fundamental and a hugely  Hugely, you know big change and final cut 10 and I think the final cut 10 has come around  I think that if the final cut 10 that is available now had been released six years ago  You wouldn't have seen the switch that happened  but when you did that big industry shift which  Incidentally was the same thing that had happened when the first final cut came out where people switch from Avid and and premier systems to  Using final cut when you have that seismic kind of shift with within a lot of professionals to being like well  We're we're now Adobe people and Adobe has now moved with software as a service model  And Adobe, you know software is gonna work the same as PC as it is on Mac  I wonder how much that has to do with kind of the the feeling amongst professionals that that Apple is is less relevant  if that makes any sense because I so I wonder like how much of it is that they'd  Ignored things on the software side to a certain extent  They've made wrong bets there in addition to maybe making some wrong calculations when it came to  At least on the Mac Pro side some of the designs considerations Schiller did want to reassure pros about software

Start time: 1080.88
End time: 1098.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says I want to reiterate our strong commitment there as well  Both with final cut Pro 10 and logic 10 there are teams on these software products that are completely  Dedicated to delivering great software no foot off the gas  There but this meeting really is to reassure pros right Harry. I mean, that's really what this is all about

Start time: 1099.30
End time: 1111.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They were really having an existential crisis in a lot of cases. They have no idea. What was it? Is it enough?  Again, I think it's kind of kicking the can down the road eventually these machines will come out there. They're not gonna please everybody

Transcript:  Will people how hard is it? I mean obviously you just mentioned Christina. We've shifted twice  How hard is it if you shifted the windows this year to go back to Mac if they come out with a great Mac Pro at?  the end of  2018 you could shift back

Start time: 1127.68

Well, okay  Last time I tried to use a Chromebook  I was trying to use something in the field and then I was able to make it work once I connected but I had  To use my phone as a hotspot. I mean, it's still ultimately for me as a work machine. I could never use it  Because there are instances when I might be in a cab and I'm working on a story and I need to write something and then  I can't trust that it's gonna locally store the stuff that I need and then update it  I mean it for most people and these are edge cases. I'm not trying to say that for most people a Chromebook wouldn't be fine  I think you're right. It would be what you're doing is hanging out on Facebook and reading your email. Oh, yeah

They want to move everybody to iOS

Yeah, they're doing but they're not  It's not bad. See that red is the Mac mini on this graph here. It's not as right  It's not as depressed as it looks  well, I think I think you're gonna see a big bump as  They just announced a $329 iPad which I want compete with a Chromebook pretty well  Lot of people are gonna come into the end and I'm by the way when I say Chromebook  I iPad would also be a very good choice for those people at  $329 I predict the next quarter or two you're gonna see iPad sales resurge  There are a lot of people with older iPads what they didn't anticipate is that an iPad would be good for four or five years

Start time: 1636.90
End time: 1700.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that that's it right there because when you saw  Exactly, I mean I would say that but that's what they didn't anticipate because I look back at something  A couple of years ago on the fifth anniversary of the iPad and whether we were all wrong or not  and because at that point two years ago, we hadn't kind of seen this research and with the iPad Pro and things like that and  because the iPad was like I think it's like seven years old like this week, I think and  Yeah, I think you're right  I think that you know you had like these couple of years of tremendous growth and and Apple and everybody else kind of anticipated  Oh, well, this is going to be the new iPhone and then what happened was everybody had an iPad and realized  Oh, I don't need it for you know, four years or so  I'm gonna buy my mom for instance the new one the three hundred twenty nine dollar iPad for her birthday  So if mom is watching in August, you'll be getting a new iPad, but this will be the third iPad  I've bought her I bought her the original iPad 3g and then I got her an iPad 4 with LTE and that was I guess  So this will be the first time in nearly five years that I've got her an iPad and and she uses her iPad more than she  uses her MacBook and

Start time: 1702.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the reason I have my point is all of that revenue comes from the iPhone we acknowledge right  But I think they really do want to replace Mac OS with iOS. Yes, absolutely  As soon as iOS is as capable and it's rapidly closing in according to Harry as a PC as a Mac OS  You need to be committed to it  Yeah, but it's that's why they're not gonna do touch on the Mac  They're gonna this by the time we put on touch on the Mac  You'll be using iOS by the way  memo from imagination the company that made the GPUs  Yeah  Arm is that it's like arm, right?

This is the kind of thing a company does  Hey when it wants to own everything it's gonna try to buy to Shiba's and production  It wants to own all the hardware as Samsung does by the way, which is why Samsung is the biggest threat to Apple right now  And not only they want to own all the heart on the hardware manufacturer. They  This is a step towards making the iPad and the iPhone as powerful as a PC  Absolutely, I fully think that Apple this meeting will end this now because you know, we've talked enough about it, but this meeting  This briefing that Apple gave this week is  Merely a holding action and what what what was missing and I know that Matthew and Ena and everybody else knows this is  The admission that Apple ultimately isn't gonna be making Macs anymore. They denied it. They said no, no, no, we love the Mac  Just like they said Apple to forever

Transcript:  Well, how do you build iPad apps if you don't I mean honestly and until you have Xcode running on iOS  I agree a ways away from then how you can we away away from that? I think we are I I mean are we I  Think we are I think that they could technically do it  I don't I mean we'll see what they do at WWDC, but we haven't seen a mobile first IDE from anyone now  That's not just Apple. We haven't seen this from Google or Microsoft either

Transcript:  Will you then say okay, that's it? I'm not gonna say that's it because I think that it's much more nuanced than that  I think Harry is right. I think it's got a lot longer life than that  But will I think that is where I think is that more on the term sure?  But I mean I think that a it's a high margin product P there there are even though the average consumer  I think they would love to move them to iOS. I think you're right  They would love to move a lot of people, you know to the iPad  There are plenty of people and it's not insignificant. The fact is they still sell five million max a quarter  and a very high margins who rely on on Mac OS and and I don't  foresee  Them being able to it's I think it's gonna be a ways off before they can replace that  But it's mean to us with iOS in the meantime Google is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But again Google still doesn't have an IDE that will work on Chrome OS  So, you know, you still so, you know what I'm saying?  So like you're not wrong  But I think that for both of these until you actually get to the point where you can develop your your applications on these alternative operating  Systems the the desktops not going to go away. No, yeah

So, you know, I hope you're right because I love Mac OS. I'd like to keep using Mac OS  You know, I I'm very happy with Linux.

It's you wouldn't understand  It's well armored rugby you mean yeah, right armored rugby. It's it's almost  Inevitably the sign that companies peaked when they build the massive headquarters, although  Apple Facebook and Google all three are doing massive new headquarters and Salesforce and Salesforce. All right  UBS which is a bank company an investment company they have analysts they have released a research note  Which Business Insider is quoting saying that Apple has more than a thousand engineers  working on augmented reality in Israel and  Robert Scoble might be right doesn't say that in the note, but that the this may appear on the new tenth anniversary  iPhone remember they hire they acquired prime sense which made the connect sensor  Matio  Which  Kind of lets you overlay look at products in an overlay different colors and finishes real face, which is face recognition another Israeli company  Apple  In the dark behind the scenes may be working hard on AR  But you got to think companies like Google and Microsoft which have been doing this for a long time  Also are working on it. Will Apple beat him to the punch?  They have to sorry go no, that's a good question do they do they even have to Hololens is delayed  I mean, it's a development kit now, but it won't be out till 2019 Microsoft's right

Transcript:  I don't know one of the things that really encouraged me about this article is they were going for AR rather than VR  Yeah  Because I think VR is a really big dead end most of this most of the money most of the software is going to be  Focused on AR or mixed reality VR is is a few key locations until they work out the whole movement and vomit deal  But with AR you can get really useful stuff going  You've got a great selection of apps that you can get in you can really personalize it  It's gonna be tricky, but I think Apple are playing catch-up on this  But they're willing to throw large amounts of money and as you say they're not usually the first to do stuff  But they're usually the best at doing it for the short. So are they still  Well, this is the problem they used to be I  Mean it's given the last couple of years. I have my doubts, but at the same time  I mean Microsoft is doing very well with HoloLens, but isn't selling particularly well. It's very expensive  Well, it's a developer thing.

They'd be much more likely to put off talking about anything until they had something spectacular  Which Microsoft didn't do Microsoft has something which is not yet transcendent. That is really interesting  I would also be a little cautious about  Thinking that Apple having a thousand people means that much given that you're probably had a thousand people on their Titan project

It's a good start  That I feel I mean it has an unlimited dvr and it's very and the by the way the best  Based user interface of any of these right including your cable company  Um, if you look at the live tv grid and you hover your mouse over you can actually see what's playing  In real time  And if you want to dvr something it's one click

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, they do well, that's that's most of the cases. Most of them have a limit but the nine months is decent  Nine months is a lot longer  Yes, it is and and there's a six user profiles that you can have in your family and then up to three  Consecutive streams at once concurrent streams at once three streams at once is actually really good  I think playstation view will technically let you do five  But a lot of times they will limit what types of devices you can use a direct tv lets you do two sling  I think maybe lets you do two it depends  Hulu hasn't been really clear with what their live product will be how many they will let you do  So three at once for most families, I think is fine  And then six profiles is really good  Yeah, you're right harry only nine months on the dvr, but that I think for most shows that's fine  And I have to say it better than most and I honestly think the way their dvr is set up right now, you know  It'll record all of your so if you like you have a show like uh, if you want to record, you know  Bob's burgers it'll record not just when bobs burgers is arian fox  But also if we're arian syndication on one of your local channels, so it'll do all those instances or playback

End time: 3333.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For some live stuff I have but yeah, it's mostly like 720. I will say this though  When it comes to playback that's been my big  My big like issue when I've reviewed any other services has been buffering  Especially when you're trying to watch things live sling tv is notorious for the sling tv has a great product  But even now two and a half years after it came out if i'm trying to watch the walking dead  On a sunday or whatever united air is you know an amc there's mad buffering and it's it's not great quality

Start time: 3333.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So i'm looking at national geographic's nature that if anything should be at least 720. It's not it's 480  It's probably fine on an ipad on our phone. In fact, the reason I might consider keeping this is more for the mobile  Than four because I have tv at home especially right now

Start time: 3370.34
End time: 3431.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not only that but also airplay doesn't work. Um, chromecast does work. Chromecast works well  But but only chromecast so if you have for instance  I have a tv that has the cast protocol built in but it does it's not like chromecast built in  So you need to actually have the chromecast enabled tv or you need to have a physical chromecast dongle  I assume because of the drm. I haven't been able to get clarification to youtube from that. I reached out  But I have I have a tv with with the the cast protocol  It'll work with any of my other cast compatible apps. It does not work with youtube tv  And that's a huge problem because right now that means the only way you can watch it on the big screen is either to connect  a computer to your tv physically or to have a chromecast and  That's uh, that puts the meta disadvantage because the competitors sling view direct tv now all have apps  At least on the other platforms at least on roku, you know, um, or and or at least will support airplay and and so  To me this could change now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I got to see like it was staged  It was a demo but I got to see a staged demo at ces and I have to say that  Is probably of all of them the most impressive one if they can bring it to market the way that I saw it  I think the hulu model is the best one i've seen tell us about that model. What is the model?  So it's very similar to what you see with youtube tv  The difference is that it's kind of this perfect combination between on-demand programming of hulu  So, you know the big advantage hulu  I think is that they have this huge catalog of shows both originals and older content  And it's the merger of that and live tv  And so the one thing that I was saying huge advantage  And so the one thing I would say that youtube tv doesn't have as much and I think youtube tv is a great start  The one thing I would say is that you have some of the legacy content that might be available  You know depending on licensing deals, you know through like, you know fox or nbc or whatever you where you can watch older shows  But you don't have this whole catalog  Of other shows and and and and stuff that the that hulu has and I think that for a lot of millennials and for a lot  Of tv viewers. It's when you want kind of a holistic television experience  You are intrigued by having the live stuff, especially with sports  But a lot of stuff comes down to original content or just the fact that I want to binge watch  Buffy the vampire slayer and I want to watch those other things and so I think that if hulu can bring to market  What I was shown at ces  That's has to me is the most compelling i've seen  But I think that of the ones that are on the market right now. I think that that youtube tv is a really really good first effort

Does that mean earlier and they tried to they made it seem like it would be earlier than fall  But I don't know, you know, um the fact that uh, you know  Comcast is doing the xfinity mobile service that verizon is rumored to be doing their  Um online only service now that you have youtube tv you have all these others  It would obviously behoove them to to move sooner rather than later, but who knows?

We are moving very quickly now  Much more quickly than we just thought yeah toward an over-the-top internet ip tv only world  Uh, and I think that we can't move fast enough. I mean really what's  Stymied it and frankly the one thing i'd worry about with hulu tv  hulu has been so troubled for so long because  The founders and its partners couldn't agree on how what it should be is it ads free services have ads with subscription  What is it? You know what shows are going to be and interesting enough hulu tv doesn't have any via com shows either  So it's like these guys are just shooting themselves in the foot constantly  Um, very interesting you mentioned comcast is getting into the phone business.

Transcript:  In fact xfinity mobile  Is going to use that whenever possible. It was clear they were going to build a mobile service around this  I thought I thought that well, that's clearly what they're up to right  I worry because reliability on the xfinity mobile is not great, right?  Because sometimes it'll join an xfinity wi-fi hotspot and get no connectivity for some reason  In fact, I ended up telling my phone whatever you do do not join xfinity hotspot  So they have six they claim 16 million wi-fi hotspots

Yeah, verizon's like 80 dollars, right  Which if you're getting verizon cell phone service when you're not on a network is I could that might be a good reason

Start time: 4002.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I haven't met that many people that like verizon a lot and i've got a you know with with t-mobile activity is good  Their data is they're kind of they have great service. It's just very expensive. You've got project phi  You've got t-mobile for the vast majority of americans. There are much cheaper options out there  And I think the only place this is going to get any play is there's some people who are very large sensitive

Start time: 4029.40
End time: 4038.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would and I would and I would just say too. I mean it's  I obviously live in new york and I spend a lot of time on the coast  So i'm in a unique position where most and verizon is a new york company  Yes, but also I could get good service from at&t or from t-mobile and I suppose I could even get good service from sprint  Although I wouldn't want to risk it. Um, but there are parts of the country where  I've been where genuinely you don't get good connectivity from the other places where verizon is just kind of you know  Especially more rural areas is there so, you know, everybody's bad in the rural areas. There's nobody good in rural areas  Yeah, I would agree with that but I would say that that's where you still at least in my experience  You're better or support from at&t and from verizon those two tend to still be best  Right

Start time: 4079.38

Yeah, that's exactly right. That's the only really  Yeah, which play here which for them makes sense  But I mean they could have attempted to do something that would raise more eyebrows and get more people to consider switching and they haven't  That's it's just one more thing

I was one of their first customers back in 2004  I used it because I hated invoicing if you're a freelancer you have to send out invoices the worst thing ever  Well, i'm getting them paid off that's the problem, right? So if you don't send an invoice it turns out I learned you don't get paid  Uh, well if you use fresh books a it's easy to create the invoice 30 seconds or less and it's a professional looking invoice  And this is the thing I like the most  On average fresh books users get paid 11 days  Faster you're going to get paid faster because when your client gets that invoice there's a pay me button on it  You can let your clients pay online via credit card. There's no setup required  Your customer could pay straight from the invoice. It turns out clients a paperwork as much as you do  They put off paying the bills as much as you put off sending the bills if they can pay faster  They will it's good for everyone. You can always see with fresh books dashboard  Which invoices have been sent which ones have been paid even which ones have been viewed so no more excuses  I didn't get your invoice. Yes, you did  Yes, you did. You could send auto payment reminders. You could set automatic late fees  Fresh books lets you time track billing for time and hours and it'll automatically put it right in the invoice  You can even set it up by specific project as well as by client  Attack track your time down to the minute on their app or on their website. You can manage team time sheets this way  And it is so easy the best part this new dashboard  They just redesign it tells you if you're making money or not something a lot of small business  I didn't know am I making money when you add in all the invoices plus the what I got paid what I didn't get paid  What my expenses were did I make money this year?  You'll know and when it comes to tax time all the reports your accountant needs  Like sales tax summary and profit and loss are available. You don't have to be an accountant to use it though. It's really straightforward  It's kind of like behind the scenes accounting it does it all for you it integrates with many of the apps you probably use like  Shopify and stripe and gusto acuity scheduling  All the expensing like concur and expensify. It's just it's just sweet  Ensure a smooth tax season next year.

Transcript:  Which I got a lot of heat for on Twitter what a surprise on Wednesday was well  This is a stupid advertisement if you started protesting every stupid advertisement you'd never end and in fact that this is a  my opinion this is a calm calm very  Predictable Twitter outrage protest not a real protest  but just a bunch of people tweeting 140 characters of outrage and  Why the media pays any attention to outrage on Twitter anymore is beyond me and yeah, maybe it's it's stupid and dumb  But tell me I so to add that's not stupid and dumb  It's not overtly racist. It's not overtly wouldn't say that it's massively distasteful

Start time: 5268.64

Start time: 5282.98
End time: 5294.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is the bad thing here? Well, it's not even but to me the offensive part is it isn't just that they're making light of the protest  They're fundamentally misunderstanding what a protest is by trying to piggyback on a movement

Start time: 5296.18
End time: 5304.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5305.60
End time: 5340.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the whole point of this is the only reason we are talking about protesting  The only reason this is even in the lexicon is because of the resistance  It's because of Black Lives Matter is because of the protests that have been happening over the last few years  That's the only reason it's even relevant to this demographic they're trying to go over  So to me they are absolutely taking iconography and they're taking current events  They're trying to piggyback on those things and pretending to be  Woke pretending to be you know aware of what's happening and rather than actually making a statement of any sorts that is  supporting of things they are making the most innocuous and  As every ad ever

So I understand that I know I but I don't I think you can also go too far the other way  with microaggressions and Twitter outrage and I sometimes I worry that you know, we before the show I was  celebrating Tom Lair's birthday, right? Oh and  He has a great song called the Vatican rag, which is funny  It says if the Vatican liturgy were set to ragtime music, it's not offensive Jen  But immediately somebody said this is Palm Sunday.

Start time: 5785.28
End time: 5837.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also, I think that at least I mean maybe I saw different parts of Twitter than you did Leo  But most of the reaction I saw was obviously was was making fun of how tone-deaf it was it wasn't an outreach of how dare  Pepsi be you know, it wasn't going over the top of people feeling overly vilified. It was it was just  Acknowledgement kind of like the SNL thing was acknowledgement of what a dumb stupid ad  This wasn't how completely off-base this was I didn't see a lot of serious  I mean there were obviously some serious critiques of what was wrong with it, but most of it seemed to kind of almost be  Exactly that that was the reaction in my reaction and why I love this story so much  How does this ever get how do you ever think that this is going to be something that will play well like in what universe  Do you think this is a good idea not how dare they do this, you know insensitive thing?

Just remember  Always use the serial comma our show today brought to you by Casper  I love my Casper mattress. Have I say that I can't say that enough. I love my Casper mattress the Casper  Reinvented the mass mattress business by selling direct to you from the US based factory  They're an online retailer of mattresses what people said you can't sell mattresses online. How will you try them?  Well, it turns out lying on a mattress for five minutes in the middle of the day in front of a shop girl who does not  Want you to take your shoes off is not the best way  to try a mattress what if you could lie on that mattress for a hundred nights and  Then if you don't like it you get to return it and get every penny back  That's how it works Casper is made of supportive memory phones for a sleep surface with just the right sink  Just the right bounce you want both you want it to be firm  So you don't have a you know bad back when you wake up, but you don't want your hips and your other pointy bits  To be you know  Sticking out right you know what I'm saying  So it you sink into it, but then it's for it's hard to describe  But you got to try it and by the way, it's breathable. So you sleep cool, and I don't care if it's winter or summer  sleeping cool really is I think a key to a good night's sleep a  Casper mattress provides long-lasting comfort support. You can easily buy it online. It's completely risk-free  They really put the effort into making a great mattress  You spend a third of your life lying on your mattress. Don't you deserve a great one?  You know if you've had your mattress for ten years  It's time for a new one and by the way if you have had your mattress is one of those old spring mattresses  You know what lumps are?  There's no springs in a Casper mattress this thing is gonna go for a long long time free shipping and returns  In the US or Canada, but I guarantee you you won't want to return it  This is the greatest mattress I've ever had get a Casper today  You'll save an additional $50 off when you go to Casper  See ASP er comm slash twit and use the promo code to it some terms and conditions apply Casper comm  Slash twit promo code twit for the best mattress sleep great tonight  On your brand new Casper. We have this has been a far-ranging conversation  We got gorillas in  We were to talk about hackers the shadow brokers. Remember these guys  Mmm, they had a fairly large trove of NSA exploits and they offered them for sale. They wanted seven million dollars  They got one offer for nine thousand dollars  So they have dumped them on the internet and this was a busy Sunday because a lot of security researchers  Have a lot of files to go through so far the reaction on Twitter is some of this is pretty old like dating back to  the 1990s  mostly Linux  The mock monster on Twitter OS X  Reverser tweets while files are old  There's a lot of interesting stuff on the equation group files the equation group is what the NSA group that develops this stuff is called  What they were looking at methods, etc. Very cool might not be interesting to young minds  But it's gold for 90s old farts says OS X reverser  Actually the  Probably more salient tweet is from Edward Snowden  Who says a quick review of the shadow brokers leak of top secret NSA tools reveals is nowhere near the full library and he ought to  Know but there's still so much here  The NSA should be able to instantly identify where it came from and how they lost it if they can't it's a scandal  Yeah, they're not gonna tell us if they do that's right  Yeah, but they you may remember that a that the shadow brokers came to light last August  when they posted samples of the exploit code and  After the leak the FBI arrested a former NSA contractor named Harold Martin
