So I read  the interview with the  Discovery Executive who said  you know we spend seven hundred  five hundred thousand seven  hundred fifty thousand dollars  an hour to make programming so  we're very excited to acquire a  company that does it for a  tenth the cost and I thought  really they spend seventy five  thousand dollars an hour for  programming under revision  three. Oh not not even that much  I mean maybe maybe maybe for  like a hundredth of that

Start time: 490.08

Because I heard they had  seconds some other rounds that  came in. They did have two  rounds and I think ten was  total. Well I know the first  round my understanding was  eight. Right. So the second  one have to be at least eight.  Right you know okay you want to

Start time: 533.18
End time: 565.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  talk gossip. The gossip I heard  was that they couldn't get a  second round so that the  original funder Greylock said  alright alright we're going to  keep because you needed at this  point they were desperate for  cash. Right. Greylock said  alright we'll give you a few  minutes to get the money  alright we'll give you a few  more million but that's going  to be it. And at that point I  think Revision 3 did a good  thing. They pivoted a little bit  they became kind of an ad  agency for for the most part an  ad not so much a creative a  content creator with Scam  School but more an ad agency  for YouTube stars like Phil  DeFranco and Epic Meal Time.

Start time: 565.16
End time: 576.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that was an  extremely important thing for  them to do at that time.  It's a big transition.  To keep everything going alive.  Yeah I know for a while Scam  School was like the last for a  long while of stuff that was  produced in house.

Start time: 576.22
End time: 579.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 579.20
End time: 598.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well and I'll tell you this is  what's really exciting to me is  I've been developing you know  after we pitched Scam School  and it didn't go anywhere I  came up with four or five ideas  of stuff that I could thought  could be the next Brian  Brushwood television property  and television is such a messed  up business.  It's not worth it.  You know it's like it's you'll  get 90 percent of the way there  and somebody will have a bad  Tuesday and decide to justify  their position.

Start time: 599.44
End time: 606.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is why I no longer have  conversations with mainstream  media because that's happened  to me too many times we get  almost there and then they go  yeah never mind.  Well and you find these bizarre

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 619.26
End time: 621.24

Transcript:  Yeah no absolutely because they  want they want that bigger than

Start time: 621.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  live spectrum.  They want it glossy.  So what I'm what I'm mostly  excited about.  That's because you're a  magician and that's what they  do with magic.

Start time: 628.24
End time: 636.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure sure.  I mean they don't do if it's  desperate housewives of  Virginia they're not going to  do it.  How can we spend more money.  Oh no.  Yeah they do because they just

Start time: 636.28
End time: 657.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like what celebrities can you  involve.  You know what crossovers can we  do.  But the main thing that changes  for me is the number of  opportunities a lot of projects  that I previously would have  thought to pitch outside of  revision three.  Suddenly with them having a rich  uncle it becomes way more  important for me to pitch them  internally.  Right.  Which again that's good for a  revision.  They only got 30 that was only

Start time: 657.28
End time: 662.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 677.32
End time: 715.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sense of humor.  The gossip.  Thank you John.  John's always protecting me.  Is that it wasn't a big payout  for the founders.  The founders.  The founders.  The founders.  The founders.  The founders.  The founders.  The founders.  The founders.  The founders.  But it was a fairly successful  payout for existing managers.  Which tells me that the reason  Discovery was interested in  revision 3 is they liked the  management team and they want to  make sure that they were staying  in place.  This is always the issue when  you acquire a company is that  talent really.  Everyone who bails.  So what they will do and I think  they did in this case is make  contracts with the people, the  key people and those were fairly  lucrative.  But I was told by.  So let's find out.  What did Brushwood, what did you  get for your contract to be kept  around?  I'm not an employee of revision

Start time: 750.44
End time: 757.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I'm not one of the most  hands of the revision three  team but I'm certainly not one  of the most important when you  compare to like you know Philip  DeFranco coming in with you know  he could find out.

Start time: 757.42
End time: 762.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 762.40
End time: 784.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  pretty.  Yeah well because those are  established properties that  would continue to do super well  all on their own.  Whereas like for me it would be  significantly difficult.  I could stop scam school and  next week come up with a  completely different show  called Con Class.  Right.  But again it's like I don't  want to do that.  I love the scam school brand.  I love what we've been able to  do.  But again compared to like a  Philip DeFranco it's like it's  I don't see how I would even  factor into revision three's

Transcript:  It's a school in a credit  credit university.  Where is scams.  I mean maybe this is you know I  come from showbiz where  everything is.  Everything is bullshit.  Yeah exactly.  Totally.  And so and so at some point  it's like you're not going to  ruin someone else's show to  correct every little thing.  And plus it's like look for  example.  It lets there was no  computer science degree  program available at his  university.  Right.  But he has a narrative that is  authentic that he's you know.  He took computer science

Start time: 1083.86
End time: 1106.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so and so if if if the  story other people are  reporting because here's the  problem you cannot get in the  business of going around  correcting the media on all  the things they get wrong  about you.  The media sucks balls at  getting things wrong.  It was the Yahoo website.  There's not been a single  article even interviews with  me where they were they even  quoted me correctly in all  this.  And if I made a job going  around saying oh no it wasn't  a nail in my ear it was a  nail in my eye.  Yeah but if it was a nail in  your eye or ear or whatever  that was not supposed to be on

Start time: 1106.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  your own website with arrows  pointing to it I think you  would be.  Now was it his website or was  it like he physically made it  by himself or somebody else  made it and he didn't get  around.  It was like the Yahoo  corporate wasn't it.

Start time: 1116.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The point is all of this  only one thing matters can he  do the job or can't he.  No that's not what matters.  No no no.  Here's why he should be fired.  Wrong.

Start time: 1131.92
End time: 1160.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right all right.  The reason he should be fired  is if a low level person at  Yahoo did this he would be  fired.  True.  And so we can either say well  we have a double standard for  millionaire CEOs they get to  get away with stuff the rest of  us don't.  But if any of us had real work  instead of being journalists  and media people if we had real  jobs and we worked at  companies and we our resume  said we had a degree we didn't  have we would be fired.  And if we had a degree we  didn't have we would be fired.  So if Yahoo wants to have a  policy where if we catch you  fudging your resume you won't be  fired then I think that he also  should be part of that policy.  But I don't like this double  standard.

Start time: 1161.94
End time: 1189.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would hate to break it to you  but there exists a double  standard between millionaire  CEOs and low level employees.  But we shouldn't agree with it.  But again this guy did not  write up a piece of paper with  lies he wrote about himself.  This is something that happened  around and.  Well we don't know.  Okay well no you're right.  That's a good point.  If he did then certainly.  If he intentionally lied then  that is definitely a problem.  But this is a good point.  But this this massive focus on  on on a bio that was written  about him that he failed to  correct in this quote out of  context from an interview from

Start time: 1190.59
End time: 1195.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a minor aspect of the bio.  It's not like he you know was  born on April 6th and it says  April 5th.

Start time: 1204.04
End time: 1207.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 1207.96
End time: 1229.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  or something else.  It doesn't speak to his ability  to do the job.  It speaks to his honesty and  then the question becomes well  how much did he know or was  this somebody else writing the  bio and didn't notice it or did  he say I know they didn't have  it.  You know somebody might write  of me say that he graduated  from Yale.  That's not true.  I dropped out but I might not  make a big deal about it as you  point out if somebody says  actually I would but but.

Start time: 1230.02
End time: 1271.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well you would have been hired  and that was I might not notice  if it was in a bio that I  didn't write.  This is going on for a while.  I here's what I have.  Here's the real problem I have  with this sort of thing because  I've known a bunch of people  that I would just call  pathological liars and they  may start when they make up  anything.  I always have to assume maybe a  lot of it is bull crap and you  know maybe a lot of their skills  are bull crap.  When you start seeing bull crap  you have to maybe once in a  while it's a one shot bull crap  the guy was accidentally full of  it.  But generally speaking when a  guy is full of it at any level  he is full of it on a lot of  levels and I get real skeptical  when I run into one of these  guys because they try to trick  you in the believing stuff  that's not true.  It speaks to his integrity.  Yes.

End time: 1334.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know enough about this  specific situation and certainly  if someone is a pathological  liar I'm not going to defend  that practice but I do know like  I look at my own life like I'll  tell somebody that I went to  University of Texas at Austin  where I studied the Plan 2  honors program in history and  the fact is I had enough history  credits that if I was one...  Planet 2?  It's a special honors programs  at UT where it's like they only  take $100 to $100 to get a  degree.  And you go to a planet?  Plan 2.  Oh I'm sorry.  Plan 2.  It's its own liberal arts major  right?  And so...  You didn't finish?  No I did but after I graduated  I discovered that if I had taken  just one more history class I  would have had a double major.  But I didn't.  What was your major?  What was your major in?  Plan 2?  Plan 2 is the name of the major  believe it or not.  All right enough.  Anyway the point is if somebody  misreported or misinterpreted my  statement to mean that I said  that I had two degrees.  You would correct them.  Well it depends on the situation.  You wouldn't really correct them.  In the middle of an interview  I probably wouldn't.  But if it was in your official

Transcript:  but here's the argument there's bad guys doing stuff on Facebook  wait a minute that makes no sense  so there's bad guys doing stuff on Skype  that we can't listen to because we're the FBI  and we don't have the technology because it's encrypted  and we can't hear them so we can't arrest them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well no but they can get a court order  but it doesn't help because Skype is encrypted  they're telling Skype, Microsoft  you've got to rewrite the Skype code  is that a problem?  no it's all of our problem because bad guys are bad for all of us  well that's the old argument everyone's a bad guy

Start time: 4913.02
End time: 4918.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4918.96
End time: 4934.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and they make a very compelling argument of like  no it would be really easy for us to catch more bad guys  and that's true it would make it way easy  it would also make it way easy for you to vastly overstep  the bounds of your target  yeah make it easy for anyone once that back door is in  which is essentially what we're talking about

Start time: 4935.06
End time: 4938.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4953.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  how is that specious?  we're saying give the law enforcement officials the tools they need  to apprehend criminals  and you're saying well don't give them tools  because they might apprehend innocent people as well  but that's always the case

Start time: 4975.00
End time: 5003.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  no I'm saying it is accepted practice  you give law enforcement officials tools they need  to enforce the laws  and you have to have safeguards obviously  like court oversight  so that they don't overstep  and go on fishing  we do have the fourth amendment  that protects us against unreasonable search and seizure  that's right  that's in the constitution  I understand that  but we don't then strip away all powers from law enforcement  because we don't trust them  what specific

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  okay and so now I know the FBI's got a back door  so now I'm going to just send you encrypted messages  that are encrypted by me  and that you hold the key to  so the skype encryption means nothing  because I'm going to bypass the whole system  what are they going to do  what my friends in law enforcement tell us is

Start time: 5101.00
End time: 5144.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  law enforcement has tools the difference is  is it should it be legal to have private conversations  that you can guarantee are private electronically  that's the question so every time  but you can't do that on the phone right now  I categorize this in a larger phenomenon  which is every time there's an advancement in technology  authorities, law enforcement, government and so on  use the advancement of technology to seize additional powers for themselves  to tip the balance in their favor between the public's rights  and their own capabilities  and this is yet another example  so every time we move forward with technology they grab more  and so it gets to the point where they can listen to everything  it's not that they're listening  it's not just a bunch of FBI agents sitting in Washington  I don't want to conflate a fishing expedition

Start time: 5145.20
End time: 5150.54

Start time: 5154.98
End time: 5207.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and I will fight, you're right, against the Patriot Act  I don't think law enforcement should be allowed to fish  in the sense that if there is no evidence of wrongdoing  that we can then use these tools to look for it  and that is unconstitutional  that should always be wrong  but we're not saying that  we're saying if a duly constituted official of the government  thinks that there is a crime being committed  he goes to a judge and says  Your Honor, here's the evidence for a crime being committed  I would like a wiretap, this is the process  and the judge says, reviews it, gives checks and balances  this is okay, I agree you have probable cause  go ahead and do that wiretap  now we can do it in phones  the issue that the law enforcement has is that  there are now technologies that they can't tap  and they want to have the same situation  that's not true  they have with phones  so here's the thing  should we not have wiretaps on telephones?

Start time: 5208.14
End time: 5230.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well here's the difference, right?  the difference is, the same ability has always existed  if the government suspects you of a specific crime  and gets a warrant  they can go and ask you to open any single thing  and check inside  and that's always the way it's been  all this would allow them to do is to snoop  without ever tipping you off  and it's important, sunlight has a sanitizing effect  I agree that's wrong  you've got to do everything in the opening

Start time: 5231.10
End time: 5241.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree that's wrong  and I agree the Patriot Act is wrong  and the FISA courts are wrong  I'm not denying that  I think fishing expeditions are wrong  but let's  how about, let me turn this around

Start time: 5242.68
End time: 5247.68

Start time: 5254.96
End time: 5263.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's the same standard of evidence  either way  the only difference is one  you actually knock on my door  and make me be the one to open it up  the other one, you don't even inform me  and go snooping around on my stuff

Start time: 5263.96
End time: 5268.96

Start time: 5306.98
End time: 5330.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but I think there's something else that needs to be mentioned  is that the real reason that you want these back doors of your government  especially into something like Skype  is that whether we like it or not  the NSA with their various nodes around the country  are essentially just sucking up everything on the internet  for future analysis  and they can't suck up anything from the Skype  and that's the ultimate fishing expedition

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5886.96
End time: 5942.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you end up paying more  a lot more  if you had just bought everything right up front  you would do better  but in order to do that  you would have to decide to yourself  and this is one of those things about accountability  and the way we perceive ourselves  like if you're gonna invest $400 in an Xbox, a Kinect  and two years of Xbox Live  you will identify, self-identify yourself as a gamer  and what Xbox has to deal with the fact is that  they are a very valuable media consumption device  or device for people who don't perceive themselves as gamers  you got HBO Go as an app on an Xbox available  so that's who this is for?  I think it's the impulse buy  it's to replace the cable bill?  for people who could be seduced  like they're just, and keep in mind this is only retail outlets  well it's only $100  exactly and they're like  $100 and $15 a month, yeah sure  how much did WebTV cost?  I don't play a lot of games  but it seems like that would be fun  and so they jump in and do it  I think this is a very smart move on their part  from a marketing perspective  it's still a bad purchase  and most of the people listening to this show  would not go near it

Start time: 5944.16
End time: 5955.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah, probably already  and I think that there's a certain resistance  to yet another $15 a month bill  sure  that we can't underestimate  even granny and grandpa know that  yeah  do you want another $15 a month bill?  we have too many already

Start time: 5956.24
End time: 5964.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's true, but again you don't think about those things  you just think of  oh I've always liked the Xbox  and it's only $99 finally I can jump in  Jay Spin in our chat room it says

Start time: 6113.04
End time: 6122.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so this was Skyrim, which is kind of an anachronism in gaming  was a stand alone game  you don't play against other people  you play against AIs  you're playing against a game just you, by yourself, all alone

Start time: 6123.40
End time: 6135.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6151.40
End time: 6176.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but here's the interesting question on Skyrim  is, it makes sense from a business perspective  if you've invested this much time and effort to create a world  and a set of systems  why not make it a public world?  why not turn it into a money factory?  but the problem is from a positioning standpoint  you already have World of Warcraft  which is of course the 800 pound gorilla  and you have essentially a copy of the exact same gameplay mechanic  with Star Wars The Old Republic

Start time: 6176.96
End time: 6181.76
