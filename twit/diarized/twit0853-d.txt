So first of all, thoughts and prayers out to the many people dislocated by horrible  tornadoes in the Southeast.  It seems every year now we're reporting that and tragedy, including how many workers in  the Amazon warehouse in Illinois, Alex?  It was 10?

Start time: 357.96
End time: 361.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a few dozen were injured and I think we're still counting how many have died.

Start time: 362.70
End time: 377.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So horrible.  Some criticism of Amazon there, apparently, because one of the things that warehouse workers  cannot do is bring their phones inside the warehouse.  They leave them behind.  And why would that may have made a difference?

Start time: 378.74
End time: 420.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I think that if you're allowing workers to have cell phones, if you treat them like  human beings and you trust them to do their job, even if they have a phone in their pocket,  you know, then there's a chance they might have been alerted to the extreme weather heading  their way.  And all indications are was that this caught them by surprise and may have even increased  the death and injury toll.  Now Amazon, I understand the policy and principle, right?  You want to have people focusing on the task.  But they monitor everybody so closely anyway, right?  And so you're not going to have a tornado every day, but in the off chance that you  do, you should have people be prepared for the extreme weather heading in their direction  or whatever else might be coming to them.

Start time: 421.02
End time: 435.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a really an excellent point.  These days, not having a phone in your pocket kind of disconnects you from the world, oddly  enough.  And it is a little paternalistic of Amazon to say, well, we don't trust you.  You're going to be playing words with friends while you're supposed to be picking and pulling.

Start time: 436.52
End time: 441.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what people say who aren't to be trusted.  They don't trust you because you shouldn't trust them.

Start time: 442.86
End time: 460.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting point.  A little projection going on.  You know, if I were working in the warehouse and I had a phone, I'd be what's happened.  That's probably the case here.  I think you nailed it.  Yeah, somebody in the chat was saying this has triangle shirtwaist factory vibes.

Start time: 461.10
End time: 490.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the bottom line is if they're not going to let the phones in, they need to be double  triple prepared for the case of a natural disaster, you know, potentially heading the  way of the fulfillment centers.  And you know, Amazon is like so up on data, they know every little movement that's going  on in the factory.  So if they don't have anything built in to prepare them for this, you know, they need  to at least revisit those processes because, you know, we're not going to say there's blood  in their hands on their hands, but we are going to say that, you know, they need to  do better in situations like this.  That's obvious.

Start time: 491.63
End time: 630.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  A number of GoFundMe's have been set up for the families of the six who have passed in  that Amazon warehouse collapse in Edwardsville, Illinois.  So very sad, very, very tragic.  We're sorry to have to report that.  There's also very bad news.  Security news going around.  Some are calling this the worst security flaw in a decade, which in a decade has been full  of nasty security laws.  That seems like a bad thing.  It's a zero day in a Java logging library, log4j that allows about the worst possible  scenario remote code execution by logging a carefully formed string.  Now this log4j is very widely used.  Cloud services like Steam, iCloud, the Minecraft servers all use it.  Anybody using Apache struts is likely to be vulnerable.  One of the things this brings up, and it's kind of an interesting side note, is how much  on open source applications maintained by volunteers, which this is.  They are working night and day, these volunteers, unpaid volunteers, to fix this.  It affects any version of Apache log4j from 2.0 to 2.141.  2.15 has been released.  Is a permanent fix.  You can get it.  If you are running, I would hope if you're running Apache struts, you are not only aware  of this, but you fixed it.  As far as I know, I don't know of any serious impact from this.  It was caught and fixed very quickly.  A lot of infrastructure relies on a small number of unpaid volunteers in this world.  Is this something we should fix?  Carolina, what do you think?

Start time: 631.92
End time: 644.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's quite shocking.  I didn't know that.  Given that somebody else had an outage this week, and it took a little bit longer to fix,  maybe Amazon should rely on unpaid volunteers too.  I don't know.

Start time: 645.46
End time: 685.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  AWS also down.  Much longer than the vulnerability in 4JS.  This is the famous XKCD dependency cartoon, which shows all modern digital infrastructure  relying.  It's a block building relying on a tiny little block.  A project some random person in Nebraska has been thanklessly maintaining since 2003.  Unfortunately we know now this is really more true than not.  What about that Amazon outage?  How long was AWS out?

Start time: 687.95
End time: 689.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was a couple of days, wasn't it?

Start time: 690.42
End time: 696.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It seemed like it was a lot longer than it should be.  Everybody relies on AWS.

Start time: 700.38
End time: 704.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Including Amazon.  A lot of those services were struggling.

Start time: 706.12
End time: 771.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The outage was explained on Friday.  Hours long outage earlier this week that disrupted its retail business and third party online  services.  One of the complaints people had is that the status page is useless.  They're going to fix that.  So at least if they're down, you'll know they're down.  Tools began in US East 1, 1030 a.m. Eastern on Tuesday.  Amazon said an automated activity to scale capacity of one of AWS's services hosted  in the main AWS network triggered an unexpected behavior from a large number of clients inside  the internal network.  This reminds me of the Facebook flaw a few months ago.  tools suffered EC2, which provides virtual server capacity.  Amazon engineers work to resolve issues, bring back services over the next several hours.  It didn't bounce back fully.  Let's see, it went down at 1030 a.m.  It didn't bounce back fully to 940 p.m.  So a 12 hour and 10 minute outage.

Start time: 784.20
End time: 810.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Honestly, when these things happen, you really learn who is relying on AWS, which is basically  everybody.  I don't know if affected us.  We go through AWS.  Disney Plus was down.  Netflix was down.  Ticketmaster Roomba vacuum cleaners were offline.  Amazon's ring security cameras were offline.  There were smart cat litter boxes.  App connected ceiling fans.  The world fell apart.

Start time: 810.20
End time: 816.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The world died.  That's like what's worrisome.  What if there were drones and everything and if they went offline, would drones just like  bang into each other and fall?

Start time: 818.60
End time: 940.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amazon's own retail operations, as Carolina was saying, were brought to a standstill in  some parts of the U.S.  Internal apps used by Amazon's warehouse and delivery force rely on AWS.  So most of Tuesday employees were unable to scan packages.  It's a bad time of year to not be able to access delivery routes and scan packages.  Third party sellers couldn't manage customer orders.  And yes, the status page was one of the things impacted.  Oh, well, maybe we shouldn't attach the status page to AWS because if AWS is down, you don't  know.  So what they did is they put a global banner on the service health dashboard, which Amazon  says we have since learned makes it difficult for some customers to find information.  Customers couldn't create support cases for seven hours because the support tool also  runs in AWS.  There's that little block again and that giant tower of blocks, this time not maintained  by some kid in Nebraska, but still kind of a little bit of a choke point, a weak link  in the whole thing.  There's nothing much to report.  That's Amazon's explanation.  It's fascinating to see how much this is though the Wall Street Journal headline, Amazon outage  disrupts lives, surprising people about their cloud dependency.  When your light switches stop working because AWS is down, oops.  The best one is, and this is the lead for the Wall Street Journal, Kyle Lerner and his  girlfriend, since something was amiss when they came home Tuesday and found their two  Persian Himalayan cats meowing nonstop.  They were using an internet connected feeding machine to dispense kibble, but it had been  out since the morning.  This is the best quote, we had to manually give them food like in ancient times.

Start time: 949.50
End time: 962.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Marina Del Rai, it was like ancient times.  I can't, Steve Peters of Los Angeles, also one of your neighbors, couldn't tell his Roomba  vacuum to clean up the blueberry muffin crumbs during breakfast.

Start time: 969.38
End time: 991.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He relies on an app on his phone to beckon the machine.  I had to resort to getting a broom and dustpan.  It was crazy, said Mr. Peters.  I'm reading from the Wall Street Journal.  In St. Louis, losing access to Amazon's Alexa service made Mark Edelstein feel lonely and  helpless.

Transcript:  What is worse than first world problems?  Marina Del Rai problems?  It is like Roomba problems.

Start time: 1022.98
End time: 1062.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fairness though, it does make you think about the reliance on cloud overall.  If you're thinking about driverless cars and smart cities.  Or drones falling out of the sky.  The danger that we might have going forward.  Even if you think about we were out of power, somebody unfortunately lost control and took  out one of the posts outside our house.  We were out of power for four hours, so nothing in the house was working.  No lights, but because everything is smart, but also because there was no Wi-Fi.  So yes, like the ancient times I was just using my phone.

Start time: 1063.03
End time: 1065.55

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Wall Street Journal, I think is taking a little too much glee in this because of  course as a mainstream media company, they're probably not thrilled with the internet in  general anyway.  The outage forced Samantha Sherhog to open blinds in her home in the Tampa Bay area of  Florida.  She couldn't instruct Alexa to turn on the lights.  She otherwise has to move furniture to reach the main light switch in her living room.  So like an animal, she had to open the blinds.

Transcript:  In fairness though, there is an accessibility part of this.  That's true.  Yeah.  Carolyn, thank you.  Voice from an accessibility perspective and that can be distressing.

Start time: 1134.52
End time: 1151.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Especially if you're a Persian Himalayan cat who cannot find food in your cat feeder.  I love the journal.  I mean, really way too much glee in this posting these pictures.  They're just really enjoying this.  I disagree.

Start time: 1168.16
End time: 1195.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's a typically, this is typical of our crowd and their response.  When the Amazon powered lights in his home wouldn't work, he checked the website down  detector.  Of course the lights won't work.  First thing you do go online and see if something's down.  It was a sigh of relief, he said, but the experience also made him realize how much  he relies on AWS.  Alex, is this something to worry about or is this just, you know?

Start time: 1196.18
End time: 1265.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, first of all, I'll say that it's somewhat miraculous that it wasn't worse.  So this was actually better failure than that's 2018 AWS failure.  It was not as bad and this was a hit to US East one, which is part of the oldest region  of AWS.  So if you think about like the way that these things are built on top of each other, you  would imagine that if you're a lot of your foundation is in this, you know, East one,  right?  The first region that AWS built in and it goes down, you'd be in trouble.  And like actually maybe it's a testament to AWS that most of this stuff actually stayed  up and it was only down for a few hours.  Like it could have been much more disastrous.  Now, speaking about this Wall Street Journal story, I think it's a lovely story.  I'm going to disagree with you on.  It's pretty funny.  I think it's great.  I think they really illustrate how much, you know, how do you tell a story like a server  farm, you know, going down and wait, it's human and accessible.  And I happen to think, you know, getting people on record talking about how like they had  to feed their pets like it's ancient times.  I mean, that's kind of give them the pull up.  That's a beautiful story.

Start time: 1266.32
End time: 1285.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  But let's be honest, you know what happened.  The reporter just went to Instagram, searched for people having problems and took their  pictures.  I mean, it wasn't exactly, you know, you didn't have to hit the street.  And your fedora and with your nose, new predators notebook and interview people to find this.  I think they probably Instagram is the street today.  It is the it's the new street.

Transcript:  Speaking of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, the CEO, testified in front of a Senate panel this  week examining social media's negative effects on young people.  Of course, Frances Haugen, the whistleblower at Facebook, among all the things she revealed,  revealed that Instagram had internal studies that showed that young women had a lower self  opinion as a result of using Instagram that it made him feel bad.  In some cases, even suicidal senators, of course, took this opportunity to show anger  and ask sharp questions.  Mosseri defended the company's conduct.  He said, we've got safety measures in place.  And in fact, we don't think Instagram is addictive to young people and and most people are  not harmed by Instagram, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Good point.  Dick Blumenthal and others created Finsta's, remember a couple of months ago, fake Instagram  accounts posing as 13 year old girls, which on the surface sounds kind of creepy.  But they were, to be honest, not what you really want your senator to be doing.  But the idea was to see what kinds of things they saw.  And they certainly were fed a diet, if you will, of, you know, kind of bad food suggestions,  bad ideas.

Start time: 1399.78
End time: 1427.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just wish they did this for every other thing we're fighting for.  Like, let's put ourselves in the shoes of people asking for the change.  Yeah. Like, what does that take?  No, I mean, there's a legitimate issue.  It just sucks that Instagram until they accept this somehow, then they'll make a difference.  If they're going to be in denial of it, because obviously they're liable and there's legal  issues around this, they're going to still fight this.  But then we're not going to see anything change.

Start time: 1427.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Instagram also says, well, look, we adhere to COPPA.  We don't let people under 13 create.  We create accounts, of course.  Good luck doing that.  We ban specific features for kids under 16.  But parents let kids on.  You know, you're an avid Instagrammer, Shira.  It's how I keep up with you.  On balance, is Instagram a positive?  It is in your life, I would say, yes.

Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and I feel like there's a lot of freedom.  There's a lot of creativity.  I connect to a lot of people and meet a lot of people.  There's empowerment.  But there are two sides to that coin, including younger and younger when people are wrapping  their and women are wrapping their self-worth around their profiles.  Or even if they're not building their profiles, but they're like looking at Instagram and  the feed and comparing themselves.  Yeah, that can be very harmful.  I don't know what the alternative is, though.  Like one, you know, make sure younger and younger people are not on the platform and  that I don't know how you create a feed and filter when like that is the world around  you, like the world around you has this.  It's just now an amplified version of that.

Transcript:  Right. Well, exactly.  In fact, Gali in our chat room says teenagers have always had depression and body image  issues. That didn't start with Instagram.  I think really the big problem with Instagram is it allows other people really.  And this is the problem. I don't think it's ads.  I don't think I think it's that other people curate the pictures in the life that they  project on Instagram.  And there's no way you can live up to that.  I always tell my daughter, don't judge your insides by other people's outsides because  what you're seeing is presentational.  It's not what you don't know how they feel.  They probably feel exactly like you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, most of the times they do.  But you can't force people to share those sides of them.  They'll share what they want to share.  Yeah. Right.  And so it's like, how much is Instagram part of that versus just this is where our  society is moving.  It is. I don't think it's Instagram's fault.

Transcript:  But I do think that the more that they're there for creators and for users and  create initiatives and they do acknowledge that there is a problem, then at least that  helps. Like other platforms have acknowledged like, you know, YouTube.  I mean, you could say TikTok a bit.  I mean, they're all part of the problem.  But the more Instagram fights against this, the more they just seem delusional and  continuing to propagate it.

And I remember, I'm sure you do too, Carolina, that the days of Twiggy and Kate  Moss, these super thin supermodels, which caused eating, you know, eating disorders to  ripple throughout the world because everybody thought, oh, well, that's the standard for  beauty is, you know, concentration camp sin.  You have teenage daughters, right?

Transcript:  I have a child, yeah.  And they they were born a girl and now they're gender fluid.  And that brings a whole different layer of, I guess, the complication in as much as  where, you know, they see themselves, who they associate themselves with.  Do they use Instagram?  So they had an account that was a private account when they turned 13.  They could not be least interested now.  And they actually want...  Yeah.  Well, but what is fascinating to me is why.  And I do think that Shira is 100 percent spot on when she says that Instagram should  start with acknowledging there is a problem because they're spending more time and  resources fighting that versus acknowledging and then trying to solve it.  The reason why my my kid is no longer interested is because it feels like TV.  It feels unreal.  And what they actually want is a subscription to Discord because they want a community.  They want people that they want to communicate with that are, you know, similarly  money did have share interests and all of that.  And, you know, it is fascinating to me how I think the younger generation in a way is  more savvy to understand what's real and what isn't.  But at the same time, it's true, depression and, you know, problem with with self-image  and weight and so forth has always been there.  But it's one thing to see it in your school, your class, your friends is one other thing  to see models and actresses because that's the idea of beauty.  And that is still there.  All of that is still there.  Plus Instagram, right?  Because the idea of beauty is still the thin and the perfect and it's still mostly white  and blonde and all of that, right?  Versus representing the diverse world that we live in.  So that's the part where I think my child being, you know, mixed race and gender fluid  could not actually find what they were looking for from an Instagram perspective.

And I think that's it.  So I think there is more awareness of that.  I hope there is.  But and I completely agree with you, Instagram needn't fight it.

Transcript:  I would just say that there's an important difference between the apps that we haven't covered in this  discussion, which is something that came out in Facebook's own research, where Facebook is not like TikTok  and that people come to Facebook and Instagram in particular to compare themselves against others.  Whereas they go to TikTok for entertainment, go to Twitter for news.  And Facebook knows that this comparison part of the app is actually a real problem.  It's what they say in their own documents.  And I think it should have been a focus in the hearing.  But of course, it wasn't because, you know, when it comes to legislators, I don't think there's, you know, anyone  less effective than Richard Blumenthal.  Right.  Doesn't really feel very interested in doing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nor am I.  I mean, I've been down this road long enough to not compare myself to people on Facebook or Instagram  or TikTok.  But yeah, if you're 13 or 14, you're trying to figure out what life is all about.  I can't imagine growing up with that, those signals constantly flooding in on you.  Absolutely.

Start time: 1907.46
End time: 1930.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But in fairness, there is a societal part to this, because you are at that age, starting from school,  you're encouraged to compare yourself to others.  That's right.  And I'm not, you know, I'm not obviously comparing schools with Instagram, but I'm saying from really from a  broader societal perspective, I think it's not it's not it's the peer group.

Start time: 1931.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  I do think that is the education system, too, where, you know, you have a score and you need to fit into  some parameters.  And, you know, there are outliers, either because you're behind or you're, you know, you're ahead of others  and you're getting into that still, you know, what is considered normal or average versus not.  So I, you know, I it's been fascinating.  One of the things that we did as well over the past few years was to to switch from school to homeschooling,  spending a year, almost de-schooling.  And in terms of, you know, asking questions and feeling that you can fail and you don't have to get it right,  that the process that you go through in working something out, whether it's math or science or whatever, is  as important as getting the final and right answer.  Right. You know, it's quite fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So actually, this is something that COVID has, in a way, brought up, certainly in the workplace.  And I think our schools are very much like workplaces in the sense that they have an industrial era mentality  of you come in, we get you to fit into the mold and we crank out people that fit into society.  And it's all about getting you, you know, mushing down the sharp bits so that you fit.  And that industrial era mentality, whether it's in work or in schooling, was a little bit challenged,  I think, during the pandemic when kids had to go home, they had to do Zoom.  They weren't surrounded by their peers.  And the teachers were no longer really able to squish the sharp points out quite as much.  Offices had to let workers go home and work from home.  And now, as we start to emerge from COVID, and I'm sure you might say we are not emerging yet,  but as we hope we start to emerge from COVID, I think the world's going to be a very different place.  And maybe schooling, they'll take an opportunity for schooling to rethink how it works.  I know a lot of kids are still Zooming to school.  So here's an opportunity.  Alex, do you see that in tech?  You see, you must see that in tech companies kind of reassessing post-COVID.

Start time: 2091.20
End time: 2157.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I think that like we all know that the hybrid workplace is going to be the way that we move forward from this.  And we're never going to go back to five days in the office mandatory for everyone inside every company.  I think that's over.  I think it's pretty good, honestly.  Like, you know, we've now realized that there's a balance where we can look at what's happened with the economy since we went into lockdowns.  You know, been on an amazing run.  And of course, some of that has to do with federal stimulus.  But you can't tell me that productivity in the economy has slowed down in a noticeable way.  If anything, it seems like it's the opposite.  So we should give workers the opportunity to spend a couple of days, you know, at home and a couple of days in the office.  If that's their decision, or maybe you trust people to spend every day at home.  And we're starting to figure out the ways that we're going to make this work.  For instance, I was just on a Zoom meeting where we had me and then somebody else remote and then two people in the office together.  And they kind of sat side by side on their own laptop.  So they each get their own Zoom bubble.  And then I had our own Zoom bubble.  And was it weird?  Yeah, it was a little weird, especially for them.

Start time: 2158.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it worked.  We're doing it, too.  It's hybrid.  Yeah, a lot of it.  We're doing it, too.  Instagram does say they're going to bring back a chronological feed.  Not right away.  Now, I don't understand what's so hard about a chronological feed.  Adam said the company has been working on a version of the feature for months.  See, to me, it's like the hard thing is a non-chronological feed.  Chronological means in order.  But not only that.  Go ahead, Alex.

Start time: 2190.74
End time: 2200.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 2223.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's what Maseri said in a blog post in June.  The problem with a chronological feed, the problem is it's impossible for most people to see everything, let alone the posts they cared about.  So we, in our infinite wisdom, are going to tell you what posts you care about.  Make sure you see those first.  Shira, you had something to say?

Start time: 2224.36
End time: 2273.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just going to say, why don't they just have a choice?  You could have the choice of seeing chronological.  I think that's the idea.  You could have the choice of seeing curated.  I mean, the issue with the chronological, too, there will always be a reason to complain.  Because it is cool that if you're posting in your creator, people could discover it a few days later.  There is a feeling like people are just going to start like hyper posting, right?  Just to be in front of people.  Oh, that's not good.  So it'll be interesting to see how our behavior changes in that way.  But then you just unfollow.  True, true.  Yeah, I mean, that is true.  So I mean, I just think it make it easier for people to discover stuff from other people.  Like, you know, I feel like Twitter does a decent job at that.  They're not chronological either.  Are they not?  I feel like I go on Twitter.  Really?

Start time: 2273.56
End time: 2280.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's kind of a matter for debate.  I think they're semi- chronological.

Start time: 2281.32
End time: 2325.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're algorithmic.  Like, they definitely filter that feed with an algorithm and you can choose.  But I bet most users don't even know that that option to choose exists.  Yeah, that's true.  You still actually use it.  So there was actually a big uproar about this in 2015, I believe, when they said they would introduce it.  Because they started off like Instagram, pure reverse chron.  And people like, you know, said that Twitter's live and there shouldn't be an algorithm.  And I actually broke the story that they were going to put an algorithm within the week.  And Jack denied it.  And about a million people over that weekend tweeted hashtag RIP Twitter.  But I think that if you're a user of the platform, you know now that it's way better with an algorithm than without.  So I give them credit.  It's made the service better.  Same with Instagram.  I'm pro algorithm.

Start time: 2325.43
End time: 2372.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're pro.  I'm anti algorithm.  Because I think algorithm is what gets us in all this trouble.  That when people join Facebook or Instagram, they follow the people they want to follow, mostly family and friends.  And they want to see everything that person posts.  But Facebook doesn't show you that.  My mom could.  My mom doesn't post anymore.  But let's say some relative, my sister, I maybe see half of what she sees.  Because, you know, oh, it's too much.  You don't want to see all of your sisters.  Yes, I do.  That's why I joined.  Algorithms are what gets you in trouble with extremism.  Algorithms what tells YouTube to take you down the rabbit hole of QAnon.  I think the algorithms are the problems.  But I've been saying that for a while.  Alex, talk me out of that because you're pro algorithm.

Start time: 2373.50
End time: 2391.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the way you design the algorithm.  So I would definitely want something showing me the stuff that I think is most relevant.  I've tried both the Facebook and the Twitter feed on chronolog or reverse chron and then algorithm.  And I prefer the algorithm.  But it does get into trouble sometimes.  I don't deny that.

Start time: 2392.48
End time: 2414.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the problem is an algorithm which works completely automatically.  Right.  I mean, there's not a human piggy.  And he's going to generalize.  Generally, I think an algorithm is going to optimize for engagement.  Thinking, well, you spent more time on that post.  You want to see more of that.  And while that's good for business, it's why I get a lot of bikini videos on TikTok.

If there is a bikini video, I'm a guy.  I'm going to slow down.  I don't want to.  And it's not what I want to see more of.  But I go, oh, and then I move on.  You have to actively on TikTok say, no, no, no, no.  Because if I look at that, no, I'll see more of it.  You have to, in effect, manipulate the algorithm.  Yeah.

Start time: 2460.59
End time: 2493.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, we've only done a couple of years of social media algorithm.  If you think about where we are with where Twitter did it and Instagram did it,  this all started in 2015, 2016.  So we're only six years in.  So I think that we went from these pure reverse chronological feeds to algorithmic feeds.  Now what we're going to go to is a future where you have the opportunity to toggle back and forth.  But also, pretty importantly, the opportunity for you to tell them what type of feed you want.  Facebook's even working on something where you can tell it what mood you want it to put you in.  You want it more light or do you want it reflected?

Start time: 2493.62
End time: 2497.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 2497.79
End time: 2506.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  It definitely can manipulate your mood.  But the better thing is that it just gives you an opportunity to tune it yourself versus bringing it into Facebook.  I'd like to be emo depressed.

Start time: 2506.94
End time: 2553.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  Yeah, because then what the algorithm assumes is happy.  What the algorithm assumes is sad.  And then so you're typically cutting out a lot of content from LGBTQ or BIPOC communities  or stuff that you need to see to be informed.  A lot of times the algorithm puts content like that or individuals in those communities.  It enforces a filter bubble.  It puts you in a box.  Exactly.  That's the danger of this, which is what they really need to figure out.  How can you be customized?  How can you give people what they want while not filtering out things that people need to see and get to see?  And the voices and communities that matter as well in all of this.

Start time: 2554.08
End time: 2561.98

End time: 2598.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, yeah.  I think it's a work in progress.  But I really do like the fact that they're going to let you tune these feeds to the type of experience that you want.  And I do think it's a good thing to give people who use these platforms agency over their experience.  And I just found the post.  So what Facebook is working on, and this is still in development, but it came out in the HagenLeaks.  So there's four mood that you could pick.  Recharge, feel good, throwback, and cozy.  I don't know.  I mean, like, you know, these things are cozy.  I feel cozy.  Yeah, I'm into it.  Let's try it out.  And you know what's going to happen?

Start time: 2599.20

I'm going to start making my Instagram feed a throwback feed because I see that throwback content does really well.  You know, I think that it's really fascinating.  Like, how do you stop people from then feeding into that type of content that they know works, right?  Or more people like, and then we're back into the same scenario as we were before.

Talk about the new world order.  The you know, it's funny in the I don't know, maybe the 80s or the 90s.  If you were a business, I guess it was started really in the late 90s.  You had to have a website, right?  Before that, you had to have an answering machine.  Then you had to have a website.  Then you had to have an email address.  You know, slowly you had to have an app.  Nowadays, thanks to I think probably thanks to the pandemic, we've kind of got used to  this idea of frictionless interaction with businesses over text messages.  And you probably noticed this.  You know, maybe you went to a dentist and as you left, they sent you your appointment  for the next time you'd be there.  Or even sometimes they said, leave a review on Yelp or Google.  Let people know.  Maybe you got a bill from a company.  Maybe you've used texting to try to reach a company so you don't have to play phone tag.  This is the way business gets done these days.  More often than not, when you're experiencing that, you're experiencing Podium.  Podium is the way to stay in touch with customers.  Local businesses everywhere, all over the country are turning to Podium because they  make every interaction with a customer as easy as sending a text.  Your employees love it because one inbox means they don't have to go all over the place to  help customers.  It makes it faster.  It makes it better.  Everything that makes your business great can be done faster.  It's not just really a better way to communicate.  It's a better way to do everything.  You can get reviews from Podium.

Apparently, he just had a stroke in jail because of the tension of this.  The US appealed the UK court's decision not to extradite Assange from the UK.  The UK High Court has now granted that appeal against an earlier refusal by a UK judge who  said, we're not going to extradite him on mental health grounds.  The UK Secretary of State has the final decision.  I am really curious what you all think of this.  At first, Julian Assange was a hero.  WikiLeaks exposed the US using drone strikes to kill journalists and civilians.  That was in WikiLeaks.  But as time went by, WikiLeaks started to look more and more like an arm of Russian  foreign policy.  On the other hand, Assange always said, they're going to come after me because governments  can't tolerate the information that we post on WikiLeaks and they're going to find me  and they're going to get me on some trumped up charge.  The US does want to put him on trial for conspiracy to hack and computer misuse, which  for whatever you think about Assange and WikiLeaks is in my opinion exactly that  trumped up charge.  They're saying Assange encouraged and taught a hacker how to hack over chat.  I don't think that's demonstrable.  He'll face 18 counts connected with obtaining and disclosing defense and national security  material, primarily in 2009 and 2010.  I'm curious what you all think of this because it's funny as time goes by and Edward  Snowden is in Russia and I'm starting to think maybe Snowden isn't the  golden haired boy we thought he was.  Assange is now going to be sent to trial in the US and I'm thinking maybe he's not quite  the bad guy we thought he was.  Alex, what do you think?

Is it possible that Julian Assange did everything above board?  Yes.  If so, then he shouldn't be put in jail.  Obviously not.  But if there are demonstrable moments where he did break US law and end up hacking stuff,  I think you have to enforce those rules.  Now, what am I rooting for?  I'm rooting for Julian Assange to have not done any of that stuff because I do think  that what he did was important and in public interest.

There are parts of it that aren't trustworthy, but it's a good system.  Some of the tenants, innocent until proven guilty,  people need to be proving stuff beyond a reasonable doubt.  Let's see what it looks like in court.  The activities that Julian Assange did, I'd be rooting for it all to be above board and  for him to be able to walk because ultimately we need people like that that are going to be able to  stick their neck out when it comes to publishing damning information that governments don't want  out there but is in the public interest, which is exactly what he did.

Speaking truth to power and walking the thin line to get to the truth.  I think it's like you all.  I hope it did everything according to the books and in the name of revealing  some of the things that the government has done.  Because we need more people like that.  I'm a new American.  I became American three years ago.  I have to say that I have my doubts about the check-in balances of the system.  I hope that he did everything right.  Like you are saying.  The question I think that has come up a few times is whether it was to his benefit or the benefit  of the people so to speak.  Surely we have come to understand some of the steps that the government is taking from an  air-raids perspective that we weren't aware of.

Dmitry Muratov, a journalist in Russia, both won the Nobel Peace Prize for their fight  for freedom of expression in very difficult circumstances in Russia and the Philippines.  There was a great quote from Rappler about how difficult it is to be a journalist today.  I wish I could find it.  But anyway, yeah, you're absolutely right.  The fight against the media is not a fight against the media, said Mr. Muratov.  It is a fight against the people.  Excellent.  Without freedom of expression and freedom of press, this is part of the award, it will  be difficult to successfully promote fraternity between nations, disarmament and a better  world order to succeed in our times.

Only the 18th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize in its 120 year history.  So, yeah.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  It's nice to see journalists get recognition for what is actually getting to be a much  more dangerous profession.  Fortunately, not for tech journalists so far.  Anyway, we're all going to be.  Okay.  Big revelation from the information, speaking of great journalism, about a Tim Cook deal  with the Chinese worth $275 billion.  Now, this goes back in time to 2015.  You may remember around 2016, it was getting harder and harder for Apple to work in China.  iPhone sales were plummeting.  Apple apparently, Cook decided to go to the country, meet with senior leadership,  made a five year agreement in secret.  This is the first time that's been reported in 2016 to quash a sudden burst of regulatory  actions against Apple's business.  This is Wayne Ma writing for the information.  Before the meetings, Apple executives are scrambling to salvage the company's relationship  with Chinese officials who believe the company wasn't contributing enough to the local economy.  So, Cook very effectively took charge here.  And now the real question is, now does that mean Apple is kind of in the back pocket of  the Chinese Communist Party?  They kept this agreement secret.  The information quotes a political economist at the University of California, San Diego,  Victor Shi, who says, Apple is a global company needs to appease the Chinese government because  China is a large market and a large production base for Apple.  But at the same time, the vast majority of its consumers are still located outside of China.  And as their opinion has turned increasingly negative toward China, Apple likely wanted to  avoid the optics of groveling to the Chinese government.  I don't know if it's fair to say grovel.  They announced a investment in DD Global, a billion dollar investment.  That's the Uber of China.  They went to China.  Jeff Williams, Lisa Jackson and CEO Cook went to China to meet with the Chinese government  leaders at their secretive leadership compound, Zhongnanhai.  Neither side disclosed details of the visit, but they signed an economic deal  with China worth, according to the information, $275 billion.  Microsoft did similar things in years earlier, somewhat smaller commitment.  Cisco did the same thing.  These deals are technically non-binding, but Chinese officials take them more seriously  than officials in other countries do.  They are more binding than you would think.  It's an international attorney who writes about Chinese law, Dan Harris from Harris Brickin.  What do you think?  You can then trace this to China moving its servers, its iCloud servers, to  the Chinese mainland last year, perhaps bowing to Chinese pressure to remove VPN apps from the  app store in China, to even go so far as to change maps so as not to offend the Chinese government.  It's made a difference.  iPhone sales have suddenly gone up in China considerably.  China's State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping told members of the Apple Maps team  sometime in 2014 or 2015 to make the Diaoyu Islands appear large even when users zoomed out.  There's been a long-running dispute between China and Japan over who owns those islands.  Chinese regulators threatened to withhold approval of the first  Apple Watch if they didn't change the maps, so they did.  So apparently when you view the Diaoyu Islands in Apple Maps,  they appear on a larger scale.  They still do than surrounding territories.  It's interesting the things governments want you to do.  Chinese regulators ordered Apple to shut down its iTunes store for China  six months after it launched in 2016 because it didn't have the necessary  content licenses, but they fixed that.  It's not surprising to hear that China and Apple have some sort of back channel agreement.  How do we feel about that?  Shira, does it bother you?

Transcript:  I was going to say it's the price of doing business in China and you need to make a decision  whether or not from a company perspective, it is worth you doing so not just from a business  perspective, but from an ethical perspective and who you want to be as a brand.  I'm not surprised that Cook took care of it himself because obviously,  he's been a supply chain. He spent a lot of time in China working with government from  a supply chain perspective. He's very well connected and he knows how to talk to people.  I do think that the reason why maybe they don't get the scrutiny that they should is because the  impact is on Chinese people, not necessarily on people internationally. People are quite happy to  turn the other way and not be concerned about it. But the question is how far they go to fit into  what the Chinese government is requesting for their own user. I don't really think the increase  in smartphone sales is necessarily linked to the deal that they made. There was a boycott of Apple  for a certain period of time because it's the US brand with the biggest presence in China  that came as a result of the ban on Huawei here in the US. But it was very short-lived and people  didn't really seem to care enough about Huawei not to buy Apple in China. But generally,  consumers have stayed with the brand and the increase in sales has way more to do with the  products that they're selling and the design of the iPhone and so forth that came with the  recent models and not necessarily the deal. What is interesting though is that the companies that  you're talking about, Google, LinkedIn, all of those companies is more on a services side than  not the hardware side. Apple is depending on hardware. They're not really making a great deal  of revenue from a services perspective. It's really all on hardware sales. Well, that's changing  though rapidly with Apple. Services are becoming outside of China for sure. Yeah, but not necessarily

Start time: 4062.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that the other big tech companies are handling it better. I mean, find me a company  that's more smug, more self-satisfied, more moralistic, more preachy in its marketing than  Apple. Talking about what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone and how you could really  trust it. And then you see what it's doing. I mean, getting in bed with the CCP and they  have their data storage in servers that are owned by Chinese Communist Party subsidiaries.  So, I think that every company needs to make its own determination about what it will compromise  to operate in China because it's always going to be a compromise. But I think that for Apple to do  this and then persist with its marketing messages to me is extremely hypocritical. And I think  eventually it catches up with the company. I mean, people will eventually start looking at this stuff  weird if they continue to see this news about Apple. That's a really good point. I don't know

Transcript:  it works for them. They're viewed as a luxury brand. But Steve Jobs, when he talked about  marketing, he said it really is, you got a short amount of time to tell people who you are and what  you stand for. And if Apple's telling us it's about privacy and safety and security on one hand,  and then doing these things that we're seeing in China on the other, that marketing will no longer  align with what it actually stands for and who it is. And I think it will fall apart.

Transcript:  – Actually, that's one of the big stories this week. We're going to take a break when we come back.  Does the Apple Do Not Track button actually do anything? Increasing research shows no.  It's, as Carl Bodhi says in the Tech Dirt Privacy Theater. We'll talk about that in just a little  bit. This is Twit. Carolina Milanesi is here. Alex Kantrowitz. Shira Lazar. It's great to have all  three of you. Our show brought to you by OurCrowd. I love this idea, OurCrowd. From my whole life  covering technology I've been watching is people I know, people like Kevin Rose, get in on these  deals at the ground floor in these tech companies that they go public, they have an exit, and  suddenly these guys, they're buying fancy watches, driving fancy cars. And I go, how do you get in on  that deal flow question? Well, OurCrowd is the answer. OurCrowd is actually very cool. This is  a venture capital firm who helps accredited investors get in on these early stage startups  so they can be there for the big exits. They analyze companies around the global private market.  They look at those with the private notice market. These are not companies that have gone public.  These are companies that are under the radar in many cases. They pick those with the greatest  growth potential and then they present them to you in areas like personalized medicine,  cybersecurity, robotics, quantum computing, and more. In state-of-the-art labs and startup garages  and anywhere in between, OurCrowd is seeking out and identifying innovators so you can invest  when growth potential is greatest early, early on. Now, you have to be an accredited investor to do  this. So when you go to ourcrowd.com slash twit, it'll ask what country you're in and then you'll  see the requirements because every nation has different requirements for net worth and so forth.  But if you're an accredited investor, you're sophisticated enough to say, I want to go beyond  investing in the stock market or buying mutual funds or index funds. I want to get a little  taste of the exciting stuff that's happening that's so far up to now has only been available to  angel investors and VCs. This is a great way to do it. Ourcrowd's accredited investors have  already invested $1 billion in growing tech companies. There have been 46 exits, 46 IPOs or  sales of their investments. Many of their members have benefited big time from these exits and now  you can. This is again something that I would look at only to diversify your portfolio only if you're  an accredited investor. But it's a great way to get in early on innovative private market companies.  Ourcrowd does the legwork. Of course, at no time are you obligated. There's no cost to you to join  Ourcrowd. It's only an opportunity that you can look at. Accredited investors can participate.  There's a couple of ways you can do this. In single company deals for as little as $10,000,  you don't have to have millions to invest. Or you can get into their funds. They actually do  an Ourcrowd fund, a number of funds. The entry of that is $50,000. But you do have to have at  least $10,000 to invest. Investment terms are going to vary. As I mentioned, depending on what  country you're in, what you should do is find out more information. Just go to the site, input the  country you're investing from, you'll see what the requirements are. But if you are an accredited  investor, I think this is a really interesting way to get in early. Ourcrowd folks, they've got the  deal flow. They're willing to let you in on these deals. And of course, these are deals they're  already in on as well. Join the fastest growing venture capital investment community right now.  No cost to join ourcrowd.com slash twit. Even for just informational purposes, I think this would be  fascinating. Ourcrowd.com slash twit. I should mention because I cover these companies, I don't  invest in them. That's one of the reasons I've been sitting on the sidelines watching Kevin Rose  get rich. But that's fine. That's the choice I paid. And I'm very happy about it because I probably  lose my shirt. But if you are somebody who wants to invest in these companies, this is a great way  to do it. Ourcrowd.com slash twit. Really interesting idea, I think. All right, let's talk  about this. Carl Bodie, Apple, do not track button is privacy theater. We're starting to see  research. Financial Times had a big article. It all started, of course, seven months ago when iOS 14.5  came out. And Apple started surfacing a setting it had always had deep in the settings. Every time  you install a new app saying this app wants permission to track you across apps, yes or no.  And of course, when you say it like that, people are invariably clicking no. In fact, about 80%  estimated of users say no, don't track me. And Facebook took out ads.  Carl says, Facebook cried like a disappointed toddler at Christmas.  Except we're going to lose millions of dollars. In fact, Facebook was smart. They didn't say,  we're going to lose money. This is going to hurt small businesses. They took a full page ads  saying this is terrible. But really, maybe it wasn't that bad. All it did was turn off the  ID for advertising that Apple has, the IDFA. And what's happened over the last seven months  is companies like Facebook and Snap have figured out how to track you without it. It wasn't  that useful. Financial Times says, seven months later, companies including Snap and  Facebook have been allowed to keep sharing user level signals from iPhones. Apple didn't block  that. As long as that data is, and again, I'm going to put this in quotes, anonymized and  aggregated rather than tied to you specifically. So all of the information that was tied to your  IDFA is now still coming to them, just not tied to your IDFA. But as we know,  in many, many studies have reported anonymization doesn't work. It's fairly easy to  disanonymize that information. And in fact, there's lots of ways to do it. Companies still can  exfiltrate information about things like how much storage you have free, what your IP address is,  how much RAM you have, enough information that they can fingerprint you. So they may not know  your name, but they know you. So this is the question. Carl writes, Apple's opt out button  is largely decorative, helping the company brand itself as hyper privacy conscious  without doing the heavy lifting required of such a shift. The Financial Times  quoted lockdown privacy, which is an app that blocks ad trackers. They say Apple's policy is  functionally useless in stopping third party tracking. They performed a variety of tests on  top apps and observed that personal data and device information is still being sent to trackers  in almost all cases. In other words, you check that box. All that blocks is the IDFA. Everything  else is still going on. Now I have to say, I use an iPhone. I don't care because to me,  advertisers knowing more about my preferences is not a harm, but I'm not a privacy, you know,  a strong privacy advocate. Shira, you use an iPhone, I bet.  I do. Are you worried?

Like it  is annoying to feel like you're being, and I don't want to feel like I'm being listened to  in that way. I feel like if there's a way to serve me up ads that are more relevant for me,  then I'm open to that. Like I'm open to supporting small business and all that. But who am I really  supporting? My supporting small business or am I supporting Facebook? Instagram, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to enable these people. Carolina, what's your take? I think we have a similar conversation  as to what we were saying about Instagram. It's fascinating that companies spend these seven  months figuring out how to work around it versus spending seven months figuring out how you can  better serve me. Because I don't have a problem being tracked if you're using the information  in a smart way that serves me, right? And unfortunately, there's a lot of companies  that still don't do that very well from an ad perspective. And I think that's for me,  I'm also not a very strong privacy pro person because I live on the internet and yeah,  I share too much about my family too, Shira. But it's all about what's in it for me.  I'm being very selfish. Like, yeah, track me, but show me that you're using the data to my benefit,  not yours. And so I think that to me is where the conversation should be. And as we talk more and  more about AI and how AI is going to be part of the way that we serve better ads and information  in general by using that even anonymized data points, then do a better job at it.  And I do draw the line at Facebook. I'm not like, yes, I want to support small businesses,  but I go and support them in somewhere else versus over Facebook. I just don't think that  is like the algorithm discussion earlier. Is that algorithm serving me or serving the platform?  And I do think that is serving the platform. Now, from an Apple perspective, I agree. I think that  there could be more to be done than what they're doing. And the conversation is also, okay,  you're so against what Facebook is doing and yet we can all use Facebook. You're so against Google  and yet you are working with Google. So I think there are different reasons why people might be  kind of skeptical about the privacy pro push that Apple has been serving over the past

Transcript:  two to three years. I'm probably in, I get heat for this all the time, not the guy to talk to  about this because I think the whole privacy thing is overblown. You're on the internet.  My take is nothing you do is private. It's all out there. It is chiefly used for advertising  to make advertising targeted. I have no problem with that. In fact, the reason I stopped using  Instagram is because I kept buying every third thing that came up. It was so effective.  It was so much targeted to me. I have so much stuff I don't want that I bought on Instagram  that I just, I stopped using the platform as a result because it was effective.  That's the only negative is advertising works and it's targeted and it works. I guess you could say,  well, what if government gets that? And we certainly know that law enforcement has  access to a lot of information from your smartphone and from carriers. And again,  it doesn't bother me. Now, if you were an activist, a dissident, if you were gender fluid,  you know, maybe you might be more concerned. I'm a white old white man. I'm, I got nothing to lose.  So I understand that other people may be more concerned, but on the balance, I don't know if  this is, I think you're asking a lot to say, I want all these free services and I don't want  them to know anything about me. Alex, am I nuts? No, I think you should have the option. And that's

Transcript:  what I like about this Apple update. And I'm going to, if it did something, I can't believe  I'm doing this, but I'm about to take Apple side. I'm taking Apple's side. Good. Somebody has to.  Good. I think that what they do is block the individual tracking. If they have broader  anonymous and we know anonymous has some issues, but largely anonymized, aggregated information  so that advertisers are now advertising to cohorts of people, not individuals. So advertisers are  tracking groups of people, not individuals, and are able to optimize based on that. I think that's  actually where we want to go on the web, where it's not one-to-one marketing that like a lot of  advertisers like to talk about, but it's creepy to users. But if it's a group, you know, if it's  targeted, but not that targeted that you kind of feel like they're listening to your conversations,  I think that's good. And I feel like the Google cohorts thing, Flock, that I think I happen to  think that that's a good solution. And I think that I feel a lot better, you know, having companies  track me and group of 20 people and they do individually, because ultimately, like, let's  say you take a worst case scenario where an engineer wanted to know everything they had,  they could about me and violated all rules to be able to access that information. If they find me  as part of a cohort, that's very different than if they find me as an individual. What if companies

So Twitter, I know Facebook's considered making  a pay product as well. I think it gets kind of difficult when you talk about going to other  markets and, you know, when you think about their average revenue per user in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  privacy. Exactly. Yeah. So, Leo, but I'm totally sympathetic that when someone builds something,  you should be able to give them something of value in exchange for that. And if it's not going  to be money, it can be data. And that's why I think that since we're going to make this compromise on  the internet as it is, let's move to cohorts away from individualized data that can still work for  advertisers. And there's this storyline, you know, it's very interesting, the storyline that like,  you know, they're still collecting all the data and it's working just as well as it had been in  the past. I mean, I've spoken with advertisers who've seen the impact of these changes that  Apple has made firsthand. And I can tell you they're moving their money away from Facebook  because it doesn't work as well anymore. And Facebook has advised investors that its stock  is going to take a hit because of it. So I do think that it's actually real, but not real enough  that Facebook's advertising business has gone off the cliff. And I think that's a pretty fair

Start time: 5108.50
End time: 5201.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  compromise for everyone. Yeah. But I think Alex's point about, you know, if you cannot afford to pay  for the service, your compromise should not be data is really important, right? Because that's  a little bit the argument that Facebook has been using saying, well, we don't make you pay for the  service. So we have to do it this way. And we did actually a research when the first time that the  idea of paying for surface for Facebook circulated, nobody wanted to pay. You know, we served about  1500 people here in the US and nobody wanted to pay, which to me goes back to then the service  is, you know, it's not critical to people because otherwise you would be prepared to pay.  But what is fascinating is that we talk a lot about privacy and data being used online. But  I can tell you that in my move from California to Georgia, I have no idea how, what I checked  to have every mortgage company, every moving company, everything. Yes, they do. And clearly  I've not done it online because everything was coming from my mailbox. So, you know, it's not  just online is real life too. And that continues, you know, even now with services being pitched  and whatnot. So there are, you know, old fashioned distribution lists still exist.

So, so I don't, I don't particularly want ads for Viagra in my spam, but spammers don't care. Spam  is so cheap. That doesn't matter what they're sending a spam out. Most spam is not something  you'd ever want to buy. But spam is free and cheap. Those mailers in your mailbox, that's not,  unfortunately the US Postal Service does subsidize it. So it's practically free. It's very cheap.  And those ads, those Instagram ads, those are expensive relatively. Don't you think if I'm going  to buy an ad, I want to kind of make sure that the people who want my product will see it, not the  ones who don't. I just, I don't, I think people are knee-jerk about this. They feel like I, I don't  want anybody to know anything about me, but that's not realistic. We live in the world. People know a  lot about you, even if you're not online. And,

Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know that people are unrealistic. I think that people want to know  who knows about them and what they're going to do about it. Do you know what I mean? Like I,  obviously I'm online, so clearly I want people to know something about me because otherwise,  you know, parts of my business model wouldn't work. But, but the, the, that is my conscious  decision of sharing data with people versus you're taking something from me. I'm not quite sure what  you're taking. And then I'm not sure how, you know, companies are using that. And I go back to my  point. If you surface data, you know, ads that were actually relevant for me, I wouldn't mind it as  much. It's just when you get bombarded by stuff that really you don't care about.  Well, that's mostly just a complaint of how bad ad, ad recommendation services are.

And so it's like  a free for all. And I think that's what consumers are saying. Like we need to start setting boundaries  or else then anything can be used and taken advantage of and used for the wrong reason.  And I mean, like that's the issue. Well, of course, there's always that. And this is somebody in the

But as yet, nobody has shown me  that's happening. Well, yeah, Facebook. What about in the election? Manipulate. But I knew who I was  going to vote for. I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's always when people say that they're always saying, well, it's not going to affect me, but  think of all the dumb people it's going to affect. It's like, how patronizing can you be?

Start time: 5458.42
End time: 5473.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Leo, like advertising has always been targeted. So you started by targeting based off  of like, you know, the content, right? And so if people were watching, you know, people are watching  your show, right? Your show is targeted based off of content. Yeah, we do it. We do it the old

Start time: 5474.04
End time: 5477.92

Start time: 5478.38
End time: 5553.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  some geek stuff. And so you can run targeted, you know, advertising without knowing everything.  I don't know anything about our audience.  That tunes in. And I bet the advertising works really well for your advertising.  I hope so.  Then you go down the line a little bit and there's, you know, on the internet,  we started breaking things down by location, by age and gender. And that was fine too. I don't  think anyone has a problem with that when you do it, you know, broadly segmented. And then we went  another step and we started targeting, you know, by browsing behavior and interests. And then,  you know, eventually you could basically pick out the thousand people you need to reach and find  them some way. You can target based off of credit card information and all that type of stuff.  And so the question is, like, when we think about advertising online,  we're going to make that compromise between getting shown advertisements and using free  products everywhere we go. And the question is, you know, what is fair for a person to give up  in order to be able to use these products? Because, you know, we were able to fund through  advertising lots of great stuff, including the show. And we don't need necessarily to go  so granular to the point that people feel creeped out. And I think that's the discussion here.  And I think it's a reasonable question in terms of where you actually want to draw that line.

Start time: 5555.24

If you  think about how many people are actually, and not only that, they're voting with the way that  they're using this Apple opt out. And most people are opting out of Facebook targeting. So yeah,  I think that like largely people are, and we can have a discussion about whether they should be or

Start time: 5609.60
End time: 5622.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  not. They shouldn't be creeped out. People get creeped out in the same, they thought somebody  was reading their mail when Gmail, you know, was advertising based on keywords in your Gmail.  And the thing that was creepy was they were anthropomorphizing it like, well, there's somebody

Start time: 5622.64
End time: 5630.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  reading, nobody's reading your mail. Okay, Leo, is there eventually a place where like  online advertising tracks to the extent that you start to say, hey, maybe that's too much?

Start time: 5630.98
End time: 5672.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or is every single thing? No, because it's just advertising. If you don't like it, ignore it.  People, the real problem, I think people don't like ads. They would just admit this, you guys,  you don't want any ads. You don't want any ads. And people use ad blockers and all sorts of things.  They don't want any ads. I don't want any ads. But it doesn't work that way because you're getting  a free service that's ad supported like ours. We give people a choice. I mean, they can pay  seven bucks a month and not get any ads. A tiny fraction of our audience does that. Far more  probably just skip the ads or block the ads or because they I don't want any ads. I don't want  to pay for anything and I don't want any ads. I think that's a childish point of view.

Start time: 5674.14
End time: 5710.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't I think that's a straw man, Leo, because that's not what people are saying.  They're not saying they don't want ads. The real question is, again, like how much tracking should  there be? Like if someone is if an advertiser is tracking my locations, you know, and, you know,  I just walked into Shake Shack and Chick-fil-A sends me a message and says, get out of there.  We're going to give you something. Is that creepy to you? I think it's, you know,  it's could be a benefit. Maybe you go, oh, great. I'd like that dollar. Chick-fil-A. I know. I think  that specific instance is fine, but there are going to be weird situations. It's invasive.

End time: 5780.50

Transcript:  And I don't care. All right. I go to the map for this. I mean, Leo, think about what ads look like  before all this targeting. Right. Like Mad Men, the whole show is them trying to make beautiful ads.  It was all about the whole show was trying to get you to smoke cigarettes. I mean, yes, yes.

I put advertising used to be nice to look at because they knew that the image and the story  was going to be what was going to sell something, not the fact that they were targeting someone so  granularly on the internet. And I think that we could get to a better era of advertising with a  little less tracking, a little more focus on the creative and maybe we'll have less people hate ads  because they'll actually be nice and nice to look at and pleasant to consume. Unlike what we have

In fact,  somebody took my birthday out of Wikipedia and I told the chat room, put that back.  Because it said, he's 64 or 65. We don't know. Put my birthday in there. Who cares?

It's the idea of  creating so much data, generating so much data that is going to be used in a way that I don't  know. How are you going to use all that you know about me to make decisions about how you survey  it, not from an ad perspective, but actually about me as a person. That I think is the part that  concerns me and yet I don't decide to be offline and I don't decide to not share some of the  information. But it does concern me. I do draw the line on some of the public information that I put  out there. I don't know.

Transcript:  the time. Like, when is that going to happen? I hope it's soon. I mean, Elon Musk probably has the answer.  Yeah. I should mention, if you hate tracking and you don't want to be tracked,  we are an ad-supported network. We're free. And I'm very proud of that. It means it's  democratic. Anybody can listen to our shows or participate with the network in any way they want.  We have an IRC that's open to all. We have a twit forums. We have the Mastodon instance. All that's  free. But if you, A, would like to support us a little bit, or B, don't want to have any tracking,  and C, don't want to hear any ads, there is an option for you. I do wish more people would  join Club Twit. I love this idea. In fact, if we could, I would just say, let's just be an ad-free  network and you pay for it. But that hasn't worked out so far. But join Club Twit. Seven bucks a  month gets you all of our shows ad-free. It gets you access to our Discord, which is incredible.  I mean, really a lot of fun. It's a great community. I'm a big fan of that. And you get the  twit plus feed, which has stuff like, well, Burke spraying Christmas all over the studio  on Tuesday, things like that. All you have to do is go to twit.tv slash club twit, twit.tv slash  club twit, and you can find out more. And by the way, we also have corporate memberships and we got  our first corporate membership. I'm so thrilled. If you want to know more about corporate memberships,  when you go to twit.tv slash club twit, there's at the bottom there, there's more. But I want  to really thank David Hickman and the folks at Resource Management Concepts, rmcweb.com.  They bought 300 corporate memberships for their IT and security team because they love security.  Now they can listen ad-free. Thank you. That's a great way to support what we do and avoid ads  and tracking. See, it seems like a fair, you know, less than a super duper frappuccino  a month and you get you get all of that. twit.tv slash club twit. Now, if you are a member,  you didn't hear that ad and you're not going to hear this ad. And you know what you should be  sad because this is a good product. It's called Udacity. Udacity is actually changing the world.  Started some years ago, about a decade ago, by a Googler who realized that a lot of the people  and applying for jobs at Google, even though they had computer science degrees and master's degrees,  didn't actually have the raw skills Google needed. They founded Udacity with one goal,  to give people an online education geared toward taking your technology to the next level,  to getting the information about the career you want, giving you the skills for that career,  and then getting the job. And Udacity does it. They're here to encourage your career growth  with their cutting edge nanodegree programs. You could see the references on the website,  like the Udacity graduate who was working at a local Nigerian airline lost his job  because of COVID. Decided to turn things around. He applied for the machine learning scholarship  program. And for Microsoft Azure within six months, he transitioned to a career as a data  analyst. I know so many people who are working now, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and elsewhere.  Thanks to Udacity. Check out some of the Udacity nanodegree programs. Data engineering,  very hot right now. You could learn how to be a product manager. You know, companies are  desperate for this. Data analyst, data scientist. How about programming for data science with Python?  Or things that are even more cutting edge. Perhaps you'd like a nanodegree program in AI,  or flying cars, and autonomous flight engineer, machine learning engineer. One of the things that's  great about Udacity is they work on these programs with industry leaders like Microsoft and Google  and IBM and Amazon. So in fact, the teachers you're going to get are team leads at these  companies. So you're going to get the kind of knowledge they know you need from experts who  are working in that field every day. I also think very important that their courses are project  based. This is active learning. You don't just learn. You actually have to build projects. You  get graded on projects. You get homework and projects will be reviewed by qualified professionals  in the field. That doesn't just test your knowledge and solidify your knowledge. It actually helps you  build a portfolio, which makes it easier to get that job. Because you've got on GitHub, you've got,  oh, I built this, I built that. And that really makes a difference. It really does. They're going  to help you do that too. But you're not alone. They've got a great mentorship program, 24-7  mentors. By the way, 24-7 because Udacity is truly global all over the world. People are doing this.  They have day jobs. They want to get a better job. You could go five to 10 hours a week,  learn at your own pace, graduate in as little as three months, get that job right away.  I'll give you, and they have some great scholarships too. You should check those out  right at the bottom of the page. Under resources, you'll see scholarships. There's one from an  great organization, 110 Blacks in Technology. They teamed up with Udacity to offer part-time  online tech scholarships for black Americans who don't have a four-year degree.  Up to 2,000 full scholarships for qualified applicants. They're available. Apply today.  udacity.com. Again, there's more. Just go to those scholarships under resources at the bottom of the  page. If you're a business, Udacity has an enterprise section. You can upskill your entire  workforce with Udacity. Very popular for teams. Learn more at the enterprise section of Udacity's  website today. Bottom line, get the in-demand tech skills you need to advance your career.  Udacity, U-D-A-C-I-T-Y, udacity.com slash twit, udacity.com slash twit. We thank them so much  for their support of our show. Let's see here. Back to work. The advertising segment is over.  What do you think? You start to see more and more reports of Tesla's full self-driving vehicles  going off the road, hitting things, crashing. You got to wonder, autonomy is still quite a ways off.  Mercedes-Benz has received the world's first approval for their automated driving system.  Don't get too excited. It's only for certain areas of the Autobahn in the new S-Class and EQS sedans.  You have to go in these geofence stretches of highway on the Autobahn.  This is really the deal killer as far as I'm concerned. You can only go 37 miles an hour.  That's confidence. I think you're actually more of a hazard on the Autobahn if you're going 37  miles an hour than not. Really, these are designed for stop and go traffic, heavy traffic in geofenced  areas of the highway. But they got government approval. This is the first level three self-driving  system that actually satisfies the Germany's Federal Motor Transport Authority that the  system is safe. I don't know if they'd approve Tesla's full self-driving. I have a feeling not.

Or here's another nice feature of the Tesla,  playing a video game. Yeah, no, we don't need, we do enough of that. You don't need to do that while  you're driving. Like that does not help anyone.

You can't be doing that.  Tesla says, this is in model threes. Oh, that's not for the driver. That's for the passenger.  You know, they only have one big screen in the middle. The automaker added the games in an  over the air software update this summer, but they can be played by a passenger in fuel view  of the driver or by the driver.

The cyber truck, we actually  just, the reason we're talking about this is there was a tweet. Somebody was flying a drone  over the Tesla factory and saw a new model of the cyber truck in the parking lot  that originally the cyber truck didn't have side mirrors. Turns out it's a minor thing,  but the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration requires that you have side  mirrors. So they put those on there. It also oddly was lacking in its original design, a windshield  wiper. Now, at least according to the drone photo, it has a three foot long, one three foot long  windshield wiper that covers the whole thing. Are there two? I thought it was just one.  Oh, there's two blades because nobody sells windshield wiper blades  that are three feet long. So you have two long blades.  All right. I'm sorry. I shouldn't mock Tesla.

Transcript:  There are people around here do that.  Kickstarter. I don't know what could possibly grow wrong is moving its crowdfunding platform  to blockchain. It's creating a new company to develop and distribute the technology.  They will reveal this on Wednesday.  A Kickstarter will unveil. This is from Bloomberg.  Will unveil a project that will merge the two worlds,  hatching a standalone company to build a crowdfunding system much like Kickstarter's,  but based on blockchain technology.  You know, you just throw the word in blockchain and suddenly it's fresh and new.  I don't know how that changes things. New company doesn't have a name as far as we know.  They're going to transition its current site to the new protocol sometime next year.  Behind the scenes shouldn't affect how people use the site.  You don't have to suddenly use Bitcoin or anything.  I am actually, I'm banned from Kickstarter because I've invested in far too many projects  that have never. Sometimes I'll get, does this happen to you? Sometimes I'll get  a thing in the mail I don't remember buying. I got this backpack for photographers or something.  It turns out I'd give it was a Kickstarter project from years ago  that they finally made something. It was awful.  I never got toots the unicorn. Somebody in the chat room, mashed potato reminding me of that.  That was a rainbow farting unicorn.  Nope, never got that. You know, I kind of wish I had the idea.

All of the things I've purchased on Kickstarter,  the solo V2 safety net against phishing, the phone case that does more with zero bulk,  the UV. We did get that, John. The UV mask. You never got yours, John? All day active UVC  air purification face mask. You can have mine. It's so heavy, like your head bows down.  I did get the hygiene hand anti-microbial brass EDC door opener, but the only problem with that  is it took them so long to make it that long before I got it, I saw people using this. Oh,  yeah, it was on eBay for a buck because they were copied immediately. Where is Toots the Unicorn?  I did get my F-lashes, fun interactive LED eyelashes. I haven't had the nerve to wear those  yet. Maybe they took Toots the Unicorn off my list because I don't think it's ever going to happen.  The idea was if you could tie it into Twitter. Oh, yeah, here was a good investment. My very first  Kickstarter decentralized the web with diaspora, fully funded. This was going to replace Facebook.  You remember that? I do remember that. 2013, $200,000 they raised. By the way, you can go there.  It's there. It's a website. Anyway, maybe blockchain will make it better.  Michael Strahan wants to go back into space. He says, I want to go back.  I can't get enough of space. Yeah, because you only had like three minutes.  Michael Strahan, the host of Good Morning America, former NFL player, yesterday went up with the New  Shepard aircraft. There were actually six people aboard.

Best Buy was the only retailer to sell these Google TVs.  They've pulled them all. The entire line mysteriously disappeared according to 905 Google.  Due to performance complaints, both the 5 and 6 series TCLs,  other TCLs have Roku built in, which works great. In fact, my mom, I got her one.

Start time: 7454.92
End time: 7531.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it was that it was always inaccurate. Yeah. Because in order for it to work,  I remember this, and people would tout it. Number one, in order for it to work,  the people visiting the site had to be running the plugin on their browser.  So it was just a self-selected group and then they would statistically multiply it by a big number  to get the actual number. So apparently in order to use the name, Amazon bought Alexa.com  and they are now shutting it down.  RIP. RIP. Roar went out. We hardly knew you. May 2022, no new monthly stats will be released going  forward. The company said 25 years ago, wow, 25 years ago we founded Alexa.com after two decades  of helping you, yes you, find, reach, and convert your digital audience. We've made the difficult  decision, or at least Jeff Bezos did, to retire.com on May 1st. Thank you for making us your go-to  resource for content research, competitive analysis, keyword research, and so much.  Can they just change the name?

Transcript:  Leo In Illinois State, according to eyewitness  to Chicago, an Illinois state lawmaker is proposing a ban on Grand Theft Auto because  of a recent surge in carjackings around the Chicago area. He says it's all because of  Grand Theft Auto and is going to plans to ban sales of the game in Illinois.  Shira Karran Yeah, go ahead.  Leo He says carjacking is not normal and carjacking  must stop. I don't know if you live in Illinois and you voted this clown in.  Leo I'll give you his name, Marcus Evans. He's a Democratic state representative.  Grand Theft Auto, by the way, has been around since 1997. So if it's suddenly causing a  surge in carjackings, I don't know. He also thanked a community activist,  Early Walker, for starting Operation Safe Pump. Not what it sounds like. Security teams are  patrolling gas stations to protect people while they're pumping gas, which apparently is where a  lot of carjackings happen. Walker says, Representative Evans and I have researched and concluded these  very young offenders of carjacking are greatly influenced by the Grand Theft Audio video game.  Leo I believe there is bipartisan support to ban this game from being sold in Illinois. I  shouldn't laugh. Carjackings, nothing to laugh at. Grand Theft Auto, on the other hand.

They're stepping forward.  Leo I have a lot of representatives, Evans, for going there and taking home what's really ailing  us, Grand Theft Audio. And I do think that it's time for us to take on some other serious societal  problems. For instance, let's start to take on the serious epidemic of thievery. And I think we

Now we're talking because a lot of these find 70 million,  12 million. Big deal. But you know, we're talking billions now for abusing market dominance.  This is the Italian Competition Authority. Although I as I know Carolina correct me,  but I like to call it the authority that guarantee della Correzzonana,  della mercato. That's wrong. Concorrenza. Concorrenza. I love Italian.  Is that right? Is that pretty good? That's right. It's close. Yeah, that's pretty good.  Would they laugh me out of Milan if I said it that way? The AGCM, they say Amazon's giving sellers  using its Amazon logistics fulfillment by Amazon advantages in terms of visibility and sales,  including access to its prime label. Amazon says we will appeal but it is a big find 1.13 billion  euros. Good for the good for the try one more time.  Autorita garante della Concorrenza e della Mercato. Good for them. Taking a stand.  Big, big news in the US. Jessica Warson-Wassel is now the chairman or has been confirmed by the  Senate to lead the FCC, the first female chair in FCC history. She is one of the best as far as I'm  concerned personally, one of the best FCC commissioners. She really understands things  like net neutrality. Will be an excellent FCC chairperson. Amazingly, I don't know how you get  this kind of a vote in the Senate as it's constituted today. 68 to 31. Wow. Nice. She will,  it is thought, place particular emphasis on broadband access, increasing high speed internet  coverage in underserved areas. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Congrats. On the other hand,  I don't think Gigi Sohn is going to get in there. She's been kind of, she won't get a full Senate  vote till after the new year. And she is the fifth and currently open seat for the FCC nominee from  President Biden. Let's take a little break. We got to wrap things up. We're going way long. Thank  you. You guys are very patient. But let's let me quick break then a final story. Birds are not real  and I'm going to prove it to you. Our show today brought to you by userway.org. Now this is real.  There is a real problem for 60 million Americans with disabilities. When they come to your website,  they can't use it. They can't navigate it. The images don't have alt tags. And the worst for you,  they can't use your shopping cart. They can't fill in forms. They can't use it. You need to make your  website accessible. You need to make it ADA compliant. It's a federal law that says websites  are public entities and have to provide equal access to its services for all Americans. Domino's  found that out the hard way. The pizza big national pizza chain, they said, well, wait a minute,  our website has a phone number. They went all the way to the Supreme Court on this one. Supreme  Court said, nope, that's separate but equal. The ADA requires accessibility. So the good news is  you can do it with userway. Userway has an incredible AI powered solution that tirelessly  enforces all of those complicated web content accessibility guidelines. And they do it with one  line of JavaScript. It could do more than an entire team of developers. Userways, AI and machine  learning solutions power accessibility for over one million websites, including some of the biggest  websites in the world. Coca-Cola uses it. Disney, eBay, FedEx, Walmart all use userway. And now this  top of the line best in class enterprise level accessibility tools available to you, small and  medium business owners. I was shocked at how affordable it is. It's less than the cost of the  fonts on our front page, the Google fonts that we pay for. When you scale, you need userway because  it's going to grow with you. If it can handle Disney, it can handle you. And accessible and  compliant websites, not just the right thing to do, it's good for business. And Achilles heel for  website registration forms, nav menus that leave out millions of people.

Because if  you can add a line of JavaScript that pulls in all the user way, AI, machine learning, computer vision,  it's going to go in there, it's automatically generating alt tags for your images. It uses its  computer vision to generate image descriptions. You can add to it. You can add to it, but it gets  you started. It will remediate complex nav menus, make sure all your pop-ups are accessible. Even  make your colors accessible while remaining true to your brand. And you'll get a detailed report of  all the violations that were fixed. Look, check it out. Go to userway.org slash twit. They've got a  scanning tool. Just see if your site's ADA compliant. You at least do that. And then if it's  not, I got to tell you, this is the easiest way to do it. Userway can make any website fully  accessible, ADA compliant, avoid lawsuits, most importantly serve a community that needs your  help just a little bit to make your website accessible. With Userway, everyone who visits  your site can browse seamlessly, can customize it to fit their needs. This is a way to show  your commitment to millions of people with disabilities.

Why is it so dark in this restaurant? I can hardly read the menu.  You're going to say, are they making the print on websites smaller? Because you are going to,  as you cross, and I know it's years away, cross the age of 40, suddenly suffer what we all suffer,  which is farsightedness, the inability to read because your eyes get older.  Thanks for the explanation.  Just ahead of time. There is a new drop. The FDA has approved it. It will be hitting the market  on Thursday. An eye drop from a company called Viewity takes effect in 15 minutes. One drop in  each eye provides sharper vision for six to 10 hours. An eye drop, you don't need readers. You  don't have to go to the drug store and go to the Dr. Dean Adell. You don't know. Carolina,  you might remember that. Would you use an eye drop instead of wearing readers?

He said,  as soon as you hit 40, you're going to have to wear glasses anyway because you can't read.  I thought, well, what's the point if I'm going to have to wear glasses anyway?  Presbyopia is the condition that older folks suffer from. Unfortunately, so that's the upside.  Medical science, amazing. It's going to cost $80 for a 30-day supply.  How much did the Dr. Dean Adell readers cost? Four bucks and 50 cents. It works best in people 40 to  55. After that, forget it. Side effects include headaches and red eyes, but that's a small  percentage of people. The annals of medical science, a big breakthrough. Finally, I love this.  I actually want to give credit to the New York Times and the wonderful Taylor Lawrence. She is  really good on following cultural trends.

Wake up. Birds are government surveillance drones. There are no birds.  It's kind of credible. He says the birds, they charge on power lines. That explains a lot.  That's why they're sitting there. He also on his van, his birds aren't real van,  has a picture of a bird that shows with a microphone, the camera, the antenna,  the speaker, the battery, and the inductive charging coil are on the pigeon.  It also says pigeons are liars. Liars! Last month, they protested outside Twitter headquarters in  San Francisco to demand the company change its bird logo. But Taylor, thank you for telling us  because I thought it was real. It's not. It's all tongue in cheek. In fact, the founders of birds  aren't real know that birds are in fact real. It's a parody social movement to show how people are  falling into the rabbit hole of conspiracy. In fact, one of the founders said, if you actually  believe that birds aren't real, you've got a bigger problem than this. A spontaneous joke.  They're actually buying billboards. This is the billboard in Memphis, Tennessee. Note, by the way,  the birds perching on the billboard proving it's true. They're probably trying to mess it up.  And as our chat room is saying, Evil IRC is saying, if birds were real, wouldn't they just  fly off the edge of the earth? What's keeping them on the planet? They know better.

And they had a discussion that's kind of academic, but we'll talk a little bit about like how the  human mind thinks and how you can transpose that into AI. And it was interesting because we  started, you know, my thought was we would have a conversation focused on trying to learn about  where AI was going. But actually, like, there was a debate about how the human brain works.  And then, you know, I found that kind of interesting, like you can learn a little bit about  how we as humans think. If you think about what it's like to build a brain, quote unquote, from  the ground up when you're building AI. Anyway, it was pretty interesting. So I would recommend  people go check it out.

Transcript:  to the end. So looks like actually the NLRB had something to do with it. They rejected her  withdrawal requests because Apple added a clause saying that she would not solicit, encourage or  incite anyone to file any charge or complaint with any administrative agency or court against  Apple for one year. And the NLRB said, you got to leave that out. That's not even legal. They  requested Apple strike, encourage or incite. Apple said no. And the NLRB as a result said,  you don't get to withdraw it because we're going to pursue this one. So Apple, that's just more  evidence that Apple is trying to suppress all of this rather than let it resolve itself. Carolina,  thank you. And the Heart of Tech does important work and we appreciate you being here. It's  always great to have you. We thank you all for joining us. We do the show this week in tech  every Sunday afternoon about 2 30 Pacific, 5 30 Eastern, 22 30 UTC. I mentioned that because you  can watch us do it live, kind of a behind the scenes feed, audio or video at live.twit.tv,  watching live chat live at irc.twit.tv. And of course club members, as always, can chat with us  live with all of the animated gifts and all in discord. And they do. They definitely do.  After the fact on demand versions of everything we do available for free at our website,  twit.tv. Every one of the shows has its own YouTube channel for youtube.com slash this  week in tech for instance, or for the master channel, youtube.com slash twit. And you'll  find links there to all the shows. And just as my friend Alex said, you can find us in every  podcatcher. All you have to do is subscribe and you'll get it automatically the minute  it's available wherever you find your podcasts are distributed. Do me a favor though, if you  if you do subscribe in a podcast application that allows reviews, leave us a five star review. That  would sure help when you've been around as long as we have 15 years. People kind of forget that  you exist. You don't show up on the charts anymore because you know you're old timers.  And it'd be nice to spread the word. Let others know that this week in tech is still  15 years later, still on the air. Thank you everybody for joining us. We'll see you next time.  Another twit.
