We talked we've been talking about it and we talked about it on Mac break weekly at length  last couple of weeks, but  There was a suggestion for some time that there might be  Some new hardware like a new iMac maybe a new Apple TV  John Prosser who is the premier Apple leaker these days and Max Weinbach both said  Any new hardware reveal at WWDC tomorrow has been scrapped  So if you were waiting for a new iPad Pro or a new iMac or new Apple TV or new AirPod studio  AirTags which we know are in the future somewhere not tomorrow

Start time: 643.18
End time: 656.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm with you Andy. I will be devastated if I don't get my air tags  So  Hopefully they're wrong at least about the air tags because I think those could be if done well  I think that they could be really life-changing. So yeah

Start time: 656.88
End time: 711.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean if half of what we've heard about these things is true that they're not just it's not just Apple pointing at hey  You know these blue these Bluetooth le trackers  Let's do one of them too, but as opposed to let's get support for really really precise location  By through hardware in our phones so that they can be more useful than a vague  Oh some dude on a bike passed by where your bag used to be ten hours ago as opposed to no  No, here's exactly where your dog here's here  Here's exactly where cat is hiding or here's the room that you left that that you left your your keys in that one time  And it really was the only apart from the iMac  It was the only piece of hardware that I thought was I at least was anticipating some sort of an announcement about so it's  I hope that the air tags counts as an accessory as a lifestyle add-on and not technically as a piece of hardware because I  Would love to finally see a demo of it if it by the way mark Gurman confirms

Start time: 712.42
End time: 749.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That he heard this too if you have three of the top Apple rumor  leakers saying this it seems likely to me that they were told this  By Apple in effect that they that Apple said and Apple wanted this to go out  And of course they would because if they weren't going to announce anything tomorrow and everybody expected something there would be that would be a Paul  Oh, yeah, there'd be a lot of disappointment. So I'm not but why Georgia you think Apple would  Have I mean surely they've got tags ready  Why would they be holding on? I don't know

Start time: 749.90
End time: 784.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would think that there's something that's that they need to wait on I would like for them even if they're not gonna release them  Soon that we can just go through them. Give me a little bit of excitement  I think that people need it right now, and I think this could be really helpful to everyone  So I'm hoping they still release air tags  I know everyone else is it's the max and I'm good with just  you know give me my tags so that I can you know find my dog and my children and my phone and my car and  Myself and my purse I  Would love that I would love it. I need a little bit of all of that. So

Start time: 788.18
End time: 803.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I could just put  Everywhere well we had you know, we had tracker as an advertiser and I've used both the tracker which and the tile  They're both Bluetooth  Trackers, but but I get the feeling that what Apple's doing is a little different from that

Start time: 805.92
End time: 820.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah  The one of the one of the rumors around it is that it's not it is Bluetooth Bluetooth le  But it's also based on some of the custom Bluetooth hardware and Bluetooth wireless hardware that is inside every single  And every single iPhone are already this UWB chip

Start time: 822.06
End time: 848.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's what's weird because they put this in the iPhone. It's been out six months  The only thing I know of that it uses it is the airdrop where you can point it at  At the person that you're gonna send it to that seems like such a trivial use for something clearly that added to the cost of  bill the  Cost of build on the iPhone. Why would they must have expected air tags before this?  Well, not not just that but remember that Apple I'm sorry

Start time: 849.66
End time: 870.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll make that quick, but the when you realize that Apple builds iPhones to last four or five years  Well, they could put that chip in anticipating an announcement two or three years from now and still decide that this is it's not  It's cheap enough and it's relevant enough to put this inside every hardware  Particularly if we put it inside the hardware at a point where not everybody's going to use it  So it's not gonna cause anything to blow up

Start time: 872.58
End time: 909.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if this stuff if they announce them they're gonna announce it right they're gonna release it  Here's the problem. The world is upside down  So you getting a hold of one is probably their issue  because you know how they always have their first wave and then there's a stall and then the next wave comes in because  They only make so many of something with their expectations of their first wave  But something like this they they might have a production problem could be yes, like only have X amount and  Some people like Georgia Georgia. Yeah my email you might want to email me  You saw you about to have super duper sadness in your heart if you don't get one of these

Start time: 913.62
End time: 916.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nothing at all I will be sad like I like software

Start time: 919.74
End time: 940.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I  Will Leo miss the gunners to bet trip. You just had someone's sadness in your heart about these tags  I just want you to be warned. There's only 14  There's a lot of Apple nerds on YouTube to give first dibs. So just relax  But you probably won't get one that's gonna be the issue  You're probably not gonna get one, but they will be out in the world  That's my thought process on isn't that funny?

Start time: 940.84
End time: 964.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cuz of course it could just be that they there's a production issue  the world is locked down under pandemic, but we've all kind of  At least I have in my mind kind of said oh China's back open again. They're kind of open. They're not fully open  They kept saying iPhone production for the iPhone 12 is on track and things like that, but who knows maybe they couldn't make them  Maybe it wasn't important enough to devote limited factory capability to those

Start time: 965.32
End time: 982.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They got behind on other things that they might get made  So so it's not just about having got to make the iPhone. They can't not make the iPhones  Yeah, you know, I mean like there's a level of production and importance there, you know what I mean?  So, I don't know like I said, we're gonna find out tomorrow what they say  I know they're gonna come out. I know they're gonna have them but they're only gonna have 12

Start time: 985.22
End time: 1047.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a very important point to share very important point you get to I'll take to  Apple is closing reclosing. Yeah Apple is reclosing some stores 11 stores  That were reopened in Florida, Arizona, North Carolina and South Carolina are being closed due to kovat spikes in that area  So, you know, that's another probably factor in this Apple slowly been reopening its US stores and  Stores around the world with some you know, obvious precautions. You have to get your temperature taken. You have to  answer some health questions  You also have to socially distance when you're in there and most importantly you must wear a mask  inside  But  Nevertheless, they decided even though they've reopened a majority of US retail stores are gonna reclose 11 of them in those  Hard-hit states. I have I just feel like it's gonna be hard-hit in a lot of places  So maybe that store opening was a little premature. I don't know

Start time: 1048.20
End time: 1091.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, both of Florida is kind of famous for being super super aggressive with the kind of the political end of oh  We've got to get everything reopened as quickly as possible  So it's similarly Arizona was also a lot of governors that have been really on the bandwagon of  This isn't a medical crisis. This is a political crisis. So then secondarily, it's a financial crisis  It's only number three health crisis have been sort of racing to get things back to as normal as possible as quickly as possible  And these the places that we're seeing these resurgence spikes  So, I don't know  Maybe that maybe this is going to be like a maker of a political ad saying the reason why you can't get these new beautiful  Air tags from Apple is because you're a Republican governor  decided to reopen

Start time: 1093.36
End time: 1106.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Possibly although I have to say it's spiking in other places too, including I think here in California  We're gonna start to see a spike but that's not fun. So let's not talk about that anymore  Let's talk some more about WWDC. Okay. Okay

Start time: 1108.42
End time: 1135.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like maybe we'll get to see the the new super pro air pods  No, we're not gonna see any hardware any they say no  I mean, that's that's the that's the other big disappointment if that was true  I mean, yeah, it makes sense that that we would that they would kind of wait for an iPhone event  but given that we've seen like sneaks of that  Enter in and help files and info files have been embedded in like a pre-release  IOS you at least somebody at some point thought that that was going to be imminent a few months ago  No

Start time: 1135.78
End time: 1163.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was it seemed to me a very well sourced leak  Because you even had images of a new iMac a new small bezel iMac  The tags have been but sure for sure must have been available by now. So there's something, you know, who knows and it could also be  Apples dampening down the expectations. So when they announce only five new products people will be very very happy  You know, we just I feel like Apple plays us like a fiddle and they don't have seals this year

Transcript:  People expect it for whatever reason. I learned this at when I used to do live with Regis and Kelly  their  producer  Gelman would come out to do the warm-up before every show and the funny thing is  He got great laughs, but he said exactly the same thing every single time  It never varied one of the things he said is if you clap faster, it sounds like there's more people just a little tip  Clap three times faster. It sounds like there's 19,000 people in that arena. Just clap faster  That's the key

Start time: 1253.02
End time: 1306.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I used to watch letterman and then watch time Snyder on that show  And so just again just knowing that all he wanted to do was make those six union guys laugh and that was pretty much it  You also have a point there's today the New York Times had I think their first like sticking sticking their neck out prediction of oh  Well, according to unnamed sources that we have inside Apple Apple is definitely going to be is that going to be transitioning to arm processors?  Away from Intel and whenever that happens like immediately at a time where it's really useful for Apple to for a piece of Apple News to come out  I don't know that it was it was an authorized leak  But that's the sort of thing where I start to wonder if we're seeing some manipulation here that this is Apple wanted a big story  To be out in the newspaper of record the day before  Soften the ground for announcements that they were going to have I do think that the and by the way

Start time: 1306.70
End time: 1319.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think from now on we should no longer say it's a transition to arm because I think that misrepresents it  Oh true Apple leaving Intel for its own chips is really a more isn't that more accurate way to put it?

Start time: 1320.30
End time: 1358.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's the way that they'll they'll describe it when it happens  I guess no one knows no knows what arm is they'll say over and here's and they'll say here's all the things we can do now  If we're they're gonna they're gonna go into here's here's the many amazing things  We've been able to do with the iPhones performance and the iPads performance and the iPhone and iPads  Features like here's here's the reason why there's touch ID  Biometric ID on every single iOS device that we ship because we have all the iPhones and iPads  But we've only been able to recently put it on the Macs  It's because we were able to bake that stuff right into the CPUs and now we're going to make  Now we're going to make Macs just as good as the iPhones and the iPads which I think has been

Start time: 1362.18
End time: 1394.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a very interesting way to put it because one of the concerns people who have an experience with arm particularly windows on arm  Have is that it's gonna be not very performant that it you know windows on arm is a pig  It's awful, but they're using off-the-shelf  Qualcomm chips primarily  So Apple's got to fight a little bit fight that perception. I think that's a very good point  Look how fast our iPad Pro is we wanted to bring all that power and performance  To our desktops is a much better story and to be fair I mean like I

That's not necessarily better than another smart speaker  But but also I want one of these two in the lineup I want one of these like next to my desk  So I don't have to shout into the next room  So that the one smart speaker that I can afford  Can actually set a reminder or or tell me whether I need a jacket or do any other?  Soul soul comforting things that these things do when you can spend anywhere from thirty dollars to  For a basic one to a hundred bucks for one with a very good speaker to now a hundred dollars for one with a with a with  Actual screen on it.

Transcript:  It's a fine line each other because you want it to be funny. You want it to be cute  You want it to be entertaining?  You want it to ask you from time to time how you're feeling but you don't want it to do that too often  Because then it's just you want to throw it through the window. So it's it's got to be hard to design these things  I don't maybe we don't know the best way to do it  It is as is often the case around this time Apple is also heading into some controversy  with the hey  email app  Andy you were with me on Mac break weekly when Alex Lindsay launched into a  Spirited defense of Apple's right to take 30% of anything on its platform. They built the platform  They put a lot of R&D into it and gosh darn it if you want to be on it  It's fair for Apple to charge you 30%  To be in the in the store. Hey is an email program that Apple has refused  Because they don't have an in-app subscription. It's a hundred dollar a month a year hundred dollar a year email  Service, but they don't they didn't put it and they were refusing to put it in the app  The reason it's important is it comes from base camp Jason Fried and David Hannah Meyer Hansen  Who are very well known highly respected and I think there's a certain amount of excitement  I signed up immediately after reading about a comm because it's an interesting take on email, but Phil Schiller says nope  we're not going to change the rules and  until hey  Offers in-app purchases of their service. It ain't gonna happen is  Apple  Right or wrong on this now any you and I got to got to  Tussle and Renee got to tussle a little bit with Alex  Or actually Renee wasn't there Laurie Gill got a little tussle with Alex, but actually was really adamant. What do you what do you think Georgia?  Should Apple relent and let hey?  Be in the app store without in-app purchases. I

Start time: 2344.10
End time: 2386.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they should I think they should actually overhaul the entire system  I think that 30% like there's so many developers that aren't making anything and you already have to pay for the developer kit  Like I think that it should be like a percentage of how much you make right so if you're a new struggling developer  It should be a very small amount of percentages  They make I think that if you're a big developer you could make a larger percentage  And it's not gonna hurt Apple  And I think they should be a little bit more open about not trying to squeeze every single person  For as much as they can get because there it's not like Apple struggling  So I think that a lot of the people are recognizing these large trillion dollar billion dollar companies are kind of  Swallowing up all the things that are good in the world  And there's a lot of backlash because of that and I think it would cause staple very little for a lot of goodwill

Start time: 2389.52
End time: 2418.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thirty percent it seems like a lot especially and now you can buy the service  Online and that's what base camp wants you to do is pay for it online and then download an app  Their contention is it's kind of like the Kindle app. It's just an email reader  It lets you read your email, but the service is separate Apple says no, that's not a reader app  And so you have to do it differently Owen you have an opinion on this I think you do

Transcript:  The thing that drives me crazy is  Do you want to play in the NBA or do you want to play in?  The circus league do you want to play in the NFL or do you want to play in the XFL?  Because when somebody has a major league and they make the rules either you play by the rules or you don't right?  Here's the thing  Apple is Apple which gives everyone the benefit of having the possibility of having that one-hit wonder app and make a bajillion dollars  Yes, a lot of people are struggling  But they've also made a mint for a lot of companies that would have never made a dime anywhere else  They got Android is free. Why aren't you out there making a mint on Android because you can't so  The payment structure to Apple is facilitated the the brand facilitation that they have the quality control that they have if you don't want to  Pay then you don't want to play. I really don't have a problem that now if you want to say 30% too high  So sure  let's cut it down to 20% and then 10 years will be crying about 20% then you'll be down to 10% and then Apple have  Any money and then I won't have to pay a thousand something dollars for this phone. So  Apple makes the rules because it's their company and that's the way it goes either you pay to play or you don't I don't care about  Companies crying about it. I don't care about people trying to get around it  Go ahead and make your application so great that it makes me switch from an iPhone to a Samsung and then I'll come and get  Your email. Hey, how you doing about that? I don't know. That's just my thought

Start time: 2518.66
End time: 2579.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I you know Apple the other complaint people make is not necessarily that they want the 30%  But that they're just not consistent in the application of these rules that some email programs  That don't do that do this are on the App Store  Apples in this letter to a base camp said look your app doesn't do anything  It doesn't read email unless you pay a hundred dollars on hey calm to get it  And we don't want an app on our phone that doesn't do anything unless you pay  You know outside to turn it on and if you're gonna do that you have to have it in the app  And that's a reasonable thing from an end  Their position is look end users are gonna download the app and say well now what and there's no way they can do anything  in the app so I I don't disagree that that's a  problem and I also think that base camp is  very happy to have this controversy going on because  Hell of a lot more people know about hey calm the new before you know what they'll do though

Start time: 2579.76
End time: 2590.10

Transcript:  They'll bump it up to 115 and then put it in the App Store and then yeah the margin charge us  But they're just gonna get free advertisement because we're here talking about that by the way is

Transcript:  The basis for a class-action lawsuit the Supreme Court allowed to go forward last year against the App Store saying  you're in effect charging end users this because the company's just passed the 30% along in their price and  So that will that's a case that is ongoing, so we'll keep an eye on that for me for me

Start time: 2610.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's a question of Apple is and is running the risk of turning into ticket master where if  Most for the most part the idea that they're they're establishing this App Store and all these  Apis and Xcode to allow you to create a work  Let's say a word processor or a game and then sell it to the store. They will handle all the distribution  They will handle all the all the all the taking of the money and that sort of thing and that's when you start to say  Okay, well, here's all the things they're doing for this this thing  Which is a piece of software, but then when when you get into situations like why are they?  Insisting that the why can't I simply buy books through the Kindle app?  Why can't I buy comic books through the comics ology app and you start to ask yourself?  Well, what the hell are they doing that would entitle them to 30% of my Superman comic?  that's the sort of thing that they want to avoid because I I do see the need for  Some before developers to pay something into this this Apple can't simply run this as a charity  This is something that they are delivering value  Providing a service and they deserve to be paid for that service  But there are certainly exemptions to exceptions to this where again you say why why is this 60?  $75 ticket costing me $156. What is ticket master doing to to justify a  $75 like add-on to this to this purchase price when the answer is no, I'm not upset with the venue promoter  I'm not upset with the band. I'm upset with  With ticket master and the second and the second problem is always that but something's been very consistent  Which is the inconsistency with which Apple seems to?  Promote its it's a rules for the App Store  the  Apple said that well the only reason why your iOS app got accepted to begin with was because of a mistake  we shouldn't have let it in to begin with and  Time there are so many times I've talked to developers where they've had problems exactly like this where an app on a totally  non-controversial sort of issue that they've they've been they've been  Submitting and updating this app for three or four years and now suddenly they produce an update and it gets rejected because they're saying though  Well three years ago you should have switched from using this API  For time or for text or for whatever to this new API and for that reason we're rejecting it  And then they'll say well we talked to you three years ago and told you that there's no way we can make our app work  With this change that you're suggesting and their response is well, nonetheless  So it's it's a problem for people who think that Apple is cheating amount of a lot of money  But it's also an indicative of how powerless a lot of developers feel when they're trying to deal with this black box  that whose whose  judgments are not to be not to be tampered with or questioned I think that's the real

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Power differentials that if your app gets thrown out  There's nothing that you can do if Apple says no for whatever reason they choose to you can't really do anything  Right if you're a really large company you probably have big lawyers and odds are you can kind of put some pressure on it or if  You're really famous right if you're Taylor Swift you can put pressure on Apple and something could actually happen  but for most of developers they have nothing there's no recourse they don't have the money from it because they're not making any money and  They're already having to pay Apple, you know to be a developer  But you know if and I'll just say it might be controversial  But if like all developers kind of created a union where they were unionized and they had a union that could fight for them  Versus Apple then they would have at least a recourse if something that they think is unfair or possibly is unfair  happens to them and

So if I have a business and I go into a strip mall and I buy a rent a storefront  And my business is booming and I'm paying rent and my landlord says oh your lease is up  I'm gonna raise the rent XYZ because you're making this much money, and I want it  Well do I close up my store and move away or sell it out on the street across three like I have to pay  This front and somebody good you could actually move you could and yet right you you could  You could move to Android there. There's the other there's another platform out there. That's for you. That's free  I'm just saying this is the  Intensive how things work in the world  You're paying rent somewhere because you want to sell your stuff at this storefront and at some point  Things change in the lease and they say look you have to do this or do that or you have to move out  We're gonna cut your square footage. There's all kinds of things that happen in the regular world  This is average business stuff  And we have a personal affinity to it because we want our apps or we feel like these companies are being  Trampled upon but this is just business and I hate sticking up for apps like this. It's driving me crazy  Isn't there a risk though?

Maybe in the US they have 80%  But it's not monopoly size and you do have a choice in that respect  There's an also a risk to Apple and Daniel Jalcoot who is a great developer red sweater software  Posted this as microblog something. I haven't emphasized is Apple's approach to hate.com and others  Who are actively dissuaded from distributing apps to customers basically Apple saying yet?  No, you can't distribute this is it creates a threat to Apple's platforms  There's a point in which both developers and consumers will turn away. Is that a risk?  That Apple it has to be a little more generous because they could lose developers. They could lose users on this

So it's interesting. There's a good  Test if Sweeney's not willing to walk away from  What must be billions of dollars that Apple's taking out of his pocket with their 30% then I can't imagine many others doing it  It's just because he's still making money, right?

They really should break that out and say here  Here's how many people who are able to pay their phone bill?  Here's how many people who are able to even afford to keep with developing this app  versus here's all the people that that are simply able to keep their jobs in an existing gaming company because we're not it's not there they're  The profits aren't coming solely from individual apps being made but by in-game content that's being sold.

Transcript:  should also mention too big that on Friday the  EU announced two investigations  Into Apple now, it's the EU. I don't want to be too dismissive, but they are a little bit more aggressive in consumer protection  actions  One of the things they're worried about is the Commission the first investigation prompted by complaints from Spotify and  Rakuten will determine whether Apple has used its digital marketplaces to stifle competition from rivals in the digital services space  Spotify for instance says we can't possibly compete against Apple music. It's installed on all the phones  Apple you know has a  Incredible advantage and they even and the maker by the way speaking of Apple tags the maker of the tile  Tag has also testified to Congress. We can't compete against a built-in Apple app and she's worried  She says we can't compete against lost my or fine my  But that's not even mentioning tags  Which I think that that's her greatest fear of course and then so that's one one issue  Is the anti-competitive nature of it?  they're worried that it would distort the market giving Apple's own products an unfair advantage over the competition and  then I think the other is  Apple pay  because Apple pay is the only mobile payments tool that can use the NFC built into the iPhone and  The EU says well you should let other companies use that NFC chip for their payment services  I think in both cases Apple can make a strong case. It's better for the consumer  What we do make sense of the consumer, and that's why we do it

Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, also they can also they can always hide behind the fact that hey look. We're not Android. We're not Windows  We don't we don't we're not Facebook, and we're not Twitter. We're not Google  We don't have a dominant market share worldwide in anything  So if it depends on whether the jurors whether the jurisdiction they're arguing through  Looks at anti-competitive practices as something that affects consumers or something that affects markets  Because they could make they could certainly have a problem defending themselves against the against the idea that hey look you're allowing yourself  You're allowing your own products to have access to a special blessed  Sandboxed access to certain really really important features of your hardware  But you're not letting us your competitors have it that would be a problem  But then if they have to say well tell me show me how  Users are actually paying the price for this how does this drive up the prices of your product?  And how does that mean that it's it's gonna be a harder thing for them to do I think in principle  It's it's I don't know it depends on how much caffeine sugar or sleep. I've had the  Whether I'm angry at Apple or I'm angry at their accusers because the thing is Apple could not have created something as cool  As the Apple ecosystem if they had not simply said if not for them  Exploiting the advantage that they have that look we create the hardware we create the operating system  We create the software people are using we create the services that they're using  We also have created applied that towards the desktop that you're that you're using the phone you're using and the tablet you're using  That allows us to create  Solutions that work so well to say nothing of also controlling controlling the API and what software  Can be installed on your system on your machine and not that we are creating you can't deny that there is an advantage  To using our ecosystem than a match mishmash of other ecosystems on the other hand then again if I've had more sleep or less  Sugar or whatever that I'm like well look damn it  I mean this is my phone if you want if I want to install a new bootloader  I should be able to do that and if this company can't do can't create a really good tracker because you're not letting them  Have access to NFC and you're just giving this bogus  And you're simply creating a dogmatic excuse to saying we are now gonna lock down all my all Mac apps so that you can't install  Any Mac apps that don't that haven't been approved by the App Store well screw you you're creating a horrible situation where this is not  My computer so again it really depends it really depends on those three things I

It's hard to know  Because we you know what there's a definite benefit to Apple's approach  and and of course it both benefits Apple and  Consumers for Apple to say we're a gated community and you can only you know you only enter if we allow you to enter  That's a good thing for Apple's business, but it's also a good thing for consumers, so I yeah  It's it's a difficult one if Apple were a monopoly  It would not be a problem  Then we would know that this is an issue and we've got to fix it  But Apple is no as you said Georgia nowhere near a monopoly so yeah

Transcript:  I  Do have the best VPN though. I have to say and I was I will brook no contest on this. This is  Express VPN  I want to talk a little bit about privacy  You know that a VPN is all about security, of course, but it's also about privacy  Have you it says in the ad I should talk about a time. I searched for something online  I wouldn't want others to know about  Pretty much all the time pretty much every day, right?  But the point is every your internet service provider your carrier they know where you go  I don't care if you're in like the incognito mode that doesn't hide it from them. It's it from Google sort of  Incognito mode is not a protection for privacy  No matter what mode you use or how many times you clear your browsing history your ISP knows every single website you've ever visited  That's why even when I'm at home, I never go online without using Express VPN  It's a sad thing but ISPs in the United States can legally sell your information to add companies furthermore  We just passed a reauthorization of the Patriot Act  The house about to pass it that's gonna let the FBI look at your search history without a warrant just whenever they want to say  Hey Comcast, what's Leo been up to and they know and they show not if you use an Express VPN  It's a simple app. You put it on your iPhone your Android device. You put it on your Mac your PC  You can even run it on Linux. You can run it on smart TVs  It reroutes all of your internet through their secure servers  The ISP can't see where you're going all of your data is a hundred percent encrypted. You don't have to use anything like DNS over a  HTTPS or anything like that. It's all protected a hundred percent of your data with the best encryption you can get  Military grade and it's so fast. You won't even know you're using Express VPN  That's another nice benefit by the way if they're in 94 countries  You can go to any one of those countries emerge to the internet from that country. That's where you look like you're coming from  Let's say you want to watch Doctor Who you've used up all your Netflix at home. You want to watch Doctor Who on Netflix UK  No problem. You say please put me in London  Express VPNs got their server there you emerge onto the internet from London you refresh Netflix suddenly hi-ho  There's my doctor who or Japan for anime and on and on and on it is so fast  You can watch HD video. In fact, I've been doing an experiment. I left Express VPN on on my iPad  I think since last week and I for like no difference. I keep forgetting it's on it's like  It's just as fast but I'm secure and I'm private  All your devices you got to get Express VPN it would see net rated them number one wired rated them number one  I rate them number one and I've checked the privacy policy  So have independent third parties they've audited the privacy policy and their unique trusted server technology and they say yes, your privacy is protected  Protect your online activity today. If you want an extra three months free go to express VPN comm slash twit  Express VPN comm slash twit and you'll get a three months free on a one-year package  Express VPN  comm slash  Twit we thank you so much for their support of  These week in tech and maybe if I do a few more of those ads I can buy myself a woodwind Wi-Fi 24 with sidekick

It's like it's yeah  He peep it's perfect. You're upset about a building that's insured  property that's not yours and  The people that did it were peacefully protesting and you know that there's anarchists out there to do certain things  But you're worried about those things before you're worried about loss of life  And again, I don't want to get on the thing about politics and ran into a little thing  But I will say this  There are criminals in this world and those criminals get punished  When people in law enforcement do something blatantly wrong and they get to go home or go to another job and don't receive justice  That is the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so the reason I ask all three of you is I wanted to your opinion  First I want to understand your relationship to Facebook before I ask you your opinion on this  Because Facebook and Instagram have decided to let Facebook users turn off political ads for the 2020 election  There's been a big debate whether they should take money for political ads at all  And I've for one have said no, you probably shouldn't Jeff Jarvis has defended it saying look  It's not just the people you don't like who buy ads. It's the chance for the underdog candidate to efficiently reach voters  It's a valuable tool for people and so not taking political ads would be bad  I think though maybe I don't know. What do you think turning?  It seems to me it's a good half measure to say if you don't like the political ads  You can just turn them off  You won't see them and Facebook at that time will not make money off you on political ads. Let's start with Georgia  Is that a good idea? I

Start time: 5280.46
End time: 5333.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't know. I feel kind of neutral towards that. I think Facebook  I don't like Facebook in the least of the time the best of times. I don't like Facebook  I think that it you know, anyways, I think it's insidious in certain ways  So it doesn't know if the the ads themselves are the worst part of Facebook  I think that it's nice that you can choose to turn it off or not turn it off  And I think that you know in the end it's like really being educated about media and how do ads, you know persuade manipulate  Control you I think that that should be an education that goes through the school system so that you can deal with having all of  these advertisements  Kind of trying to change your opinion and tell you that you're not beautiful enough. You're not smart enough  This is why you're powerless. This is why you should be scared and give up all of your control and give it to us  But I think that them, you know, the ads are gonna be there anyway somewhere  So I like that they you can choose to or not choose to so I also should point out the Facebook is gonna start a

Transcript:  special section  On for voters  That'll be a voter information section and a voter registration section they want to  register four million new people to vote in  November so that is an opportunity to use Facebook's platform to give people information about where their polling place is  What the issues are who the candidates are in a they say nonpartisan way  So let's add that into the mix  They're trying to do both something good and kind of help people who'd have over overwhelmed by political ads Owen. What do you think?

Transcript:  That should be capped and there should be no fundraising secondly if they allow you to turn it off, that's great  But no matter what they do no matter what you do is the same thing as everything else  You can turn off ads all you want to the biggest salesman in your life is the person right across from you  I'm sitting there looking at Leo LaPorte who bought his own pellet grill and I made him feel like  Showing him the power of personal choice  So you could black that's all you want to if you have a friend that has a good compelling argument such as myself  They can sway you and change you so Facebook has still got that going for itself  I also do appreciate them having the voters and all that kind of stuff set up where people find out where they're voting and  Register because that is something that's desperately in a digital platform because in America we are so far behind in the voting

Yeah, I actually that's really the real thing is let's get money out of politics to best we guess  I agree with you 100% on that  on the other hand  We it is in politics and it's gonna be for the foreseeable future because guess what the people who got elected by that money are  Who decide whether they're gonna be able to take money but  America, but I  Don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's a positive thing that Facebook has  Indicated that they have some responsibility for anything that happens on on their system  Which is a positive thing for me, but it's and it's good to give people a little bit more control over what's appearing in their news feeds  That's also a good thing. However, it really doesn't attack the problem  It goes it solves a problem for people that are annoyed by political ads or annoyed by ads in general  but the real problem is the  absolute  Find to the to a 100th of a percent percentage point with which modern advertising tools and targeting tools allow you to  Recraft an argument to make sure that it will appear appeal specifically to the group of people that this art this ad is going to be  Is going to be shown to there was a study  I think that was released last month that was talking about some of these specific problems of  above a  COVID-19 vaccine and indicating that this is it  it's one of those few things that  That spreads across melt multiple categories of paranoia where you have people who think that oh well all vaccines are bad  but how then you get to  Targeting people who are saying that I don't want to get a vaccine because this is big pharma bit  We don't I don't need this  This is a huge corporation that once again is trying to control us or you have someone who's saying well the government says that  We should all have this and the government is saying I can't send my kid to school until I have this  This is big governments  Getting out coming after me just the way the big government always does and then even you have the hippie crunchy people who are like  Oh my god  We don't want to put another artificial chemical into our sainted temples of our bodies  And this is the when you multiply that towards towards a spectrum of a thousand different  categories and you have someone who as  Has been said has a trillion dollars to spend on the campaign to make sure that look we don't  It's really important that we get this state and we've decided we've we determined that winning this state means turning only  30,000 to 300,000 undecided voters. That's when you decide that I'm going to  Unleash 12,000 specific campaigns to make sure we'll get 300 people there 800 people there 700 people there  To make sure that we can turn this state to our advantage. So this is I really think that  In an idealized sort of world  Facebook will just will not will have a standard user interface  But there will be third-party apps that can I can interface through it instead that could be a little bit smarter in deciding that well  Why am I seeing this particular ad?  That a way that I can use Facebook without Facebook and having any details about who I am and  What it thinks that I stand for that's the only way to  Protect the our collective brains against this kind of this kind of infection  That's and it's it's gonna get worse before if we don't  Do it take any steps to make sure that there are controls over how people can try to manipulate people through social media

Transcript:  speaking of social media manipulation  And actually, I'm not sure I feel about this. I feel like the president was trolled by kpop  tik-tok  Facebook and Instagram teenagers all over the country apparently  Signed up for tickets to the president's rally in Tulsa last night  That's why his campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted a million tickets. Give it away  He also by the way and Brad just a tip you're not supposed to tell people this part  I can't wait, you know, he tweeted the data's the datatrove is amazing  Except that he now has apparently a good number of phone numbers of teenagers because they didn't have an age check on  There they didn't have they did verify the phone numbers. It would sent you a pin  So they have real phone numbers  although it's not I would imagine these tik-tok and Instagram users probably know how to create a  Temporary phony phone number on places like Google Voice  It's one of the reasons though that they had an overflow  Area ready for a thousand people and the president and the vice president were supposed to speak to that. No one showed up  There and in fact the 19,000 seat arena according to the Tulsa Fire Marshal was filled with a mere  6200 people  They were trolled that's trolling  Right  They didn't do a lot to prevent that but Wow  Steve Schmidt is a Republican strategist  You might see him on the MSNBC regularly tweeted that he is his daughter had herself  Had hundreds of tickets to the rally and so did her friends  My 16 year old daughter and her friends in Park City, Utah hundreds of tickets. You've been rolled by America's teams  Teens Steve Schmidt tweeted this morning  100,000 likes many responses from people said this is the AP reporting  Say they or their kids did the same Wow

Wow survey by opinion matters on behalf of a security company of Vera  When asked if they plan to download a contact tracing app an overwhelming majority 71% said no  Part of the problem with the Apple as it turns out with the Apple Google API is is to privacy forward  That none of the information health experts want  Things like your name and actual location are available to them. So only four states say they're going to use the API  More countries are using it Switzerland's trying it out. Germany's finally gotten said they're going to do it  Lafay is doing it even the UK has said we're going to use the API  But my guess is that worldwide the reaction is pretty much the same. We know in Singapore  Where they put out an app early on only 25% of residents installed it now Singapore's  Considering handing out a Bluetooth token a kind of like an Apple tag  That you'd carry in your pocket that would record your location at all times people will be just sticking on their dog  Don't you want to help you want to be locked up forever

Right, if you're only going to test you when you're really sick  You've already you've had 14 days to infect right like how many people right a thousand perhaps? So yeah  Well, it's a

Transcript:  Yeah, I think a part of it a big part of it's just going to simply be  Once we have some a binary yes-no pass fail sort of system in place that has numbers and  And science behind it the ability to say, okay  Well, if you do want to if you do want to go to this restaurant tonight  You're gonna have to show that you have a valid pass fail card  If you want to if you want to attend this concert, you're gonna have to have a have your have a pass fail card scan  That's gonna either cause either  riots, I'm sorry. That's a bad word a cause  enough kickback that the  Organizations proposing this will back down or that's going to lead to widespread adoption. It depends on how how  It depends on how much attention people are paying to the numbers week by week by week and people are still dying  And we can still see areas in which the numbers are going up and not down and it's it's very very disappointing to see  Very very disappointing to me that I'm seeing people even when I'm going when I went grocery shopping the other day that I'm wearing my I'm wearing my mask  Of course, no not just because I'm outside but because specifically hey, you're inside this enclosed space  There's a sign saying you have to wear a mask and the number of times where I pass someone by who's wearing their mask around  Their necks. Yeah, and then they see me with the mat and they like sheepishly pull it up that all it's like  Yeah, do you not understand that we are still in a crisis here?  Something's gonna have to give and one possibility I have to say is that  Society either through ignorance or through acceptance decides that we are okay with losing  X tens of thousands of people that would have lived over the past 20 past two or three of the over a period of two or three years  over all the damage that's being done to social social situations to school to businesses  That's a possibility but it would be a very very sad one if I'm opted into this by virtue of the fact that I have to live  I have to go shopping with people who are going out while they're sick and not wearing masks and Andy that doesn't even work though

I don't have it  Yeah, you didn't have it last week when you got tested you walk around now without a mask  You just got it from your sister's brother's cousin at the barbecue and boom you got it, but you won't know for another two weeks  So that little token wouldn't even work because you're clear today and you went out and did all that willy-nilly stuff and now you got it tomorrow  so I mean

Transcript:  The way the token works to be fair the way the token works everybody carries it  It's all the time as soon as you test positive you give them your token it has in it everywhere  You've been and everyone you've come into contact with much like the Apple Google API  That then the health authorities can use to do contact tracing the difference is it has names addresses and phone numbers in effect  It has the actual people so that they can call them and say you need to you were exposed you need to quarantine as well  But nobody's gonna do it, especially in the United States if they're not doing it in Singapore  I I can't imagine they're gonna do it in the United States

Don't that's the thing is that you don't know if you don't get it again  And they've tested that some people that tested positive and had antibodies no lower have the antibodies  so there's just so many things that are unknown and I think that  The the World Health Organization did a real disservice by first saying that masks did not help you and they were doing it to protect  The health care workers so that they could get enough masks for themselves. They could have said homemade masks are okay

Transcript:  Well, it's a technology subject in a way that this is this is a mistake that collectively we keep making over and over again  To think that oh well technology we here is a an academic an epic academic idea in which we can use  technology to solve this huge problem and we're gonna have faith in the technology as opposed to  Seeing how that's gonna play out in a real world. I just I just bought on eBay  One of the one those one laptop per child laptops because it's still a cool piece of design. Yeah  Never Ponte was saying oh, well, here's how we solve education worldwide  we make really cheap $100 laptops and the governments will buy like a million of them and give a child their own laptop and  That was without actually checking with each of these individual regions saying well  What is your biggest problem?  And if they're telling them well our biggest problem is that we don't have enough trained teachers  It doesn't matter how many laptops you give out if you don't have a teacher you're gonna need that good point  Yeah time and time again. So that's so that's I academically. I think that's a great idea  Let's find a way so that when someone gets sick we can find out who they're in contact with so we can contain that that little  nodules of spread but nonetheless trying to  trying to convince people that this is not going to  Weaken your personal privacy is a is something that you have a responsibility to do that means that this person is simply well informed on  The the the risks of carrying around a phone with them wherever they go and it might be an unsolvable problem

Transcript:  Some blame to the scientific community because there's been such a rush to publish  That there's been a lot of conflicting information flowing out of the  Epidemiological and scientific and health communities and that's confusing to us because we hear a variety of things  I you know there was a really I thought a wonderful paper in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  Published it looked like it was peer-reviewed. It said it was peer-reviewed published by a Nobel laureate  chemist  saying that not only  Is it pretty clear at this point that aerosolized?  COVID-19 is the predominant way of infection and a particularly virulent form because it goes right near lungs  But that masks above all other mitigations work not that you shouldn't social distance and wash your hands  But everybody should wear a mask and if everybody did it would work and I thought this was so good  I blogged about it. I thought this is a great paper today in the New York Times  It turns out a bunch of scientists are asking the NAS to retract the article  Because yes, it's peer-reviewed, but it was peer-reviewed in a fashion  That isn't very good the peer reviewers were selected by the studies authors and a number of scientists now saying this the  assertions in this article are over the top and not supported by science and  when that happens  It it in and I think I'm fairly literate and consuming scientific literature  That really undermines the whole damn thing  It's like okay if you're gonna publish that NES and you're very respected and you say it's peer-reviewed and the guy who wrote  It's a Nobel laureate and now it's not true  Oi, so and the other problem is now it goes the other direction people are gonna say see that mask thing  It's not true, which is not true either  So this is part of the problem with science why agree

I was saying well, this is not a preprint  This is peer review from a prestigious journal and even then apparently I was fooled. So  I don't know. I you know, I think that's part of the problem too is  Scientific method does not work in the way that  Helps us be certain about what we need to do. That's where leadership makes a difference. That's where  Unfortunately, a gutted CDC is no help at all because we don't have the kind of leadership that can  Assess all this material and then give us clear instructions one way or the other. It's all just a mess  And that's too bad because it's just gonna make us sicker  Let's take a little bit of a break on that light and happy note  What are you gonna cook brisket shoulder a pork little pulled pork?

Transcript:  It says in that bone just slides out it's beautiful. Oh, yeah  Yeah  Our show today, bro  Would you like a little wasabi with that our show today brought to you by wasabi not the hot sauce wasabi hot cloud  storage if  You are if you're collecting data in your enterprise, you're probably collecting it so fast  You're buying more storage all the time more on-prem storage all the time. I was talking at wasabi CEO David friend good friend  I've known for a long time. David was telling me about a Boston high-rise that bought security cameras. This is some months ago and  and didn't really think about the fact that these security cameras are recording megabytes of  Content every minute that they would be buying new hard drives every month and it was starting to really add up and  David said you should store it in the cloud  It's a frankly. It's a it's a no-brainer for most people and of course, I'll tell you what some of the objections are  It's not secure in most cases wasabi on  Hot cloud storage is more secure than your on-prem storage. Oh, well, it's more expensive. No, in fact  In most cases, it's so inexpensive at least wasabi is you're thinking of those other guys  Wasabi's 80% cheaper than Amazon s3. It's so inexpensive  You can typically store data in wasabi's cloud for less than just the maintenance fees  the maintenance fees on the on-prem storage  Regard not even the storage just the maintenance fees wasabi is really remarkable and it's going to solve  It's going to solve your problem with needing more storage  Wasabi is brilliant. They've devised a way to make  enterprise grade cloud storage a fifth the price of Amazon s3  as much as six times faster and  More durable 11 nines of durability on average you'd lose one file every  649,000 years that compare that can you say that about your San?  No, it's hosted in premier tier 4 data center facilities that are not only highly secure but fully redundant and they do active  Integrity checking every object stored on wasabi is checked every 90 days  So if there's ever an issue, they've got a copy somewhere else in another tier 4 center. They can copy it over  That's why your data is absolutely  Safe and secure all data stored in the cloud at wasabi is always encrypted at rest  Even if you don't specify encryption, they follow all the best models of security and design  There's things like access control mechanisms like bucket policies  access control lists  So you and by the way the best part I love this you can select your data some data are all to be immutable  Means it cannot be erased or altered it cannot be erased or altered  Malware can't get to it hackers can't get to it  Your fumble-fingered nephew and accounting can't get to it. That's awesome HIPAA compliant CJIS compliant and so affordable  Now there's two ways to pay you can pay as you go very simple a very affordable price  But if you know if you're like that high-rise and you know exactly how much storage you're gonna need every week month and year  You can reserve capacity wasabi's reserved capacity storage  Means you buy ahead  For one three or five years you get greater discounts the longer the term the greater the capacity you're gonna save even more I  Just think this is a no-brainer. The only problem is the name wasabi  Everybody's heard of s3 and Azure and Google Cloud  Nobody's heard of wasabi. That's why I want to tell you about it. Why I'm a big believer in wasabi  It's highly secure disruptive technology that's turning the industry on its ear  80% cheaper up to six times faster than the industry leader  You're when you go to the boss and you say look we got to do this. Let's stop. Let's stop the insanity  Let's stop buying on-prem storage. Let's move to the cloud and I've got the best way to do it  You want to try it go to wasabi.com? Click the free trial link out of the code twit  Wasabi.com  Calm you got on the front page. There's a picture of Nate director of IT being squished by on-prem storage  You gotta for many of us as you the time to move the cloud has come and  Next generation cloud storage is here wasabi. Try it free for a full month wasabi.com use the offer code  twit and  It's good  Try it because you can try for instance they support the Amazon API so you can try your Amazon s3 tools  They'll all work and unlike Amazon. They don't charge for egress and they don't charge for API access  So that's it. That's another one. I  Have to say it, you know use OS 3. That's great  I'm gonna put everything up there and then you find out you have to pay to get it back  Not with wasabi no fee for egress no fee for API access. It's really a good deal wasabi.com  Use the offer code  twit if you would  Okay, we can let's see let's wrap this up with a few  great quick fast  hits  Oh, this is nice.

I do it's called Endeavor  Rx from  Achille interactive formerly project Evo  It's prescribed as medicine for the kids between the ages of 8 and 12 with ADHD. It's an iPhone or iPad game  seven years of clinical trials  Six hundred kids figuring out whether this game could actually make a difference  The answer is yes one-thirds of kids treated with this game no longer had a measurable attention deficit  On at least one measure of objective attention after playing the game for 25 minutes a day five days a week for four weeks

Transcript:  The only thing I have to ask is that  Kids with ADHD usually are very good and have a lot of good attention when they play the video game. They're focused. Yes  They're interested in something they also have a good amount of folks that can actually be hyper focused. That's what I did. Yes  So I just don't and again, I'm intrigued by it and I think that that would be wonderful if it could help them on a separate  Area, but I wonder if it isn't if it's that area and if it's that area  I don't know if it would be as usable to being bored like our school system has to be kind of overhauled  It hasn't really changed in a very long time and it's dull like to be able to sit there  you know and just listen to someone maybe perhaps prattling on about something which sometimes can happen or  You know, they're not being able to move around.

Start time: 7436.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The chess would be I think that would be very effective because you have to be calm  You have to be paying attention. You have to pay attention to the other person. I  And I know that neurofeedback  So they they do neurofeedback where they you're not kind of hooked up to electrodes and when you're working on being calm  You know, there's a plane it's a video game and there's a plane that's kind of there's many different ones  But like let's say there's a plane that you try to move up and down depending on your brain waves and you're working on  Becoming focused becoming relaxed being able to calm your mind down and when it does the plane flies straight  Yeah, and so that helps build up that part of your brain doing anything that's kind of  Slower paced can also help that and so maybe they're working on something that is similar to that

It'll tell you why people protest and why people are so angry and  You can watch videos about it  You don't have to read you can just go ahead and watch them and it'll give you some things that you could do  Personally because people ask me all the time what they could do or how they can get more information  So I put it all in one little section for you to go look at and read if you want to do it if you want  To share with someone else who's a little bit hard-headed  But you know they have the right heart and you just want to nudge them  I think that this will help you nudge them and I will leave that on my site until you know  We fix everything in the world.
