Transcript:  It's time for Twitter this week in tech. What an amazing show ahead for you.  Jason Calacanis joins me along with Ian Thompson. Of course, because Ian's here,  we're going to have to start by talking a little bit about Brexit and what it  means to the tech community and the community at large.  And I have a feeling we're going to get pretty, pretty heavy on this one.  So stay tuned. Apple drops the headphone port. Is that a big deal?  It may be so. In fact, maybe the end of Apple, according to some.  And we'll talk about solar city and Elon Musk and his plan to make the next  trillion dollar company. It's all coming up next on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, asking questions and having that BS meter is in your head. It's in  your head. You're constantly when you're talking to people trying to form the  next question, which is actually why so many journalists wind up becoming  investors, because it really is about asking questions, listening, being  present, and then coming up with a follow up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Deal flow is good. Yeah, you know, so if you're M.G. Siegler or O'Malek, you  know, they knew everybody from being a journalist. It's a great way to cut your  teeth. And then you leverage that into an investing career.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just I started listening at about lunchtime UK time because of the time  difference. And yeah, it's about five a.m.  before it was just like I've got to do an interview in about three hours time.  I need to get some sleep.  But it was you couldn't.  And to be honest, my wife learned an awful lot of English swear words.  She probably shouldn't have been introduced to that point.  But yeah, it was it was a very fraught night.  The last few last few days haven't been much better.  And I'd like to keep it light and cheery, but basically the UK is screwed.

Start time: 248.44
End time: 298.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there you go. There you have it.  I mean, there's look, it's funny from our point of view across the pond.  I don't think we really know what to think of it, right?  And on the one hand, I understand  how voters might be afraid of untrammeled immigration.  The UK is one of the richest of the UK of the EU countries or  UK isn't even a country.  Well, technically, I guess it is.  One of the richest.  And so as a result, it carries the weight of Greece and other countries  that are suffering. And also, you're going to get your share of immigrants  coming in who are looking for work in one of the richer countries, just as Germany.  Does so. I understand the reluctance to keep your borders wide open.  I also understand the reluctance to let Brussels  decide things that would normally be to be decided by Parliament.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that voted for exit over 50s were overwhelmingly vote leave.  And the young people did not want to leave.  No, the young people. Why not?  Well, because they want the right to live and work in 29 other countries.  Should they should they have the desire to?  They recognize that Europe has kept the peace for the last 70 years,  which is longer than the continent's managed for the last 2000.

Start time: 334.62
End time: 345.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, that is at least from my point of view,  the one thing that here in the states, we might look across the pond  and worry about, because one of the things  the source of two world wars now.

Start time: 356.60
End time: 371.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a united Europe to us looks better for peace.  Absolutely. From the point of view of technology,  there's economic benefit to negotiating one treaty with 29 countries  than than multiple treaties.  And now we'll have to negotiate separately with England, of course.

Start time: 371.84
End time: 392.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you look at the demographics of just Europe as a whole  and it's it's under a billion people and it's a very slow growth culture,  you have, you know, population growth is a fifth of other countries, other continents.  So people are getting old there. What do people do when they get old?  You know, they they they want to protect what they have.  Well, that's the thing I understand.

Transcript:  World. And it's kind of the same reason Trump is supported.  We want to go back to the days when England was England. Yeah.  And England wasn't a bunch of curry shops on the corner.  We want to go back.

Start time: 402.18
End time: 458.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, on the curry front, I would have to say it's pretty great.  You were talking about what immigrants give to this country.  Before immigrants brought curry and the rest of it to this country.  We had scones and trust me, they're really boring bangers.  Yeah, we had bangers and mash.  We had fish and chips.  You had roast beef and lamb being facetious.  Yeah, no, indeed. It's going to be a disaster.  Benefit from it's but it's going to be a complete disaster  in terms of economics because from pure economics.  I mean, the biggest winners out of this island,  because if you're an international company that wants to get into the euro zone,  your first choice, if you're an English speaking country like the US,  was to come to the UK. Right.  If the UK isn't in the euro zone anymore.  And by the way, that includes Ireland.  That includes Ireland. Or Berlin.  Well, in Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland. But Southern Ireland has the very favorable tax systems.  So that's where Google is and Apple is.  Yeah, this is where they funnel all their money.  So that this doesn't affect that.  No. But I mean, if you're actually looking to get along in, you know.

Start time: 458.64
End time: 460.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Is Southern Ireland in the EU? Yeah, it is.

Start time: 460.72
End time: 469.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, they're there.  They're firmly in the EU.  And in fact, Northern Ireland could be going into the EU.  Well, that's the other thing.  They're now talking about a referendum to rejoin with Ireland,  to keep their EU status.

Start time: 469.82
End time: 491.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're nostalgic about jolly old England,  you might be a little nervous about the notion that Scotland is not thrilled  about this. They've got going.  Yeah. 60 plus percent to 38.  Every single constituency in Scotland voted to stay.  And of course, Scotland had recently had an independence vote that failed.  Yeah. Now they're thinking they will have another independence vote  and they will appeal to they will apply to be in the EU.

Start time: 491.94
End time: 503.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And they'll do it.  Which is kind of mind boggling.  Everything I'm seeing from the Scotland vote is if the EU membership is at stake,  the Scotland independence vote will win.  And I think it's an enormous mistake for Scotland.  But at the same time, they will win.

Start time: 503.42
End time: 512.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But speaking as a tech company, I could now I could still go to Ireland.  I could still go to perhaps to Scotland. Yeah.  And you don't have to pay. I might not have to go to England.  I might want to go to England.

Start time: 512.34
End time: 558.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But just think about data privacy.  Where are you going to store your data?  Well, I know you're going to be building products in the European market.  It's like you're now going to have the reason the EU is so transformative,  I think, for tech companies, was we can look at that region as one region  as opposed to building a terms of service for every region,  building a product for every region.  And now it's going to be OK.  We have to build a product and an office in the UK and in the EU  and in this country.  You're competing against South America and China, the United States.  It's going to set them back.  Of course, they might make some better decisions for themselves.  We'll see how that turns out.  But it is something there is something in the air about not trusting  the government, not trusting politicians.  And we see it here with with Trump, obviously.

Start time: 558.24
End time: 584.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a much larger story that's being told here, too, of a complete distrust of  what up to now have been the elites, not just the political elites,  but the media elites, intellectuals, the intellectuals, the scientists.  And so that's pretty clearly happening in the US.  I think that the Trump movement and to a certain degree, the Bernie Sanders  movement are about same thing, turning our backs, turning their backs  because as a media elite, I guess I'm the one who's suffering here.

Start time: 584.48
End time: 587.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could say if turning your back on the elites, I expected the pay to be a lot better.

Start time: 588.64
End time: 655.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  At least get a make up person if it's going to be media elites.  You know, the thing is, if what I really think this comes down to jobs  and the economy, if if the rich keep getting richer.  Yeah, it's income inequality.  People in the middle are looking and they're saying, wow,  all these rich people are getting so rich.  And then the middle class is getting ground down and the poor don't feel there's a path.  There's no path to get to the middle class.  And the middle class is stuck.  And if you look at something, just one example, education, college education.  Oh, huge. Yeah.  Used to be that you had this great path to success, which was city universities  and and state universities were either free or cheap.  And we've got it.  And now Bernie Sanders comes out and says, hey, let's make college free again.  You know what? That's a brilliant idea.  It gives people a path to get out of poverty.  And you know what?  The elite are like, yeah, we don't want to get free college.  I as a member of the elite at this point in my life and being previously being poor.  Let's make college free again.  Let's give people a path, because if people feel ground down,  they don't trust Hillary, they don't trust intellectuals,  they don't trust global warming.  And they're going to vote for somebody like Trump  who can't complete a sentence and changes his plan every other week.

Start time: 655.74
End time: 705.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'll be honest, I completely understand.  I'm not unsympathetic to that.  It's a little bit like let Rome burn.  It's a burn it down vote.  It is. It's exactly what it is.  Glenn Greenwald in The Intercept kind of surprised me.  And I'm not sure I completely agree with him, but he says Brexit is only the latest  proof of the insularity and failure of Western established  establishment institutions.  This is exactly what he's saying is the failure of the elite,  the political elite, the media elite, the government elite to  to to provide an opportunity.  And it's it's a reaction to that to people who feel disenfranchised.  And I completely understand that.  So now if you're Google, you might not be completely against this.  Google's had horrific times with the EU in privacy, the right to be forgotten.  It doesn't necessarily the EU is not necessarily a great place for American  corporate interests.

Start time: 705.82
End time: 711.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, OK, it's not a great place for American corporate interests  who want to carry on the way that they do in America.

Start time: 711.40
End time: 713.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Microsoft's been censured by the EU.

Start time: 713.84
End time: 721.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google has been censured by the EU.  Why were they censured?  Microsoft was censured because the EU took action that the US government  wasn't prepared to do.  But the EU did dopey things.

Start time: 722.34
End time: 727.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The EU said, well, your Internet Explorer browser is a monopoly,  just as our Department of Justice tried to do in the 90s.

Start time: 728.48
End time: 729.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then completely wussed out.

Start time: 730.14
End time: 758.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what they ended up doing is saying, well, what you got to do  is a browser ballot. They insisted on a ballot.  When you install Windows in Europe, you get OK, which browser  do you want to be the default?  This was a terrible solution.  The cookie. Yes, because it's not what it doesn't serve anybody  in any way.  The cookie banner that you see everywhere now as you travel around  the Internet is directly attributable to Brussels because of their privacy  concerns, misguided privacy concerns about cookies.

Start time: 758.66
End time: 760.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, we could argue long and hard.

Start time: 760.16
End time: 767.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's the thing.  But how does it in any way do anything but annoy that banner?  Do you just you click OK, right?

Start time: 767.50
End time: 771.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It depends on the site.  I had to check out their terms and conditions and then I decide  whether I'm going to click on it.

Start time: 772.02
End time: 786.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody else just clicks OK and says, get rid of that banner.  It's just an annoyance.  They've had the opportunity to make the decision.  The right to be forgotten is an abomination.  It's a misunderstanding about the Internet works.  It's an attempt to edit history.  And you think the Germans of all people would know better.

Start time: 786.72
End time: 791.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, now the Germans are the nice, nice politicians.  Now that they're the nice people, I know.  But I just say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There is one good thing.  When you have to deal with one governing body as opposed to 20 or 30,  it does make it for the United States...  The US companies a little bit easier.

Start time: 820.40
End time: 833.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google still has to go to France and deal with the French courts  and Germany and deal with the German courts.  So, no, it's not. It doesn't...  The EU's decisions do not eliminate the courts in France.

Start time: 833.16
End time: 840.68

Transcript:  There is an anti-corporate sentiment that comes out of Europe.  Europe is pro-government, anti-corporate,  just as US is anti-government, pro-corporate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  At the end of the day, people get to choose which country they live in.  The United States happens to be full capitalist,  and we suffer the ramifications of that.  There's pros and cons.  The UK is pretty much pro-capitalist.  People in the United States would like to turn it into Denmark or Norway  and get a year off for maternity  and have people have three years of job severance  or two years of job severance.  If you do those kind of things,  while they seem great on an individual basis,  sure, we all want to take a year off when we have a baby  or we all want to have two years of severance,  the problem is then people don't create cutting-edge companies  because they don't want to take the risk of being personally liable  for people's salaries and they have to go a little bit slower.  That's why the United States comes up with all these great companies  and Europe comes up with very few to none.  There's very little VC in Europe.

Start time: 903.44
End time: 922.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the corollary of that is that in the US,  you have no safety net whatsoever.  So if you actually want to go and start your own company,  you've got to abandon the choices of healthcare  because that's something you have to pay through the nose for.  You've got to weigh down with student debts,  which to my mind is quite frankly economic surfe.  I think we agree on that.  I mean, I think that's...

Start time: 923.08
End time: 925.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, listen, there are going to be some ramifications.

Start time: 925.12

Transcript:  But I feel we're also rugged individualists.  And I think that this is...

Start time: 929.06
End time: 934.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry, you have this appearance to be...  It's like, oh, we're all rugged individualists.  Now, where's my Medicare check?

Start time: 934.84
End time: 971.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in the DNA.  I'm admittedly, I'm not a rugged individualist,  but you started the station, you've been pretty damn good.  I can't chop wood, but I do think that there is in the DNA of this country  this sense of independence and self-determinism  that says we don't want a safety net  because that is some sort of nanny government.  We want the opportunity to succeed or fail on our own rights.  But I agree with you, Jason, we failed at that as well  because their opportunity doesn't exist  and income inequality is growing.  And that's why you're seeing a rebellion.  I mean, social mobility in this country is lower than UK at the moment.  Yeah, no, it's clear there are some real failures here.

Start time: 972.72
End time: 1017.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And adding to all of this is the fact that  while we are arguing about the particulars of socialism  versus full capitalism versus everything in between,  there is a bigger trend that's occurring,  which is artificial intelligence robotics  could lead to the end of employment,  could lead to a massive deprecation of jobs.  And if that happens, you know, this kind of weird behavior  we're seeing like the Brexit or Donald Trump phenomenon,  this could be the tip of the iceberg.  Operation Wall Street, I believe, was like the dry run.  It was like this little peek into what discord could look like.  And if you look at what happened in Spain and Greece with full scale riots,  you know, this could become our life.  Yeah, we could be sitting here 10 years from now doing an episode.

Transcript:  Last month, Foxconn laid off, replaced.  They said we didn't lay off these 60,000 workers,  but they replaced 60,000 workers with robots.  I'm pretty sure that 60,000 people didn't get other jobs.  Yes.  And this is the beginning.  This is happening in China.  This is the beginning of a complete transformation.  I agree with you.

Start time: 1037.92
End time: 1046.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, the advance in AI and robotics machine learning  is going to bring around, in terms of in the job front,  something that's going to make the 30s Great Depression look like a cakewalk.

Transcript:  But if you ask Mark Andresen, and by the way,  I'm not think Mark knows what he's talking about,  but if you ask Mark Andresen...  Certainly not when it comes to India.  His position is, well, what's going to happen is the cost of goods  is going to drop so low that it's effectively free.  And so you don't need a job.  Is that credible in any sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, there is something that, I mean, Star Trek kind of envisioned this,  which is there's going to be this life of leisure  and people are going to find their pursuits.  That is a possible utopian vision that could happen.  Free electricity, free food, free clean water,  and even free housing is possible in our lifetime.  We could provide that for everybody.  And we're kind of on the way to that when you think about welfare or food stamps  or solar.  So there is this beautiful utopian society.  What it's going to take is a complete recalibration  of what our expectation is.  In the United States, we're going to have to expect maybe  that this minimum viable income, a universal income,  which is a lot of tests going on around that,  maybe that becomes a possibility.  We're going to need transportation to the suburbs  and out to the royal farms.  But the second half of our lifetimes are going to be quite interesting  and it's going to require a level of leadership  that we just don't see today.

I think that there's so much wealth and prosperity in the world  and it's just not equally distributed yet.  But if you think about something,  people can buy a pair of jeans today.  This is where Mark's points do make sense.  If you think about what it cost to buy a pair of jeans  when I was a kid in 1985, when I was 15 years old,  it was 20 bucks, 25 bucks to buy a pair of jeans.  If you go to Old Neve or to Walmart,  it's 10 bucks or 20 bucks to buy a pair of jeans.  And you think about the price of milk.  It's not by Chinese slaves.  Exactly.  Well, slaves, or they would consider it  that they're becoming part of the middle class.  They're off a farm, they have running water,  they have hot water.

The fact that we have a capital gains tack,  we don't let individuals own stock in private companies.  You have to be accredited investors.  Doesn't the Jobs Act change that?  It's starting to.  And it's just a...  And you think that's a good thing?  Of course, because 97% of the people in the country  cannot invest in private companies.  They can't invest in things that could really have returns.

So they pay this very de minimis amount of tax  compared to income tax.  There's a big gap between those two things.  So we just have to maybe get rid of the capital gains tax.

When you're on the back nine and you're 50, 60, 70 years old,  we have to get these intelligent people  to start getting involved in politics  because the solutions that we face  are not solutions that can be solved by career politicians.  That's why people hate Hillary.  That's why there's this anti.  They just think, well, this person is bought and paid for.  And we can't trust them.

And this is a tough state because it's a weak governorship.  We have a crap legislature.  And yet he's managed to do some things that we need.  I mean, we would be, we're dying in a drought here.  And he's managed to do some things,  to force some things through  that actually have made a difference.  So maybe a career politician is not the bad thing.  Maybe it's the right career politician.  I don't think that, look, if somebody says,  I wanna devote my life to civil service,  and I think that's clear,  Jerry Brown's an example of that.  He has not enriched himself in any way  by being a civil servant.

Both for the rich and capitalists and for politicians.  And the fact that those two groups are so in cahoots,  where these entrepreneurs and capitalists  are paying off the presidential candidates  and the representatives.  It's even more reasonable for the Burn It Down party  is going to get bigger and bigger.  And you know what, maybe Trump becoming president  in Brexit is part of an overall process  that will lead to inspiring the Bloombergs  who should have run this time.  And I think Mike Bloomberg made a horrible mistake  in not running this time.  I think he was electable.  And I think if you look at how horrible  this has all turned out for our country,  how terrible the dialogue is,  if Mike Bloomberg was out there,  I think he becomes the obvious vote.  The most qualified person.

The head of the Leave campaign, Nigel Farage,  or one of the heads, Nigel Farage.  They thought it was a protest vote, not an actual vote.  I mean, he went on TV and he said basically,  when the vote closed, yep, we think we've lost this one,  but you know, we may come back to it later on.  And then as the night went on,  and he realized how close it was getting,  he changed and it was just like, yeah, we'll get them now.

And I think somebody needs to just sit there and say,  you know what, stop thinking about your shareholders  for a second here.  Stop thinking about, and just think about  how insane these ideas are.  There are some insane ideas out there.  They need to be addressed.  And people just need to say, listen,  whatever you think of Trump is fine.  Whatever you think of Hillary is fine, Bernie.  Just address the ideas.  Free college for everybody?  That's not a crazy idea.  Building a huge border and being in isolationist with China  and moving 10 million people across the border.  Those are crazy ideas.  Those are horribly bad ideas.

Then that was, if you,  somebody then found an old Nazi advert  about Jews coming into,  and it was the same picture of lines of people coming in  and just like, they're here for your jobs and your woman.

Transcript:  They don't have to!  Our show today brought to you by A Squarespace.  Everybody now gets a voice.  And while that can make a cacophony,  it is ultimately democratic,  and this is the thing I celebrate about the internet.  The best place, the first place you should go  is have a website.  You gotta have a website.  You just find out your Twitter handle  and your Facebook page, but you gotta have a website.  And this is doubly true if you're a business.  A business without a website is like a business  without, in the old days, a telephone.  This is how people, I don't do business with somebody.  I can't go to their website and find out more about them.  I don't care if you're a tree surgeon, a plumber,  a baker, a candlestick maker,  you gotta go and make a website.  And the best place to do it is Squarespace.  You've said it yourself, Jason.  Squarespace has completely changed the landscape  because web technology's moving so fast.  You don't want to hire an engineer  to use some web technology that in a year  is gonna be completely different.  You don't want to hire a designer  when styles and fads will change next year.  You wanna let Squarespace do it.  And they've got the best designers, the best engineers,  making the best sites.  All you have to do is pick a template,  customize it so it reflects your personal style and ethos.  You've got a great website.  It's mobile responsive,  so it looks great on any size page.  It's got all the SEO handles,  so you're gonna get great results from Google.  It has e-commerce built into each and every template.  They've got new templates for people  who wanna kind of do magazine-style stuff.  They've got the grid-style landing pages,  the infinite scroll.  This is something that all of a sudden everybody was doing,  and if you were to engineer this,  to buy the technology,  it would cost you hundreds of thousands.  You go to Squarespace and you got it.  In fact, you get it free right now with their free trial.  You get related posts at the bottom  encouraging visitors to explore more.  There's author profile pages.  Search is integrated into the header  so readers can get to where they want on your site fast.  That's just one example of the many different templates  for bands, for restaurants, for journalists.  And now that they sell domains, Squarespace domains,  you can get a free custom domain name  with an annual purchase.  You get access to 24-7 customer support.  And instead of those awful landing pages  that those other domain name sellers give you,  you'll get, if you get your domain,  your top-level domain at squarespace.com,  a beautiful spam-free parking page  so when you're ready,  Brexit, let's create a Brexit page.  When you're ready to start building your page,  it's gonna be there,  but when people come to your site,  oh, that looks great.  The cover page alone, that's how I got started.  I made a cover page and said, well, that was easy.  Let me make a whole website.  Power Your Business with Squarespace Commerce,  the only platform that lets you create, manage,  and brand your store in a beautiful way,  except payments instantly.  They recently introduced Advanced Analytics for Commerce,  which lets you view how visitors are interacting  in real time with your commerce,  what you get for abandoned checkouts.  There's device filtering so you can see  who's visiting you and how.  It's really impressive.  They have this new Squarespace circle.  If you've built three or more active Squarespace websites,  and I know many of you do this,  you can get the Squarespace circle,  which includes, membership includes advanced guides,  organized support, six-month trial periods  for new projects and more.  One million customers now, that's a big deal.  They crossed the one million customer threshold.

Transcript:  Dan Lyons, just read his Disrupted, all about HubSpot.  And Dan is quite a cranky fella.  Cranky fella.  I love Dan.  In fact, we're trying to get him on this week  in Google as a regular.  I think we will.  But one of the, kind of an indictment, frankly,  of this whole system of early stage investing,  early stage investing, venture capital, IPO.  And I think one of the Occupy Wall Street points  kind of redounds to this, which is, it's a freaking scam.  These companies never, HubSpot never made any money.  They were a multi-billion dollar,  they were a double unicorn,  raised money on the stock market, stock price went up,  never made, they're still around.

Start time: 2789.20

Start time: 2819.86
End time: 2835.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What they're doing and others is they spend a lot of money  to acquire customers.  They basically are buying revenue growth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so that looks like a pyramid game to me.  Uber's doing exactly the same thing.  Uber's never made money.  I mean, they have revenue.  They've never profited.

Start time: 2835.88
End time: 2843.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you know, I'm gonna get a little bit conflict here  because I'm an early investor in Uber,  but they're profitable in all their major US cities.  So the problem, and this is why I don't like

Start time: 2843.60
End time: 2859.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the jobs act a little bit,  is that this is a sophisticated field  and it's very easy, I think,  for people like me, unsophisticated investors,  to go, well, look at that, stock price go up.  This has gotta be a good investment.  And not look at the balance sheet and go,  but wait a minute, they're buying customers.  They're not making money.

Start time: 2859.64
End time: 2871.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, so Uber is a revenue printing machine.  Like that is a company that is-  Uber is different.  I'm not actually-  That is a revenue printing machine.  And it's clear-  Just like in the sense that Google and Facebook are.  And I'm not just saying that because I'm a third  or fourth investor, but yeah.

Start time: 2871.24
End time: 2880.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you look at Uber, it's an innovation there.  They're reinventing something.  But there are lots of companies  that aren't really innovating,  that are basically, it's a Ponzi scheme.

Start time: 2881.36
End time: 2937.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wouldn't say, I don't think people go into it  with a Ponzi scheme effort.  That would show like, I have the intent  to get a bunch of money in, not build a real business,  and then go to Brazil and run away with the money.  What's happened is, I do think some people come in  and they overspend, and they think optimistically  about the lifetime value of customers.  So this is where they spend $100 to get somebody  to download an app or $10 to download an app.  And they think, well, if I keep this person for three years  and I make $10 a year off them,  sometime in year two, I'll be at break even.  The problem is, with the exception of video games  and the fact that you can't get a lot of money  on your iPhone and some other categories  where people are willing to pay a lot of money  and there's whales in the system who spend a lot of money,  it's very hard to do.  So the app economy was a perfect example  of people spent a lot to acquire customers.  But then there are other examples  where AOL at one point was spending a lot  to acquire customers, but they were also making  $30 a month per customer at one point,  $25 or $30 a month per customer.

Start time: 2937.82
End time: 2959.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it actually was a major, major...  It strikes me, and I get pictures from startups  the whole time and 90% of them get filed  in the circular filing cabinet  because they have no clear business plan.  They have no clear product to path to series revenue  and profit, but somehow they're getting money from people.  Is it just there's so much loose money sloshing around?

Start time: 2960.34
End time: 2985.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what Dan says in Disrupted.  He said, HubSpot, the first thing they did,  they didn't hire an engineer.  He said, it used to be you'd have a product,  oh, I got a great product,  now let's make a business and sell this.  HubSpot, the first hires were marketing people  and salespeople.  They didn't even have a product.  This is a company built Bass-Ackwards  where they don't have a product.  They're building a company around a non-existent innovation  and saying, well, someday we'll have something.

Transcript:  It is a product for marketers.  I know a lot of people who use it  and like swear by the product, a lot of marketing companies.  So they definitely have revenue from a marketing company.  To your point, Ian, about how many startups there are,  it's so affordable to start a startup now.  It used to be in the old days,  it cost three, four, five million dollars  to get a product to market.  That's an amazing thing.  Now it's 30, 40,000 dollars to get a product to market.

Transcript:  And if you're a developer,  it'll cost you nothing to get a product to market.  So what I do is, I'm looking for people when I invest  who can get their product to market,  get a little bit of traction, and then I invest.  So they've just sort of figured out enough  there is a problem of people who have never built anything  and people give them money.  And in a hot market like it was the last couple of years,  you did have people give a million dollars  or a half million dollars to somebody to build an app  based upon some designs on a piece of paper.  That's a little bit out there.  There's so much.

Transcript:  So are we in a bubble?  Well, for sure, there were a lot of bubble-like behaviors.  And so usually what happens in these bubbles  is there's a bunch of real stuff that's solid.  And yeah, there's some things that are not.  The good news is when things blow up now,  it's not like the dot-com bubble  where you had houses of cards,  you had 3,000 or 4,000 employees  and there was no way this company was gonna make it  and 3,000 people were gonna be outside  with their area on chairs, selling them for 50 bucks.

Start time: 3067.64
End time: 3071.37

It never breaks out, but it can't be shut down.  The founders making a salary.  So you just get a lot of that walking dead experience.

Start time: 3099.46
End time: 3146.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So in that case- Really, you're going that far on that one.  I think it could be straight up fraud.  Interesting.  I figured they tried to make it work  and then pivoted. I put a qualifier of could be  and I based the could be  based upon how they responded to a crisis.  When you have a crisis of that magnitude-  They circled the wagons.  Yeah, and they fought it to a level  that was deranged in my mind.  I've never seen a company attack the journalists personally  and not go with facts  and then they had to restate every lab result.  It's unprecedented.  And then Walgreens backed out  and nobody's seen the technology.  There's a very easy way to respond to all the criticism,  which would be to show people the technology  and to vet the technology.

Transcript:  But this was another example of a product  that sounded hugely innovative,  would have made a huge difference.  Of course. Had it worked,  I don't think it was fraud at the beginning.  I think Elizabeth Holmes, its founder,  who didn't have any expertise in this area-  No, she was a kid.  But really wanted-  Dropped out.  Thought this could be done, hired the best scientists.  Turns out, I think what happened is,  after much research, much effort, they-  They failed.  Ah, it doesn't work.  And then they kept the fraud going.  And they were stuck, because they had a unicorn,  and they had a lot of investors,  and they had a lot of money,  and they couldn't say, or can you?  Can't you at some point say,

I had a company that got into trouble  with a government agency,  who said, hey, what you're doing is very innovative.  I won't say the name of the company,  but this government agency,  which is a humorless agency,  said, this is not cool, you need to stop.  And the person came to me and said,  hey, they told us we can't do it.  And I was like, okay, what's your plan?  They're like, give the money back.  I said, sounds great, what's your next idea?

It's like, listen, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist  from a Pulitzer Prize-winning organization  has their teeth hooked into you  and you're responding with ad hominem attacks?  Just let's see the data.  Let's see the data.  That's Nixonian.  And when they restated the data,  a doctor came out and said,  I sent somebody to the emergency room  based on these results.  The new results you're giving me,  I would not have sent that person to an emergency room.  This is life and death stuff.  You don't mess with this stuff.  You do not mess with this stuff.

Transcript:  Actually, it was with Kevin Kelly, who I respect,  in fact, speaking of which,  he's gonna be our triangulation guest tomorrow.  Kevin Kelly did a long piece on Magic Leap.  He said legit?  Well, there was a back and forth on it.  I read a medium piece where, I can't remember who said,  well, Kevin-  He couched it very carefully.  These are the 10 questions you didn't ask,  like how does it work?  You know, you showed us a demo,  but you didn't show us where those wires went,  how, you know, there's a lot of-  Unquestioned questions.  You know, and I have huge respect for Kevin Kelly,  and I totally trust him,  but he may not have had the technical skills  to evaluate what he was seeing.  He may have been shown a dog and pony show.  I don't know.  Kevin will be our guest, and I didn't ask,  I'm kicking myself now,  because I did not ask him about it on triangulation,  but he's gonna join us.  He's got a brand new book, which is fantastic.  I've been talking about it a lot.  It's called The Inevitable, about the next 20 years  and what technologies are gonna change our lives.  And one of the things Kevin talked about  was machine learning.  He said, what's, we are, just as you said earlier,  we're in a revolution now,  where machine learning will be applied  just as a thin veneer to everything,  and will change everything,  much the same way the internet is being applied  to your toaster, and your doorbell,  and your sprinkler system.  And it creates a huge industry and an innovative force  that's very powerful.  Great article by Steven Levy a few days ago on Back Channel,  which was started at Medium and now,  who's it?  Kande bought it.  Kande Nass bought it, which is kind of interesting.  He talks about machine learning and Google's attempt  to create machine learning ninjas,  but way down in the article, buried a little bit,  and I think maybe not given as much importance  as I think it deserves,  the fact that Google is now using machine learning  on 90% of its search results.  When they first launched their,  what was it called, big brain, Google Brain,  it came out of Google X.  When they first launched it,  it was being used kind of experimentally with search,  which is of course the bread and butter at Google.  According to Steven, and I think of all people,  Steven is the guy who really can look at something like this  and get deep into it.  And I think he got somebody at Google  to kind of admit something.  90% of all searches now through Google  are going through machine learning.  They're going through the machine learning.

Start time: 3563.60
End time: 3652.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, they've always looked for human signals.  So if you were to go to the number one search result,  immediately hit the back key and then go to the number two,  but then not come back, they can start to infer,  oh, maybe you didn't get what you needed from number one,  but you did get what you needed from number two,  maybe two should be one, one should move down.  And so there's gonna be a lot of sort of moments like that.  And then to the toast, for example,  if you keep checking the toast for when it's ready,  and then you stop checking the toast,  I think we know the toast is ready.  And so it's gonna know the next time  exactly how you like your toast.  And then with sensors, it's gonna know  and be able to visually see, is the toast burnt or not?  So a lot of these ideas that we have  where humans are coming and intervening  on behalf of the machines to figure things out,  it's just gonna know.  It's gonna know when you're getting to this exit,  at this time, it's gonna be slow.  It's gonna be backed up.  Oh, it's gonna know through machine learning  that there is a warrior's game  and that there's gonna be traffic on this route,  so we're gonna take you on a different route,  or we're gonna change the speed,  or the right lane is faster than the left lane,  whatever it is.  And so it's definitely gonna be  the level of efficiency that's occurring now  because of structured data.  Like if data wasn't structured,  you can't really do this kind of stuff.  So if you remember 10 years ago,  we'd be on the show or talking on podcasts about,  oh, structured data, we're gonna have big data,  things are gonna be organized.  You can't have a tool like Alexa  when you say, Alexa, play John Mayer on Spotify.

That's the next commercial break.  Exactly. All right.  But the thing with that is,  if you have structured data,  then you can start doing this natural language searching  and then machine learning can take over.  And so we're on this path, right?  And we're accelerating.  It's accelerating.

Okay.  So jealous.  Mine in a couple of months.  Doesn't make you nervous that Elon  can see everything you do?  Like down to the point of like where he presses,  where you're pressing the cigarette lighter and.  I don't think they.

Start time: 3825.52
End time: 3863.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have a cigarette lighter in a Tesla?  No, they don't.  I don't think they keep all that data.  And I think in the privacy arrangements,  they can just say like, hey, it's anonymized  and we can put the data of a crash up,  but all cars can do that now with their black boxes in it.  So they have that.  So I think it's actually net-net for society  gonna be pretty great that we're gonna know  when accidents happens, who was the actual cause of it.  It might be bad for people trying to cover up stuff.  Like some guy was using the auto summon feature.  The auto summon feature is specifically designed  that you have to monitor the car  as it pulls out of your garage, right?  So you press the button, your garage opens,  the car comes out.  And because of state laws,

And if you press any button, it stops.  And it's going very, very slow.  Five miles an hour.  It backed into another car.  It's like, well, how did that happen?  He's like, oh, it didn't stop.  It's like, well, we know it didn't stop  because you didn't press the stop button.  You obviously were not watching.  So anyway.

You've seen this with the dash cam thing though.  You know, I mean,  initially dash cams were very popular in Eastern Europe  because of certain laws,  which said if you were in an accident  and you had to wait for the police  to actually come and sort it out.  Now, everyone's trying to get a dash cam  because it solves so many problems.  And if somebody runs into the side of you  and then does a convincing acting job  with the police and he turns up for the accident report,  you can get sent to jail.  Whereas you can just say,  actually, just read that, would you?  And just watch that.  And then problem solved.

Transcript:  And the interesting thing about it is  the press is just kind of sorting out this issue  because it's kind of unprecedented  that one person started two different companies like this.  Or he was an investor in SolarCity.  Does he have to recuse himself when the board votes?  And they did that.  So they're not voting.  It's up to the other shareholders to vote.  So the management teams are not voting on it.  It's up to the other ones.  But there is a big vision here,  which is imagine you go to a Tesla store,  you buy a car and they say,  would you like solar panels and a Powerwall to go with it?  And now you're completely off the grid.

Start time: 3991.60
End time: 4003.38

And again, I don't have any certain information,  but imagine a world where you go to a showroom for a Tesla  with solar panels and the Powerwall in it  and they say, hey, for $350 a month,  would you like solar panels installed,  a Powerwall and a Model 3?

If everybody started to put solar,  and I think this is gonna be a huge geopolitical impact,  there's really a multiple impact, a multiplier here.  One, there's the environment.  Two, there's cost savings.  Three, there's geopolitical issues,  which is do we want to have to buy oil from Venezuela,  Russia, Saudi Arabia, and other countries  Those damn Canadians.  Well, they don't actually have the same view  of human rights as we do.  And so this might create a parity  where we become less dependent on them,  and that's already starting to happen.

With the supercharger network, the larger batteries.  So we solve for that major issue of range anxiety.  The major objection to solar is,  well, what if there's no sun?  What if it's a cloudy day?  What if you live in a cloudy area?  Well, you know what?  If you have the battery back, and what about nighttime?  When you need air conditioning, it's a hot summer night.  Well, you solve for that too.  So there are technological solutions  that if you have the wherewithal and the investment ability,  which these companies take large amounts of investment,  can really change the world.  This is something that transcends just SolarCity and Tesla.  This is something for the United States  and for humanity and the world we need to get to.  So I think this could be a very powerful combination.  And every single-  How important is the Gigafactory to this?  It's absolutely critical that we make the batteries here  and that he has a supplier that can provide the batteries.  Again, I don't have any inside information about it,  but the number of batteries he's gonna need to fulfill the,  I think it's close to 400,000 orders for the Model 3.  And by the way, there was this weird rumor,  oh my God, people are just buying a bunch of tickets  to resell them kind of.  It turned out that 2% of people had bought more than one.  So there's not this,  people are buying up 1,000 reservations to resell them,  which is also an indicator that something good's going on.

You know, it's, and one of the things he'd say,  sort of build the Gigafactory as is sort of two years ago,  was that, you know, we're building in,  we're investing in American jobs,  we're doing what Apple and the other companies aren't,  and he's done it.  But then I think given the Tesla 3,  enormous demand for the Tesla 3,  that's not really gonna work.  Yeah.  You've gotta go to China  to actually get something knocked up quickly.

Transcript:  You know what?  If you can do it,  here's my feeling on Elon and the companies.  If watching him do what he's done  over the last couple of years,  I think he's got a couple of things up his sleeves  about how to deploy this financially  that could be very accretive to the bottom line,  accretive to the bottom line,  and could make it an even better and more attractive deal  for a large portion of people.  So if you just think about people who go into the store  who are buying an EV,  they've already bought into these 400,000 people  who are buying it,  and the 100,000 people who have bought the other cars,  it's a half million people.  They have money and they buy into this vision of the future.  Which means the checkbox of put a power wall in,  the checkbox of put solar on,  I think that's like at least half of them will do it.  Maybe more.  We did it.

But that's going to be a very interesting one  is when they get these dialed in  that you're going to have these convoys of trucks, you know,  that just automatically, you know,  go in a convoy on the road.  It's going to be pretty interesting.  What's interesting also is I think Tesla's on a course  to maybe you'll be able to buy the car  based on how many miles you use  and it will automatically come to you.  So that's, you know, have your car come out of the driveway.  There's no reason at some point you couldn't  click that button and have a car come to you  from a central garage.  No, that's not.  You take the garage from the day.  Or as Elon has said, across the country.  Across the country.  Imagine that vision where you don't own a car.

Trunk Club is cool.  Now you said subscription,  and I think that's the first thing people assume.  Oh, I'm gonna get a box every month.  No, this is really cool.  And there is no cost to you upfront.  Here's how it works.  With Trunk Club, you go to TrunkClub.com slash tweet  and you sign up.  This is free.  But you will never go into a store to do your shopping.  You're gonna get your very own personal stylist for free.  She will call you.  You will talk.  And I had a nice conversation.  I'm not telling you her name  because I don't want to steal her.  And I told her I'm a little portly.  A lot portly.  I told her I was blunt.  I was honest.  I told her.  Candid, thank you.  And she was not mean.  She did not laugh.  No judgments?  When I said stocky, she said, okay.  And she thinks that I got some ideas.  They put them up on a website.  I say yay or nay.  And then they sent me the trunk.  Wow.  Wow.  Full of really nice premium clothes.  She picked them all.  It's better than Geranimals,  but they all went together in nice shoes, ties, swim trunks.  Beautiful swim trunks.  I got some nice swim trunks, short sleeve button downs,  lightweight blazers.  Then you still have paid nothing, by the way, at this point.  Then you pick what you want  and you send the trunk back with everything you don't want.  And then and only then do you pay  just for the clothes you keep.  If you keep nothing, you pay nothing, zero.  And it doesn't mean you're gonna get another box next month.  It is not a subscription.  This is from Nordstrom.  So you know you're getting really high quality clothing.  Really great stylists.  They have the highest standards in customer service.  If you live in Dallas or New York or LA or Chicago or DC,  they have Trunk Club clubhouses and your stylist is there.  You can work with them and talk to them  and meet them in person and even try on clothes there.  The nice thing is when your trunk arrives,  you have 10 days to try on the clothes,  to keep what you want, send back what you don't.  It's not a subscription service.  Shipping is always free.  You only pay for the clothes you keep.  That's it.  Super easy.  Oh, easy peasy.  So great.  I'm not a big shopper.  They have it for men and women.  I am not a big shopper.

Start time: 5157.70
End time: 5170.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  because the Engadget guys got banned,  because we did Antennegate.  We didn't come up with the name Antennegate,  one of the commenters did,  but we made a phone headline like,  Antennegate, iPhone 4 issue.  And Steve was so upset by this.

Start time: 5172.58
End time: 5196.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This seems so wrong to me.  Well, you know, Steve-  He was so thin-skinned.  Steve-  Well, not even thin-skinned.  You're saying this not to that journal.  You're not just saying it to Engadget.  You're saying it to their readers.  You're saying it to your potential customers.  You're not invited.  Right.  And I feel like that that is,  well, it's the same thing as Mr. Trump saying  to the Washington Post,  you can't have reporters in my events anymore.  It's anti-American.

Start time: 5196.94
End time: 5200.30

Transcript:  Well, not Beltway.  It's Silicon Valley journalism, as well.  It's the same thing.  You say the wrong thing about the wrong company,  then you will get your invite to go back.  So it's not just that.

Start time: 5216.50
End time: 5234.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, forget about not getting access.  How about not getting people to come give a keynote  at your conference,  and then other people are getting them for your keynote.  So like, if you think about, you know,  the Deconference or Recode.  When I look at Recode, everybody goes to Recode.  Well, it's very clubby.  I'm friends with Walt.

Start time: 5234.46
End time: 5241.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that because Walt will never say anything bad?  No, Walt will say bad things.  Here's the thing.  Kara will say bad things.  There's two ways to maintain-  He'll say bad things about some people.

Start time: 5242.18
End time: 5250.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a way in which you go about it.  Like, you can't be super sharp.  You have to be...  There's a way-

Start time: 5250.82
End time: 5265.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gentle criticism.  Yeah, there's a way to frame the criticism.  Which Walt is very good at that,  because Walt's very positive about Apple,  but everybody points out, he says,  well, no, no, no, no.  I don't have any special treatment from Apple.  I'll say negative things.  Look, I didn't like the trackpad on the mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maintaining access is important.  This is why I take it as a great point of pride  that I get invited to do nothing.  No, no, I'm saying to people's minds.  I'm not saying to me.  But here's the thing.  If you look at Theranos, putting this aside,  it took a Wall Street Journal writer in Brooklyn,  John Kerry, who should have gotten a Pulitzer for this,  and I hope they correct that,  because it's just tremendous journalism.  It couldn't happen here, because the other thing is,  Silicon Valley Access.  If you look at even, and listen, I'm here,  and I'm massively conflicted as an angel investor.  People know my conflicts, so they can take my words.  You're honest about them, yeah.  Yeah, I'm upfront with it.  But there's other people,  and I recently had this on my podcast  where I brought up some conflicts somebody had,  and it was like, oh my God,  you were being a bully to this other journalist.  I was like, well, here's the thing.  You have to state what your conflicts are right up front  if your spouse works at Google, or Facebook, or Twitter.  As Kara Swishers did.  Kara Swishers did, or Jessica Lessens does.  It's just one of those complications  that we have to be more honest about.  And if you live here, the problem with it is,  if you live here, your chances of winding up married  to a tech person, or dating a tech person, is like 98%.  If you live in New York, and you work for the New York Times,  your chances of marrying a Wall Street person is 6%.  So we just have this inherent conflict.  Then, if you marry a person who works for a tech company,  or the person you're married to as a journalist  winds up going to work for a tech company,  which could also happen, then all of a sudden,  your net worth could be based upon that.  So it's just very problematic here.  I don't think you have a sharp,  since like Upside and Red Herring, and those kind of like.  Oh, those were the days.  Those were like very edgy.  Tony Perkins, Red Herring.  Tony was like a jerk, and it was like his redeeming quality.  He was a jerk, and that was good.  At the time, and then he became a sellout.  But he was like, it was kind of jerky to people  in a good way.

Start time: 5453.32
End time: 5514.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's, here's the thing, when Mike was there,  he was a jerky publisher who would say anything,  but there was also this undertone of like.  He was also investing in it.  They were also invested in the pocket of things.  So it all comes out in the end.  Yeah.  You know, journalism is out of a crossroads right now  because you have the conflict of interests, right?  CNN getting owned by a big media conglomerate, et cetera.  Jeff Bezos owning Amazon.  You have this massive conflicted industry.  The Russian Post, yeah.  At the Russian Post.  And then at the same time, the business model is imploded,  so there's no room to pay  for investigative journalists anymore.  Their ranks have been totally slaughtered.  And we really need to think about freedom of the press.  And obviously the Peter Thiel Gawker thing,  no big winner there.  It was a lot of bad actors actually.  Yes, that was the problem.  Is the problem.  We really need as a society to figure out  what is the, where is the independent journalist core  that is sharp and aggressive and protects society  and gets us to the truth,  because the current press corps  are largely failing at that.

Start time: 5515.54
End time: 5536.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree totally.  No, no, I mean seriously, when we get companies saying,  and we've had this with some of the biggest companies  in the meeting, they say,  we're no longer gonna cooperate with you  because of that particular story that you did.  Well, fine.  This is what the readers don't pay us to write  what you would like us to write.  The readers pay us what they want to.  It seems like a very old fashioned.  Hey, come on.  I mean, Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this has always been a problem with trade press,  going back to Hi-Fis and cars,  which is to some degree,  it was always press release journalism.  And it was an understood, if you read Car and Driver,  you don't read it for their hard hitting analysis  of whether a car is good.  It's really a fanzine for the industry.  And I think a lot of tech journalism.  Far too much of it.  Far too much.  But it's not a bad thing.  Well, okay, I'll give you, here's a great example.  It's a bad thing.

Transcript:  Back in the 90s, it was a good thing  because people were so scared about technology.  They were so worried about it.  We needed a cheerleader a little bit.  We needed cheerleaders.

Transcript:  Well, here's a really good example,  which is this Apple headphone jack.  Actually, we should take a break and then we'll come back.  Because, you know, Neelai Patel wrote a great takedown.  By the way, he was the one who also said,  here's five questions Kevin Kelly ought to have asked  when he visited Magic Leap.  That was Neelai also.  Neelai, I have to say, Neelai, of all the guys out there,  and of course, he worked for you at Engadget, right?  Is willing to stick his neck out and say nasty ass things.  And in this case, he says what Apple's doing  or potentially doing with the headphone jack  is criminal almost.  It's anti-user.

You look at those ratings, 4.6 stars,  so a large number of ratings with a very high rating.  And what I do when you get that great platinum edition of...  You get two books a month, which is nice.  You get tons of books,  and what you do is you're opportunistic.  You go right into a category  where you feel like you need to beef up.  For me, it was science and technology,  and you just pick whatever five  of the top 10 science books you think will make you smart.  Brilliant.  And that's how I do it.  I just look at the rankings, you browse Audible,  you look at the top rankings,  and then you just buy the books  that have the highest rankings  and that have the most reviews,  and you will become smarter.  That is, what a great tip.  And all your books are refundable.  If you don't like a book, it's a money-back guarantee.  Was that true? I didn't know that.

So you could log in through the web app  and so I keep myself logged in in Chrome.

They have serious issues now because they have media  which they can't, you know, they don't like.  If they play it back, it'll shred.  Well, they, well no.  Mylar will just.  They've got the heads on the tape player  to play the media back are so old and no longer made.  They don't have enough head time  to actually play the recordings back and digitize them.  So now they're gonna have to go to people  and get them to custom build these heads.  Go to Ampex and make a new head.  And it's an enormous problem.  We are, when I get dropped.

But you know, there's enormous, we are reaching,  well, we're kind of going through a digital dark age  at the moment where all the stuff that was created.  No, you're absolutely right.

Start time: 6512.98
End time: 6573.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  let's just assume that's true.  It would be a lightning port.  By the way, there's precedent for this.  Motorola's new Moto Z or Zed, as your people say.  The guys that invented the language.  Okay, whatever.  Is a type C connector with no headphone jack.  And both type C and lightning are data connectors  as well as charging ports.  So you can get digital audio out.  You would have to have a DAC,  a digital to analog converter,  either in a dongle or built into headphones  that would plug into the lightning port.  Apple does, Beats does make lightning port headphones.  Philips also makes lightning port headphones.  And the question is, and it's unknown  whether Apple would bundle a dongle.  Are you kidding?  They're gonna make you pay $30 for a dongle.  So, Neelai Patel, and again, we should say this is a rumor.  Although, getting more credible  as we get closer to the launch date.  Taking the, and I love Neelai for saying this,  taking the headphone jack off phones is user hostile  and stupid have some dignity.

Start time: 6575.38
End time: 6598.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I mean, is there motivation  because they bought Beats to make a royalty  every time somebody makes headphones for?  Unknown.  Apple?  That would be really like, you don't make,  that would show that Apple is so desperate  to make more money that they have to close  the ecosystem anymore.  What is the upside to not having it  is what I'm trying to figure out.  That's the rub, yeah.  Is the upside that it's cost?

Transcript:  Well, you know they'll have some statement.  Johnny Ive will come on and said,  after really thinking about the purpose  of a headphone jack, we've decided  the best way to do it is to not do it at all.  What we've done is we've made the invisible headphone jack  you've always wanted.

Transcript:  It's not to make it thinner.  You could argue that there'd be more room in the case  a little bit for battery.  Oh, maybe a millimeter or two.  Not a lot.  It simplifies it.  Of course, Apple's always been about fewer buttons,  fewer controls, fewer jacks.  They made the MacBook with one type C connector.  Yeah, and hasn't that paid bonuses for users?

Transcript:  Apple has said we will make it with a lightning port.  In fact, at this point, if they do do this,  now they're really committed to the lightning port  for many more years.  Because what the last thing you're gonna do  is next year make it a type C connector.  Oh, and by the way, that perfect headphone you just bought  doesn't work anymore.

Start time: 6668.70

There are enough Apple sheep out there  who will buy whatever they get because they're told  it's cool and yeah, no, this is great,  look, I can save a whole millimeter for my phone.  It only cost me $30 and one user effort.

End time: 6719.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple will undoubtedly have a reason.  Now, one thing Neelai brings up  is digital rights management because of course,  that headphone port is an analog hole, right?  And I don't think this is, I can't imagine this is a problem  for anybody in the industry, but you could of course  take copy protected music and record it.  But nobody's doing that because most music  is no longer copy protected.  So I don't think that could be the reason.  It may have a significant impact for, I don't know,  podcasters?

Start time: 6720.42

Is there something that you're missing  or something that you can predict  would make you go, I have to have it?  No.  And that's where I think a lot of the smartphone companies  are gonna have a problem.

We've got, I mean, but one of the things from Google I.O.  was they bring out this new range of VR ready phones  which have up to spec, decent memory,  decent screen latency, good screens all along the way.  They've got a cost of far out more  and they're gonna have to run Android N  and whatever they're calling back then,  but that could be a series,  someone who's got the Samsung VR headset,  that could be a good reason to buy.

He was working for Pixar and Nest, or Next.  He ran Pixar and started Next.  And he was very clear.  Now, of course, remember this is Steve mad  at being fired at Apple,  but he said we had a lead against Microsoft.  We had a 10 year lead  when we came out with the Macintosh in 1984.  We squandered that lead.  And by 1994, Windows had caught up.  And he was talking about Windows 311.  He wasn't even talking about Windows 95.  He said Windows had caught up.  And he saw that as a clear and present danger for Apple.  Is Apple today in the same position?

Start time: 7277.70
End time: 7306.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Apple has said we're not gonna make monitors anymore.  Now there's a couple of possibilities.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Couple of possibilities.  One is that they have a new monitor  and they're just selling off the stock.  That's my understanding.  Well, but that's not the understanding  I can get from Apple's own statement.  Did you read what Apple said when,  let me see if I can find this.  They basically said there's a lot of other people  making great monitors.  Just get one of those.  Does that sound like a company that's selling off stock?  That's bizarre.

Start time: 7307.64
End time: 7337.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They really said that because I literally was tweeting  to Tim Cook about this.  Like I bought the Mac Pro with the cylinder  and I had to, for my video editing folks,  and I had to buy like Asus monitors  or LG 4K monitors to run with it  because they don't make a 4K monitor.  Then I bought the 5K iMac and the iMac,  then I had to, wanted to get a second monitor.  I'm like, am I supposed to buy a second iMac  and use it as a pass through display?  Or am I, so then I bought the widescreen LG.  It makes no sense.

Start time: 7337.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's what Apple says.  We're discontinuing the Apple Thunderbolt display  available through apple.com, Apple's retail stores,  Apple authorized resellers.  While supplies last, there are a number  of great third party options available for Mac users.  Until we, and they don't have the end.  Yeah, until we bring out that a moment later.  No, no, no, here's what I think.  A monitor is a commodity.  Apple doesn't even want to be in this business.  There are too many other people underselling them  with great monitors.  I mean, you can go to Dell and get a fantastic  27 inch, 34 inch display for less than Apple sells  a Thunderbolt display for.  So I think they, and there's another reason.  They don't want to make computers  that need monitors anymore.  They only make two right now, the Mac Mini and the Mac Pro,  neither of which I can imagine are very good sellers.  The Mac Mini is not particularly where they want to be.  They sell the iMac.  They only make Mi Macs.  They'll still make iMac monitors.  High margin.  And one of the ways that the iMac 5K works  is because it is built into the system.  They can have a dedicated chip running that monitor.  Dedicated GP.  It's my feeling that Apple says,  I don't want to be in this market.

Start time: 7403.02

Transcript:  I think it's a head fake.  It's a head fake because they've been,  they've been talking about this television service.  So I think they're out of the monitor business.  Well, they've been talking about it for a long time.  And they have the five.

Start time: 7418.78

Transcript:  They've been negotiating with, they have Apple TV.  Well, they do want to buy,  they want to get cable on Apple TV.  And they want to license content.  And there was somebody floated buying HBO at some point.  So they clearly know Amazon's in the content business.  Netflix is a home run.  The Apple TV is getting more sophisticated,  has a more powerful processor in it.  I think they're going to make,  I still believe they're going to make an actual physical TV.  And I think that this is some sort of head fake.  And maybe they're just going to jump the fence  and make an 8K monitor or, you know, make a 5K monitor,  something truly transformative.  And they just don't want to tip their cards.

Start time: 7454.62
End time: 7463.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a possibility.  I mean, my read of this was they will have a better monitor  coming along in a couple of months, clear the shelves out.  Certainly that would be the normal course of events.

Thanks to Gmail, by the way.  Then all corporate communications  kind of bounced out of your inbox  because of HipChat and other services by Atlassian,  great company.  I got your brother.  Thank you.  Social networks took all photos in private communication  or a large percentage out of email.  So then email became all of a sudden,  well, this is the important stuff.  And a great content delivery mechanism.  So we're really leaning into it.  I think it's gonna work in a major way.

What I love about the email model is  journalists on most publications,  BuzzFeeds, Business Insiders, whatever, Gawker,  they're trying to get people to click on social media.  So it drives the editorial in a certain very nasty,  disturbing, czar, untrue.  Very bad.  Way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Of course, right?  These people retweet, they're like,  I like that sentiment.  Boom, I'm outraged.  Then with email, what is the writer's motivation?  To not have you unsubscribe or hit the reply key  and tell you this is stupid or wrong.  So when you think about journalist behavior  at these other publications,  they're driven to do link bait.  At my publication, in my publishing house,  they're driven to not have people unsubscribe,  which means they're driven to do  high quality journalism again.  So I'm like an old journalist publisher,  and I just wanna get one more swing at the bat  and build one more great publishing house.  One more great engaging.  One more great print magazine like Silicon Air Reporter  where I get it right and journalism is saved  and quality again.  I feel like I got one more swing at the bat.  It doesn't mean I'll succeed,  but I think there's something there.

But then the automatic says,  and by the way, the gas cost you a buck 50.  Now you know, maybe that's not the best,  most economical way to do it.  This is fascinating.  Now I guess you wouldn't get gas mileage information  on a Tesla.

Transcript:  Since 1996, every car in America has the OBD2 port.  You have it.  It's, if you've never seen it, you probably haven't,  because no one notices it's in the dark  where your knees are underneath the steering wheel.  Yeah, three seconds to install.  You plug it in, you put the app on your iPhone  or your Android device.  You use Bluetooth to bond.  I think it's Bluetooth, Ellie.  It's very easy to pair it.  Now all of a sudden you get an engine check light,  automatic tells you what it means.  In fact, it will tell you not only what it means,  but where the nearest repair shop is, which is awesome.  You keep track of your fuel mileage.  You can set custom low fuel warnings.  You can even ask your Amazon Echo  how much gas is left in the tank.  Now see, I would like to do that with a Tesla.  How much battery?  I guess I can do that with a Tesla.  It's a Fitbit for your car.  It's Fitbit for your car.  You get, if you got a teen,  it will tell you what your teen's driving stats are.  On the Android device,  automatic will set your Android phone to do not disturb  and disable the keyboard if you set it up.  You don't have to do this by the way,  but if you've got a teen driver, you will want to do this.

Transcript:  I was thinking actually that I know of a similar system  which is being used to buy a bloke  to test his teen's technology ability.  This has, this has, if she can actually  she can disable this. subvert this  and get around it without him finding out.  This has geo-fencing.

Transcript:  You know, if you can set a geo-fence and say,  if the teen drives outside of this area, I want an email.  I want a text message.  Automatic of course has 24 seven crash response.  So that makes you feel good too.  The dashboard web app gives you all sorts of information,  lets you export trips, but I'm using if this, then that.  So every time I turn off the key and the ignition,  if this, then that, sends a summary,  including a map and gas mileage and everything  of every trip to Evernote.  So it's all in, I've got Evernote notebooks  for every trip I take.  It works with your Nest.  So you can set it so that your Nest  turns on the heat when you arrive.  Your mechanic, FreshBooks,  do you keep track of business mileage?  It will do that for you and FreshBooks are Expensify.  If you lose your car.  You never lose your car.  And I actually- You know where you parked.  I have used this. It's the Disneyland feature.  I was, I went somewhere, I went out of town.  I don't want to say where, I was in a town.  I didn't know where I was.  I was just looking around, looky-looing around,  and I went, oh crap. Where did I park?  Where did I park? Yeah.  And I had no idea where I was.  Launched the automatic app and it said, you parked here.  And it even gave me the way to get home.  Now normally it's 99.95.  The software is free, but when you use our,  and there's no monthly subscription by the way.  When you use our special offer code, TWIT,  you're going to save 20%.  I love this thing.  Automatic.com slash TWIT.  TWIT offer code saves you 20%.  It is fantastic.  And you think I might be joking,  but in fact, when you take the automatic out  of its specially designed packaging,  you actually do in fact get a travel cup.  I'm just saying, I don't know if that's going to  put you over the top.  If you're reluctant, maybe you're thinking,  if you're thirsty.  Gosh, if only I got a travel cup,  maybe I would buy that.  Well, you do.  Automatic.com slash TWIT.  Don't forget the offer code to get 10, 20.

Now, C-SPAN doesn't own the cameras.  The Congress owns the cameras.  And the rules are, we turn off the cameras when we adjourn.  But the sit-in continued past adjournment.  Cameras go off.  C-SPAN cannot cover it.  However, I want to say there's some members of the house  that are technologically savvy,  but in fact, they asked their staffers.  Their staffers showed them how to use Periscope.  Young person, show me how to use this.  Young passion.  And Facebook Live, and they broadcast.  Periscope kind of went down, but Facebook Live continued.  And C-SPAN found out about it,  picked it up, and continued the broadcast.

Transcript:  I'm seeing more and more apps.  I got pitched this week on two different apps  that are basically using this as a studio,  where not only does it have, obviously,  the bandwidth to do it properly,  but they have a teleprompter.  So you look at your phone's camera,  and it's running a teleprompter,  so you can do your news report,  and then it sends it up,  and you can either do it live,  or you can send up the stream,  and you have the teleprompter,  you have people asking you questions.  So this is gonna become a thing  where news reporters are gonna have this,  and they're just gonna speak into it.

Transcript:  I've ordered this,  and I don't know why it's taking so long.  Livestream is selling a camera for Facebook Live.  What's interesting about this camera,  it looks like a plain old webcam, right?  It's got a ray mic, not just a regular mic,  but it has a 4K sensor.  And so what you can do is split the 4K  up into four 1080p streams.  So you actually stream for this 1080p,  you're not gonna stream for 4K,  but you can switch cameras in effect by pointing it.  You use your phone to aim it,  you touch where you want it to be,  but it also has face recognition,  so it will follow you.  So if you're walking around,  and so you're gonna get a subset of the total stream.  That's interesting.

And they had many cameras,  but the one they started with was placed in the back,  and it was sitting next to a cameraman.  It was overlooking an audience.  It was looking at the crowd.  I'm sitting here.  I'm watching the cameraman literally pick his nose,  chew some gum,  because he doesn't realize.  He has no idea he's on camera.  I'm on camera.  I'm looking down here.  There's a guy sitting in a seat.  He's on his phone.  I can read what he's looking at on his phone.  I'm thinking, you're being streamed nationwide.  No idea.

Start time: 8545.12
End time: 8574.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a general election?  Okay, back in the day,  well, they changed the rules in 2011.  They, either the prime minister could say,  right, we're calling election now,  go to the palace and say, excuse me, madam,  could we hold an election?  Or the majority of MPs could vote to,  could pass a motion of no confidence  and dissolve parliament.  However, the rule change is now three quarters of MPs  have to vote on that.  Or five years, whichever comes first.  Yeah, or five years, in which case,  the country might as well be burning down  because five years, three years from now  when the next election is scheduled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if they went to a vote of no confidence,  then it would probably fail  because enough conservative MPs  would have to vote against their own government  and would then get deselected by their own local parties.  So I hope you're right, I really hope you're right.  So this petition is kind of meaningless.  Oh, the petition is totally meaningless.  Petition was, I've seen a number of reports on this,  the petition was apparently started by a vote leave person  before the election.  Because he thought he was gonna lose.  Because he thought he was gonna lose.  And then it garnered like 20 signatures or something.  And then after the election, somebody saw this and thought,  oh, that's a good idea, I'll sign my name to this.  It's never gonna happen.  They will have to roll it back some way,  but I don't understand how they can do it  under the current system.
