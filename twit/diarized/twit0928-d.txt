Transcript:  It's time for Twitter this week in tech.  Two people in studio, Harry McCracken, the technologizer is here.  Kathy Gales from Tech Dirt is here.  Also Amanda Silberling joins us for the first time ever from Tech Crunch.  We will talk about the three big Supreme Court decisions that came down this week.  Turns out Kathy wrote amicus briefs for two of them.  She says it's one win, one loss.  We'll find out what that means.  We'll also talk about the change in streaming TV and the failure of pay TV services.  And a whole lot more.  It's all coming up next.  We might even play a little D&D next on Twitter.

It's time for Twit this week in tech, the show we cover the week's tech news.  I'm a little scared.  I have people in the studio today.  This is scary.  Harry McCracken.  Hello.  Good to see you.  Fast Company, the technologizer.  Your name, you might've heard your ears burning earlier this week because people were saying,  well, no one uses an iPad for day to day work.  And I said, well, Harry does.  Absolutely.  I have for like 12 years.  11 inch pros now.  And you're feeling pretty good because now you got final cut and logic on there.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  I will soon.  Or the final cut at least is exciting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're ready.  Also in studio with us from Tech Dirt, our favorite intellectual person.  She's an attorney.  Kathy Gellis.  Thanks for having me.  Hi, Kathy.  CG council.com.  You're on mass done on that, Kathy Gellis.  But more importantly, Kathy wrote not one, but two amicus briefs for big, big Supreme  Court decisions that came down this week.  And we were going to talk about both of them.  One had a lot to do with fair use.  The other turns out didn't have anything to do with section 230.  It could have though.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  It could have.  It will reverberate in the same space.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It will reverberate in the same space.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm going to think about that for a little while while I introduce Amanda Silverling,  who I've been wanting to get on this show forever and ever.  She writes about culture.  She's the senior culture writer at Tech Crunch.  And it's great to see you.  You've been on Tech News Weekly before, but we never got you on this show.  So welcome.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's exciting to be on the show.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't want to say anything, but it looks like somebody stole your guitar.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Oh, so yeah, it's, man, I should have that in the background because it's like a neon  pink base and it makes me look really cool.  But it's in the other room right now because I had a bass lesson the other day.  Because you were playing it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a good reason.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Yeah.  Excellent.  So it's in the other room inside of a black case, but it should be there looking cool.  Hot pink.  I'm playing the wrong way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So before we get to the Supreme Court, because I do want to get to the Supreme Court,  but I also, Amanda had a scoop that I thought was really interesting.  I kind of want to mention this.  It looks like you saw an email from Instagram that Instagram is going to launch a Twitter clone.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  See, I love that you think it's a scoop because I think Leah Haberman and Matt Navarra posted  this before me.  So thank you for giving me the credit, but tell my editors that it was a scoop.  Leah tweeted it, but that doesn't count.  You wrote the article.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what matters.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, also, actually, before we got on, apparently, the incoming CEO of Twitter,  Linda Jacino or Jacarino, sorry, she just retweeted the TechCrunch tweet of that article.  So thank you for the traffic, Linda.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's interesting.  I wonder why the new CEO of Twitter would be promoting a major competitor from Meta.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Well, she said, I think she said like game on or something was her comment.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's like the welcome.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  Instagram is validating the market.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I think our belief in rational behavior by anybody running the company that is Twitter  these days might be overestimating.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wonder what Elon will say.  So Instagram is, and this is the slide, I guess, that Leah Haberman got.  Yeah.  Instagram is going to launch up.  It looks a lot like Twitter.  It's text based, right?  Not photo based.  It says quickly build your audience in one tap.  Anyone can follow the accounts they follow on Instagram.  So it's kind of just Instagram comments in a kind of a separate space.  Yes.  That's what it feels like a little bit.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Yeah.  It seems like it's going to be very similar to Twitter,  but basically if you have an Instagram account, then you can just carry over your handle and  your verification status if you're verified and then it'll give a little notification.  Like Amanda is now on whatever they name the Twitter clone.  But yeah, I mean, this is all very speculative.  Instagram wouldn't give me a comment on the record about it, but there was another blog  I'm, it's in the article, but I'm forgetting the name now, but they did give them a comment  and they were like, this is in development essentially, but it is interesting that they're  being hush hush.  However, I did see an email that they sent to a creator where they're basically trying  to get like big name creators, actors, athletes to just get on the platform from the get go  because that's kind of what drives growth.  If people are like, oh man, LeBron is over here.  Sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's totally what made blue sky kind of explode with suddenly some big names like AOC.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  She follows me, which it's an honor.  She's never engaged with any of my blue sky skeets.  That's what they're called officially, but she does follow me on there and it's an honor  and a privilege that I am.  I'm afraid she's going to unfollow me and that I'm going to feel bad.  So just say nothing, say nothing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the new blog you were talking about is money sent money control rather.  Yes.  And they say it's going to be called either it's codenamed P 92 or Barcelona.  Neither of which will be named.  I'm sure.  Metta said in a statement to money control, we're exploring a standalone decentralized  social network for sharing text updates.  We believe there's an opportunity for a separate space where creators and public figures can share  timely updates about their interests.  Yeah, we call it Twitter.  We believe there is an opportunity and has been.  It's interesting though.  They say decentralized because you don't think of Instagram is decentralized in any way.  Nope.  Your article says it will.  Well, actually this is from the slide.  It will be compatible with other apps like mastodon.  That doesn't mean we'll be on the Fediverse necessarily.  I don't know what that means.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really confusing wording because like we were talking about this before we  went live that it's just confusing because you would think that if it's compatible with  mastodon, then it would be built on activity pub.  But maybe it's not.  Maybe like, are we going to have like Amanda at Instagram.com?  Is that how it's going to be interoperable?  It's like the tech behind it feels very vague, but I guess they could be cool if it's  decentralized.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Yeah, there's some like little bits of when I saw this get tweeted and social media, I  saw a lot of cynicism behind it.  But as we're talking about it, I actually think there's some little sparks of a good  idea here, but it really feels like not enough meetings have actually happened in the company  to work this all out because I think it's actually really interesting if Instagram has  something that is their own community that they foster and they moderate and somehow  monetize, but that they're using a technology that's less proprietary.  Like that's really interesting, but that is a fundamental shift in the way that a Facebook  property has operated.  So it could be a really big idea, but that's got to kind of happen from C level suite type  things because it fundamentally re-architects the company.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we don't know where this slide is from and it may be that the people who are doing  it know more than the people who made this silly slide, but I completely agree with you.  I think the opportunity is very interesting.  If anybody were open to new ideas at this point, it would be Metta, right?  Because their bet on the Mettaverse has not been hit.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I think individual employees at Metta are very great.  No, I mean, the mind that thought that that was a good idea makes me-  But he's chastened now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is he not?  Isn't Mark saying, oh, whoops, I should have done AI?  I think-  It's just a mistake all the way.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  I don't think they're like walking it back, but I think in the investor calls, like with  so many companies right now, it's like everyone just wants to say AI as much as possible when  they are reporting their earnings because they're trying to make the investors happy.  But yeah, I think I actually, I wrote this at some point, who knows where it is on  techcrunch.com somewhere, but at the last quarterly earnings report, Mark was like,  we're not backing away from the Mettaverse.  We're just also focusing on AI.  But I don't know.  What's your sense of that, Harry?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I know you've written a lot about this.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  They're not abandoning the Mettaverse.  Abandoning the Mettaverse would involve things like shutting down.  MetaQuest and so forth, which I do not expect to happen.  It must be less of a priority, particularly when they have fewer people on staff and are  trying to be efficient.  They fired what?  25,000 or something?  It seems like it would be a terrible mistake to downplay AI in order to put all your resources  into the Mettaverse.  And in fact, Metta actually does have a lot of great AI people who have done-  Always have.  Jan LeCun.  They have done a lot of great research.  And the next step is to actually figure out how to make that into a better and more successful  Metta, which has not quite happened yet, but could.  So-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they're not mutually exclusive.  No.  Right?  You could have VR with AI.  Then you have Rye.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  I mean, I think what people kind of feel-  What people feel is not-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's French for true, I might point out.  So it's not a bad slogan and not a bad nickname.  You can use it if you want.  Go ahead.  That's too clever for them.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  I think what maybe almost everybody agrees, whether they've acknowledged or not, is that  the Metaverse is not like two years away because the hardware we really went for,  the Metaverse is not two years away.  And in fact, there are just some fundamental things about creating great Metaverse hardware  that we don't know how to do yet.  I foolishly spent-  And we don't know when we will know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  $1,600 on the Oculus Pro, which is now $1,000, very shortly thereafter.  And it's not $1,600 worth of anything.  It's not much better than the HTC Vive or even the original Oculus Rift,  which I bought through a Kickstarter sale.  Apple is now two weeks away.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  Two weeks away, $3,000.  Less than that, a week from-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, two weeks away.  Do we know that though?  I mean, and my concern with Apple launching a VR headset is  that maybe this is a category that's already dead.  Is that a possibility?

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Yeah. I never thought it was worth spending any attention on.  Like I've just kind of sat out this whole-  I mean, I remember Vermil.  I've been in tech long enough that I've seen this before,  and I've seen the same level of enthusiasm,  and I've seen the same detachment of understanding  what the technology could possibly solve as an identified problem.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, everything you just said,  if you took out VR and put AI in instead-  Exactly. I'm kind of saying this went out too.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  You talked about, is Zuck chastened?  But I mean, he might say whoops,  but if you don't have any sort of reckoning about what your error was  and how you ended up coming to make it, he's just going to repeat them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When you put $25 billion into something, it's hard to say whoops.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Or $44 billion.  Is it even more?  Well, no, but he's been out wasted, buddy.  So Zuck kind of has- he's kind of out of the limelight.  He only wasted $25 billion.  Other people have wasted a lot more.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We don't know because Apple's very secret of how much they might have spent on this.  Your headline last month, Harry, was how Apple's headset  could be a $3,000 flop and a success.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I thought way, way back to the early 1980s  when Apple released the LeaseHuff, which was a $10,000 computer-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Very expensive flop.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  Which only lasted for a few years and is remembered as a flop,  but it was also a milestone along the way to the Mac.  And even the Mac, when it came out, did not sell anywhere near as well  as they expected.  But on the other hand, the Mac is still around and is an enormous business.  And I feel like we need to give the LeaseHuff a little bit of credit  for helping to jumpstart that process.  That's a really good point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And more recently, you could even say the Apple Watch in its first few iterations  was not a compelling product.  It took a while.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  I mean, even the iPhone, if you look at the earliest coverage of the iPhone after it came out,  people were not entirely sure whether the iPhone, as innovative as it was,  was going to be a success.  Very interesting.  I think it's quite possible.  We'll just take years before we know whether this Apple headset was worth it or not.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  That may be an important thing.  You can have sleeper hits.  And the problem is, is in our culture, we don't have good ways of appreciating  and measuring sleeper hits.  But you can have things like, I'm thinking the movie Clue,  which came out in the theaters and failed.  It's still sleeping as far as I can tell.  Is it there yet now?  No, the movie Clue, people love it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  People watch it because they glued to get- they split the endings  and that just ended up a mess.  But they glued the endings together.  They watch it because it's bad.  No, Clue is good.  Oh, it's good.  Yes. It's got some fantastic performances in it.  Highly recommend it.  I'm going to watch it tonight.  I had no idea.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  Are you trying to go play anything?

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  It has legs, but it failed at the box office, but it was a quality product.  So I think there's certain things where they come and they end up making a difference.  And sometimes they come, they make a difference, but they die,  but something about their legacy lives on.  Like the Lisa.  Yeah.  But sometimes the thing actually comes out and holds on and it doesn't quite hit the,  you're not going to measure it as a success because it's not an astronomical success,  but it can hold on just enough that it can live on for years and decades.  This is critical.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Amy Webb said this last week on the show,  Magic Leap had a vision for something that would take a decade to bring to fruition.  Ahead of their time is a phrase that we use.  Yeah. But the venture cap- the model of venture capital they were using  would never give them that much time so they couldn't make it happen.  Apple on the other hand has, you know, is it almost $3 trillion company with  billions in the bank, many billions in the bank, probably could if it took a decade.  If they were really committed, could make something of this.  I guess my next question though is what would, what makes this a success?  I don't want whatever it is this, even if it were 1500 bucks, I already have one.  What would it, what would it take for Apple's headset to be a success?  Amanda, do you ever do VR gaming?

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a quest to because Meadow was just like trying to like  get them into journalists hands at the time, which is,  it is ethical because you need to have one in order to report on it.  You can't review anything without it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. I, so great news for Mark Zuckerberg, if Mark is out there, hey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I play rec softball and today I overheard people, I was like running onto the field  and as I'm like running, I heard someone talking about their Oculus and I was like,  what? And then I was like, no, don't talk to them.  You are playing softball right now. You're not at work.  But I have one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you don't spend a lot of time in it, I'm guessing.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  I know. I mean, I did for a little bit.  Exactly.  Because when I initially got it, like I like to do physical activity in places that are not  my apartment. But in case you forgot, there was a major international event that made doing things  outside of your apartment temporarily less possible. And the Supernatural app, which the  meta acquisition of within, which makes Supernatural, which is like an exercise app  that was a whole legal situation, but eventually the acquisition got closed. But yeah, Supernatural  was like great. And I really enjoyed using it. I thought it was really fun.  Why'd you stop?  But, oh, I stopped because then the yoga studio near me opened. I was like, cool, I'm going to go  to yoga now and like not be looking at a screen. Because I think that's like one of my big problems  with it is after work, I don't want to be looking at screens. And there's a really big difference  between like playing your switch or having a thing on your head. But I don't know. I mean,  my whole take on all this, which this is like not a particularly intellectual take, I think this is  incredibly obvious, but the idea of playing a video game in VR is really cool. The idea of taking a  work meeting in VR is not. And all of the marketing around how you use these headsets has been  really focused on like going to work and like doing meetings in VR. And I just don't really  think we need to be in a VR meeting. Like you just told us why though. You just told us why,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  because you don't want to, you've been looking at screens all day. You don't want to use it  after work. So Meta probably observed that and said, well, we'll use it for work, but nobody  wants to use it for work either. It's not better. That's the problem. Like, I mean, to some extent,

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  we're talking computer mediated communication, but that could mean anything. Like right now  we're having computer mediated communication and this is fine. I don't need to have a headset and  some 3D graphic rendering of a physical environment. I mean, even if we're not actually  in the physical environment, that doesn't help me. It doesn't enhance the experience. I need to be  able to hear you, maybe be able to see facial recognition and just have a conversation,  have the connection. And I don't see why adding this third dimensional immersive thing,  even if it was rendered well, helps. Like why that's the thing that we're just all desperate for.  Cause we can kind of connect via computers, via flatter technology. And let's not forget that a

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  certain percentage of the population around 11% gets nauseated by wearing these. I think I would

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  be in that. I haven't tried it, but I know I do. And so that's another reason to take it off after

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  a little bit. I have a question too, but I can't get it over my head and over my glasses.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we wear glasses. So Harry, assuming that this is the Lisa,  when will it and what will it look like when it becomes a success?

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  Well, at $3,000, I assume that Apple is not expecting this to be like an enormous consumer  product. It might be something that enough people buy that they learn. They talked about selling a

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  million, which should be a $3 billion. Now they're saying half a million, still a big market.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  So it seems like the price has to come way, way down and there's certainly a lot of reporting  they're working on cheaper versions. I think they couldn't make it cheaper. I think that's the  problem. It also seems like, well, smartphones got more economical once the necessary technologies  scaled up. Even in the first year, the iPhone's price was cut significantly. So that could happen.  I mean, probably the one thing we will learn when they have this WWDC keynote is whether they have  any more of a better vision than Mark Zuckerberg or anybody else for killer apps that do indeed feel  like they could be killer apps because other than supernatural, this whole world is very short on  those things. And if nothing else, Apple is good at kind of figuring out how to not just put  technology out in the world, but kind of figure out the stack of hardware and software and services  that adds up to something compelling. And, you know, are we going to be blown away by it in the  way that people were blown away by the iPhone on day one? That seems unlikely, but it's at least  conceivable that some of the ideas out there will have more clarity after Apple shows them off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think Apple's getting a pass from a lot of us because they have in the past done that.  I'm not convinced that's going to happen this time.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  It's really tough. I mean, I think the bar is higher than it was for the iPhone or the

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Apple Watch in a lot of ways. I mean, I think Apple's got the money that it can spend it,  including on some things that don't work. And quite frankly, that's the point of if you've got all that  cash, it's kind of what you should do. I mean, you don't want to be completely reckless, but on the  other hand, they can afford to take chances and make longer term investments. So more power to them.  Right.  Although if we're going to talk money for things and even smartphones coming down,  I don't understand $1,800 for a foldable pixel. I mean, maybe that's the cost of production,  but I don't understand because even the Samsung can flip and it's expensive at $1,000. Finally,  there's a pixel that's foldable and it folds on the axis that doesn't actually fit in your pocket,  but that's unreachable. And who wants to carry around that much cash value in your pocket?

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  And it has the equivalent of three very large screens because it has a normal large screen and  then something double the size of a large screen. Yeah. The cheaper Samsung is a flip.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's a regular size phone when you open it up. This is more like the Samsung fold. It's the same  price as a Samsung fold. I'm sure. Oh, is it? Yeah. I think Samsung, I'm sure Google looked at  Samsung and said, well, how much can we charge? Oh, 1700 bucks. Okay. But I don't think anybody's  going to buy. I don't know why Google's releasing that. That's, that doesn't make any sense. I mean,

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  they needed to produce something that flipped. I'm waiting for something that's a much better,  like something, cause they got bigger and bigger and bigger. And I was waiting for it to shrink.  And the really good way to shrink it is folded in half. And I'm looking at this. I'm like, oh,  they have a foldable phone. I look at it. I'm like, you're folding it on the wrong axis.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You want the galaxy flip, which I think rumor has it. Samsung will announce the flip four. Is it next  in a couple of months this summer? I guess it's the five because the four is out. This is what  you want. It's cute. See it folds in half. It's the size of a pocket square. Yeah. I mean, I,

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I covet it. I would rather have pixel for various reasons and I still don't want to spend a thousand  dollars on my cell phone. Like I thought a thousand was usurious. And the only thing that'll happen is  new generations will drive down the price of the old ones. But I also don't want an outdated phone  because like some of the other considerations are like the security of the phones and you kind of

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  want something that's, you know, you must be, you must be a con head. A con. You know what I'm  talking about? The TV show succession. Oh, I haven't seen it. Connor Roy says running for president.  I've only seen one season. Well, all you need to know is Connor Roy, who had an interest in politics at a very young age,  is running for president. His slogan is he's fighting against usury and onanism.  So he's at least have 50% in your, in your pocket. And anyway, I'm sorry, I'm bringing up 1980s movies  as my cultural. At least I have a more modern show. All right. Moving on. Actually, Amanda, what is the

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  timeframe for Instagram's, uh, Twitter clone? They said that they're aiming for release this summer. So  we'll see, but that'll be really interesting to keep an eye on. And I will definitely be  writing about it. If that actually comes out this summer, you may think I would be against it because

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not a fan of centralized networks, but if it does in fact support activity pub or the Fediverse,  uh, I would be, I would, I think that's kind of the kind of thing that would be very helpful for  mastodon and other Fediverse, uh, applications. If Firefox is doing a mastodon, uh, they haven't yet  released it, but they're, they're planning to, uh, I think this is good. If they did a Microsoft,

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  old school Microsoft of embrace and extend problems, but on the, but you know, given the,  you know, little bit of details we have now, I think there's a surprising amount of potential  to actually produce something good and useful for the ecosystem. But I will be maybe surprised if  they do manage to produce something good and healthy for the ecosystem and not accidentally  screw everything up for themselves or anybody else. Well, there we have it, ladies and gentlemen,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  VR headsets, AI and Twitter all in one segment. This is a first. We got it all out of the way.  The Supreme court is coming. Yeah, we're done. Good night. Everybody has a bingo card out there.  We covered it all in one segment. We are going to talk more about the Supreme court decision.  There's a lot more to talk about in just a bit. I really like having all three of you here though.  This is great. Thank you, Amanda, for being on the show for the first time ever.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Yeah, thanks for having me on a little screen, which makes me feel like a cyborg, but kind of

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  in a cool way. Well, to be fair, you have the biggest head on the set right now. So that's,

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  yeah, that's okay. You win. Uh, well, yeah, she does just keep paying her compliments.  It'll get bigger. No way. I'm going the other way. Techcrunch.com. She's a culture writer for

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Techcrunch. Of course, Kathy Gellis is here, uh, expert on, uh, uh, many things, but we're going  to talk about the Supreme court decisions, the Andy Warhol decision, and then the, the Tamna,  which is the Twitter decision and the Google decision, all of which came down. Actually,  there was another Supreme court decision that came down this week. Nine, nothing. We could talk about  that. You, this was a good week for you, busy week. It was a weird week. It was a weird couple

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  of days. There was a conference where me, um, and some other people who are in the space were at to  even talk about these cases. Like there was a whole panel, what is going on at the Supreme court? And  basically we found out like 15 minutes before the panel began. So it was actually really interesting  because nobody had to feel everyone felt bad because we really, nobody had had time to read

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  anything. So we thought, I think the general thinking was the Supreme court is going to

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  defer this decision to the very end. We were expecting this to be a late one, but also with  a very different result potentially, but Warhol was a very late decision. And that must have been a

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  gut punch for you. Oh, it was terrible. Yes. I will explain why it was terrible. Yeah. Bad for fair  use. We'll talk about that in just a little bit. Also Harry McCracken, the technologizer. It's great  to have you. Number of people in the chat room said, Twitch over? No, just beginning. Just don't  get your hopes up. Just beginning. Our show today brought to you by Grammarly and something new from  Grammarly, Grammarly Go. First of all, props to Grammarly. They are a Ukraine company. They are,  it's been a very tough time for them, but they make one of the best products out there. And I  love Grammarly for that. They're from Ukraine, but also I love them because they do their core  product in Lisp. I love them for that. And now there's Grammarly Go. Today we're working  in communicating faster than ever, but a lot of times when you're sitting down to that blank page,  it's tough, right? You feel a little stuck. Have you ever had that happen?

You can download it, learn more about Grammarly Go,  G-R-A-M-M-A-R-L-Y, grammarly.com slash go. For me, because I think I'm a good writer,  I love it because I apply it to something I've written already and it cleans up any little,  you know, confusion, not just grammar anymore. Now it's like, well, that was a little confusing.  Let's break that into two sentences, makes it clearer. That's really good at kind of refining  what you write. Or if you're looking at that blank page going, I don't know where to start.  It's a great way to get started and then the juices flow and you can write. Grammarly,  I love it, dot com slash go. Give it a try today. All right. I've been putting it off.  Should I put off a little more and talk about Montana? No, no. Actually, I do want to talk  about Montana because Montana banned TikTok this week. It thinks it did. I mean, first of all,  there's a first, there's a thing called the first amendment, right? There's also the practical

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  implementation of this. How do you even do it? Right. So many states have already said, if you're

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  a state employee, you can't use TikTok on your state provided phone. I don't have a problem with  that. Military do it too. That's fine. You shouldn't be TikToking when you're working anyway.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I think that's harder to say because you get, should AOC not be TikToking? She TikToks as part  of her work. No, it's communication. Yeah. So I think it's less legally fraught to have such a  rule, but it may not actually be good internal policy to have such a rule and possibly also,  therefore, run into some constitutional problems as well. But in theory, state to state, like we're  governing our own property makes a little bit more sense legally. Very hard for one state to say,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  okay, nobody in Montana can use TikTok. I don't even know how, where would you begin? And by the  way, the fine is significant. It's $10,000 per incident. So the first people who would act,  I guess, would be Apple and Google, who would then say, are you in Montana? Well, you can't get the

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  TikTok app on our phone. I mean, one thing that has not happened, although I think there might be  some runway before this actually kicks in, is- January 1st. So, like how many people are there  actually in Montana? Google has done some geo blocking before with stupid local jurisdictional  rules that have tried to govern it in stupid ways. Spain. Spain with turning off the news. So  they might do that. But in the meantime, there's at least one legal challenge that's been filed so

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  far. This is interesting because TikTok decided not to sue on its own behalf, but it's very clear  what they probably did is they went to five Montana TikTok creators and said, you know,  this is going to be a problem, isn't it? So they have TikTok users and creators challenging it.  That's a little, from a first amendment point of view, that's probably more sensible. Yeah.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if TikTok is officially sitting it out, but it's, it did steer a corporate ship  is hard. And there's a lot of considerations that you have to do. I'd like to see companies  be a lot more aggressive and challenge a lot of these state laws, but there's reasons why,  and some not completely unreasonable reasons why they're more cautious in what they do.  I don't know if they necessarily had any conversation with the TikTokers themselves. Maybe  they did. Maybe they didn't. But I looked at it briefly. I mean, one of the things you're  always going to have is, you know, standing questions of, are these people affected in the  way that they would even be able to challenge this? Although I think there's certainly a

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  colorable argument. They five Montana residents who quote, create published view, interact with  and share videos on TikTok. That sounds like standing. I think it gets in the door.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  And first amendment standing is supposed to be more expansive anyway. So that does look like a,  an injury that's likely to be accrued. And that's interesting that they're Montana residents. So  I don't know what will happen to it, but it certainly looks colorable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My feeling is TikTok is watching and if they don't have to sue, they won't. It's interesting.  Netchoice who has sued in other first amendment cases, I think in Texas and Florida is saying  right now we don't have plans to sue. I think everybody's hoping the creators will step forward.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Well, Netchoice is doing a California lawsuit. Netchoice has already filed a lawsuit challenging  the age appropriate design law that California had. And I mean, I think that's a thing of  Netchoice as an entity is showing up kind of, they're a trade association, but they're showing  up and they're actually bringing some of these challenges. And the question is, will the rest of  the industry, you know, back them up on this? Cause I think it's, I think it's absolutely the  right move. Like I think companies end up thinking like, well, can I survive this? But that's too  short term in their thinking because maybe you can survive this particular piece of crap, but you

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  can't survive the whole onslaught. The state of Montana through a spokesperson for the AG  said that they want to use geo-fencing to prevent the use of TikTok in Montana.  Build a wall. That sounds like the great firewall of Montana.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  I mean, it's so interesting too. I mean, like, Kathy, I would be interesting what you would  have to say about this, but like another, like state specific legal issue I've been following  is certain states passing legislation that in order to access certain adult websites,  you need to verify your age, but you're verifying your age through a government app.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  And I think there's pretty, California started Utah then doubled down on it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. And I think maybe UK is about to do. And so it seems like there's just a lot of

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  legislation right now. That's like very state specific regulating how people are using the  internet. And I don't know, I just find that really interesting and kind of scary, but yeah,  I feel like a lot of internet legislation. Is it like trying to regulate interstate commerce?

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  There are so many problems with this. I mean, there's the pure first amendment problem there.  When you start to use the, well, actually the first amendment problem also shows up in a couple  of ways. One of which is, well, the imposition on the platforms and who the platforms can associate  with and how, who they can speak to and what their users and who they can have their users.  So their first amendment rights are breached.  So their first amendments, it's impinging on speakers because it's going to essentially keep  them off the internet and it's impinging particularly on anonymous speakers because you  don't get to speak anonymously if you have to prove yourself to people. It starts to create  privacy problems because now you've collecting all sorts of really private sensitive data.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You might be- It's like you have to go in and get your porn license.  Yeah. And now you've got some fourth amendment problems. You might have some fifth amendment

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  problems. I mean, this is disastrous in every way you can look at it. And it's also like,  there's no way to run an inter commerce railroad like this because you can't,  this is why we have a preemption clause in section 230. It also tends to run straight into  section 230, but that was where section 230 was starting to get weakened by courts who tended to  see a lot more things percolating out of the state as being like, oh no, this isn't preempted. This  isn't preempted. And I think, I think they're wrong. And I think the effect of that is going to be,  you can see the harm of each state doing things because how do you deal with  what Texas wants of internet platforms to do and what California wants, although California is busy  picking the same things that Utah wants. So it's all very confusing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apple and Google have said through a trade group before this was banned, was approved that they  did not think it possible to restrict access to an app to a single state. Like they didn't think

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  there was a technical way to do that. It seems tough. I mean, would we see less of the stuff on  the state level if at the federal level, people have spent less time yapping and more time actually

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  coming up with laws, if any laws make sense? Well, the problem is Congress is busy trying to also  wreck the internet, but better that they wreck it at the federal level than they wreck it at the  state level. It's wrecked for all of us instead of just Montana. I mean, because otherwise there's  always going to be a compliance issue. And what tech companies can't do, what platforms can't do  is respond to one state and also all 50 states, because it's even not only just the 50 states.  If you start to allow state jurisdiction over the internet, then it's state and local and  municipality. And it's like, you can't cabin this in because like Texas could have one rule  and Austin could have another rule and this is not viable. Joe and our discord makes a good point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I don't know historically how long this has been going on, but it seems like lately anyway,  a lot more laws are created as theater, not with any intent of passing any constitutional review  or getting past courts, but just because, well, we said it, so you can trust us. We did the right  thing. It feels like a lot of theatrics. It feels very performative. Yeah. Yeah. I am not sure that

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  sounds almost too benign. I mean, I think there's an aspect- I think it's worse than that. I think  it's worse than that. But what's a little bit confusing is that, so I think from the red states,  I mean, if they're busy banning books, then they're going to have to ban the internet too,  because you haven't effectively like shut down kids' minds unless you take away all the stuff  that they're reading. What boggles the mind though is what's coming out of blue states. I don't  understand what Governor Newsom is thinking in that like he basically produced just a slightly  lighter version of what Utah ended up doing, what Texas ended up doing. And no one said Republicans  had a monopoly on foolishness. It'd be nice if there was a political opposition that actually  wanted to sort of say, wait, the attacks on the constitutional order is a problem. So our political

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  platform will be not to do that. This is why I give money to the EFF. You know, there are a lot of  trade organizations that are trying to do the right thing. Maybe not our members,

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  representative democracy. I think also they don't necessarily understand exactly what will break.  I think that's also the case. I think that's fundamentally true of every regulator that wants  to speak to it, including members of Congress who are kind of like something must be done and just  have no idea that, no, you're going to just make the problem you think you're fixing worse. And  they don't know. And what really bothers me is the ones who refuse to learn. Like, I mean,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I listen to- But you said an interesting phrase, something must be done. That's what's really  going on. We don't know how to do it. We don't know if we can do it, but something must be done.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  I understand that- I feel like we see this happening with the Kids Online Safety Act,  where that was pretty much a direct response to the Facebook whistleblowers and the situation with  all these bombshell articles about Instagram being an agent of depression and eating disorders  and teenage girls. But then it's just like this same, to the point of theatricality,  it's like, yeah, if you say Kids Online Safety Act, no one's going to be like, that's bad. But  then when you think about it and what this would do is like any situation where people are putting  age checks and checking people's actual government identification in order to do anything  on the internet, there are so many really scary implications of that. And no one's arguing against  kids' safety, but the way that these laws play out in practice, you can really tell that the  people that are writing them don't know how the internet works. And to Cathy's point-  It's a bigger problem.  There have been so many, I've watched so many hearings over the last two or so years about  how social media is making everyone depressed. And I think that is something that's worth  talking about, but nothing has even come of these hearings yet other than some proposed  legislations that won't really fix much. These hearings are performing-  And they've had so much time to learn about the internet.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  But they're not learning. Talk about the theatrics. These hearings are performative  where people bring in speakers who can speak to their pre-ordained biases.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or worse, they bring in somebody and then grandstand and don't let them speak.  It's just an opportunity for a member of Congress to go on for his full 10 minutes.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  There's not a whole lot of rigorous inquiry going on here and there's not a whole lot of  interest in rigorous inquiry. And then we get things to be political. I listen to  Senator Blumenthal talking about, I've been trying for years to make changes to 230 and  now will finally be the time. It's like, no, the reason you've not been able to pull that off is  because smart people have managed to stop you because it was a bad idea. It doesn't mean that  the time will come or your good idea will survive. It will still not be a good idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's incidentally co-sponsored with Marsha Blackburn, Dick Blumenthal of the Kids on My Safety Act.  And Josh Hawley.  When you see Marco Rubio's name right next to Amy Klobuchar or Hickenlooper's, it's like, well,  at least there's bipartisan support, I guess.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I have a TechDirt post from January 2001, I think, where it's Dear Section 230 critics when Josh  Hawley and Ted Cruz are your allies and this is time to think again because they know exactly  why they want to get rid of this law and exactly what it'll advance.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why it's bipartisan. They have different agendas,  but the agendas happen to meet in the middle.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  And I listen to that hearing where Josh Hawley is smart and he knows that he's getting political  support from Blumenthal for what he wants. And I can listen to him kind of like, oh yes,  I'm totally doing it to advance that woman's rights issue that you were just speaking of.  And Blumenthal doesn't seem to understand that he's getting played.  Sorry.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  It's all just a series of tubes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Remember that? This is why we're all playing Tears of the Kingdom right now. Right,  Amanda? You're playing Tears of the Kingdom, I bet.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Oh my God. So this is a horrible confession.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mom, I have to play Zelda for my work.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Wait, what's her confession?

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Tell Matthew Panzerino that right now. No, I'm just kidding. But no, I mean,  so I have not finished Breath of the Wild. That is my big confession.  The predecessor.  So I have not started Tears of the Kingdom.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because it's the sequel. It's the same game. I mean, I'm just going to tell you. It's the same  game. Same place. You're still in Hyrule. You're still wandering around. You could play both at

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  the same time. I really should be playing it. I'm not done yet. I don't know. Breath of the Wild,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  just... I'm not done. I'm not done with Animal Crossing New Horizons. I cannot play anything  till I finish my Animal Crossings down. And then... Well, you can't ever finish it.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  Oh, shucks. I never finished games, so I didn't finish  Breath of the Wild. And I am playing Tears of the Kingdom despite that.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I win because I'm not even... I know I'm not even starting here.  You don't even know what we're talking about, probably. Ten million copies sold in three days.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Switch itself is practically at the end of life.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  Sales of new Switches have been disappointing lately. But games for the Switches people already  have are still doing well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And many are saying this is the best game ever made. Ten out of ten in many cases.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  This was also the standard price for Switch games that are like Pokemon or Zelda or big  franchises like that is $60. But this was the first time that they sold a game for $70.  And it's still... I mean, great financial decision for Nintendo. They still sold an

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  insane amount of copies. To put this in perspective, Breath of the Wild...  For the consumer, a little concerning.  The Breath of the Wild only sold 30 million copies in its entire lifetime,  four-year lifetime. Three days, ten million copies on Tears of the Kingdom.  I imagine there'll be people going back and playing Breath of the Wild, too.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I'd just like to note for the record, I had an Atari 800. I played video games then.  I had Pac-Man. I did Caverns of Mars. We had Breakout. I mean, I've got some cram,  but after that, what do I need this for now?

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  All right, let's take a break.  I'm playing those games, too, by the way, on my Atari 800, which I have.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, three Atari people. That's great. That was my first computer was a 400.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  My first console was Nintendo 64.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're an N64. You're a Mario kid. I bet you're gonna play.  Did you go see the Mario movie?

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  When did the Atari 800 came out?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you don't even want to know.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  I have not, but I do want to see it because I have heard that it is good.  I also think it's very funny that Mario and Luigi apparently are canonically from Flat  Bush, Brooklyn, which I'm just very happy to know what neighborhood of Brooklyn they live in.  I really wanted to know, and I found out.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  We played Donkey Kong where it came from.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In an arcade game with sticks.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I think we had one for the Atari, but it wasn't as old as Pac-Man.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It wasn't as good as the arcade version.  Amanda, this came out before you were born.  This is before you were born.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  I literally just fact checked this. It was discontinued before I was born.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Discontinued before you were born.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  That's like a lyric to a song.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  The Atari 800 was discontinued before I was born.  That's gonna write a poem right now.  Yeah.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  The Atari 400 was the first computer I bought with my own money, by the way, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Me too.  Because I was playing a lot of games in the arcade, and I realized all these quarters I've just  dropped, if I bought an Atari 400, I could play Battlezone to my heart's content.  And I still have my 400.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  My friend Benj Edwards, who works for R's Technic, I recently repaired it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so jealous.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  The crummy keyboard stopped working and he swapped in a replacement keyboard.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I think we have an 800, but it had a sticky select key,  so I'm wondering if that can get fixed because I think we still have it.  I bet you can.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm sad.  I long ago got rid of all of those.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, Amanda, you have to be with all these old farts, but that's okay.  That's life.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  No, I mean, I just had a birthday and I'm like, I don't know.  I know I'm young, but it's like every year closer I get to 30, I'm like, what am I doing?  I know.  Like, so I...

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Someday you two can be on a show waxing poetic about video games you played in your youth.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I'll be dead by then.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  I just exploit people to make me feel like I haven't aged.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's good.  You feel young and that's all that matters.  Yes.  Thank you.  I'm very happy to be in this company.  What position do you play in your softball league?

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  I play second base.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Nice.  Oh, that's a good position.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you range the field?  Yep.  Do they still allow the shift in softball?

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  A little bit.  I do tend to shift more closer to up the middle when there's a righty batter,  which is often.  Good job.  Yeah.  You want to get that?  I don't know, but then the lefties, they get me.  Every time.  Yeah.  My team is called the Hometoshin, which for those who don't know is a Jewish cookie,  and I am Jewish, but there are only three Jewish people on the team.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A prune-filled Jewish cookie or poppy seed.  Yeah.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Now that I don't have section 230 to worry about, I can complain about the  new roles in Major League Baseball, which just exorcises me completely.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When you play in the Hometoshin, do you wear tricorn hats to match your?

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  No, but I, yes, the Hometoshin.  I did just get a hat that a Jewish artist made.  It's just a hat that is embroidered and says Hometoshin.  But unfortunately, I debuted it on the field today, and I realized that when I run,  it would fall off.  So I need to do a little bit of testing and hat tightening before our next game.  That's what I'm doing outside of work.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  The aerodynamics of a regular baseball cap are not great,  so I think they're supposed to fall off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Before your time, both of you probably, but the great Willie Mays used to wear a cap that  was one size too big so that when he made a running catch out in the outfield and his cap  flew off, he looked much more dynamic.  He was quite famous for that, actually.  Maybe that's what I'm trying to do.  The famous basket catch.  Let's take a little break.  We'll come back with more with this sports adult group.  But first...

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  That we're not playing the video games anymore.  We're getting out and getting fresh air.  First a word.  I'm doing both.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just open the window.  That's fresh air.  First a word from our sponsor, Noom.  I'm a big Noom fan.  My wife, Lisa, is a big Noom fan.  I started it.  I saw all those TV ads a couple of years ago.  I said, you know, that looks like a good thing.  Actually, you took about 20 of them before I said, that looks like a good thing.  I should try it.  Signed up.  It's not a diet.  I said, I'm going to be doing Noom, Lisa.  And she said, you know what?  I'm going to be a good wife.  I don't need to lose any weight, but I'm going to do it with you.  She has now lost and kept off about 12 pounds.  I lost about 16 and kept it off.  Actually, I think it was closer to 20.  I gained back a few of those, but I'm still 16 pounds down.  But it's not from dieting.  Noom...  These fad diets and health trends come and go.  But Noom is not a fad.  It's not a diet.  It's psychology.  And that's why it works.  Psychology that helps you make intentional, sustainable choices  aligned with your values and your weight loss goals.  So Noom uses well-known established psychological techniques  to help you understand what your eating choices are and why you have cravings.  I, for instance, I'm a fog eater.  I'll sit down.  I come home from work and I'll just start stuffing my face.  I don't even know I ate it.  And afterwards, I don't even know I ate it.  It's a complete fog.  It's unconscious eating.  One of the things Lisa and I do now is we put the fork down in between bites.  We chew.  We don't have the TV on.  We don't have the phone in front of us.  We just take clothes.  Sometimes we close our eyes and taste the food.  It makes such a difference.  It's little things.  So that's mine.  Everybody's journey is different.  Noom will give you daily lessons personalized to your goals, your needs.  They use scientific principles like cognitive behavioral therapy.  So you understand your relationship with food, why you have cravings,  why you can't seem to change what you're doing.  But there's not a diet.  It's nourishing, not restrictive.

All right, we got to talk about the Supreme Court.  I've been putting it off.  It's like dessert.  I've been like putting it off.  It's dessert.  So there were a number of, the Supreme Court, what is it?  Second Tuesday in October, they meet in October, right?  They do the arguments and then they think.  And then the opinions start coming out.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I mean, in theory, they trail at some reasonable amount of time  after you hear the oral argument.  But this one they heard in October and there had been no opinion until May.  And that was an unusually long delay, I think.  Although everything about how this particular  iteration of the court likes to do things is there's past practice and then there's this court.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we won't talk about the shadow docket.  That's a whole other matter entirely.  Do you want to start with, we should, with the Andy Warhol case?

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Well, do you want to do the good news or the bad news first?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's state the facts of the case.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, the Warhol is the all bad news case.  The other stuff on the 230 front was the surprisingly good news case.  Yeah, well, let's start with the bad news first.  All right.  Oh, gosh.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So photographer Lynn Goldsmith in 1981 took picture prints.  Yes.  That's what's on the left if you're watching the video.  Andy Warhol on a commission from...

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Variety, I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I can't remember.  It was a Conde Nast publication.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Conde Nast ended up later and I don't know if...  Later, okay.  It was for Vanity Fair later.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Anyway, they commissioned these 16 silk screen images  clearly taken from the original Lynn Goldsmith photograph.  And the position of Andy Warhol's estate was...  And your position too, right?  You wrote an amicus brief for this one.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  So they...  It got like...  So Andy Warhol made those silk screen adaptations of the Goldsmith photo  while he was alive.  At some point while he was alive and I think he died in 1987.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's hard to make them when you're not alive.  Let's just say that.  I'll stipulate that, Your Honor.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  And that is a fact that is largely overlooked in this decision  and it sort of should matter.  And I don't mean sort of, it should have mattered.  So essentially, they describe briefly the successor and interest to him,  which was he had a foundation, the Andy Warhol Foundation,  I guess basically owns the copyrights in his works.  And he was approached by Conde Nast because Prince now had died  and they wanted to do an article about him.  And they had a choice of like...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When you said he was alive, you didn't mean Andy Warhol, you meant Prince.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Sorry, no. Andy Warhol.  Okay.  I was confused.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought she said Andy Warhol made these prints while he was alive.  You meant while Prince was alive.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  No, Andy Warhol when he was alive made his own works.  He did not make them after he died.  And that makes sense.  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's how it's usually done.  So Prince also was alive then.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Because he made the prints.  It's also confusing because there's Prince.  He made the silk screens.  We'll go with that.  He made the silk screen.  The images.  He made the images and while he was alive and they got published somewhere.  But then...  And everything was okay then.  And everything apparently was okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nobody complained.  Lynn Goldsmith didn't complain.  Nobody complained.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Right.  Then 20 years after Warhol died, Prince now died.  And so Conde Nast wanted to illustrate the article they had on Prince.  And they went to the Andy Warhol Foundation,  which now was the successor in interest for the rights in Andy Warhol's works.  And they said, can we license that?  And the foundation said, great, give us $10,000, I think.  And then Goldsmith found out about this and started to threaten them in some way.  And so the foundation sued for declaratory judgment to say,  well, this should be fair use.  So you shouldn't have a leg to stand on unless you have the court's rule on this now.  And the district court said, you're right.  It's fair use.  Nothing to see here.  And then the Second Circuit undid that.  And a decision that really abandoned what the Supreme Court had said in the Campbell  versus Acuff Rose case, which was the one where Two Live Crew had  Sampled the music.  Saturized the Oh Pretty Woman Roy Orbison's song.  By the way, that word satirizes.  Yeah.  I may actually be saying it wrong whether it's satirize or parody,  but I think it's all dummy either way you slice it.  So I hate to give it that dignity.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If they just used it in the production, that wouldn't be fair use.  But if they were satirizing or parodying it like Weird Al does, that would be fair use.  But only because I, the only reason I say this is because we are always thinking about fair use here.  Only if it parodies the original creator of it.  So you can't use it to make another, a separate.  That's too complicated.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, it's also too hard to figure out what the court just said.  But in theory, the idea is in the statute, it talks about one of the things that  makes things more likely to be fair use is if it's commentary.  And so the interpretation is, okay, if you're commenting on the original,  you got to be able to use the original.  So that's more likely.  It is less clear whether commenting on anything else would be fair use.  And this decision seems to drive a stake through the heart of the idea that you could comment on  anything else using a previously existing work.  But that's going to fall apart in practice and be awfully chilling for anybody who the  expression is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me just, just because we're using this phrase.  I want to explain what it is so people understand what the phrase fair use is.  It is not a law, but it's a, it's a doctrine, right?  It's a, it's a, it's a point of view that says you can in a limited fashion use somebody else's  copyrighted material without permission.  Providing it satisfies one of what is it?

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Part of the law.  It is in the law.  It is in the law.  So before the 19-  17 USC 107.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Before the 1976 act, it was interpreted to be part of the law.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is now in 76.  But they codified it.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  They used a lot of what the judges were, the factors the judges were using to consider  whether something was fair use or not.  And then they baked them into, they baked them into the statute with the 1976 act,  which is basically what we're using now.  And so fair use is there.  It is part of the law and it inherently.  So what's in the law is if you have a copyright, there's some exclusive rights you get as part  of a copyright subject to other limitations, including the ones articulated in, in 107.  And 107 talks about fair use.  So fair use and courts go back and forth with good language or bad language, but that though  in there is a take on this that your copyright is inherently limited by  things that the public can still do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And there's reasons for that because it's in society's interest.  There's two interests, conflicting interests.  The creator of the original work has an interest in protecting their rights so they can sell it.  And, you know, they've made it so they own it.  But society also has a right that it may be reused in other fashion.  I mean, you know, we wouldn't have Cinderella if Grimm's fairy tales didn't create that notion.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Well, the whole point to have copyright at all is we want more stuff.  And so we think we have to protect, protect creators a little bit, protect creators a  little bit so that they will produce the stuff that we need.  But now we've taken the stuff away.  Like, what's the point?  So the question is, what's the tipping point?  What does the law need to do so we do get more stuff?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Society's interest is that, well, we use all of this stuff to create new stuff.  By the way, this is going to become important in artificial intelligence later.  But anyway, this is why it's a big deal.  So Goldsmith's able to take this photo of Prince and have some rights.  In fact, she did license it for 400 bucks to the Vanity Fair originally.  But then they reused it 20 years later when Prince died.  They reused the Andy Warhol things.  And Goldsmith said, you didn't pay for that.  I still have the rights to it.  So the real question was, is this Andy Warhol creation protected by fair use?

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  And the court really botched that.  And I think the reason that they botched it, well, there were a couple.  That's a weird thing why they botched it.  But the big fundamental thing that I think they got wrong, and I've not seen this discussed  in many other quarters, so other people may disagree, but they ended up focusing on  the later license to Conde Nast as the use.  But it wasn't the use of the original.  Fair use applies to the use of the original, which is what Andy Warhol himself did,  I guess in the 1980s when he made the adaptation of the Goldsmith picture.  He used it in a way to say something new about Prince.  And then he goes and he dies and he's dead for 20 years.  And then later, the party that ends up owning the copyrights in his new works  The Andy Warhol Foundation.  Start to use his works.  And they judged fair use based on a use of his work and construed it to be a use of the original.  And I think that burned down an awful lot.  And I think that's a really big deal.  And I think it's a really big deal that will blow up on copyright owners  because they are a copyright owner in his subsequent work.  Sleeping on something that they own, they think is fine.  And later, they go on to actually exploit the copyright in something they think they own.  And then they're going to be called on the carpet to say that the thing you thought you owned  actually turns out, I guess, to be infringing.  And now I think it leaves the question of, well, then are they liable for infringement to Goldsmith?  Does Goldsmith inherently own the Warhol work?  Because even the court leaves the door open to the fact that Warhol himself,  when he made that adaptation, that may have actually been fair use for whatever was  filling his mind about what his motivation was.  This is not a sustainable rubric for understanding these things.  So is the court.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So there's a picture.  Goldsmith owns the rights to that picture.  Andy Warhol makes those...

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  He adapts the picture.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Adapts it.  That's okay, according to the court.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  It could be, according to the court.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because that's transformative.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  As they ran their four factor analysis test, which is the things that the court used to use  that's now in the statute.  As the court did it, it said, well, based on facts that are not present here,  yeah, he still could be considered fair use.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's fair use because it's transformative.  It could be.  They never would.  So Goldsmith sued the Andy Warhol Foundation  over the publishing of these pictures in Vanity Fair.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  The licensing of the Warhol version for Vanity Fair.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Her contention was, well, Andy could make these pictures,  but the Andy Warhol Foundation may not license them.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Apparently, somehow that was different.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  The court agreed.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  And the court agreed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the court isn't saying you can't make transformative works of somebody's photograph,  but you can't license it?

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I mean, it's very strange what the court is doing.  I mean, let's say I think there's a huge fundamental problem with the way the court  ends up viewing the term use and where the fair use is.  Because it's really about the copiers use and this idea that the Warhol Foundation  was somehow the copier when they didn't make the work.  They just ended up owning the rights of the work that Warhol made.  So Warhol is the person who made the use of the original and arguably fairly because he  used it to say something else.  So I think by breaking it down, you break the sustainability of copyright law,  including for copyright holders.  But it was also done.  And the other really toxic thing about this decision is this idea of, well,  how dare you make money from it?  That when they ran the four factor test about commerciality, it really,  it just basically meant that it resulted in if you make a fair use for free,  you're fine.  But if you want to make money from it, you're not fine.  But that matters.  This is what Soto Mayer wrote.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She said, Goldsmith's original photograph of Prince and the Andy Warhol Foundation's  copying use of that photograph in an image,  share substantially the same purpose and the use of is of a commercial nature.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Because it was like, oh, you're just making pictures of Prince to license to a magazine  as if these are both two same things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But Warhol did not make that picture to license to a magazine.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  No.  So somehow his intent 20 years later was not commercial,  is construed to now be the Warhol Foundation.  None of this makes sense temporally.  But the other thing, and actually I need to criticize Kagan,  who wrote a really scathing and correct ascent.  I there's 87 pages of this PDF that got produced by the court.  I did a search for First Amendment and I've also read it.  I don't think the term shows up at all.  And the really important thing about like, what is the goals and purpose of copyright?  We're trying to stimulate the creative, the creation of more of this stuff.  But part of the reason we have fair use is because it is the codification of the First  Amendment interest, because what are we doing with exclusive rights taking away what the public can  do, but essentially impinging on expression.  The First Amendment still exists even in the wake of copyright.  There's other Supreme Court precedent that talks about how fair use is the vindication  of the free expression values that the First Amendment is making sure that Congress doesn't  get to step on.  And they're stepping on it.  Because now all of a sudden, if you want to make subsequent expression that uses something  else that came before, you're going to be in trouble, especially if you want to monetize it.  And there's nothing in the First Amendment that says you don't get to make money off  of your expression, because I'm something you have to, because it's the only way you're  going to keep the lights on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Justice Kagan and Chief Justice John Roberts were the two dissenters.  She said, it will stifle creativity of every sort.  It will impede new art and music and literature.  It will thwart the expression of new ideas and the attainment of new knowledge.  It will make our world poorer.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  That's absolutely right.  And I don't understand why Justice Sotomayor, who normally is one of my favorite justices,  who normally sees things really clearly and all their implications, is so blind to this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it seems to be the difference is this commercial use.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I mean, that seems to be the thing.  The photographer's like, I made a picture and I didn't get to license it the second  time around because there was a second picture that used mine.  So I lost a market opportunity and that was not fair.  And that's basically what the court is like, you're right.  That's one of the four tests, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It doesn't that the derivative work doesn't impinge on your market opportunity.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  It's not the way it's phrased.  And so that's part of the problem.  This case was like, what are the four factors say and what do they end up meaning?  Because the effect on the commercial market of the original work matters for the inquiry.  But the degree is supposed to matter is, as Kagan pointed out and the foundation would point out,  it's not supposed to eat the whole.  Because the first factor is about did it was a transformative?  Did it bring something new to the table?  A new message.  And what Kagan is screaming at Sotomayor about is like, of course, it brought something new.  So when Conde Nast had a choice about what image to run to illustrate the story,  they wanted the new one.  They didn't want the photo.  Because they say different things.  They illustrate prints, the art, the artist in a very different way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is the case that the first test, and this is from 17 USC 107, in determining whether the use  made of a work in any particular case is fair use, the factors to be considered shall include,  doesn't mean limited to, but shall include the purpose and character of the use,  including whether such use is of commercial nature.  I mean, it does say that.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  It does say that.  And what this court has done is interpreted in a way where it just eats the whole and shuts  everything down.  It also makes me wonder what happens to the author of an original work who made it with  no intention to modify it is all of a sudden their copyright weaker than somebody who produced  a work to modify it.  Court doesn't answer that question.  There's a whole lot of like hand waving over some really significant issues that are not  addressed by this court.  I don't know.  How sweeping was this decision?  So we're not entirely sure.  This may be a decision that is so bad, it might end up being a nothing.  No, it is a precedent, but it may end up being so weird that basically like everybody just  ignores it and we carry on with stuff as we did.  So that's one Pollyanna take.  I've seen some of my friends who try to advocate for fair uses and things like that talk about  how, well, it's kind of rested on its facts and it's more narrow that commerciality is  an important thing.  And so that will in theory help a lot of the more nonprofit uses that don't want to get  obliterated by litigation that if you take the money out of the equation, in theory,  this court, this decision doesn't really hurt them.  I just think it makes such a mess out of everything doctrinally that we are all in trouble,  including the copyright holders.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this is kind of like, okay, let's say so Michael Jackson did a song called Bad.  Weird Al Yankovitch did a derivative work of it called Fat, which is fair use.  Actually, he got permission from Michael Jackson.  He tends to get permission.  But that he didn't have to.  That's probably fair use.  Probably he's never litigated it.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  He doesn't litigate it.  He had one song, I think, where he didn't get the permission.  Let's say I played Bad on the show to rather fat on the show to talk about weight loss.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's say I played it in the new mad.  Now it would make sense if Weird Al sued me because that was his song I was using.  But if the Michael Jackson estate sued me saying, well, that derivative work was based on Bad,  so we, you screwed us, but I wasn't using it to illustrate Bad.  I was using to illustrate Fat.  Is this kind of analogous to what we just saw?  And by the way, I'm doing it commercially because I sell ads.  It's for an ad.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I think the upshot to this decision is that could be a problem.  And I don't think that's the way copyrights are supposed to work.  It's a weird problem.  I don't think the court addresses it.  I think the court creates that problem.  And I don't think that's a vector of litigation liability that's necessarily existed before  where we've really had to contend with it.  I mean, we're always in a problem of did you play the song and did that in French on the  copyright based in the song?  But I think what they're basically saying is, yeah, I think that's actually a really  good analogy of what they've just set up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Even the original work has some rights.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  The Michael Jackson copyright holder could come after you for having played a derivative work.  A derivative work.  Because that may have been fair use in that context, but it's not fair use in the context.  Yes, because I'm doing it commercially now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or something.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  And that's going to not help your four factor analysis, but that because you use the derivative  that the copyright holder in the original has some cause of action against you.  That's the same thing that happened just now.  And I don't think it's supposed to work that way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's very interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  I've heard a theory that with this case, there might have been a factor of kind of like  modern art.  My kid could have done that, which kind of informed that.  Well, that's the question is, did they accept that that was a derivative work that Andy Warhol did?  I could go on about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think they did accept that Andy Warhol's work was fair use, right?  That his work itself was fair use.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I think they said it could be.  I mean, and in theory, that wasn't necessarily the facts brought to the case.  They weren't talking about what Warhol did to the original because that wasn't what the  litigation...  Well, it ended up strange.  Somehow, it should have been maybe what the litigation was about, but somehow it ended  up not being what the litigation was out about by the time it ended up at the Supreme Court.  I'm wondering how this happened.  And it seems like the court got so fixated on the four factors and how it wanted to  interpret the commerciality aspect of it that they just got so lost in the four factors that  they lost the forest for the trees in terms of what is actually going on here and what is  the implication.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So unfortunately, what they've done is they've really muddied the whole concept.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I think they've muddied things in a really disastrous way because somebody owns those  weird out copyrights and I don't think they're going to be happy to know that they might be  in trouble based on issues raised by whoever he parodied in the first place.  And I think that's a vector of attack that this decision sets up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's really...

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  I also think it's really interesting to think about how this is going to have implications  in tech because I mean, what's going to happen with all of these like AI Drake voice situations  or I've written about fair use in copyright law a little bit in the context of fan communities.  Like there was a Bridgerton musical and...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's right.  They got shut down.  That was on TikTok.  Yeah.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Yeah.  But that actually...  So I had written about the case when Netflix had sued the people that created the Bridgerton  musical, which was basically just like these two songwriters on TikTok writing songs like  in real time on the app and then they made an album and then the album won a Grammy, I believe.  Yes.  But I think they settled the case because I mean, I might be wrong, but the last time I looked at  it, I think they settled the case. But there are a lot of precedents or there's a lot of like  conversation about this in the context of like fan fiction where Archive of Our Own,  which is like a really big fan fiction website, they literally were like created in tandem with  copyright lawyers to figure out like, how can we protect 16 year olds writing about like whatever  book they're interested in when it's like, like you can't even link to a Venmo or like a coffee  on AO3 because they are so afraid of getting sued.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Netflix settled, which so it really, we don't know what happened and the court never decided,  got to decide on this. Netflix settled. But they were...  And that's a really interesting case.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  And I think similarly with what we were talking about with government officials making  legislation about the internet when they don't really know how the internet works.  I also feel like that happens with art to an extent where like you could write a dissertation  on whether or not this Andy Warhol work is like just copying or if it's an original work.  And I mean, I think it's original.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But the court wasn't really thinking about that. That wasn't really the issue was whether Andy's  work was derivative or not.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  They were thinking about it so focused on the photographer that she took a picture  to be licensed in a magazine. She was putting her product in the to be licensed to a magazine  market space and a magazine comes along, wants a picture of exactly the same thing that she had  taken a picture of. And the court was deeply offended that the subsequent work could somehow  take that market opportunity from her because the court just treated them as equivalents.  And Kagan in the dissent started screaming at the majority of like, they're not equivalent.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a derivative work. And similarly, Netflix said different things.  Netflix loved the the the Bridgerton parody when it was on TikTok.  But it wasn't until they went to the Kimmel Center.  It wasn't until they went to the Kennedy Center and had a paying a ticket price for a paying  concert that Netflix said they said they crossed the line that they had tried to establish with  Barlow and Bear, the creators of the because Netflix has his own Bridgerton experience.  And so in the minds of Bridgerton fans, there was a confusion between the derivative  work and the original work.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  So one other thing that ends up happening in the space is there's other things that can go wrong,  like passing off or rights of publicity issues. Like there's other things that sort of offend  us as like, wait, maybe that isn't the thing that should happen. But it isn't copyright that  solves that problem. It is other legal doctrines and other legal rights that might solve the  problem. And we tend to just throw it all under copyright, let copyright fix it, but it ends up  contorting copyright. So it stops doing what it's supposed to do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We need a public space. We need a public domain at town square where where all ideas go and can be  reworked because that's how creativity happens.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Kagan is pointing out in the dissent that we've really impinged on that.  Like everybody, we already had to look over our shoulder where the joke was fair use is the right  to hire a lawyer. Like there was already a lot of chilling. There is this decision would appear to  produce more chilling. And I'm thinking about, you know, I haven't seen a whole lot of people  make the point that I just made. So stay tuned till next week where we can see if people take  issue with it. But I think it's actually the upshot and that hurts copyright holders.  So even if you buy the idea that copyright holders should have more and stronger rights,  I think it just weakened them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's really an interesting side effect that makes me wonder.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I must be wrong because I can't believe nobody noticed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it was bad enough on the face of it. They didn't even need to dig any deeper. Yeah.  You know, there is an absolute chilling effect. YouTube is very much a part of that.  We are very we can't do a lot of the things that I think are as a news organization are  clearly protected by fair use because we'll get rightly or wrongly. We'll get a DMC take  down on YouTube and then we lose those views. And there's First Amendment implications of it.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  You're trying to do expression that normally the First Amendment should protect. So why does  copyright get to say no to it? And you have to be really careful about what copyright says no to  because of the First Amendment. And that's what fair use is supposed to be there to make sure it

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  doesn't say no to too much. I guess my point is maybe we would win in court. We could probably  defend it. It doesn't matter because it's too late. By then we've already lost any commercial  value to the show. So I the chilling effect is just taking us down for any length of time.  So we don't even dare risk that not because we're worried about court. We might win in court.  Right. You don't want to pay those lawyers. But we can't. Yeah. But well, even if even if I wanted  to pay the lawyers, the value of the show is gone after a few days. So by simply by virtue, yeah,  you have the right to appeal, but by virtue of taking it down and they do, by the way,  content ID takes stuff down immediately because it's automated. And yeah, we can appeal. But if  it's gone for five days, we've lost the value anyway. So this is the problem we're in right now.  And I don't know what the answer is to it except. Well, not this, but the problem is there's a whole

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  lot of people on team give more to the copyright holders, give more to the copyright holders.  I think it's not good for them. I think this case has just created a very real problem for them.  But, you know, the reason that there's people like me and EFF and public knowledge that have  been pointing out, like you have to protect, protect fair use is because ultimately, you know,  there's other people expressing stuff and they need to be able to. And that we've accidentally  untuned copyright law that it's saying no to expression. But the whole point of copyright  law is to incentivize this expression. How are you incentivizing something that you're chilling  with the exact same rules that you're doing? You've got to tune it better or else there's  just no point in having it. So that was the bad news. That was the bad news. Also, I feel like  nobody on the Supreme Court actually read my amicus brief because I made these points very  clearly, very capably, and they didn't show up anywhere. And I'm really alarmed that the words  first amendment did not show up in the 87 pages. Even Justice Kagan and Roberts didn't. Even they  did. And I think it would have helped them possibly win their argument because ultimately they were  kind of talking about the effects, like the first amendment value in terms of the expression was  going to foster. But I think they really needed to doctrinally say this. And we miss Justice  Breyer on the court because he actually understood these issues. And he had written really important  dissents and some earlier for fair earlier copyright decisions at the court where he talked  about the dance that the copyright law needs to do with the first amendment, which interestingly,  Justice Alito signed on to one of them. And now he signed on to the Sotomayor majority. So I don't

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  know what he's thinking these days. There were two other cases, kind of interlinked cases that the  Supreme Court took. We talked a lot about it after oral arguments. Gonzalo, I think you were on with  us after oral arguments, because you were in the court during oral arguments, which must have been  an interesting thing. There were two days in a row. They really were the similar case that for some  reason they separated into two different cases. Similar fact patterns. They were different cases

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  brought by different plaintiffs that had different cases that came out of the Ninth Circuit. So they  had to separate them? Well, they were two separate things. And the Ninth Circuit kind of ruled on  them together. And then when the cert petitions were filed, Gonzales, I think was the one that had  the original cert petition. And then the and then Twitter said, we're going to do a conditional one  where if you grant Gonzales, please do our case too. So Gonzales versus Google and Twitter versus

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Tamina in both cases, a terrorist act. The family of a victim sued the social media trying to hold  them liable for the attacks because social media allowed terrorist organizations to have accounts on  either in the case of YouTube, because Google was YouTube in case of Twitter was Twitter. And that

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  somehow that meant they were liable for. Yeah, it's all a little vaguer than that. And it depended  also on which case but the general thing is terrorists, you terrorists do bad things and  terrorists are also using the internet. So both were built on the theories of internet  is being used by terrorists. So therefore internet must be liable in some way for what

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the terrorists are doing. Historically, and we've celebrated this many times, the internet is protected  by section 230 of the DMCA or the Communications Decency Act. I always get it wrong, the CDA  saying that we're not, you know, we just can't be held liable for that, right? Is this a fit? So now  the Supreme Court, by the way, took the side of section 230. They avoided it, but they avoided

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  it in a way that may actually be better. So they punted. Well, they punted, but they did better  than punting. This was actually sort of, I don't know if I want to say this is absolutely, but best  case scenario is actually a reasonable term that some observers are talking about for those of us

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  who wanted to maintain things. So Tamina was nine to nothing in favor of Twitter. And Google versus

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Gonzales v. Google, I don't remember how it's postured. Basically that one was punted. So that  was the one that when I came on and talked about, because this is when I did the brief and I was in  the courtroom for, was not well litigated. It's funny, I thought it was the Google versus Gonzales

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  that would end up being the, well everybody did. That's the one where we listened to the arguments,  you were in the room. That was the one where they at some point said, well the problem is thumbnails,

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  which was insane. Which was not the thing that they had argued. They changed it. So they did rule on  Tamina, the second case, the Twitter case. The one that was more conditional that only went along for

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the ride. But then said, but based on our ruling in Tamina, there's no underlying cause of action  in Gonzales, so we don't even have to think about it. So a couple of things are happening here.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Leading up to this, everyone was really alarmed that either of these cases were taken because-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it looked like the Supreme Court took them both with an eye towards undermining 230 probably.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Right, because in earlier cases, Justice Thomas and eventually joined by, probably Alito, I forget,  started to get joined by people who were like, we need to take a look at section 230. We need to take  a look at section 230. And in these companion concurrences they were writing, they were  articulating their understanding of section 230 that was alarmingly wrong. So it looked like they  were, that they plucked these cases out and decided to take them because they really wanted  to make amends of section 230. So the internet community was alarmed deeply and did major, major  brief work on both these cases as they went to the Supreme Court. Then, but something weird happened.  So we went into the courtroom for Gonzales v. Google, noticed that there were some significant  issues in how it was being argued by the plaintiffs and that the court was noticing and that they kept  saying like, let me make sure I understand your argument correctly, which is not a good thing you  want to hear from any number of justices. And it looked like, and I think I came on the show and  said it didn't look like they had the appetite to undermine section 230 on these claims.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One of the things that the plaintiffs were arguing against Google was they use algorithms.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Right, the idea was, well, to the extent that we think this is what they were litigating.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They promoted terrorist content through algorithms and that made them publishers, that made them  complicit in the appearance of these videos on YouTube. So section 230 protects a platform for

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  content created by others, to briefly paraphrase it, but it doesn't protect you from the stuff you

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  create yourself. So if you're a publisher, if I publish, you know, if Elon Musk publishes a  tweet, that's different than if I publish a tweet because he's Twitter. Right, he's liable for his

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  own stuff that he publishes, but he's not right for the third party who used his platform to publish it.  So, I mean, then you can litigate over, well, and what this case was litigating over, well,  technically who created it. And so the plaintiff's argument, basically, although it was not well  pled, was if you algorithmically promote something that somebody else created, now you count as the  creator and section 230 doesn't get it. Or if you create a thumbnail. Well, and this was not, this was,  if they wanted to gut 230, this was really not the way to do it. I was listening to the real arguments,  and poor Lisa, I was going, they don't create the thumbnail. I was sitting next to the press  pool and a woman was sitting in the press pool who was like new to these issues. And I could hear her  under her breath being like, but that's the whole argument and stuff like that. Like everybody was

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  screaming at it. So what's interesting is, and it was justice Thomas who wrote this opinion.  He actually said, no, no, no algorithmic algorithm is everywhere. It's not publishing.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  So that was in the Tamna case. So with the Google versus Garcia,  they basically punted it because they basically looked at it and said, we did Tamna, but they,  they hung their hat on Tamna. So Tamna wasn't really dealing with section 230 altogether.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, this is interesting. Do you think they did that so they wouldn't, that this wouldn't apply

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  to 230? We are really baffled because this is why we think it's the best case scenario, because  it's getting really hard to litigate 230 since so many people don't like it or misunderstand it.  What he ended up saying was basically like, look, if you had no 230, would there be a claim anyway?  Because essentially it was a, it's a concept of secondary liability. Is it aiding and abetting?  Is it aiding and abetting? And the secondary liability is basically like, you know,  if you do something, you're responsible for it. But am I somehow responsible for the thing you did

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  as a, when you're the one who did it? Or this is your show, so it would be the other way around.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Are you liable for something I say right now because it's your show?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mike Masnick says that actually in his opinion, Justice Thomas gave the best argument in favor of

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  230 without mentioning 230. Right, because basically 230 basically doesn't really change that. But if  there's no secondary liability, then there'd be no liability anyway. Maybe that didn't come out clear,  but basically there would be no cause of action. Because you couldn't have been liable in the first  place because you weren't the actor. It's not being pled that you were the actor. It's being  pled that somehow there's a cause of action against you as for secondary liability for  something somebody else did. And he said, this statute doesn't reach that because that's not  what aiding and abetting could possibly mean. In which case you still need section 230 because  it helps dispense with the litigation early. But actually it kind of looks like with this,  on a regular motion to dismiss, you could actually get rid of it because there's no cause of action  for aiding and abetting for something that ISIS happens to use the platform for. And the language  Thomas used to talk about the algorithms as infrastructure is that without something a lot  more than what a platform being a platform is not enough to create secondary liability.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The fact that Twitter exists and that these tweets were on Twitter, it does not mean Twitter aided

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  and abetted these terrorists. Yeah, he's kind of like, maybe there's some hypothetical things out  there, but you got to plead an awful lot more before you can start construing that the way tort  liability works, that you could have culpability on somebody who was not the direct actor.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this was the correct decision. It was a very good decision. We all agree about it. And nine

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  to nothing. So we don't have to worry about that. It was a Thomas decision. It was very clear.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But because it doesn't really mention 230, does it help strengthen 230? It does in a way. And I

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  think this is something that Maznaik is getting to. It doesn't weaken it. It doesn't weaken it. And  what it kind of says is, you know, well, all right, so we talked about Senator Blumenthal  before he's since tweeted of, well, since the courts aren't going to give us a relief, we have  to go to Congress. But basically, so in some sense, it pokes the hive of people who hate Section 230  because they didn't, the court didn't blow it up for them. But what it basically did is it kind of  painted the picture of like, why we don't have the liability, like not as a Section 230 doing the  internet as a favor, but just as a matter of law as it's been for hundreds of years, we don't have  liability that works like this. And I was reading it today and I almost think that, you know, Mike's  piece is where he summarizes is good. I think it's even better than Mike says, because Mike's  thinking about in the Section 230 context, I'm thinking about it as American law does not bend  like this. And it shouldn't bend like this because this whole idea of what we've been developing to  of my brother's keeper that like, third parties are responsible for something somebody else does,  we traditionally have allowed it, but only in narrow circumstances, because it doesn't feel fair  to be responsible for something somebody else did. And this was a big pushback on that trend in the  law to say, you know, the direct actor, totally liable, but non direct actors, you've got to be  really careful. And that's the way the law has always been. And this was a somewhat scholarly,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I got the impression somewhat scholarly opinion. It was nice. I mean, Thomas like looked at what  debating and abetting means in common law and so forth and really said the right things and did

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  the right thing. There might be some credible criticism, but the first blanch reading it was,  I am going to enjoy using that decision in my advocacy. So good news. Good news. Surprisingly  good news. And it doesn't matter that they punted Google. No, I mean, I think it had to happen. And  it was probably just as well for everybody. It was badly argued, the plaintiffs argued it.  The court couldn't blow up 230 on that particular case. But I think what Mike's point is, is that  the TAMNA case basically, because then they use the TAMNA case to say that that's what they use  to get rid of the Google case to say that, you know, even if they had played correctly,  you still wouldn't have had any underlying liability here. So the internet survived.  And that's why we can have all of our nice social media platforms.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. Thank you. This is Kathy. You wrote the brief for Google versus

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Gonzalez versus Google. I wrote one there. And I also wrote an amicus brief, as I said,  in the Warhol case, which I don't, they didn't read that one. Yeah. But I imagine you made somewhat

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  of the same 230 arguments in Gonzalez versus Google. Yes. Oh, my typical ones of it's good.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  And one of the signatories on it was an individual who hosts his own mastodon server,  because if he's going to do that for his friends, where you can see the expressive rights and stuff,  230 works for him. And I really want to make sure that people understood that 230 is not  just for big companies, that it's the boots on the ground to make sure, especially if you don't like  the big companies and that you have choices, that you need 230 to make sure other people out there

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  can create those choices. It was my point exactly, because as somebody else who runs a mastodon  server and IRC and a discord chat, it's the little people who could really, I mean, I can't afford  to defend myself. 230 protects us. Google can afford to defend itself. It did all the way to  the Supreme Court, Twitter, all the way to the Supreme Court. I'm not quite sure they paid those  lawyers at the end. I'm really curious to know. But I believe me, I couldn't. And so that is really  important. Otherwise, we wouldn't have a forum. We wouldn't have an IRC. We wouldn't have a mastodon  because it would be too risky. So it's a good thing. Yep. That was close. Oh, it totally was.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I'm having a weird weekend because I'm very happy and very unhappy. But the very happy part is we

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  can breathe a little bit. Yeah. Fair use lost section 231. That's the just skip the whole last  half hour. That's all you need to know. Right? Now you know why. Fair use lost, the internet won.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  To the extent that it doesn't rely on fair use. Good luck with that. Oh God. No, Kathy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're going to take a little break. Well, we have more to talk about our show today brought to you  by Duo. I know you must know the name Duo. I know the name Duo for a long time. We've used Duo to  protect against breaches with a leading access management suite, strong multi-layered defenses,  innovative capabilities only allow legitimate users in to your network or your site  or your app and keep bad actors out. For any organization concerned about being breached  that needs protection fast, Duo quickly enables strong security while also improving user  productivity. So many companies use Duo for that very reason. It's kind of a no-brainer. You just  turn it on and you're safe. Duo prevents unauthorized access with multi-layered defenses  and modern capabilities that thwart sophisticated malicious access attempts. We did a panel with  Wendy Nather, who was a CISO at Duo. And you know, I was so impressed by her and the Duo team. They're  so smart. They know what they're doing. This is a rock solid solution that increases authentication  requirements in real time as the risk rises. Isn't that awesome? So if things are getting problematic,  Duo turns it on, turns it up to high. Duo enables high productivity by only requiring authentication  when needed. See, it's just in time authentication, which means you get swift, easy and secure access  when it's safe. And they step up the requirements when it's not. Duo provides an all-in-one solution  for strong MFA, passwordless, single sign-on and trusted endpoint verification. I think we all know  this is very important now. Duo helps you implement zero trust principles by verifying users  and their devices before they can touch your assets. Start your free trial. Sign up today.  Sign up.duo.com. We're really, this is I think their first ad. We're really thrilled to have them on  Twitter. I've been a Duo fan for years. Sign up.duo.com. Duo, D-U-O, Duo. Sign up.duo.com.  Thank you, Duo, for all you do. We really appreciate it. And thank you, Twitter listeners,  for using that special address so they know you saw it here, right? Right. Google did reach a  privacy settlement with Washington State. This is, you know, to me, this is just the  tip of the iceberg. You may remember Google had settings to turn off their location tracking.  Oh, but look, it didn't do anything. It still tracked you. And the state of Washington sued,  saying Alphabet, well, Google's division of Alphabet misled customers about its location  tracking. The settlement resolves claims that Google deceived people into believing,  you see, you foolish person, you believed you were controlling how Google collects and uses  your personal data. They even gave you a switch, but it didn't do anything. A consent decree filed  on Wednesday requires Google to be more transparent about its tracking practices and provide a more  detailed location technologies webpage describing them and finds Google $39.9 million, which is  like the interest on one day revenue. I mean, it's not, is this enough? How important is this? I  wonder why it's only Washington State. Arizona got an $85 million settlement with Google also.  Feels like this should be something the feds should be. You get another place where the states

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  are doing stuff that the hard work better done on the federal level. Yeah. I'm surprised. I guess

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Lena Conn's worried about other stuff, but I'm surprised the FTC didn't weigh in on this one  as well. But that's a good, that's a good thing. Yeah. And $39.9 million. Who cares?  It's a cost of doing business for Google, right? Interesting article in TechCrunch. I've heard of  them, Amanda. The, yeah, this is your colleague. I think I know them, right? Yeah. I think I know  who they are. It's on your check. I think your colleague, Adam. Actually, it actually, all my  checks is Yahoo, but oh, God, that's right. I forgot. Yeah. A Yahoo company. Adam Kovacevich.  I hope I'm saying his name right. Kovacevich. Adam K we call them. The government can't seize  your data, but it can buy it. Similar story. The Biden administration proposed new protections  earlier this month to prevent law enforcement from demanding reproductive healthcare data  from companies like Twitter and Google, but they don't really need to because data brokers have  that information. And the US government has been buying that data from private data brokers for  years. In fact, we reported, I think last week about one data broker that won its case.  What was the name of it? Kovacevich or something like that. The court held, the appeals court held  that the government hadn't really shown harm. Oh, well, there's no harm in selling your location  data. But the court, I guess, implied that, well, if you come back FTC with some people who have  been harmed by this, well, then we can talk. Certainly a big issue in privacy. I think we  need a law regulating data brokers, frankly. It's such a shadowy business. Yeah. They're out there.  They're collecting that data and then they just sell it to whoever wants it. That's why a ban  against TikTok seems so silly because TikTok isn't the problem. The Chinese government can  just go to these data brokers and get anything they want about anybody they want. It's not

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  defining problems that you're throwing legislation at, which really needs to stop because it's going  to break more things and this isn't going to fix anything. Thank you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good article. You wrote, I thought, Harry, I don't know if you heard it yet or not about Apple's  announced new voice feature. This will be in the fall with iOS 17. Later this year and presumably  when the new OS updates come out, maybe. But really cool. If you have ALS and as it progresses,  it gets harder and harder to talk. People like Stephen Hawking start using machines that talk  for them, Hawking quite famously. Now Apple is going to allow you to bank your voice.  So if you have early stages ALS, you could bank your voice for the time when you'd have to use  a speech machine and it would sound like you. It comes pretty close from the samples I heard.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  Have you heard it? Yes, I've heard a few samples. They don't sound 100% like that person might.  They have a little bit of the typical stuff you associate with a synthesized voice, but they  don't sound like Siri or Alexa or the Google Assistant. They sound like a specific human  being, which is to a lot of these people who might face this really important. They would  much rather express themselves with their own voice. And that was the goal here. And there have  been ways to do this for a long time, but historically it could involve a lot of training,  which if you have ALS becomes even more of a challenge. It used to be quite expensive.  It's gotten cheaper. But what Apple is doing is the next step in terms of making it completely  accessible because it will be available on this device, which a lot of people have. And  people will be able to do the voice banking on an iPhone, an iPad or a Mac. I don't know. I presume

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apple's doing this internally. There are companies that do this already. I played with something  from a company called Acapella and I had to read 215 phrases. It took me about half an hour.  And then it made my voice. And now I don't have ALS, but if I ever needed it, but it's kind of  cool anyway. This is an example of my voice. Let's see, make sure you have my sound, right?  This is my voice. Oh, it's not coming out of the doohickey. Let me play it again.  Harry, can you get me a can of soda? This kind of sounds like me.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  From what I've heard of Apple's-  It's better?  If you did this with Apple's version, it would sound quite a bit more like you.  Apple's takes 15 minutes of training, by the way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A lot faster. Yeah. I am not surprised.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  So you need to package that up so you can be the voice that people can put on their  car directions.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, actually I did that back when, back in the day. Tom, was it TomTom? I think TomTom  allowed you to record your voice. And now actually I have a Waze voice. It's me. In fact,  I hadn't used Waze in a while.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I think this needs to be a TwitTV subscription benefit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I could put it in the club Twit. I hadn't used it in a while. I recorded this maybe  five or six years ago. And we were worried about traffic, so I turned on Waze and it  said, turn left at the next, and it was me. And I said, that sounds like me, Lisa. And  she said, it is you, you nitwit.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  Speaking of that sort of thing, I've heard some people who have been concerned that  Apple's technology could be used for nefarious purposes.  Could it?  Such as stealing somebody else's voice. I think they have done a lot of thinking about  that. And there are a bunch of existing services, which even though Apple's is not  available yet now, people are already using for questionable purposes. With Apple's,  the person who wants to do this has to do the training using these random...  Is it on your phone? Does it stay on the phone?  In fact, you can just leave it on the phone if you want, and it never gets uploaded to  the cloud at all. Probably the single most interesting thing Apple has done  technologically is they've crunched this down into a form where the crunching of your  voice can be done on the device. You can upload it to iCloud, which you probably would want  to do, because when you're doing this, it would be for later use, possibly using devices  you don't own yet. But even on iCloud, it's encrypted. And I think it does seem like it  would be tough for somebody to essentially steal your voice using this technology. It  really does seem like it's under the control of the person who is banking their voice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Using Apple stuff, because you have to read specific phrases, they're random. So you  couldn't take all the recordings of me, for instance, and do this.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  You couldn't do that. It seems like it would be extremely difficult to impossible to record  Leo's voice and then train it and create a Leo voice without Leo being aware you were  doing that, which is certainly a reasonable thing to be concerned about with some of these

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  technologies. There are AI companies, 11 Labs is one that will do this from arbitrary samples.  But in order for us to do this, Anthony had to come in and have me read a statement, said,  I am Leo Laporte, and I give permission for this to be done. But now he's got my voice,  and he's doing all sorts of stuff with I think our promos have synthesized voice.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That was Descripts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that was who?  Descripts.  Descripts. Does 11 AI ask? No, 11 AI says just give me some samples.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they say like you assume responsibility for like-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's all on you if something goes wrong. But any bad actor could then make my voice, right?  Yeah.  See, I worry. I guess I shouldn't. I've told though, as a result, all my family and friends,  we need a secret word. If I call you saying I've been kidnapped, please send a million dollars  ransom to this address, I need to have the secret word.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  That's stuff like that is already happening based on technology.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Larry Maggott almost got suckered by somebody pretending to be his wife.  He wrote the story on his website. Yeah, I feel very nervous. And anybody who's in the public  domain or for some reason or other, even you guys, just because you're on this show,  there's enough samples of your voices now. Sorry. Tell your loved ones-

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I should have a lot more fame and fortune as a consequence of this for the amount of risk it's

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I agree. We're going to have to start paying people a lot more to come on the show.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Yeah. The problem with journalism is-  You're in the public eye, but you make no money. Yeah. Yeah. I've said that for a long time. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not good. So CNET is unionizing, by the way, because of Red Ventures using AI to write  their articles. Has this been an issue at TechCrunch at all, Amanda?

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  No, we're not using generative AI in our articles, but yeah, I think this was a really interesting  story. I actually think that CNET was starting to unionize before all the AI stuff happened,  but I think there's a really clear connection between this and then the WGA writer's strike  in Hollywood where in that strike, basically AI wasn't really at the forefront, but they just  threw in something being like, hey, by the way, we don't want you to replace us with AI or ask us  to edit scripts that were written with AI and whatnot, which is also a legal issue, which-  That's completely legit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There was concern, for instance, that, well, how many years? There's 30 years of Simpson's  episodes that if you fed all of those scripts into an AI, could it write a credible Simpson's  episode? Writers were very concerned about that.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  It can write something that looks like a Simpson's episode, but I don't think it's going to be

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  good. Yeah, we saw the Seinfeld that was horrible.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  I wrote about the- Yeah, nothing forever.  Oh, it's terrible. That was what it was called.  Nothing forever. Yeah, I mean, it was literally just like Jerry Seinfeld being like-  It's random.  There's a new restaurant and then Elaine being like, what kind of restaurant is it?  Which it is the show about nothing, but this was really the show about nothing.  For those who don't know, we're talking about there was a Twitch phenomenon where it was  a generative AI Seinfeld animated copy that just went on forever, but-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It got shut down because it eventually, as all AI does, became racist, right? That's  what always happens. Twitch ended up taking it down.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  What happened with them was I think they were using a version of OpenAI.  They were using a version of the OpenAI software that had gates to prevent it from saying things  that could be offensive, but then I think that broke and their failsafe was to use  a non-gated version of that. Then Jerry and his standup set just went and had to say transphobic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is nothing forever and infinitely generated.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, sorry. Somebody else talking over it. I wanted to play a little bit of it,  but motherboards got a narration on top of it. Yeah, we can't play it anymore. They're gone.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Wisely. Wisely so. I'm going to say something. I think they're actually back on Twitch now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, are they? Oh boy. Yeah, because they were only banned for two weeks,  but then I thought they got the good common sense that this isn't worth fighting over.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  I don't know. I was subscribed to them when I was writing about them, but I haven't looked at it  in a while, but I'm still getting the emails like they're live on Twitch and then I just  haven't checked in, but maybe I need to see what they're up to.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, let's see. Do they have any shows scheduled? No, no shows.  It's not the right channel? Oh, okay. Well, it's like watch me forever is their URL.  Watch me forever. Not nothing forever. Okay. They're called.  Well, nothing forever is the name of the show, but watch me forever is the channel.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  It's very confusing. Inconsistent branding.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a problem. Oh yeah. I've been to watch me forever because it immediately,  oh, it looks like it's still doing it. There's an ad on it right now.  Yeah. Well, very interesting.  I am a contrarian on AI by the way. I don't know. I'll let you guys yell at me for this,  but I say my thought is computers are not intelligent. They do not think they never  have and they never will. They're just a box of rocks that calculate so fast. It appears to be  thinking. We don't have to worry about AI becoming dangerous because it's not intelligent. It's just  stupid words that it's stringing together. It doesn't even know what it's saying and it is  harmless. It's just, and people, especially the media are playing it up as if it's going to be  the next, you know, Oh God, it's the Terminator at Skynet and it's not, it's never going to be

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  because it doesn't think. I agree. The problem is the people deploying it are also kind of stupid  and they're going to deploy it in some really dumb ways because they think it does more than

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  it actually does. Well, that is a risk because it's often wrong. Right. Well, I think that's,

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I think you're absolutely right on what it is and what its limitations are.  It doesn't mean that there's not some externalities we shouldn't be alarmed at, but I think again,  it's like there's the policy panic of people are getting alarmed at the wrong things because they  don't understand that they're gunning after it as if it's this magic that needs to be boxed up. But

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  that's not the problem. I'll take, I'll go another step because of course Sam Altman, the CEO of  OpenAI testified in front of Congress and said, yes, you should regulate us. And it's my opinion  that all of these people who are building up the danger, including Sam Altman of AI, yes,  we need to be regulated. This is, this is them pretending that what they're doing  is somehow intelligent and oh, we better watch out. It's self-serving. They want you to think  they're doing something more than they're doing. It's just fancy software. Altman knows very well.  It's not dangerous. It's not going to do anything. And it doesn't need to be regulated

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  any more than a license to be regulated. To bring it back to the CNET staff trying to unionize,  I think like that's an example of Cathy's point about how it's not necessarily the technology.  It's the people using it that are using it in questionable ways. But like CNET was trying to  publish news articles written with ChatGBT and then of course there were a bunch of inaccuracies.  They were crap. They got beat by that, right? Yeah, they were bad. They weren't true.  But the fact that CNET even was like, this is a good idea. We're going to do this. People are  using this stuff in ways that are so like, I'm more afraid of the people that are using AI.  And then, I mean, the same thing is also happening with the WGA strike where,  like, yes, you could feasibly put in 30 years of Simpsons episodes and make a Simpsons episode,  but like, it's just going to be like Lisa plays clarinet and then Mark skateboards.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's going to be like that Seinfeld. It's not going to be good.  Yeah. So are the writers-

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  That doesn't mean that like, I mean, but yet still like that was in the contract that the  screenwriters were trying to like protect themselves with. And then the studios were like,  no, we're not going to commit to not using generative AI.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and to make your point, CNET fired a bunch of writers because presumably Red Ventures thought,  well, why are we paying humans to write this crap? I think Buzzfeed did too.  Yeah. Buzzfeed News went out of business and VICE has declared bankruptcy. So I understand they might  want to use AI, but this isn't a path to success. You need people like Carrie to write this stuff.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  On the other hand, Leo, I'm not going to tell you you're wrong about this, but I sometimes  lately wondered if I'm just a box of rocks that's good at stringing together words.  And maybe that's true of all of us. And certainly this technology is going to get at least somewhat  better in the years to come. If it continues at the same pace it has over the last six months,  it may get much better, much more quickly. And as with, I mean,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  here's my thing. I have a, maybe this is what I'm really saying. I have a belief that no matter how  fast it gets, how much better it gets, it will never equal you. Because I think there is something  different about you than a box of rocks doing very fast calculations. I mean, the best journalism,

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  that's certainly true. I can do things like- Look at self-driving cars. They got better and better

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  and better, but they still run over kids. And they will never not run over kids.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  But so do humans, unfortunately. I can score interviews with interesting people.  I think humans still have interesting takes on things that a computer can't replicate.  But I think that it just raises the bar for journalists. There's an enormous amount of  content out there. That's crap. That's generated by humans. It's terrible.  Yeah. And that stuff is going to be in trouble. That's what's in trouble. I think the same thing  about artists. The very best stuff is generated by humans. I think they're still going to be a  market for, but it scares me a little bit because if all you're doing is putting up a post about what  time the Super Bowl is on, a computer can do that in 15 seconds. Humans should not be doing that.  At least as well as a human can or better. So maybe in an odd way it's encouraging that the  people who are actually doing good stuff have a future and that people who are completely  cynical and just trying to monetize stuff through clicks might be in trouble.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I saw a skeet, I think, the other day who said something like,  I didn't think that the robots would be doing all the art and the humans doing the low-wage  terrible work instead or something like this. This was not the future I was hoping for.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I think that's upside down. I think the robots will be doing all the low-wage stupid.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  It makes more sense ultimately because I think your point is hopefully correct,  which is that humans bring a certain je ne sais quoi that really fancy good software is just not  going to be able to replicate. And at some point the human beings will come to appreciate that  appropriately, designate the grunt work to the robots and keep the cool human stuff for the

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  humans. I actually found a piece of grunt work which I'm going to happily turn over to ChatGPT,  which is when we do a post on Fest Company, there's this SEO field where you have to write a  short piece of summer, a short summary. And actually the goal of the short summary is to  be as boring as possible, but to be stuffed with the relevant keywords. ChatGPT can do that  super quickly. It can do it better than I can. And if I'm not doing it, I can spend more time  actually doing stuff that human beings will see and hopefully appreciate. It makes sense.  Machines should do the writing aimed at machines. And in fact, probably at some point that should  just be like, not even a field, but something which our publishing system does automatically.  We're looking at that. It's machines all the way down. Yeah. We want to use AI to

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  do transcripts, do summaries, do maybe chapter markings. Not supreme court analysis.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  What's that mean? Oh, it'll be like Leo and three bots at some point during the show.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that wouldn't be so bad. Oh, nevermind. Sorry I said that Benito.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  But even still with transcripts, I often am using Otter AI. This is not sponsored.  No, I like Otter. To record interviews. And it's really,  really helpful and it is a lot faster than if I were hand transcribing, but it's still not perfect.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. My contention is that you can get 90% of the way. It's that last 10% that is impossible.  Uh, we've seen this again and again in, uh, in, uh, technology and that's what humans can do.  And I don't, I don't, I'm not mystical. I don't think that, you know, oh, they don't,

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  they'll never have a soul. I think people are alarmed that the acceleration of the technology  is happening quickly in terms of improvements. So people are sort of panicking at the upshot,  both the potential and the upshots. And that panic is we have more time to sort of figure out  how to deal with this, but we don't necessarily have as much time as we thought like five years  ago. And, um, and given that there's a number of people who are like this cool thing I'm going to  deploy in a really sort of socially destructive way is not helping dial down the panic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's a mistake though, to extrapolate. Okay. Look how fast it's growing. Just guess  where it's doesn't mean it's going to suddenly be Einstein. No, but I think we're having a visceral

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  emotional reaction to it as opposed to a clear headed cogent assessment of risks and balance  and rewards and stuff like that, which welcome to tech policy. That's the way it always is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And there is legitimate concern in the area of disinformation because you can create  disinformation at speed now. And so we've got an election coming up in 2024 and the, and the,  the zone's going to be flooded with crap. It's really good at creating bad crap. You don't need  a bunch of Russians in a Russian troll farm to do that anymore. You can just do it with machines.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  And chat GPT can write English a lot more clearly than your Russian troll can probably.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  It'll be grammatical grammatical crap. Yeah. I feel like this is one of those issues in tech  where I feel like the most clear answer I can think of is that I just think I want people to  be really conscious consumers and think about where what their reading is coming from and what  the motivation exactly is. Yes. But like, I really want to say that we should be able to trust  humanity, but it's hard to know if that's true. Well, let's teach all the kids critical thinking

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  skills. Oh, but not without books or social media or take away the internet, but we'll totally have  the next generation ready to like think these things through carefully. Well, then it makes

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  you wonder why do they want to take that stuff away, right? Because they might actually have

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  critical thinking skills and have some dubious responses to some of the policy getting rammed

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  down the throats. It's I'm getting very depressed. Yeah. Well, no, I mean, the good news is we don't  have to take it. I guess I just it makes me angry because I'll go especially it's really bad on  Twitter. All the Bitcoin bros have been replaced now by AI bros every, you know, 15 great things  you can do with chat GPT, 12 ways to make money with chat GPT. And I think the only people making  money are the people who are selling these great ideas to suckers. I don't I think maybe we've

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  oversold the potential of AI. Yeah, the risk is also fascinating is just in terms of like the  cyclicalness of trends in tech. I do think that there is much, much more to AI than crypto. However,  it is really interesting that two years ago, I'm sure that this like the podcast was all about  like what's happening with ETH. And then now in our little document here, I don't think there's  a single crypto story. No ETH stories. It was more than it will be in two years. But also AI  has been powering so much tech for so long. It's just that now with generative AI in particular,  it's much more obvious and people are using chat GPT just like to play around with it and then

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  seeing what this tech is capable of. I mean, there's certain topics that I just tune out.  So I skipped the metaverse, I skipped smart Bitcoin stuff, and I'm generally skipping the AI,  but I'm going to get sucked back into it. Because AI is raising a couple of issues,  some of which is the application of it. But the other is the inputting and the training.  And that keeps ending up hitting the copyright space hard. Partly because there's an intersection  between the two. But I'm a little bit more alarmed because the people who say no, you shouldn't be  able to train your AI on a population of words, I think impacts the right to read. And what does  get me worried is everybody else who's impacting the right to read that we're going to take away  the books, we're going to take away the social media. And I think we need to have a bigger  reckoning of that is an important First Amendment right. And it's an important right for a reason.  And I think we lock things up away from, it's not good to lock the words up from people. But I also  think it's a problem if you lock things up so people can't send their assistant to go read the  books for them, or their robotic assistant to go read the books for them. And I think people need  to think through what they're asking for, especially as a solution for I think we have general,  genuine problems in how we apply it. But that doesn't mean we should forbid the training  because the training implicates completely different policy issues. Once in a while,

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  I will intentionally use these chat bots to try to get them to talk about stuff that I've written  about to see if I can see what I've written in them. And I'd say most of the time,  even if they are kind of reflecting something I did, it's not in a way that I find disturbing  or think should be illegal. I did see one of them, I think, barred the other day, which they did the  kind of thing that if it was a human doing it, you would say that they were either a plagiarist or  flirting with plagiarism because there really were entire blocks of my wording in there with no  attribution. And so it'll be interesting to see. I mean, if that kind of stuff I'm not crazy about,  but it's quite different if me and a dozen other people who wrote about something,  I'll get mishmash together and something gets spat out on the other side that might not exist  in exactly the same way if I hadn't written my piece. That's a creative process. But it's  not entirely dependent on my own personal wording, at least with attribution if you're going to use

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  whole blocks of what I wrote. I'm worried that we're accidentally banning web crawlers.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  Yeah, totally. I mean, this is the new web crawling. And people that used to think web

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  crawling was sketchy. I think it's also really interesting the difference between  how we see generative AI with text versus with images, because I think it's a lot less obvious  in generating a text block to see where it is drawing very specific phrases and ideas  directly from writers. Whereas with art, you can say do this in the style of Van Gogh.  And it's very clearly like, yep, those are those very particular kinds of brushstrokes and whatnot.  Or like, it feels a lot more obvious with visual art. And I don't know what that really,  what are the implications of that. But I find it interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There you see it all the time on Twitter among these new AI bros, the notion that in five years,  films will be made by AI, not filmmakers and not actors and writers.  I just don't think people want that though. No, I don't want that. That's for sure. I don't

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  like that. I mean, I'm worried about people like for people making illustrations for like book  covers or something. It's like, yeah, you can probably ask an AI to make like crappy,  a picture of a bat that's turning into a woman. I don't know what book that is, but there's an  idea. But like, for actual creative works, like, I don't want to see a film that an AI made. And I  think there's a gimmicky interest in it. But historically in art, these gimmicky interests  are only temporary. And I think right now we are in the moment where people think it's fun. If  maybe there was a film made with AI, it would be like, oh, this is interesting. But then  when there's a second movie made using AI, no one will think it's interesting anymore.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I'm not even crazy about movies that are mostly CGI built. And I think with one of the Star Wars,  I think the last Jedi, they made a point to say we did our special effects by going back to modeling.  Oh, interesting. Yeah, there's something about that where they were like, we didn't want it to  be just so computer-y. We wanted it to actually be the old school things where there was some  physical tangibility that still showed through onto the print that people were watching.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How long have we been trying to fight the uncanny valley with computer animation?  And yet I don't think we've yet done computer animation that really is like human, right? Or  have we? Maybe I don't, maybe we haven't, I don't know yet. It's shrunk, but it does not disappear.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  Have you used Horizon Worlds?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But no legs is the giveaway, right? That's the key. All right, so I have asked mid-journey,  Amanda, to give me an image of a bat that is turning into a woman.  And actually it's doing a pretty good job here. Which one do you like? One, two, three, or four?

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  I think four is interesting, but I'm also seeing it like this big on my screen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, well I'm gonna upscale it. I'm gonna make it look a little bit bigger so you can see it.  There it is. How do you like that? See, that's pretty cool. That ain't bad.  It's an Elizabethan bat turning into a woman. That's Victorian.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  We just have to use chat gbt to write a story about a bat turning into a woman.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I could do it. You don't need chat gbt. I could make it up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, exactly. Why bother when chat gbt could do it? I like this one myself.  I think this is like a woodcut. If you put it into chat gbt, it'll just be like,

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  there once was a bat and then suddenly it gained consciousness and now it's a woman and it has to  figure out how to be a person instead of a bat. All right, this is your assignment, Harry. You do

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  it with Bart, I'll do it with chat gbt. All right? What will the prompt be? Let's see. Tell me a  story. In what style should the story be? Do we want it Shakespearean? Do we want it Dickensian?

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  I'm going to try to think of one with my brain that isn't the obvious. I'm going to try to think of

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  a brain. Okay, you two do humans. I'm going to use chat gbt for tell that turning into a story in  the style of Dickens about a bat turning into a woman, right? Okay.  Now I have to point out that I'm using chat gbt for you're using a bard and then we have two humans.  Here's what chat gbt for said in the crowded bustling heart of London, far removed from the  genteel squares and manicured parks of its aristocratic corners. There existed a unique  feature, a sight unseen in such a urban sprawl. It was an old gnarled oak. Wow, we didn't even  mention an oak. Relic of ancient woods long since raised to the ground within the hollow of this  time ravaged tree nestled an inky creature of the night, a bat named Myrtle. Myrtle was no ordinary  bat. Her eyes held a human like lint. Her movements were purposeful and intelligent and she was  inexplicably drawn to the city's glow, especially to its vibrant pulse of humanity. Her fascination  for the world of men was so intense that it bordered on obsession, obsession that would trigger a  metamorphosis of a most fantastical sort. One faithful night, a storm of biblical proportion  rage. This is actually not bad. What do you got Harry? I'll pause. I feel like maybe you should read  that just so we have the same flavor. All right, I'll read it. Give it to me here. It starts with  the biggest cliche in the book. Sure. Here's a story in the style of Dickens about a bat turning  into a woman. It was a dark and stormy night. So that's it. A wind howled and the rain beat  against the windows of the old house. Inside a young woman sat by the fire reading a book. She  was alone and she was scared. Suddenly there was a loud crash. The young woman jumped up and ran to  the window. She saw a bat flying through the storm. The bat flew into the house and landed  on the mantelpiece. The young woman was terrified. She'd never seen a bat before. She didn't know what  to do. The bat looked at the young woman with its big dark eyes. The young woman felt a strange  sensation. She felt like she was being drawn to the bat. Oh, it goes on. This is, I'm actually  more engaged by this story. It's not as well written though, especially the dark and stormy.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  And eventually you learned that this bat was also a woman. Oh. But they, that's kind of the kicker

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  rather than the, by the way. My story ends over many months. Myrtle now known as Miriam  listened to Miss Havisham stories, her tales of lost love and long dead dreams.  Wow. Even as Miriam, she retained the curious observant nature of her bat self, but now had  the power to engage, to influence, to help. She understood the loneliness of human hearts,  the shared plight of all beings, whether they soared in the sky or walked. I think chat GPT-4 wins.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  Well, this has a similar conclusion in general with these things. They often end by talking  about how great something is. If you ask them about a tech journalist, any tech journalist,  they will say this person is incredible and well known and beloved. Oh shoot. I thought that was

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  only me. Sorry, Liam. I'm so disappointed. It is interesting that you chose Charles Dickens for

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  this experiment because according to my Google search is Dickens public domain.  Apparently a lot of the works of Dickens are in the public domain. So yes, it does beg the  question of how much of this is coming from the fact that chat GPT probably is trained on like

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  entire Dickens novels. Oh, good point. All of that would be in there, wouldn't it? Yeah. By the way,

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  it loves you Harry, by the way. Even just like the streets of London is very Dickens.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Please note this information may be outdated as my training only includes data up to September 2021.

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  You can, if you have chat GPT plus, you can turn on the browsing feature in which case it adds more

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  to it. Yeah. I haven't got the plugins yet. All right. I wrote four paragraphs of fiction while  you were talking about things. Let's hear what happens to Myrtle the bat. Oh, it's Myrtle the bat?  No, it doesn't have to be Myrtle. Actually that would make sense, but I didn't name the bat.  It had been such a nice castle, abandoned, spooky and devoid of any humans whatsoever.  Until one day suddenly a ruckus came from down below. Peering down the old stone staircase,  the bat saw boxes and suitcases being piled inside the door. It had at last happened. People had  moved in and the bat quickly realized they had moved into its house. What was it to do with its  home? So invaded the bat side and reached its reluctant conclusion. If you can't beat them,  he said, join them. And so it flew off to the attic where the old potion jars were kept,  knocked off the lid of one holding a bubbling blue solution and dove in head first.  As a gastric pain, as the burn, it felt like was boring into each of its cells. It knew that this  was still the solution. This time tomorrow, I shall be a woman. Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Bat.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I like that. I like that. Amanda, you want to give it a shot or? Yeah. So I was thinking more about

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  conceptually. I did not write anything down. I was riveted by your experiments. I think these  all were very good. Yeah. Yeah. But my idea is turning this into a nonfiction essay project in  which we explore tales from around the world from folklore in which women and animals are connected  and women are turning into animals or vice versa. Or for example, in the story of Circe from Greek  mythology, she's turning men into animals, but she herself is not being turned into an animal.  So yeah, so I'm taking this and doing a nonfiction essay collection about portrayals of women.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can sue all these AIs because you are the one who came up with a woman and turning into a bat.  Oh gosh, no. And this is what Sam Altman thinks about all of this CEO of chat,  or the folks who do chat, GBT OpenAI. I don't know why Reuters decided to use this picture of Sam

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  testifying. We don't have enough moral panicking. We're so scared. I'm scared. He actually,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the pull quote is when they asked him if the artificial intelligence could interfere with  election integrity, he says, I'm nervous about it. So there's a picture of Sam being nervous about  it. Me too, Sam. Please regulate it. It's too good. It's scary. Let's take a little break.  When we come back, final thoughts. You guys are, gosh, I don't know. I have to give a little credit  to both Bart and chat GPT for coming up with some interesting stuff. The human who wrote

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  four paragraphs of original fiction in five minutes was amazing. Gosh, I don't know. They

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  were all quite good. Oh good. I mean, compared favorably to chat. You did a great job, Kathy,  but we're going to go with the computer because it's cheaper. I stand with WGA.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  The writer is going to be a little strike.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  You have no chance of plagiarizing Dickens. So I wonder if I had more time. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  And he's in the public domain. So I can totally do that. Totally clear. It just took a while to

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  physically write the four paragraphs. I actually was impressed with what you did. Okay. Thank you.  It was quite good. We should have a vote chat room. Which story would you want to finish?  Kathy, Bard or chat GPT? Which one? I'm with Kathy. Thank you.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by mint mobile. We love mint mobile.  Been using mint mobile for two, three years now. I can't remember.  I got from it mobile. I bought an iPhone SE. That was 15 bucks a month. And then I got the 15  buck a month plan. Unlimited talk and texts plus five gigabytes a month. It's actually been going  up. It was three when I got it. It's now five. They keep adding more data on the nation's number one  5G network, the largest 5G network in America. This is a great deal. Inflations everywhere.  Prices are going up except at mint mobile. The only thing getting inflated at mint mobile is  the number of gigabytes you can download. $15 a month. What's the secret? They don't have stores.  The first company to sell premium wireless service online only. You save a ton. Plans start at $15 a  month. You can bring your family too. And by the way, families start at two people. So the family  plan is a great deal. And they don't even, you know, they don't have to actually just don't tell  Ryan Reynolds, but they don't even have to be relatives. You can just, your family could be  your friends, right? By going online only eliminating the traditional cost of retail,  mint mobile passes significant savings on to you. They don't even charge you for the sim.  And now they support eSIMs. So if you have a phone that supports eSIMs, it's even easier to switch  to mint mobile. You could port your number over. Happens very quickly. You can bring all your  contacts and apps with you or get a phone from them. All plans again, come with unlimited talk  and text and high speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5G network. Switch to mint mobile,  get premium wireless service starting at just $15 a month. And I know when I say that number,  you probably gloss it over because you think, oh, there's going to be added fees and services.  It's going to cost me 50, 60, 70 bucks. No, that's the other guys. Mint mobile,  $15 a month. That's it. 1515. How much are you paying for your wireless service? Maybe you  ought to think about switching. Get your new wireless plan for just $15 a month and get the  plan shipped to your door for free. Go to mintmobile.com slash twit, mintmobile.com slash  twit. They'll ship it right to your door. Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month.  That's for five gigabytes of data. That's all most people need, but you want more. They've got more.  They even have an unlimited plan. 30 bucks. Mint mobile. How much are you paying right now?  Three times that at least right? Mint mobile.com slash twit. We thank them so much  for supporting our show and you support it when you go to that address.  Mint mobile.com slash twit. We've got a little mini movie we made narrated by the way by my AI  voice on everything that happened this week on twit. Watch pixel phones are gaining a new ringtone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  inspired by Kenny G. Oh my God. I swear you always know when it's Kenny G on the horn.

Transcript:  tech news weekly late yesterday, the news broke that Montana became the first state to officially

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ban TikTok. One expert I talked to, I loved this analogy, compared it to legalizing flying.  You can say now people can fly, but people aren't really built to fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This week in Google. Wemo, don't ever buy their stuff period. If I've ever shown you them, just  say, Stacey, you are wrong. Here's the issue. One, it's actually not that there was a serious  vulnerability, although it is very serious. The researchers was like, this is terrible. We should  tell Belkin Wemo. So they did. And Belkin Wemo said, you're not going to fix it. Security now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If an air tag set of AirPods or find my network accessory is discovered to be unlawfully tracking  a person, law enforcement can request any available information from Apple to support  their investigation. No one appears to care about tag ownership tracking. But I suspect  not many people know or have stopped to wonder. I got a hammer and I got an air tag. Screw that.  I don't want anybody to tweet. You know that we know where your phones are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a good point. Actually, you know, they could track you about a hundred ways to Sunday.  The air tag is not the problem. Hope you enjoyed this week. And by the way, I did kill my air tag.  And that was that. I don't miss it.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Curl up with your metaverse headset.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I could do that. Everything I'm wearing tracks me. I realize there's no point  worrying about your air tag. Everyone knows where you are at all times. NASA has made good  a boo boo, at least a boo boo according to Jeff Bezos. His space company Blue Origin is now going  to be able to make a second human crude lunar lander. NASA chose SpaceX to make the first one  to which Jeff Bezos yelled and screamed and said it was a terrible thing.  I think he might have even sued. But now, now the agency on Friday announced that there's a  $3.4 billion contract coming your way, Jeff, to make a lunar lander for the upcoming Artemis  mission to the moon. The Blue Origin lander will have one uncrewed demonstration mission  ahead of a human crude demo that's set to take place in. I thought this was going to be like  next year, 2029, John. That's like forever. This is currently the plan is for four astronauts to  fly to the it is a Rube Goldberg device. They're going to fly to the Gateway Space Station on NASA's  Space Launch System rocket and the Orion spacecraft. Then they're going to get out,  get into the Blue Origin and they're going to go on the Blue Origin for a week-long trip to the  moon's South Pole. So complicated. SpaceX won a sole contract in 2021. Blue Origin sued and lost  over the decision in 2021. NASA announced in 2022, never mind, we're going to do a second one. So

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  now they got two. It's the 60th anniversary in 2029 of the original landing. Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That means I'm the only person in this room who remembers it. I thought I remembered it

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  watching it in kindergarten in 1969 until somebody pointed out it didn't happen during the day  and I would not have been at school in July. But you're not old enough to remember it, are you?  Well, theoretically, maybe. You were a little kid. I appeared to have been remembering a later

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  landing at least. Yeah, well that counts. I remember getting up middle of the night.  Well, it wasn't quite the middle of the night. It was like 4 a.m. or something in Rhode Island.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I had the Columbia launch originally in kindergarten. That was mine. That's the one

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  that... Well, it fell apart later. When I was in kindergarten, I remember 9-11.  Yeah, okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's see. A D&D streaming TV channel is coming your way. Excited?

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  I love D&D and I am so skeptical of what is going on with Hasbro, who owns Wizards of the Coast,  which owns D&D, trying to make D&D like a Lord of the Rings or a Harry Potter-type franchise,  which this is literally like what Hasbro has said in communications with investors,  that they're trying to make D&D quote-unquote a four-quadrant streaming or a four-quadrant media  property or something. But it's just so weird because there's really not IP with D&D.  What makes D&D fun is what you're doing with your friends and you're creating stories  collaboratively with other people that aren't property of D&D. I don't know. I mean, I'm curious  what's going to happen with this, but I'm also like, damn, they're just really trying to monetize

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  this right now. Well, you can't really blame them. Dungeons and Dragons. I think the part of it is  because of the success of Encounter Party, right? They are huge. One of the top channels on YouTube

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  and Twitch. Yeah, I mean, there's actual play shows like Critical Role and Dimension 20 that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  are hugely successful. Oh, Critical Role. That's who I was thinking of. They're really big, aren't

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  they? They're on Twitch. Yeah. I think in like fall 2021, there was a Twitch data breach where  someone published in order the most profitable channels and Critical Role was making something  like 90 million dollars a year from Twitch alone. 90 million. Fact check me on that because  this is like something I wrote two years ago that I'm remembering. You could lop off a lot

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  of zeros and it would still be an issue. Well, I think one of the reasons Critical Role succeeds  is because they're people and you get into the people, right? You care about the people. They're

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  professional voice actors and improvisers. And they're funny. What is D&D if not voice acting  and improvising? And I don't know. You have activated my trap card, but I don't know. I mean,  speaking of the theme of the legal issues of it all, there was a whole controversy with D&D earlier  this year where there's like a license that allows fans to make content like Critical Role  or content even like, hey, I'm going to write a little module where you can have  a pirate class or something instead of the existing fantasy classes. So what's going on here?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is the dungeon master, this guy here. And then are there teams? Like there's two teams.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  No, I think those are just all the players and they have them staggered like that for

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  screen size. Looks like Hollywood Squares. Yeah. Yeah. I can see why you'd watch this.  Looks more like the match game. But you're not watching the game. You're just watching these  people talk about it, right? It's not like League of Legends where there's something to watch.

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  No, I mean, like the way that you play is like you're quite literally just like using the  structure of these rules that are now open source, that like you're just using these rules as a way  of telling stories with your friends and you're like improvising like at a table with people.  Like when I go to play D&D, like I don't know what story I'm going to tell. That depends on  like what the other people around me are doing. And so it's like compelling in the same way that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  improv is compelling. Right. Right. Well, who knows? Maybe Hasbro has the secret sauce and  they're going to make this something very exciting. I have to say there's real trouble ahead in the  streaming world, but more importantly in the cable world. Cord cutting has hit an all-time high  according to Variety. Pay TV subscriptions, their lowest levels since 1992. You look like a cord

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  cutter, Kathy Gillis. I got cord cut it when I moved because I couldn't have it where I moved  to, but now I'm going to move to someplace where I could have it. But the pricing is like insane.  So at this point I've sort of gotten used to not having the cord. But I mean, I think just  retransmission fees are such an error. Local stations. Well, of everything. And then don't  get me started on the copyright lawsuit that obliterated low cast where now you can't rent  an antenna. Right. I rip that to shreds in a tech dirt post and I will start snarling again  if I start talking about that case, but copyright law shouldn't do it. And it was bad for everybody  because the public has access. These are public airwaves and the public now doesn't have a reliable  way of getting access to what is put on their own public spectrum. And the problem was when we

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  allowed cable or local TV channels to both charge you and run ads, they didn't want to give up  revenue streams. So the idea of ad supported free over the air TV, nope, they didn't want to do that  anymore. They wanted to make sure that you paid fees to them. I still miss low cast. I still miss

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  low cast. I can't participate in cultural events like a Superbowl. I mean, I can't even watch the  ads that advertisers are still paying money to have broadcast to audiences because now the  audience has to pay for the privilege of watching the ad. Pay TV penetration like cable or direct TV

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  is now down to 58% of US households. Big declines for Comcast, for DirecTV, for Dish.  Comcast dropped 614,000 customers in the first quarter alone. I wouldn't, to your assumption,

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I wouldn't be a cord cutter except circumstances cut it and now it just may be too pricing. Now  you're happy. You can't get in. No, I'd like to come back but it's too prohibitively expensive.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, even YouTube TV is like 73 bucks for the base services and that is because of the locals,

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  by the way, I think that's. Yeah, I just, I don't know. I guess in my like adult life, I think at  first I was like, I'm not paying for cable. I'm like, you know, like low paid writing job. And  then now I'm like, I could probably afford it, but I'm just used to not having it. And I'm like,  do I really want to pay an extra $70 a month? Your life is better without it. Well, I don't pay a lot

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  of streamers either. So like I miss when I could sort of like have one easy budgetable price and  get most of what I wanted. And now that reality doesn't really exist, but I don't really want to  pay. I mean, I think I'd rather pay cable than a whole bunch of streamers, but at this point,  the streaming market is economically nonsensical anyway. So I just pay for like a couple of things  that like happen to mean more and it's not worth dumping a whole lot of money into. Have you seen

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Harry McCracken? Have you seen, speaking of streaming the Blackberry movie? I saw it and

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  used it as an excuse to write about how great Blackberry was last week. We were so addicted

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  to it. This is Harry's article and fast company, the triumph. Yes, triumph of Blackberry. Blackberry  is no longer doing a phone, but they do do the operating system for many cars. I mean, yeah,

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  Q and X is actually pretty cool. They just acquired it too late in the game for it to help them make

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  a great phone. Yeah. So the movie, which is based on the book, Losing the Signal,  it's out now or is it about to come? It's out. It's been out for a few weeks. It's not a documentary,

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  right? It's, it's now it's in fact that the first thing you see is a card explaining that it's a  fictionalized version of what happened and they really did not try super hard to be all that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  accurate. And it's in fact kind of cartoony. The trailer's great. I really enjoyed the trailer. Oh

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  good. So this is one to see. I mean, I'm a tech journalist who writes about tech history. So I  personally wanted something that was a little bit more accurate. Right. That said, I'd say it seems  like most of the reviews have been positive and film critics are not going to judge it on whether  they detailed exactly what happened in the 1980s when research and motion was getting started. So  it seems like generally speaking, it has been a crowd pleaser. I don't think people would want

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the truly geeky real story as much. That would have been tough. And in fact, when I wrote about

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  it, my point was kind of that the things that made Blackberry great would not make for a great movie  because it was stuff like, like the fact that they created tactile keyboards, tactile keyboard,  the fact that they had a server that prevented the network from coming down, the fact they cared  about security. And in fact, the movie has a few moments where there are like meetings where they  tried to have people discussing that. And those are the least riveting parts of the movie because  they just don't make for a great drama, even though they do help explain why this thing

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  once upon a time really mattered. It's been in theaters for two weeks, hit 1.7 million last  weekend. We'll see what it does this weekend. That's a second weekend. This will be its third.  Yeah, the trailer was great. And anybody who lives, I had, we all had Blackberry's, right?

Speaker: Harry McCracken
Transcript:  I had a Palm. I did. I was more of a trio person for the most part, personally.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I had a trio, but my, right before the iPhone came out, my, my last phone before the  smartphones were, it was a Blackberry Pearl. When did you have a Blackberry, Amanda? You must've

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  been in eighth grade. No, like literally, I think I was in eighth grade. I think it was because like  my dad had them for work. And then when he got a new one, then that was just like the phone that I  got. So we both were very into Brickbreaker, the Blackberry game. Yep. I love Blackberry. I remember

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  my kids saying, dad, put down the Blackberry, pay attention to us. So that's, that's how I know.  Hey, what fun it's been to get together with all of you. Thank you, Kathy Gellis, for your analysis  of the Supreme Court stuff. Very complicated, but I think you cut through it and explained why it was  important. It clearly was. I'm glad you wrote those amicus briefs. I'm sorry they didn't read  both of them thoroughly, but hey, you know, you're one for two. That's not so bad.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  I'll claim credit for the Google versus Menzelis one. Sure. Say two for three. Okay, sure. Sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Two for three. Yeah. Kathy is of course an author at TechDirt. If you want to hire her,  obviously specializes in IP law, cgcounsel, c-o-u-n-s-e-l.com and on the Mastodon cloud at  Kathy Gellis. Great to see you. First time in studio. Yes. Thank you for coming up here. Yes.  I hope you don't catch COVID. Is it my, my deep fervent wish for you. Oh, thank you.  Thank you. Amanda, you're safe. I think in your, in your apartment. She's got a beautiful  softball. Yeah. Philadelphia. Yeah. Softball. Well, that could be dangerous. Amanda Silberling,  senior culture writer, TechCrunch. First time on. So great to have you. We will have you back again

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  soon. I really appreciate it. Yeah. Thanks for having me and I'll continue to just make jokes  about being younger than you and make everyone feel bad. That's watching, which is what you want.  You won't be the only one. Believe me. This will be me in like however many years I'm going to be  like, Oh God, like your parents weren't alive for nine 11. That's right. That's exactly right. Get

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  ready. It happens sooner than you think. No, it's nice to have somebody on the show. I really,  I really think we need that perspective. I appreciate it. Amanda. It's great to see you.  Harry, my buddy, my friend, the technologizer, find him on fast company. Every time he writes  an article, it's something great, something fantastic. Always. Always. No, I'm serious.  You, you are no chat GPT. You, you really find great topics. You, you know your history.  And it's always, I mean, I just, I read every one of them. Always. Cause I lived that. Damn it.  You lived it. You were there. You were there. I want to read this Blackberry article now. Yeah.  I want to see the movie. I love, I love the trailer. You're watching clue tonight though.  Oh yeah. That's right. Clue or maybe succession, the penultimate episode. You, I envy you because  someday you're going to get a DVD box set of all four seasons and you're going to say,  how did I not know this was the best show on television?

Speaker: Amanda Silberling
Transcript:  No, I mean, I, I've been watching, like I, I've been seeing people talking about it on Twitter  relentlessly for years. And what's funny is actually before I worked at tech crunch, I was like,  I don't get it. Like they're just in business meetings. And then now that I like,  now you understand. Yes. I'm like the stock price dropped below 120 and then they tried doing a

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  hostile takeover. And he offered 192 per share. What is he thinking? No, it's no, it's a great show.  I'm just very behind. Oh, wow. It's getting very exciting. We just last week it was the  presidential election and it was a little too close to home. That always hurts. I think we need more.

Speaker: Cathy Gellis
Transcript:  Historical distance and certainty in our world before this will be comfortable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was very painful. Harry, Kathy, Amanda, thank you so much for being here.  Thanks to all of you for being here. Thanks especially to our club members who make this  show and all of our shows possible. If you're not yet a member, I want to invite you to join  seven bucks a month. You get so much, you get ad free versions of all of our shows, shows we don't  put out in public like Hands on Macintosh, Hands on Windows, Home Theater Geeks, the Untitled Linux  Show. You get so much for your seven bucks a month. And I can't tell you how much that seven  dollars means to us. Only about 1% of our audience has joined the club. I'd like to get that number  up. Would you just check it out please? Twitter.tv slash club Twitter. We'd be very, very grateful  to have you. And if you can't, no problem. It's okay. What? I'm sure you've made this joke,  but it's cheaper than Twitter Blue. It's a dollar less than Twitter Blue and you get so much more.  Actually, I will send all three of you a coupon because we'd like to have you in there on us.  Because that's one of the things that makes Club Twitter really fun. That Discord has a lot of our  hosts in there talking as well. We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon right after Ask the Tech  2pm Pacific, 5pm Eastern Time, 2100 UTC. I say that only because if you want, you can watch us  do it live. If you want the freshest possible version, it's at live.twit.tv. There's streaming  audio and video. Plus, if you are watching live, you can chat with us live in our open to all IRC  chatroom, IRC.twit.tv. Of course, Club Twitter is also talking about it during the show. After the  fact, add supported versions of the show available on our website, twit.tv slash This Week in Tech.  By the way, when you get to that page, you'll see a link to the YouTube channel. There's a dedicated  YouTube channel. You'll also see a link to various podcast players and the RSS feed. The best thing  to do is subscribe in the podcast player of your choice. That way, you'll get it automatically the  minute it's available. That's our IRC channel there. This is the webpage for This Week in Tech.  Thank you, everybody, for being here. I'm going to go home and watch Succession.  Remember, our schedule's changed a little bit this week. Tomorrow, Monday, iOS Today.  What time, John? 9 a.m. So they're the same time, but they're going to move forward today  because we are going to do live coverage of Microsoft's Build Developers Conference. We're  going to cover, we think is going to be important, AI announcements and maybe some hardware  announcements for Microsoft. So we are going to take a chance and cover both keynotes, 9 a.m.  Pacific, 12 noon Eastern on Tuesday and Wednesday. I'll be joined by Richard Campbell on the first,  Richard Campbell and Paul Therout on the second. So I'll be back Tuesday bright and early, 9 a.m.  for the Build keynote.
