Transcript:  Yeah, last week, I think, what was it during game one?  Yeah.  You tweeted that Cody Ross was my boyfriend.  Your new boyfriend.  You were in love with Cody Ross.  Actually, we're engaged now.  Yeah.  I'm glad I sent you guys an engagement present.  I said he's the most hated man in my house right now because of course I'm from Philadelphia,  so this just absolutely chapped my behind.  And then you and I had a friendly wager that if the Phillies were to win, you would end  up wearing a full Phillies regalia on Twitter.  And if I was to win, or vice versa, if you were to win, then I'd wear a full Giants outfit.

You probably were loaded at 3 in the morning.  I was.  That's the only reason you go there.  But try it.  Next time anyone who's watching, go to John's Roast Pork in South Philadelphia.  Tell them I sent you and they won't do anything for you.

Start time: 462.53
End time: 484.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you go in, first of all, you go to John's Roast Pork.  Anything from the grill.  Anybody want anything from the grill?  And if you don't know what you're talking about, if you don't know that a cheesesteak  front comes from a grill and you walk up and you want roast pork, they have the roast pork  ready to go.  You've got to order it either with provolone or you want wit.  If you get wit, which is W-I-T, that means wit, the cheese whiz.  It's Velveeta.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's crap.

Start time: 485.26
End time: 490.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't do the cheese whiz.  But isn't that the real?  That's the way to do it.  That's what I thought.  I thought that was the real thing.

Start time: 490.22
End time: 496.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 512.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The chat room is just like, this is supposed to be a tech show.

Start time: 513.44
End time: 517.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with the chat room.  I'm just saying.  You guys are doing...

Start time: 517.56
End time: 519.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the article says he likes provolone.

Start time: 519.74
End time: 527.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, so, so, so when Joshua joined us before we began recording, he said, I got a bone  to pick with you, Laporte.

Start time: 528.22
End time: 528.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 529.44
End time: 544.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, me and you, buddy, to the mat.  So you did it again.  You did it again.  Look, here's Engadget from just the other day.  MacBook Air, 11.6 inch, first hands-on!  Update video!

Start time: 546.03
End time: 549.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so you had...  Let's just go back.  That's the demo table.

Start time: 549.28
End time: 550.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were all there.  Well, I wasn't.

Start time: 551.48
End time: 559.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So on Windows Weekly, you complained that Engadget was, we're just trying to get page  use by posting hands-on from events.

Start time: 559.81
End time: 561.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not trying to get page views?

Start time: 561.22
End time: 596.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, everything we do tries to get page views because that's how we run our business.  We need people to look at it or else we go away.  But we've been doing hands-on posts from events since the dawn of Engadget, right?  So that's something we do.  Our readers want to see the stuff for real in the hands of a human being out in public,  not on some nice press shot.  So that's the idea of the hands-on.  The first hands-on, that's like our first hands-on.  But, I mean, the idea is, I mean, it's our first encounter with the thing.  But I would argue that there was no one else who had that hands-on up before we did on that day.  So I'm not even...

Start time: 597.94
End time: 600.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, we beat you because we had the live video from...

Start time: 601.64
End time: 605.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you have detailed photos up before we did?  Well, how detailed?

Start time: 605.26
End time: 615.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see.  Let me look.  Is this detailed?  You tell it not to consider them a hands-on.  Detailed.  Well, no.  Did you look at the gap?  Did you look at the gap?  I showed you the video before the...  I'm going to fight with you.

Start time: 615.22
End time: 617.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Steve Jobs.  I didn't see even a device in that video.  So I think...

Start time: 618.40
End time: 635.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I just showed you the Steve Jobs interview.  We actually had a hands-on.  Becky Worley's holding it up, and she's showing it in front of the camera and all that stuff.  We did that live.  So, no, we did beat you.  But we didn't put it on the front page of Twitter with exclamation, we got a...  It's a demo.  Everybody's there.  What's the big deal?

Start time: 635.42
End time: 669.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the big deal is it's not for our pride to say that we had the first hands-on.  The big deal is our readers who aren't there, and that's...  They want to see it.  ...millions of people.  Right.  They want to see what it looks like next to a real MacBook.  They want to know what it looks like next to an iPhone.  They want to see the ports.  They want to see the bottom of it.  They want to see it open and closed.  And that's what we do.  I mean, the idea is we have gadget junkies who are sitting around waiting to get a closer  look at this here.  Look, this is how big it looks compared to a regular MacBook.  So that's the idea of the hands-on.  It's to show the fanatics who are reading our site what this thing actually looks like.

Start time: 669.26
End time: 678.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I stand corrected.  I now understand your nomenclature.  Hands-on means the first time we got our hands on this device.  It doesn't matter where.  It could be a demo event.

Start time: 679.05
End time: 715.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's not a...  We're not trying to be disingenuous at all.  The goal is to show people what the thing is actually like in person, in your hands,  and give them a better idea of this product that they can get from a press shot.  And I gotta say, these are some beautiful pictures I took.  They actually are.  You took these?  These are very nice.  Yeah, I took these.  You don't know.  This is crazy.  This is the most stressful thing in the world at these events is we rush out after jobs  is done and we run to these tables and desperately try to get these photos as quickly as possible  and get them online.  Because there is a certain amount of a race going on because you want to get them...  You want to be the first to get them out there.  Does that make a difference?  I mean, of course we just go by.

Start time: 715.22
End time: 723.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just out of curiosity, does that make a difference if Gizmodo gets...  Like, beats you by 30 seconds?  Is that...  Is it just pride or does it actually make any difference?  I think a long time ago it made a bigger difference.

Start time: 724.38
End time: 774.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think now it's like we know that everybody's going to do the hands-on.  And readers look at a bunch of different sites.  They're not just reading NGadget.  And that's great.  I look at a bunch of different sites too.  So I think it's we're still in the...  Mentally we still think let's get this thing up there as quickly as possible.  But I don't think the race is quite as intense as it used to be.  Though I will say this.  At the...  There was an event that we did...  Oh, the iPad event.  Nick Denton from Gawker bet me on Twitter $1,000 that Giz would get a hands-on faster than us.  And we had ours up first.  And Denton has yet to pay up.  So...  Well, what a surprise there.  He can send me a check for $1,000 whenever he feels ready.  I've asked him but he hasn't paid up.  But that's the last time I actually remember thinking like we got to get this.  Because somebody said while I was live-blogging, they said Denton just challenged you to get photos.  They said Giz is going to get photos before you.

Start time: 774.82
End time: 789.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But doesn't this speak though to the way in which we're getting information?  Now we're all in such information overload.  I mean, and your readers depend on you guys.  And they're not going off to other sources on a regular basis.  I don't know how much...  I don't know if that's true. Is that true?

Start time: 790.21
End time: 802.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think people are not so brand aware.  Do they even know nowadays?  This was Engadget, oh, this was Gizmodo.  They go to the web, they do a search and they end up where they end up.  I have a feeling the brand matters less.

Start time: 802.30
End time: 829.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a certain segment, the hardcore, they have their allegiances or they prefer the way one site does coverage over another.  But then you've got a broader audience. That's the SEO audience, right? The search audience.  The ones you're optimizing for, yeah.  They're hitting Google and they want to see who has coverage of this stuff.  And whatever comes up first or second or third, they're going to go check out.  I think that there is some delineation between the two.  You've got people who are loyalists, right?  It's interesting. I'm looking at our chat room.

Start time: 829.42
End time: 842.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are some people who do go to Engadget first.  And then there's some people who just say, I go wherever. It doesn't really matter.  I think there's some animosity towards Gizmodo because of the iPhone 4 adventure.  There's some people who actually disdain Gizmodo because of that.

Start time: 843.84
End time: 849.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Giz doesn't, now they're not at these events anymore.  They haven't been at the last few.  Oh, so they haven't been invited.

Start time: 849.34
End time: 854.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They haven't been invited. And I heard that right from someone.  You know why I haven't been invited?  They're not coming.

Start time: 854.52
End time: 859.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to check from Nick Denton because I was actually, this is really hands on.

Start time: 859.52
End time: 861.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here we go. Now you beat us.

Start time: 862.16
End time: 868.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I beat you. Absolutely. I beat everybody. But I'm not proud of that.  That wasn't my finest moment.

Start time: 868.80
End time: 880.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But does it matter? That's what I'm saying for Twitter.  You're saying it's about analysis and it's about context.  And that's why I'd come to Twitter.  I don't come to Twitter because I think I'm going to see a first hands on.

Start time: 880.34
End time: 890.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, in fact, I don't think we're in the, I mean, we're obviously not in the ball.  But first of all, we get far fewer views in Engadget or even Gizmodo.  We're not in the same race as those guys. We're not a blog.

Start time: 891.10
End time: 899.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's totally different. I don't think of, I mean, I think of you guys as something.  I mean, I would never think, oh man, does Twitter have this stuff?  Not because you couldn't get it or you're not covering it.

Start time: 899.22
End time: 903.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, in fact, I'm just pointing out in two cases we beat you. But I don't care.  It's not about a race.

Start time: 903.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 928.62
End time: 973.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I have the whole ego thing as well. I want to be the first out with the news.  It's a lot harder for me because I produce video rather than putting up a blog post with some pictures.  I also have a whole blog with a team of bloggers that do that.  And so we are a little bit more into that.  But I think, you know, it's interesting from a video podcaster perspective.  We don't get sourced when we are the first out to market with something, not out to market, but out with the news when we do actually have something that no one else has covered.  So that's a whole other perspective.  But I don't think that there's actually any monetary value to it.

Start time: 976.13
End time: 999.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, monetary value in terms of for a publisher.  Revenue, yeah.  There's obviously value in having it first.  But I think that, you know, with us, we do these huge, like an Apple Day is a huge day for us because people want to see the live blog.  Right. And then they expect this coverage to sort of roll out.  They're there anyway. And they're looking for the rest of the coverage on this stuff.

Start time: 1000.08
End time: 1010.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Isn't it interesting how Apple gets all this attention?  Did you find, Joshua, when the Windows Phone 7 was launched, that there was equal attention and equal interest?

Start time: 1010.42
End time: 1048.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's actually really crazy, to be honest with you.  Google can have a big event.  Microsoft has big events.  Dell, Sony, you know, anybody who's gigantic, they do a big event.  And the numbers are staggering how different the numbers are on a Microsoft event day versus an Apple event day.  It's a really significant difference in readership turnout.  And I don't I don't fully understand it.  I mean, it is it is like Apple has has mesmerized the the gadget community or the industry in some way that is you can't quantify it.  It's just it's it's actually kind of magical.  You cover the mainstream. You cover the mainstream of Clayton.

Start time: 1049.68
End time: 1054.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So do you think that that's reflected in the mainstream audience as well that they care more about Apple than anything else?

Start time: 1054.90
End time: 1072.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, sure. You know, I when I post a story about Windows 7 or we post a story about Apple,  we post something on Fox News dot com or we do it on my on my tech show Gadgets and Games.  I mean, people say, oh, you know, I don't care about the we Josh, you were on a few weeks ago.  We were talking about the end, the end eight.  You know, people, people just, you know, they're not interested in it.

Start time: 1072.72
End time: 1074.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the end eight is not that interesting.

Start time: 1075.34
End time: 1110.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what you're saying is actually the thing that is causing these huge spikes in traffic and this huge interest is that Apple touches the mainstream in a way that a lot of these other companies don't.  You know, Microsoft, everybody knows Microsoft, but for some reason they don't connect with this large sort of casual audience the way Apple does.  You know, Apple has this ability to pull it. You know, my mother or somebody's grandmother is saying, hey, I heard there's going to be a Verizon iPhone or stuff that you would never expect to hear from people who aren't interested in this industry really.  And I think that's part of the that's part of where those numbers come from.

Start time: 1110.32
End time: 1121.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and it's also reflected in the messaging, right? I mean, it's it's there. It's there. It's their advertising campaigns.  I mean, it's, you know, Microsoft's all over the place. And I, you know, trying to understand what they're, you know, I was watching that Microsoft ad.

Start time: 1121.54
End time: 1126.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it ran last night during the game with the people staring at their phones and running into trees and stuff.

Start time: 1127.24
End time: 1162.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I thought something really terrible ad. Yeah.  Something really struck me about that. And I thought, you know what? They're insulting all of us. Yes.  Because how do you sell a phone by and you're basically pointing out, you know, Josh, you talk about this sometimes the aspirational value of Sony, right?  But, you know, Apple really paints that picture for people that sort of aspirational value of things, whether it's FaceTime, their FaceTime commercial, but even so this Microsoft commercial with everyone sort of falling asleep and crashing their car because they're looking at their cell phone.  We all do that. It's a habit we have. So you're basically making fun of someone because they have this band.

Start time: 1162.22
End time: 1171.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't mind that being I I crash into poles.  I mean, I think once I crashed into a pole because Microsoft's message seems odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's saying our phone is not as engaging as there. So you'll be safer.

Start time: 1175.44
End time: 1207.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think what they're trying to say, maybe they're not doing a good job. I actually think those ads are pretty decent, but I think what they're trying to say is they're trying to address an audience that doesn't have a smartphone yet.  And they see people. I actually feel like what they're doing is playing.  They're playing their base really well where they're looking at the people who maybe haven't adopted smartphones yet and are looking at people with iPhones and BlackBerry's and they're constantly doing that.  You know, I'm looking at my scrolling and my thing here and I think the whole idea is to say, I think that premise is off because the value of a smartphone is that it is engaging.

Start time: 1209.50
End time: 1230.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so there are a lot of people who just want to be able to do work when they need to, but have they place a lot more value on their family time or doing things just that they love to do.  There are a huge number of people that are that way. You know, we don't see that from day to day because we're total geeks.

Start time: 1230.60

Start time: 1238.84
End time: 1271.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is not going to be the only path they go down. I think that they're off to a decent start. I think those ads connect with people.  I think a lot of people recognize that. I mean, let's be honest. We live in a, you know, we're an increasingly distracted society, right?  And it is kind of obnoxious that we're all looking at our devices. You know, I go to parties and I go out to dinner with people and it's like groups of people just staring at these phones.  Right. But is that the way to sell a smartphone?  What they're saying is this is the smartphone that will let you, this is their message. I know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they want Angry Birds. I think they want a phone that engages them. And yes, they don't like it. The people are walking into trees. We'd like not to do that.  But we don't want a phone that is not engaging so that it saves us from ourselves. We want a phone that engages us.

Start time: 1293.56
End time: 1320.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need to explain the narrative, right? It's like politics. And it's why certain kids, it's why we're seeing Linda McMahon having trouble right up and down in Connecticut with her messaging her ad campaign.  She's saying the same old thing and her poll numbers have plummeted. And now it looks like Richard Blumenthal is going to take that race.  She's been saying the same thing for two months. Was talking to a pollster about this. So what Apple does is they sort of build a narrative.  Microsoft is going to try to build a narrative. And if you think about building the narrative like the Jerry Seinfeld Bill Gates crap.

Start time: 1320.22
End time: 1323.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was not a narrative. That was just nonsense.

Start time: 1323.22
End time: 1338.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it was. It was. They were trying to build. They never finished it is the problem.  Right. And so Microsoft is trying. Josh, to your point, you know, Microsoft's trying to build this narrative, this story arc.  They're laying the groundwork now that we're all too engaged in our phones. What's the next step? Do we finally then see the phone?

Start time: 1340.68
End time: 1400.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right now they're selling the they're selling the philosophy of Windows Phone 7, which is get in, get out, get back to life.  That's literally their tagline. Right. They're saying that everywhere they can.  So the next step is going to be they're going to show how the product is actually just to do with they had they've been doing this with Bing.  I don't know if you noticed that they had this ad campaign with Bing where they have the information, the search overload ads.  Right. Yeah, that also makes me it looks like a bunch of crazy people. Those ads have been really they've worked really well for them.  People people identify with the idea that they go searching for something and they just get a bunch of crap that they don't want.  And so Bing's saying, look, here's your problem. Here's the the philosophy. Right. Your problem is we've got search overload.  Now they have new ads. I don't know if you've seen them, but they show what Bing does. They show how it works.  They showed us a little music player. It's got this search window that looks like this. It does image search like that.  So I think they're going to follow a very similar path with Windows Phone 7. They're going to say, look, you have a we have a problem.  People are staring at their devices and they're not paying attention to their real life. And these devices are complicated and annoying.  These are the people who are these are the crazy people.

Start time: 1409.22
End time: 1438.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't. But then again, I'm not. I'm not. You're not the target for these ads.  I'm not the smart ship. A smartphone ownership is like 19 percent in America.  OK, that means there is a huge market that they've never touched a smartphone, never played with one, don't know if they want one.  They're thinking about getting it. But so the market is not the 19 percent that has the iPhone and the Nokia or whatever else they've got.  I don't think they have a Nokia, but they've got some Android. It's Blackberry iPhone and Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Android is not a problem. It doesn't even matter. It's fragmented.  But the market for Microsoft is and Steve Ballmer has said this a lot is it's the people who haven't bought the smartphone yet.  It's the market that doesn't know it's a big bet. They're spending a lot of money.

Start time: 1460.54
End time: 1495.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're laying a lot of money on the bed. It'd be very interesting to see how well it does for.  I mean, we don't know. But I agree with you. That's obviously what they're saying as well.  Basically what they're saying is we've lost that those group, that group to Apple and Android.  The first wave, but the second wave.  So we're going to go after the second wave. I think there's a big question of whether that second.  Look, it's like selling a pork, a Philly cheesesteak to a vegetarian.  I mean, maybe those people don't want a smartphone. Maybe the reason those people don't have it is because they don't need it.  They want to know that they want it once they taste that Philly cheesesteak.

Start time: 1499.32
End time: 1525.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

But I think there is a feeling a lot of people have a feeling of what's the word I'm looking for.  They are kind of annoyed by people who own iPhones and Blackberries.  They think they're Ponzi. Everybody's annoyed by Apple.  But I think right. And I think those people are like, I want a phone that is about me and isn't for these New York jerks who are driving their BMW.

I love that it's, you know, solid state. So I think I think the specs are looking really good.  And the first one is the original ones, Carol. You're right.

I think that pretty soon we're going to most people are going to have fast enough connections to be able to get software online and not be installing stuff on disk.  So I think that's a smart move.  The thing about the air is they are very expensive, given how powerful they are.  I mean, the little one for a thousand dollars, it's a good price for for an app.  You think, oh, that's pretty cheap Apple computer.

I mean, if you just do email, some web browsing, watching videos on YouTube, you'll probably be fine with it.  It is very much Apple's netbook.

Transcript:  I just wonder, you know, with the whole USB thing, the software being on the USB sticks,  I wonder if that's going to kind of generate a whole new education need for how to go about dealing with with software,  because people, I mean, you know, people who are used to the whole CD thing,  are they going to get all confused?  And is it going to create a big issue or is it going to be fairly natural for them?  Now you have the App Store.  Think about it.  Let me do it.

Transcript:  We were going to segue because I think this is actually Apple's.  This says more about Apple than anything that they announced this week.  Even Steve Jobs' ridiculous phone call, which I guess we could play a recording of.  Apple announces an app store.  And by the way, so does Mozilla.  And we even saw Microsoft with that leaked slide stack on Windows 8 say we want to do an app store.  App stores are coming because of the success of the iPhone.  We'll talk about that in a second.  Before we do, though, I want to mention our friends at Citrix.  In fact, hosts, if you'd like to take a little break, we've got Clayton Morris with us.  This would be a good time.

When they say instant on, what they're talking about is...  From sleep.  Well, when you close a normal MacBook, it goes to sleep, right?  Right.  It's in a low-power mode, but it's not in some kind of crazy hibernation.  So these new devices, when you close them after an hour of being closed, they go into  a deep, some kind of deep sleep, like a hibernation.  Now, when you open them, they start right back up from that.  That's what Apple's calling instant on, because you can sleep them for 30 days.

We were freaking out when we heard this.  Were you on the call?  Yeah, we were on the call, and it was just like, what is going on?  This whole thing is totally off the rails and amazing.

Start time: 2503.30
End time: 2509.14

Start time: 2509.28
End time: 2524.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's also this...  I mean, in the computer industry, we are the gadget industry, we all think...  I mean, there does seem to be this feeling like open is better.  The more open, the better it is.  And that's true in a lot of cases.  But it's not true in every case.  No, I understand.

Start time: 2524.46
End time: 2526.22

Start time: 2526.53
End time: 2540.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's saying...  Steve Jobs is just saying...  Android is closed.  What he's really saying is it's a smoke screen.  It's not really open.  They're lying to their customers and they're actually closed.  And it's no different than what anybody else is doing.  Because he wants to diminish their selling point.

Start time: 2540.42

Transcript:  Well, he should be.  I mean, they're becoming the windows of smartphones.  I mean, if you don't see a parallel between...  Wait a minute, but Windows is open.  No, but look.  But no, that's the thing.  With Windows, you could pay a license fee and put it on whatever you wanted.  And you could make any manipulations you wanted.  That's what's funny about this.

Start time: 2559.42
End time: 2561.22

Start time: 2561.32
End time: 2567.94

Transcript:  You know, I get this big feeling lately.  That obviously he's not going to be around much longer.  He can't stick around forever, right?  So he is trying to make moves.  He's not that old.  No, he's not that old.  He's sick.  He's getting better.  All of that.  But he will have to move on at some point.  And people will have to take over his position.  And I just get the feeling over and over again.  That he's trying to put himself and Apple, in general,  in a position of authority.  Obviously they already are.  But I keep getting this impression that he's just trying to say that loud and clear.  That they are the best.  That they are in a position of authority.  And doing it right.  And everybody else is doing it wrong.  Before he walks out the door.  Maybe I'm crazy.

Start time: 2673.40
End time: 2686.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what's weird for me.  He said, for instance, nobody's ever going to want to watch video on a small device.  He said, for instance, nobody's ever going to want to read a book on a portable device.  He says things that he knows are untrue all the time.

Start time: 2686.60

Transcript:  So here's my opinion.  Let me face the thought.  Here's my opinion on Steve.  I love Steve. He's a brilliant guy.  There are two Steves.  There is a Steve who is a brilliant businessman and marketer who will say what he needs to say to forward Apple as a business.  There's also a Steve, and I think this is the fundamental Steve, who believes in products, who believes in making great stuff.  And I think you can listen to every single thing Steve says with both minds.  And it's instructive to listen with both minds.  So when he says a 7-inch tablet is wrong, if you listen with the marketer's mind, you know what he's really saying is don't buy that 7-inch tablet because it weighed until 2011.  So if you listen with the product mind, I think he genuinely says, no, it's the wrong form factor, it's the wrong size, it doesn't feel right to me.  And I think both of those are instructive.  His language is pretty strong.  Yeah, because the proof is in the pudding.

Start time: 2753.26
End time: 2772.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the proof is what sales, you know, what ends up getting sold.  And my mom or, you know, my dad, she's not listening to an Apple earnings call and listening to the nuance of Steve Jobs' voice.  She's going to go to an Apple store and she's going to put her hands on a new MacBook Air and say, oh, I'm looking for a new laptop.  And at the end of the day, if she buys it, that's where, that's why.  So who was the audience for this?

Start time: 2773.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 2777.22
End time: 2789.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, the trickle down.  I mean, this will get out there.  I mean, look, it's all this stuff trickles down.  What Steve Jobs says on an earnings call ends up in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and regular people read that stuff.  And he's super smart.

Start time: 2789.46
End time: 2811.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he probably knew that only a tagline would be remembered.  So what's the what are the three sentences that are going to get reported in the popular press from this call?  What is the import of this call?  Don't buy a seven inch tablet.  Android has Android is not what it appears to be.  In fact, it kind of underscores there's fear in the world that Google might be a little bit shady.

But I've heard this from a couple of different people at some different big companies within our same building.  And I don't know if there's some backlash against it.  They're waiting.  Maybe they're waiting to have broader, broader Blackberry integration again.  And I don't know if the torch was enough for them to say, all right, we're coming back to the table for the torch.  A lot of them are on AT&T.  So I'm not really sure.  But I don't know that it's I don't think it was a runaway iPhone enterprise extravaganza.  You know, it was for a little while.

Transcript:  There's been some adoption.  But but look, enterprise and I.T. guys don't change quickly.  Right.  And there's a lot of problems with the iPhone for enterprise.  I mean, they've they've they've gone to great lengths to fix those problems.  But you're not going to see big companies saying, you know what, throw the Blackberries out.  Let's get everybody an iPhone.  It's not good business for them at this point, I think, to do that.  I'll tell you what's changed.

Start time: 2925.95

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think Microsoft's looking at this.  And I know Apple is is that in corporate, it used to be that the I.T. department chose your phone for you.  And I think increasingly we're seeing people bring their phones into the corporate and say, integrate iPhone.  So that's the change.  And I think both Apple and Microsoft both are aiming not at business anymore, but at individuals who they hope will bring those devices into the enterprise.  Well, now you can do that.

Transcript:  I mean, a few years ago, nobody had a smartphone right for their regular phone.  Everybody had a razor, some dumb phone.  And so you'd go to work and everybody had a Blackberry because their job gave them a Blackberry they had to use.  And now it's the opposite.  You have a really advanced phone that you buy just to use for your phone.  So the opportunity is there to bring it in and say, hey, let's use this instead of that terrible curve you're trying to give me.

Start time: 2972.09
End time: 2998.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly what I got a curve.  And we had a number of executives who said, I want an iPhone.  And they actually had them get an iPhone.  And now they're all walking around with iPhones.  And then suddenly you saw this movement, this groundswell where it seemed like the IT department was going to start handing out iPhones to everyone.  They handed them out to reporters so they could do live streaming and stuff like that.  But you know, you don't have it wasn't this massive adoption.  Now there's been a bit of a freeze on it.  So but you had all these executives walking around with iPhones and everyone else was being handed a black.

They didn't mention much with Tiger, although they mentioned I think the most important thing, which is this new mission control, which takes expose and space.  I don't know.  It's bundles of stuff.  But really, the whole thing here is and he started to see this with I life full screen, a la the iPad and an app store, a la the iPhone and iPad.  And I thought that was a big title shift in how Apple thinks about its desktops.

Start time: 3166.22
End time: 3205.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's cleaning up the desktop.  It's getting rid of the clutter.  And I'm finding we were talking about information overload and sort of the pre show about things.  And I have to say, having an app that runs full screen, you're singularly focused on that one app, whether it's I photo, you don't have a you don't have tweet deck running on the side while you're doing other things.  You can focus on making that photo book of your kid.  You can do this one thing and then you can close the you can close your laptop and you can go do other things.  But it's full screen.  It's beautiful.  And it and it you know, I'm excited about that because I've got multiple windows.  I'm constantly switching and I can't get anything done half the time because I end up you know, I end up having all of these windows open.

Am I going to be hitting that button all the time?  Double tapping that home button.  I'm going to have multiple things running.  That's what full screen does, right?

Start time: 3233.30
End time: 3253.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it makes you it becomes very this is kind of what Apple originally invade against in their user interface guidelines was modality.  You don't want to be modal.  You and you don't want anything to take over the system.  This is a significant change in how they think about operating systems.  Joshua, you said you disagree with the Clinton's assessment.

Start time: 3253.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think the idea of a full screen application is one of the most obnoxious things in the world.  Like I the idea that I would want my laptop to have just one task happening.  You know, maybe if I'm doing some intense photo editing, OK, I just want to focus on that.  But to me, one of the greatest things about a desktop or laptop computer and one of the things that is so lacking on an iPhone or particularly on the iPhone and the iPad is there is no glanceable information.  There are no notifications.  There are no there's none of this extra information that I need to have like Twitter, for instance.  It's important for me to have a Twitter window open and somewhat visible to me all the time because people ask me questions and say stuff to me on Twitter constantly throughout the day.  And I want to be able to respond to those people right then and there.  Twitter keeps moving.  You know, it's not a static thing.  So, you know, same with I am clients.  And I think that the idea of having this single application experience is really not satisfying to me in any meaningful way.  And it's somewhat disappointing to see Apple pushing the paradigm of the iPad into their desktop space because our laptop space because I think it's actually a it's a bad move.

Transcript:  You know, it's funny is that this actually goes back to what Microsoft is doing with the with the Windows Phone 7 as we were talking about.  I mean, they're saying the same thing, right?  Don't unit tasks.  Don't have all this confusing stuff.  Just, you know, get in, get out and get on with your life.  This is the same idea.  Let's simplify.  Let's make it.  You got a single task.  Get that task done and, you know, get on to whatever, you know, get on to taking more pictures of your kids.  I killed the conversation.

Transcript:  I agree with Joshua.  You know, it's I certainly don't want to live my life that way.  I have things that I need.  I need those notifications.  I need to know when I'm when I'm getting an email that I've expected for hours on end.  I need that in order to work efficiently.  Now you can take the other side of that.  And maybe I would actually work a little bit more efficiently if I'm focusing on one task.  But there's so much that we do that is that is back and forth between apps.  So do I want full screen mode?  I think we just need clarification.  I guess I'm OK if I have the choice.

Start time: 3409.85

Transcript:  You know, if you want, if you're like if Clayton, if you're Clayton's imaginary Neo Neo fight user, you can use the full screen.  If you're a multitasker like us, you could use.  But my concern and a completely, completely fallacious and I'm probably just being paranoid, though, is is that Apple is not going to give us choice in the long run.

Start time: 3431.36
End time: 3451.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple and your concern is as well.  That's a well-placed concern because the truth is that they may give us the choice at the beginning, but Apple doesn't actually want you.  It's clear from what Steve Jobs is saying at this event and from what they've been doing on the iPad and the iPhone that they don't actually want you to have a bunch of they don't want you to deal with window management.  This is what they're trying to do.  That's right.

Start time: 3452.58
End time: 3510.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a fight very early on when Steve Jobs went to Xerox PARC and first saw windowing interface.  There was a fight in the earliest days of technology between overlapping windows and tiled windows.  And this was a very academic fight, but it was really about fundamentally how people use computers, whether they multitask or whether they want to see the entire thing that's going on at once and overlapping windows one.  But it looks like I have to say very regressive.  It's almost like going back to DOS.  We're going back to a day where not only are they not overlapping anymore, but they there's one window.  And I think you have to tie this into the app store because it's really a two pronged attack on complexity.  I think Apple's saying computers are too hard to use.  We had huge success with the iOS.  Normal people really like this kind of simple interface.  Why don't we bring this to the desktop?  Wouldn't we do well?  And there's some additional benefits because you have the app store.  Now we tightly control the chain.  We tightly control security.

Start time: 3529.70
End time: 3541.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And their argument and this is where you wear two hats as Steve Jobs with one argument is it's great for business because we control it all.  The other argument is great for users.  Steve Jobs is thinking, well, this makes it as cleaner, nicer, simpler.  It's Zen.  Well, it is.

Transcript:  It is better for users and it's better for Apple as well.  And it's actually better for developers.  Developers have found gold mines in the app store.  Yeah, clearly.  The thing is, it's better for users as long as and the problem is the as long as as long as Apple keeps letting you install and use apps the way you do it now.  As long as we have choice, I'm OK.

Computers have been around for a long time and people are very used to the way they use computers and very comfortable with the way they use computers.  They're not just going to be able to make a big sea change and say, well, guess what?  You can't side load an app on your computer and people are just going to accept it.  Some people will.

Transcript:  Listen to this from Engadget on the iOS app store review guidelines.  And I think this is kind of telling when you when you listen to these rules, these are the rules that are going to be in effect for the app store when it launches in three months.  It's kind of scary.  Apps crash will be rejected.  OK, apps that exhibit bugs will be rejected.  Apps that are beta demo trial or test versions will be rejected.  So no more will you be able to, for instance, use a beta of Chrome apps must be packaged and submitted using Apple's packaging technologies included in Xcode.  No third party installers allowed.  I wonder how much tie in there isn't Xcode at this point.  Apps that require this is really interesting apps that require license keys or implement their own copy protection will be rejected.  But Apple doesn't have its own copy protection yet.  In fact, Apple's own products require serial numbers.  So many of them, the pro apps Apple.  This is really weird.  Apps that present a license screen at launch will be rejected.  Like iTunes?  Yeah, like iTunes apps may not use update mechanisms outside the app store.  You're starting to see some out lock in here.  Apps that use deprecated or optionally installed technologies, for example, and this is in Apple's own words, Java or Rosetta will be rejected.  Apps that look similar to Apple products or apps bundled on the Mac.

I use GarageBand on a regular basis, but I use it on a regular basis and it crashes all the time.  And so would it allow apps in the app store that crash all the time?  According to the rules, they wouldn't with bugs.  What else crashes?  I movie. I have problems with I movie.  You know, and these finders are just as sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, when he was doing that walkthrough, he ended up with a circle around him, which he likes to do once in a while and it can kind of ping him with questions.  So Neely asked him if he would allow apps to be side loaded onto the iPhone the way they the way they're obviously going to allow on desktops once they have the app store in place.  He's his answer was interesting.  He said not at this time, but he didn't say no.  So it's possible that this could be a good thing.  Maybe he'll just say, look, we're doing it on the desktop.  Let's do it on these handheld devices.  And that'll alleviate a lot of this stuff.  I think a lot of the questions about what you can and can't do on your phones would be it would be a non issue if they just said, look, in our app store, we don't do this.  If you want to use our app store, you can't do X, Y and Z.  If you want to make a mechanism that does something outside of this, you can go sell it somewhere else and try to get people to load it onto their phone.  That's fine.  It's not our problem.  But they haven't done that yet.

Start time: 3838.36
End time: 3870.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we know that Apple likes it closed.  I mean, that's why that's why they've succeeded.  If we're going to be completely honest, they have succeeded with their closed system.  You know, in a sense, it does appear that it's going a little further than we would comfortably like.  I think they're actually going to make some changes between now and the 90 days when the app stores is released.  This almost feels like they just took and through, you know, the guidelines without much processing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

They have one one place that you can go and put your software and you lose your 30 percent.

And I'm going to tell you how you can get two of them absolutely free.  They play on all the devices, the iPhone, the iPad, the Zoom, the Kindle, Android devices.  In fact, they have a great app for both iPhone and Android and BlackBerry, too.  They don't mention it sometimes as much as we ought to, probably.  They'll allow you to browse your library.  One of the nice things about Audible is every book you've ever bought on Audible is available on your library.  And unlike maybe TV and movies, people often reread books.  And so it's really nice. I've been an Audible member for 10 years.  I've got over 400 books and I can always go back and download a book and listen to it.  And this is a really nice way to do it with these these new apps for Android, iPhone, iPod with touch and BlackBerry.  If you go to Audible, I was really excited about Keith Richards' new biography.

Transcript:  Wait until I start talking in the Irish accent.  So Ireland, in order to, and by the way, it's the Irish miracle, they call it.  Right.  Remember, that's St. Bernadette. Anyway, the Irish miracle was they took this economically depressed nation,  and by eliminating corporate taxes, all these American companies moved into Ireland,  and actually Ireland had a huge, over the last decade, just incredible success by eliminating corporate taxes.  So what you do is you set up a dummy corporation in Ireland.  You transfer your intellectual property, this is what Google did, by the way, to this dummy corporation in Ireland.  Now the IRS is very, you know, you have to transfer it for fair value,  and this is where you can get in a little bit of trouble.  You can't just say, here, give me a dollar, and I'll give you, you know, the PageRank algorithm.  So there was some decent amount of money exchanged, and Google had to pay taxes on that decent amount of money.  But now all the intellectual property is in Ireland, Google licenses it, the profits go to Ireland,  then that's when the Dutch sandwich comes in.  It's delicious.  They send it to Holland, where Holland allows you, I don't know, it gets complicated here,  Holland allows you to set up a corporation in, let's say, Bermuda, which is what Google did.  So the money goes from Ireland to Holland to Bermuda.

Transcript:  Did you see, we did the N Gadget show last night.  We had a review on stage.  And we demoed it.  Played around with it.  Look, there's some really cool stuff.  There's some really dumb stuff.  At the end of the day, most people, the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of humans on the planet  do not want to spend $300 on some weird box that they have to hook up to their cable box  to use Google searches on their television.  It's just not realistic.  I think that the stuff built into a TV is far more likely to get traction  than the stuff where it's like a separate box you have to go and get.  So Google TV can be a success or have some impact as long as companies like Sony and Panasonic  and any other, Vizio, they want to start building that stuff into the TV.  I think they have a really hard fight if they're asking people to spend $300 on a separate box to use.  People keep asking why this is different than Web TV.

Start time: 5123.02
End time: 5162.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's significantly different because the Web is different now.  And it's not Web TV because the Web is so much more robust.  But I agree with Josh completely.  And playing with it in the Logitech box, it just doesn't make much sense for the average consumer.  And I have to say, it'd be better baked into a television.  And if the price wasn't as good...  Well, you can get it in the television. Sony's the best.  Right, Sony.  And I played with the Sony television with it baked in.  And it makes more sense.  Look, if you're going to get a new television and you're in the market for a new television,  you've got Yahoo widgets, you've got these other TVs with internet capability,  and you're not paying much more to have internet-ready televisions, get it.  I don't know that it's a game changer at all.  Kelly, what do you think?

Transcript:  No, I think it is a game changer, not necessarily in the sense that everybody will be buying one of these things.  But it is impacting the future.  I mean, we all know that everything is going to become integrated more and more and more.  People are watching podcasts on their TV.  They're having to work a little bit to do that.  But more and more people will be able to just very easily do it.  You know why they're watching podcasts?

Transcript:  I want to say, I agree with Kelly.  I think it is a game changer, but I don't think it's like...  I don't think Google's device is the game changer.  I think the game changer is big companies with lots of money are starting to look at the living room,  and they're saying, what can we do to actually innovate here,  and how can we make this experience better for users?  Unfortunately, the roadblock everybody hits, and they're going to keep hitting,  is how do you make it better for users when you've got these cable companies  that are still basically throwing up blockades,  and also the content providers throwing up blockades to getting that content in an easy, decent way.  And that's what's happening now.

Transcript:  But if you just plugged in your TV in your cable box and suddenly it existed there, that's a different story.  The problem here is, and this is the same thing that Apple experienced, this is...  I thought something that was really striking when we reviewed the Apple TV.  Even in their presentation, Jobs showed Iron Man 2 and Modern Family  and all the stuff you'd want to watch on your Apple TV, right?  When we got a review unit, no Iron Man 2 and no Modern Family,  the content makers said, guess what?  We're not giving you this stuff on your device.  You can have it if you go to the video store, you can have it if you buy it,  but you can't have it on your device to rent,  you're not going to be able to watch it streaming online.  And that's what they're doing here.  Hulu is saying...  They're saying you can't get to Hulu, ABCs, you can't watch Modern Family.

Start time: 5342.54
End time: 5376.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the record companies didn't have the kind of control that these guys have.  It's a completely different situation.  I mean, Comcast and Time Warner, in collusion with the content makers,  have control not only of where the content is coming from and what you're looking at it on,  but the pipes that it comes down on.  So, I mean, it's a crazy situation that we have here where, you know,  when I buy cable, why do I have to buy 600 channels when I only watch 14 of them?  I mean, and people have been railroaded like that for years,  and there's no end in sight right now that I can tell.

Transcript:  Look at carriers and cell phones.  I mean, you've got a situation where the dream scenario would be you buy a phone, right,  that you can actually afford, and then you say, I want this kind of service.  Maybe I'll just pay monthly for this service and decide when to end that contract  instead of having some elaborate two-year contract.  But the reality is you have to pick a certain device on a certain carrier  and get locked into a two-year contract, and that doesn't seem to be changing anytime soon.  And I think the same is true for TV.  It's a real problem.  We have huge, huge corporations that have huge amounts of control  over what are going to be or what already are vital services,  and there's no way to disconnect those two things.  You can't say, just give me what I want, how I want it,  because your lines are controlled and your content is controlled by a single company.

I had a meeting with BlipTV a few weeks ago and talking about a show that I do.  They're great. I love BlipTV. They're great.  Yeah, they're fantastic.  And, you know, it's interesting.  They shed some light on how their audiences are watching television  and consuming content on set-top boxes versus the web.  And me and my buddy Jim do paranormal shows.  I love UFOs and ghosts and stuff like that.  So we do this paranormal report show once a week.  And we're figuring out the different audiences.  He's saying, look, the people that are watching it on the Roku box,  which I love, never watch it on the web.  And the people that watch it on the web never watch it on these set-top boxes,  but they get enormous traffic through the Blip.TV app on the Roku box.  And people are sampling this.  And someone in the chat room said,  I'm not sure people actually want a la carte television.  I think maybe we assume that they do,  but isn't there a certain amount of sampling going on  that people like the clicker?  And it's sort of the age-old clicker thing, right?  You just give me that clicker.

I mean, I think there's a way to do both that will please the consumer.  And also, if you want to flip around, like for me,  I could tell you very effectively and clearly what channels I want and don't want, right?  And if I could get a package from the cable company that just had those channels,  I'd be fine with that.  I wouldn't feel like, oh, man, I wish I had, you know,  I don't know what kind of random like Animal Planet or something,  because I'm never going to, well, maybe I'd watch Animal Planet.

We had a guy come back out again because these scientific Atlanta boxes  and these Samsung boxes are terrible.  If the cable companies could step it up in the hardware,  and Josh, I'd love to get your perspective on this.  If they would step up and say, you know what?  Not only do you have the great DVR content now that actually works,  but you've got all of this a la carte program that you can pick and choose from.  You've got all of this on-demand stuff that's not limited.  Then they could really... I wouldn't need to get a Google TV.  If I could jump on YouTube right on one of these cable boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mean like a Tivo box? I think that's what you're describing.  Exactly.  Yeah, except for now it's a P-Stand.  But here's the thing.  What is the incentive for Time Warner or Comcast to give you better options?  First off, they don't want you off of their main feed.  They want you to be on the Comcast main feed as much as possible.  They don't want you on the internet looking at YouTube  because that takes money out of their pocket at the end of the day.  Why are you still using your internet service? You're still paying for cable.  Yeah, you're paying for that one part,  but then you're not watching the advertisers on the networks that they have sweetheart deals with  that are pushing the content onto their lines.  What is the incentive to Comcast?  Is it user outrage? Because that obviously hasn't happened yet.

Start time: 5702.48
End time: 5717.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 5745.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we're light years away from that.  That's like saying, oh, the carriers...  I'm not disagreeing with you that that's what's going to make it happen.  There has to be some outrage from people who actually use their services.  They have to say, screw this, I'm canceling it.  But that hasn't happened in phones.  We've seen the same thing for years and years and years.  People have had the same complaint.  Well, there's going to be outrage.  People say, I'm canceling my service and I'm not going to pay these crazy contract fees  and 25 cents for a text message, which in my opinion is a criminal offense  and should be punishable by law.

He's one of the guys that's deeply involved with Windows Phone 7.  And we were talking about how you change consumer behavior  because at the end of the day, all of this stuff is about the behaviors of the consumer  and whether or not they will take what they're given.  And we have a tendency to just take what these companies dole out.  We're used to it. It's somewhat comfortable.  It may not be the best situation in the world, but it is what it is.

Transcript:  I want to read you what Mark Cuban said. I think it's very interesting.  I'm not a big fan of Mark Cuban. I think sometimes he really gets it big time wrong.  But I'm going to read what he said. His article, his column,  it kind of takes off from your Engadget revelation  that Netflix is testing a streaming-only service.  We're going to talk about that in just a little bit.  Clayton Morris is here. Joshua Topolsky from Engadget.  Callie Lewis of GeekBeat.tv.  Real briefly before we get to Mark's thoughts on Netflix  and why Google is about to hand Netflix the keys to the kingdom,  I want to tell you about The Edge.  I was at Blog World last week. Callie, you were down there too.  And Ford was doing test drives.  I took this opportunity to drive the new Edge.  I think this is such a sweet car.  I'd heard that it was the most technologically sophisticated car from Ford.  And I have to say, once you get inside, you really feel that way.  First of all, looking at it, the beautiful smooth lines,  you really can see how computer design has changed how cars are designed.  It's just very fluid, aerodynamic shape.  Inside, I think I'm very aware of the aesthetics of instrument panels.  My 2010 Mustang, one of the reasons I like it,  it's a very simple, clean instrument panel.  You see the same thing in the Ford Edge.  The center stack, the door trim, the shifter, gorgeous.  I took a picture of the shifter and posted it on Instagram.  I mean, just really beautiful.  Exceptional fit and finish, Ford has really got that down now.  These cars are solid. They feel good.  The best in class, second row leg room, lots of space back there.  The available panoramic vista roof.  This is one thing I'm sorry I did not get on the Mustang.  With a forward panel that tilts or opens fully and a fixed rear skylight  so the back seat gets light as well as the front seat.  Ambient lighting, I have this on the Mustang.  This is so cool. You can change the colors for your moods.  You get purple, amber, white, whatever you like.  That's a standard in the Limited and Sport and available on the SEL.  But the engine is where you really see technology.  It's got that advanced 3.5 liter TI-VCT V6, 285 horsepower,  27 highway miles per gallon according to the EPA.  If you get the Sport, you get even more horsepower,  305 horsepower, 285 foot pounds of torque,  Sport tune suspension, 22 inch polished aluminum wheels,  performance tires, it is sweet.  Of course, like most of the Ford vehicles, you get the Ford Sync.  In fact, the Edge has MyFord Touch, which is the Sync Plus.  They've got two screens behind the wheel in front of you.  One is the tachometer, although it can be programmed.  Then the other one is the media and stuff.  And then of course, you've got the big center screen,  the eight inch touchscreen in the center stack.  All the Sync voice. Have you seen it?

Because they're finally getting billions of dollars in retransmission fees from the distributors.  That's I guess the cable companies.  This is new money.  It's found money.  It's mining.

Google refuses to pay people to put it on Google TV.  They don't pay up front for content as Netflix does.  And so Mark Cuban says Google is just has just handed Netflix the streaming universe.  Netflix streaming content.  This blows my mind.  Netflix streaming content consumes 20 percent of download throughout a throughput during  weekday prime time hours.  One fifth of all network traffic during prime time hours on weekdays is Netflix.  It was hard.

Ziff Davis said, go down to MGM and pretend we're going to do TV with them.  So my job, I was getting paid to go down and fly once a week to LA, have an office.  I had an office in MGM where I would sit there going, I wish I had an iPad.  I would sit there pretending that we were going to do TV with MGM.  I don't think anything ever came of it.  But I do remember the most embarrassing moment.  The MGM executives came in and said, we're very excited about this new movie.  We think it's going to be a huge hit.  We think it's going to be a huge hit.  Paul Verhoeven, Elizabeth Barkley from Saved by the Bell, Kyle McCloughlin from Tune.  And we got Screech.  And so they had, we're in a screening room, right?  It's me and Gina Smith and a bunch of executives.  And they screen the scene where Elizabeth Barkley is dry humping some guy.  Okay, this is the scene.  My favorite scene.  And my jaw, I mean, I'm there with these executives.  I'm like, I'm mortified.  I'm bright around my jaw.  I said, this is, what are you thinking?  This is the first NC 17 movie.

You know, we watched the show on television.  You couldn't do it anywhere else.  Either you buy it on iTunes for like 50 bucks or you spend $10 a month and you have to sit  through a couple of commercials.

And you go through your Netflix queue,  and you're like, I feel like I'm going to watch Cake Boss tonight,  or Saw 2, or if you're Leo, Wild Things 2, straight to DVD.  Not Wild Things.

Transcript:  Let's fast forward to the year 2010, where Aaron Sorkin writes a movie.  A movie kind of loosely based on Facebook.  Finally, a man named Mark Zuckerberg, who actually lived that, sees the movie.  He's asked at the Y Combinator Startup Conference what he thought of the Facebook movie.  One of the biggest ones.

Start time: 6895.28
End time: 6974.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know.  It's interesting what stuff they focused on getting right.  Every single shirt and fleece that I had in that movie is actually a shirt or fleece that I own.  There's all the stuff that they got wrong and a bunch of random details that they got right.  The thing that I think is actually most thematically interesting that they got wrong is...  The whole framing of the movie, kind of the way that it starts is,  I'm with this girl who doesn't exist in real life, who dumps me,  which has happened in real life a lot.  Basically, the frame it as if the whole reason for making Facebook and building something  was because I wanted to get girls or wanted to get into some kind of social institution.  The reality for people who know me is I've actually been dating the same girl since before I started Facebook,  so obviously that's not a part of it.  But I think it's such a big disconnect from the way that people who make movies think about  what we do in Silicon Valley, building stuff.  They just can't wrap their head around the idea that someone might build something  because they like building things.

Start time: 6978.36
End time: 7014.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the most eloquent I've ever seen him be.  I have to say his point is really accurate.  If you've seen Aaron Sorkin talk about these characters,  you can tell that he has a tremendous disdain for people who do the kinds of things  that Zuckerberg did and the people around him do.  I do think there's a real disconnect there.  He's right about the perception from the inside versus the outside.  He thinks, of course, he's motivated by his hatred for women.  That's why he started Facebook.  That's a very childish way to think about why somebody would start something  or work on something like Facebook.

Transcript:  I interviewed Ben Mesric two weeks ago.  Of course, he's the author of Accidental Billionaires,  which probably everyone here has read or listened to on Audible,  which is a fantastic book.  It's a good Audible book.  Great service. Tremendous.  Yeah, absolutely.  He said that Zuckerberg does have that singular focus about things.  Of course, back then, early on, he was saying that he talked about the movie  as complete fiction or he said it was fiction.  Sure, there were a lot of parts of it that were absolutely completely fabricated.  Like the girlfriend issue at the beginning of the movie,  that he's after some sort of personal vendetta, which was certainly not true.  But I think this is the best thing from a PR standpoint that's happened to Zuckerberg.  I think he looks better as a result.

Start time: 7060.22
End time: 7067.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As it turns out, I think he was worried, obviously,  and everybody's worried that it was going to really hurt them.  I don't think it did.  I think it's actually been great.
