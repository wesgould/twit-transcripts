Transcript:  sound good you look good you  tired because you were out here  and just flew back right? Yeah.  Senior tech analyst for Mashable  you were covering WWDC we're  going to talk about that in a  second. Looking forward to that.  Also here Ed my old friend good  friend for many many years Ed and  I were just comparing notes I  think I've known him for more  than 20 years. Ed Bott from ZD  Net is here author of the Ed  Bott report at Ziff Davis and  I've known him since he was  editor in chief at what was it  PC world Windows weekly.  PC computing. PC computing that's

Start time: 201.16
End time: 245.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  my business. Exactly. Actually I  remember from that era looking at  3.1 which and thinking you know  what this because I was a Mac fan I  bought a Mac in 1984 and 3.0 was  not quite it but when I saw 3.1 I  said this is bad for Apple this is  Microsoft's caught up and it's been  a tough battle ever since. We are  going to talk a little bit about  WWDC of course in a bit but before  we get there I think more  importantly did you see Halt and  Catch Fire this week? Yes. Did you?  Oh good. I like that show. See I like  it. When it first in the first five  minutes I was telling Lisa this is  horrible I'm so because they had a  sex scene right away with the woman  who you know is going to be the

Start time: 246.90
End time: 263.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  smartest person on the show. Yeah  before the bombing. And you know  she's going to do whatever she's  going to be the one who says I'm in.  Right. In some future episode and I  had Leo it's funny because I had the  exact same reaction after five minutes  I looked over at Judy and I said this

Start time: 263.82
End time: 289.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is not grabbing me. Yeah well I was  pissed I felt like god they did this  is what to me this is exactly what  happens when networks get a hold of  technology technical material they  don't trust that the audience will be  interested so they sex it up. Fortunately  and it's obvious AMC said you know can  you just start with a sex scene? Yeah.  They got it out of the way and  and that and then the rest of it was  great I was really surprised I enjoyed  it. And they got the font correct.

Start time: 289.80
End time: 295.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did they get correct? I want to see  next week's. Yeah yeah oh yeah I'm not  going to say it's great yet.

Start time: 295.80
End time: 297.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've seen a few episodes I got some

Start time: 297.80
End time: 347.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  screeners and no the thing that impressed  me most and this was even from the  previews that they sent out and some of  the trailers I guess they got the font  correct on the terminal and that was  for me no because here's the thing  most people when they do like are  especially recreating like 80s tech  they don't get that stuff correct and I  talked to Christopher Cantwell who's  one of the creators of the show and he  actually has a history making 80s  looking stuff and his father was  actually worked in Texas in the 80s as  a computer engineer so he actually grew  up in Texas where his dad did some of  the stuff that was similar to Halt and  Catch Fire and he said that they the  researchers were very dedicated and  then they made sure that they got the  correct font for all the terminal  seams. It's funny that you should say

Start time: 347.80
End time: 364.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that. That was correct. I forgot but the  IBM PC had a unique font it was designed  for IBM and it was a serifed font and  you're right it was very distinctive and  to get that right is is is critical so  I didn't even notice but they did get

Start time: 365.08
End time: 385.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that right huh? No I showed it to my  husband who's like an old-school you  know computer nerd and he his first  computer was an Atari 400. Me too. And  yes and he you know learned to program  that way and whatnot and he's very he's  very very particular about making sure  that the stuff is correct and like he  won't even watch a show if it's off and  so he was even more critical than I was  and he saw the font he was like okay cool

Start time: 386.38
End time: 404.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we can watch this. So I don't think it's  spoiled and we will be careful not to  spoil anything I don't think there's that  much that you could spoil frankly it's  not that kind of show but I don't think  it spoils anything to say that the plot  it's a fictionalized story of how the  original IBM PC which came out in 1981

Start time: 405.52
End time: 407.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  was cloned. By Compaq yeah. Well I don't

Start time: 408.06
End time: 413.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  think it was Compaq you know I did some  research because the company on the TV  show is Cardiff Computer right? Right I

Start time: 413.82
End time: 440.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  mean they apparently live in a world  Cardiff Electric. They apparently live  in a world where Compaq still exists but  a lot of the stuff I've recently read  some book from one of the Compaq co-founders  and he actually did an interview with a  guy who does the the retro internet cast  internet podcast or something and he  talked about what the guys at Commodore  or Compaq rather did to reverse engineer.  They came out later than and I remember

Start time: 440.80
End time: 458.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  this because I had an Eagle computer and  the first clone was something from a  do you remember this you might remember  this Ed Columbia data products. Oh  absolutely and it was I believe the  Columbia that was the first to do this  clean room reverse engineering of the  BIOS. Right yeah there were definitely

Start time: 458.86
End time: 466.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  earlier people than Compaq but Compaq was  the first one you could get it to work  with with DOS or with some of this stuff  but it wasn't completely. I see so the

Start time: 467.00
End time: 474.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Columbia see they did say the Columbia  reverse engineered it but maybe it didn't  do it wasn't a very I don't know if it  was a perfect I don't remember that. Are

Start time: 474.84
End time: 478.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we watching the under 35 readers just  our viewers just like what are they

Start time: 479.10
End time: 480.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  talking about is this before I'm under

Start time: 481.08
End time: 484.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  35 I think it's fascinating but then I'm  a weird person. Christina Warren is very

Start time: 484.84
End time: 518.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  weird. No this is this so remember the  the Apple came out in 84 the first and  the the Apple II had come out in 77 the  Apple Macintosh came out 84 the first  personal computer from IBM non Apple you  know what this was a big deal came out in  81. One right. 81 and the thing that IBM  did that that was unheard of they used  off the shelf parts there were no  proprietary parts in it and and I think  they did this on purpose you were around  it in this time period as was I. And the

Start time: 518.82
End time: 545.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  reason I knew all of in fact one of the  original members of the IBM PC team used  to live across the street where I live  right now. I moved here nine years ago  and for the first five years that I  lived here he was a neighbor of mine so  we used to have dinner regularly and we  would talk about those early IBM PC days  and one reason they used off the shelf  parts was because they were staying under  the radar. Yeah it was a skunk works in

Start time: 546.54
End time: 550.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in Boca Raton they went down to Florida  IBM's up in New York. Yeah they were in

Start time: 551.73
End time: 579.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Armond New York and if anybody had known  what they were doing down there they  probably would have shut them down so it  was in a way it it parallels that first  episode of Halt and Catch Fire where  they were kind of trying to do this in  secret and literally in a garage and and  the IBM guys were trying to get this  thing shipped without too many red flags  showing up in Armond. And it makes sense

Start time: 580.02
End time: 587.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because they would undermine IBM's  business which was exactly mainframe  computing and if you put a real computer  on somebody's desk that's bad for

Start time: 587.80
End time: 627.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  business. Right and from what I  understand and you guys would know  better but from what I understand in  addition to trying to do it under the  radar and prevent IBM from knowing that  it was kind of done you know they were  trying to do it as cheaply as possible  so that's why it made sense to use off  the shelf parts rather than building  their own custom ship and then IBM once  they did release it IBM really didn't  expect it to be successful or even want  it to be successful and success kind of  was like well what do we do now you know  and then you know crap we have to  manufacture. Right right and then all the  mini computer guys all the you know all  the digital equipment core guys everybody  else are just like oh this is no big deal  and then you know a decade later none of  them including IBM are making computers.

Start time: 627.92
End time: 678.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you know Don Estridge by any chance  Ed? I had met him. Yeah he passed away  just a few years later in a plane crash  but he led the Boca Raton team that  built this and they not only use off the  shelf parts but they documented the one  proprietary part in fact it's so funny  because they're scanning the board  looking for the proprietary part they  buy an IBM PC in the show and they're  scanning somewhere in here there's a  yes the one with a big copyright IBM you  could see it even you know so yeah  that's the part it was an 8k ROM chip  the basic input output system that IBM  wrote but they even in their manuals  documented all the calls so IBM was  really open about this and in a way  that you wouldn't expect an IBM to be  even in those days. Yeah shockingly.

Start time: 681.02
End time: 682.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank God they were but I'm sure they

Start time: 682.80
End time: 683.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  regretted it afterwards. Well maybe

Start time: 684.86
End time: 694.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because yeah the clones came I had an  Eagle which was never reliable it was  one of the early predated compact one  of the early clones. A leading edge.  Leading edge remember that yep yep yep.

Start time: 694.80
End time: 699.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hyundai I think it was Hyundai who made  those. The reason the Eagle was cool the  IBM 8088 went at 4.77 megahertz. The

Start time: 704.90
End time: 753.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Eagle I think was at nine. It's like eight  or nine. It's like oh it's twice as fast  but it but it never was reliable so I  don't it's a trade-off a little bit so  but Ed do you so do you remember and  this is one thing I wasn't sure about  maybe Christina you know the way they do  it in the TV show is looks like it's  kind of a little bogus they they have an  oscilloscope and a you know they test the  leads and they've set up some kind of  goofy LED readout and they're and they're  writing down hex code. I gather I guess  what they were doing is looking at each  memory location in the ROM chip and  writing down its hex code. Is that how  you would do this? I don't know. I don't  know. Is that how you would do this?

Start time: 756.57
End time: 762.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how you would dump the chip.  They were basically they were basically  disassembling it well what would you  dump it into? I guess. I mean all you

Start time: 763.80
End time: 772.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  need is a chip reader that would just do  this I think you could have even in those  days just read the chip it's ROM code  unless it was somehow encrypted. But that

Start time: 772.80
End time: 790.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was you know we were talking about this  my wife and I as we were watching it was  that if as he's writing this down in  this notebook how many of these are there  65,536 and he goes okay and he's  writing them down in this notebook and  we're saying if only he had a personal  computer. He's so easy. I think even in

Start time: 793.61
End time: 860.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  those days you could get a ROM reader  that would give you and so then you get  the hex code and now you disassemble it  but now you've got a problem because the  engineers who do that now know the code  and they are contaminated. They're  contaminated. You go back to a decision  just the year before actually it may  have come down that year between Apple  and a company called Franklin computer  remember this the Franklin ace was a  clone of the Apple II and Apple sued  them saying but wait a minute your ROM  code is stolen it's exactly the same as  our proprietary code. The first court  that heard it the argument Franklin made  was well it's not human readable so you  can't copyright it you can only copyright  something that human can read. The first  court said yeah you're right Franklin  but they went on to circuit court the  circuit court reviewed it and said no no  you could still copyright own machine  readable code. That decision held and  Apple was able to put Franklin out of  business so the folks whoever it was  Cardiff, Columbia, Eagle, Compact that  were reverse engineering the code knew  already what the law held you cannot  copy the code it's copyrighted. So what

Start time: 861.36
End time: 906.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do you do? So you take the APIs or  you take the functional description of  the output of the machine and you  literally reverse engineer it you say  what does it take to take input and turn  it into this output and if the output is  documented well enough you can engineer  the part in the middle and where this  show I think is going to go is about how  you can get you can get it 90 95 percent  right but then you discover the places  where you reverse engineer the right  result for the one thing that you knew  but then something else happens and it  behaves differently. Undocumented APIs

Start time: 907.24
End time: 916.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and odd behavior maybe buggy behavior  you have to duplicate the bugs in the  code. Don't use duplicate the accurate  code you have to duplicate the bugs as

Start time: 916.92
End time: 918.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well. I mean this is in silicon. Right

Start time: 919.18
End time: 980.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah. There's a book by Rod  Rod Canlon who is one of the founders of  Compaq called Open how Compaq ended IBM's  PC domination and helped reinvent the  modern computer and I read that on the  plane actually on the way to WWDC it's a  really good read and he goes into the  whole story about what they did to  reverse engineer and white room reverse  engineer the bios and the whole  configuration and what made Compaq  unique as you said you know Leah they  weren't the first clone but they were  the first one who made it fully  compatible with the software and beyond  that they were more compatible than  future IBM's were with older software  and that was funny right and so that was  actually how they were able to outsell  IBM that and the fact that they went to  the 386 first you know IBM wanting to do  the second one you know was 286 and they  didn't want to move to the 386 and  Compaq saw as Microsoft did that hey  this is going to be like the chip and so  they had the 386 first and so that was  basically how they became like so you

Start time: 980.92
End time: 990.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  see more than you've seen more than we  have you you actually got some screeners  you've seen yeah how many episodes have  you seen three does it's does it get  good I mean are you right yeah I mean I

Start time: 991.63
End time: 1001.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  really like the show I mean you know but  I'm somebody who's a total nerd about  retro computer history but I also feel  like they're doing a good job at the  characters and things like that but I  like the show it feels like AMC said

Start time: 1010.80
End time: 1034.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  completely what's the it's funny  because you know they've got the but the  more difficult thing and I was talking  to the one of the co-creators about this  is that like how do you show how people  program or how they reverse engineer  things or whatever it is and so that  becomes a really interesting creative  challenge and like you know the social  network did it really really well I  thought so they did probably the best of  any of the writing the code and the

Start time: 1036.16
End time: 1039.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  writing the code on the window I love  that yeah yeah exactly and like you know

Start time: 1039.80
End time: 1071.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's something exactly how it works  but that can really visualize  experience rather than just somebody  who is in front of typing because that  you don't want to see that and I would  say that probably that's the best  representation and actually war games  which also just celebrated it's a 30th  anniversary or 31st anniversary I guess  it was playing a game exactly yeah that  that just turned 31 you know did a  really good job of showing that sort of  you know how computers work sort of  thing I interviewed John badum the

End time: 1125.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  about badum and the director is it was  it did Fincher direct social network is  that they both cared a lot about the  technology and even though it was kind  of behind the scenes they wanted to get  it right there was a scene in the social  network you may remember in class at  Harvard Mark Zuckerberg walks in and the  professor poses a very challenging  question nobody can get it Zuckerberg in  the back of the class stands up as well  as it turned they shot the whole scene  and the the technical expert who was on  set to advise them said you know that's  wrong and they said well what Fincher  said well what's wrong and he said well  it should say this this and they reshot  it they think that's because they want  to be right yeah I knew talking to the

Start time: 1126.80
End time: 1159.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Halt and Catch fire career he said that  when they were working with the  technology a they had to make sure that  they sourced all the stuff that was of  that era but be they work with experts  to make sure that the actors were  holding them correctly and we're using  because it was really important to them  to make sure like for instance and again  this doesn't ruin anything but like in  the opening in the first episode the  wife is is taking apart a speaking spell  to make sure that you know she was  holding and holding the tools the right  way and then they but they did that you  know across on the board with the series  because they really wanted to make sure

Start time: 1159.80
End time: 1186.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that they got those details correct and  is it feel a little weird now this this  is not for you Christina but it feels a  little world as somebody both of us are  old enough to actually lived that era  and we're and we're covering technology  in that era and we're writing about this  stuff it feels a little weird that that's  now ancient history for people did it  dressed like that I had the sidebar I  the clothes that I mean that the music  it that was it to me I was telling Lisa  this well that was just the other day I

everything  you need it's the hosting the best  hosting you can get we can't we try every  time I do a Squarespace app we try to  bring the Squarespace sites down our  ins everybody go to inside dot twit dot  TV our blog and try to bring it you  cannot bring it down because the the  software that's running on the site is  so tightly integrated with the hosting  software that the minute more bandwidth  is needed it's provided is an amazing  technological design we've been with  Squarespace it's almost the very  beginning the days they came out of the  college dorm room and I still think  every time I see it gosh it's better and  better and better and better new features  new designs better support their support  all coming from the Squarespace offices  in New York you're talking to  knowledgeable support people who  actually work with the software work  with the designs the templates it all  starts off at the Squarespace site you'll  see a big get oh that's cool you see  that

software it couldn't be easier  start by clicking the get started button  you'll be choosing from 25 gorgeous  designer templates but I have to tell  you it's not just how gorgeous the  template is it's what is going on behind  the scenes is actually quite  sophisticated this is very modern web  design as an example mobile responsive  so it looks good on any size screen in  fact when you upload a picture to your  Squarespace site they automatically size  nine different versions of it so they  can serve the version that's right for  the screen whether it's a four inch  iPhone or a 30 inch QHD displayer I mean  it just it's amazing they always look  good and but don't think because I'm  starting you with a template you're  going to be look like 25 other sites  every site's unique you'll see these are  all using the template that I selected  each one has its own unique feel and  look they're very visual because today  that's what consumers want they're great  for a photographer an artist

Start time: 1720.08
End time: 1725.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 1725.80
End time: 1741.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right right and they did actually let  some journalists get developer badges in  this case I'm a registered Apple  developer so I won the keynote in that  respect and I paid for my badge but what  was different was that they lifted the  NDA on discussing what was in the sessions  see that's where you would be at a  disadvantage because you don't want to

End time: 1779.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right so you still can't put up  screenshots and you still they don't  want like full reviews of stuff but we  could talk about everything that they  announced you know the API's and what  not which is frankly it's about time  because so many developers have felt I  think encumbered in and afraid to okay  how do we talk about this stuff now you  know because they announced so much  stuff they managed they announced so  much stuff that I think that to try to  keep it all under wraps until the fall  would be a would be untenable everybody  breaks in da anyway but be it really  wouldn't be good for the developer  ecosystem as a whole did you you didn't

Transcript:  though right so you know yeah I was at

Start time: 1793.26
End time: 1868.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  build and in fact John Gruber did an  episode of the talk show with me we at  build we did a live for John one  discussion it was so much fun and it was  so interesting and it really I think you  know a few heads exploded over that but  the but the but the reality is that Mr.  Gruber and I have a tremendous amount in  common we both love technology we both  happen to be experts on the platforms  that we've spent time right serving the  users and developers of but that doesn't  mean that we're somehow agents of those  platforms we just happen to be experts in  them and advocates for the people who use  them and so we had a lot in common and  it was a tremendous conversation that we  had there and he made a joke at the end  you know I've got to get you to WWDC and  maybe next year because I you know I did  watch I watched the entire keynote you  know made a few snarky comments on Twitter  but overall was quite quite impressed  with a lot of of what I saw not all the  jokes yeah some of which were Windows

Start time: 1869.39
End time: 1871.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  expense and so I would understand why it  wasn't even that I you know there was

Start time: 1872.90
End time: 1951.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  only I think one joke about Windows there  was a lot of anti-google stuff there yeah  yeah it was very in fact that was I think  one of the big themes among the big  takeaways of everything from WWDC for me  was that Apple has said quite clearly  with the things that it's doing here first  of all we want to make it if you are  fully invested in the Apple platform Mac  iPad iPhone and all the apps and services  that pertain there to we're going to make  your experience as good as possible the  more of our stuff you buy the better your  experience is going to be but the other  thing that they've done is to open things  up both in terms of apps but in terms of  services so there's a lot of synergy now  between Microsoft and Apple and it's almost  like despite the one pie chart up there  there was a great deal of respect and  synergy between Apple and Microsoft  products and there was literally no  respect or synergy between OS X and iOS  and their counterparts Android and Chrome  Christina did you get that takeaway

Start time: 1952.16
End time: 1969.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  completely I mean it was very clear I mean  and it makes sense to you right because  John Gruber as you mentioned earlier you  know his app that Vesper that he does with  Vesper that he does with with Brent Simmons  and with Dave Whiskas the new sync that  was just released is built on Azure and  I mean iCloud itself is an Azure

Start time: 1970.80
End time: 1974.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  can you confirm that because that's been  said for a long time but we've never

Start time: 1974.80
End time: 1979.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  confirmed it I can confirm that I can  confirm that I'll just say sources close

Start time: 1979.80
End time: 1991.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to Apple very interesting yeah because  neither side neither Microsoft nor Apple  has ever said officially but Azure which  is Microsoft's cloud platform powers  Apple's cloud platform iCloud right and

Start time: 1992.26
End time: 2047.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so but but it was also interesting that  they were almost going out of their way  to as I said very much make it so that if  you're a full Apple person like I am for  my personal use everything works together  better but also the underlying thing was  almost to say we can take Google out of  the equation as much as possible so you  know that comes with some of their search  stuff a spotlight and how it'll search  other parts of the web too you know that  comes with you know adding these  features and adding these additional  features that it's not so much because  users and developers want to need them  because they do but it's about okay well  this might convince you to no longer use  Chrome or this might convince you to not  switch to Android and I thought that was  really interesting even stuff like the  iCloud drive you know that people have  been wanting for ages it almost seems  more of a response not to Dropbox so  much but to Google Drive and wanting to  keep people from migrating to the new  which you know is Google.

Start time: 2049.46
End time: 2055.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah it's interesting how both Apple  and Microsoft are now aligned in a new

Start time: 2057.08
End time: 2059.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  axis a new alliance against Google but

Start time: 2060.08
End time: 2078.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  what I do like is it seems as if both  companies are saying we will provide an  alternative for people who want Google  like services but don't want to give  Google all that information and that's  at least from a marketing point of view  I'm not going to speak technically but  from a marketing point of view that's a  good position to take.

Start time: 2079.16
End time: 2119.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No I mean and it comes at a very  advantageous time you know because  people care about that more than they  did a year ago you know it was just a  year ago this time that the Snowden  stuff started leaked and I think that in  a different universe where we didn't  have all this new stuff and the  paranoia around privacy and security was  so high that the the fact that you know  you have to give certain things up  namely you know aggregation of your data  to get these access to these services  most people were more than willing to  make the trade-off and I think that still  most people are willing to make the  trade-off but in that climate and with  kind of this increased conversation  there is a real opportunity from a  marketing standpoint whether or not it's  true technically or not.  Well that's my question.  It could be an alternative.

Start time: 2120.18
End time: 2127.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you say that it is more private safer  to use Microsoft or Apple than it is  Google?

Start time: 2127.82
End time: 2136.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if you can say it's safer  I think that you can say it's more  private only insofar as they are not  selling services and paying for things  based on what your data says.

Start time: 2138.67
End time: 2147.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well they make their money in hardware  in the case of Apple and in hardware and  software in the case of Microsoft but  Apple has iAds, Microsoft sells ads.  Of course, of course you know and that

Start time: 2147.88
End time: 2174.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  becomes the big question is to say okay  they are taking this data are they  storing it and are they manipulating it  in other ways because I think that would  be the big question from what I understand  what I've seen I don't think that they  are but it doesn't negate the possibility  that they could at some point you know  switch things around and say now we want  to do more of what Google's doing which  is offering you a more custom experience  based on the data we have on you.  I mean but that's the thing that

Start time: 2174.80
End time: 2185.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's one advantage to giving Google that  information is they could do things like  Google Now and say hey I know you're  looking for pants you're passing a pants  store with a sale right now.  Apple would never do that.  Microsoft would never do that.

Start time: 2186.18
End time: 2219.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No and I think that you know Google is a  little bit ahead on that.  I think that that is a very great that  that's an awesome feature of Google Now  but what's really really it's creepy  though because right now anyway to me  Google Now is creepy because I don't enable  it if I enabled it and said specifically  I want this to work then I would feel  better about it but the fact that it's  just on that serendipity thing that might  be awesome and is more is quite frankly  really probably the direction we're all  moving in in terms of privacy and how  things work.  They because you're not Apple will get

Start time: 2220.61
End time: 2234.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple will get to a point where and  maybe Microsoft to where it wishes it did  have that data.  Yeah at that point.  Okay good.  So you say Christina says no and and  Ed and Ed says yes so let go ahead  Christina what do you or do you want to  let Ed you want to think about that.

Start time: 2234.92

Transcript:  Well so Google's revenue now that

Start time: 2241.98
End time: 2292.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  now if they once the Motorola deal  closes to Lenovo Google will be back to  making 90 percent of their revenue from  information that they gather from their  customers and sell it to other people.  It is literally their revenue stream  is information.  Apple's revenue stream is hardware  software and services they have displayed  consistency through the years about  taking information that they gather  about their customers credit card  numbers and so forth and using those to  make those experiences better.  Microsoft tried to compete with Google  in the advertising realm with the  acquisition of a quantum back in 2007  acquisition they ended up writing off

Start time: 2293.02
End time: 2294.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  for millions of dollars.

Start time: 2294.80
End time: 2344.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They wrote off six billion they wrote  off one third of a WhatsApp and and and  I think and I know and I know from doing  the reporting during that time that  there was a great deal of fighting  within Microsoft over this is not us we  should not be doing this and it was you  know well let's see this if this is the  future of of the Internet then we need  to be here and they tried to do it and  they couldn't succeed and so they said  you know what let's let's exit the dark  side they still sell ads because  because advertising drives the modern  Internet you can't be a player in the  modern Internet even Apple even  Microsoft.  If they still sell ads it's just a

Start time: 2344.88
End time: 2348.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  matter of degree it's not that they're  not collecting information.  No.  No.

Start time: 2351.41
End time: 2384.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go on Ed.  If you're taking if you're if your  goal is to gather as much information  about your customers as possible and put  it into databases and allow those  databases to become as large as  possible because that is your product  then that's different from let's collect  information to help us serve more  effective ads and throw it away and not  exploit it in the future.  Those really are pretty bright lines  that are pretty far apart.

Start time: 2384.98
End time: 2391.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you say Google is not merely  collecting information to show ads but  they're saving it for some future use.  Absolutely.

Start time: 2391.90
End time: 2404.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's that's without question  right I mean that's one of the reasons  why they it's they are so successful  right now is that they've been taking  our information our searches our  destinations our activities and that's  why Google Now works right.

Start time: 2404.80
End time: 2409.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They claim that's to improve search  results.  And it does and it certainly does but

Start time: 2409.82
End time: 2417.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  at the same time something like Google  Google Now would not work if you didn't  have this backlog going back a decade of  information.  That's my question.

Start time: 2417.80
End time: 2426.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Aren't consumers going to want Google  Now like features and I think won't that  be won't Microsoft and Apple be hobbled  but by the fact that they haven't been  saving this information.

Start time: 2426.80
End time: 2462.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes but I and that's what I agree with.  I think that no question at some point  that will probably become the  expectation but I think the big key  difference and this is what I think Ed  is saying is that Google also it's not  just that Google uses that information  is that they also sell that information  however it's anonymized you know but  you're still information about you is  then sold to other people.  And I think that's the disconnect where  ads that you know a ad is not a very  successful product first of all but  doesn't mean they didn't try it just  means they didn't succeed.  They didn't try very hard.  I mean if they did try hard then wow  because that was again it seems a matter

Start time: 2462.88
End time: 2463.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of degree in 10.

Start time: 2466.02
End time: 2475.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I sure but I think that it's one of  those things where you can sell ads  without making the user database  information available and whether you  can be a successful obviously you can't

Start time: 2476.41
End time: 2482.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  say we don't give personal information  about Christina Warren and Ed Bot to  anybody we sell it in aggregate as does  Facebook.

Start time: 2483.10
End time: 2543.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right I mean except for the things like  the plus ones and some of the other  information I mean there's there's you  might not be able to identify it  directly with a person but all of your  information for your profile is linked  together and sold to an advertiser which  just some people is still creepy.  So I think that you know Google's core  business is all about you know  advertising and targeted advertising  and there's nothing wrong with that but  that's their core model.  So as much data as possible and making  that available to as many people as  possible and getting as many people as  possible to use their products is their  business line.  Whereas Microsoft and Apple obviously  they might be able to use that stuff  internally but they don't make it  accessible externally to other  companies and that's because they have  other legs so to speak you know on  their share of revenue.  They can sell you know software they can  sell services in the case of Apple  hardware and that's I think the big  difference is the one is primarily an  ad information company and the others  you know it's an ad hoc thing and if  they are going to use that customized  information it's what they are using  it's not something that they could make  available to a third party so the third  party could use it.

Transcript:  I'm a Google fan and I like Google now  and I don't care what Google knows about  me but I do think that this is a very  great position to be in in one respect  for both Apple and Microsoft because  you now provide an alternative to  people who are discomforted by what  Google does.  No I think absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No there's a difference.  But there's no question everybody's  complicit but when you have so much  more information I think that's where  that it changes so much.

There's companies out there whose names  you have never heard before and they're  gathering information from Google and  double click and advertising providers  but also offline sources.  Yes.  Government agencies public records  private surveying companies and all of  this information gathered together and  if you talk to people who know  intelligence gathering people and you  know people in the government and  outside the government who know  intelligence gathering they'll say when  your ISP actually knows a relatively  small amount about you but when you  aggregate all of this information and  the offline and online stuff together  the picture that you can the inaccurate  picture that you can build of someone is  much more frightening than the accurate  picture and that's the so give them more

The Kenyan.  Understood but there's the point so  imagine he hadn't been turned in by his  employer but that had simply gone into a  database of search behavior that then got  linked with something else and linked  with something else and all of a sudden  that's.

Transcript:  Of course it's a complete but even though  I intellectually know it's a facade  there's something I think that this is  why I have a problem right now with  Google now even though I intellectually  understand that the information is  available as being aggregated by someone  not Google anyway there's something  about seeing it presented without me  giving my implicit or explicit rather  permission.  It's the creepy factor that you don't  like.  Right and now in 10 years it probably  won't be creepy in 10 years it'll be the  expectation but the problem is I mean  it's kind of the same thing.

What is what is his response?  You know basically it's Violet you knew  what you were getting into when you  signed up for this thing.  One of the reasons Violet Blue has a

Start time: 2917.80
End time: 2985.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  particular axe to grind here is she was  a victim of the what she calls the new  wars early on in Google+.  She wanted to use her name which is  obviously a pseudonym and Google said  no no you have to use your real name and  this was a big problem.  Her point though and I think it's an  interesting point is that Sergey Brin  who apparently was a big proponent of  Google Plus and admitted last week that  Google Plus was a mistake.  He said it was a mistake for me to be  working on anything tangentially related  to social to begin with.  I'm kind of a weirdo.  In other words he didn't get it as I  think Mark Zuckerberg doesn't the idea  of privacy and he designed Google Plus  in a way that made sense to him.  One of the policies of course the real  name policy now you could say well of  course Google wanted real names.  It's the best way to collect data is to  have a single definitive name we can  stack all that data underneath.  She calls it their velvet glove cast in  iron policy.  She of course was a victim of it but at  the end she you know I think it's  it's it's very emotionally charged what  she's talking about.  There's one there's one fact in there

Transcript:  they it wasn't like someone said at  Google oh by the way we're going to do  this you've been using this service all  along you've they've allowed you to have  a name that that allows you to remain  relatively anonymous if someone knows who  you are they could come and find you  there and track you down and beat you  track you down and beat play private  detective but all of a sudden Google  flipped a switch and told everyone in  these people's offices that they're you  know in the early processes of doing  transgender assignment your gender  assignment surgery and that's that  there's the nightmare scenario is  something that you thought was you've  been discreet about that you certainly  don't want your neighbors your friends  your family to know about it's not  because it's illegal or immoral it's  because you have the personal privacy  yeah absolutely absolutely it's a real

Transcript:  problem I mean you know Netflix was  sued and and this was a case I actually  don't think Netflix should have been  sued but it ended up killing off that  whole 1% project that they were working  on you know to increase the accuracy of  Netflix Netflix predictions which was a  great program because a woman said that  her Netflix history and Netflix  recommendations for her out of her to  her employer I think that that is a  little bit different than because nobody  can see your Netflix recommendations you  know I'm not sure how how the employer  saw them but I think that that is a  little bit different than what Google's  done with some of the real name stuff but  it is a real problem because yeah we all  have a right to privacy and it becomes  yin and yang you know between you know  how much I think that most of us would  be okay if a service knew our name but  aren't okay with them revealing it to  the broader internet and that's where  the disconnect happens yeah I think that

Transcript:  Violet Blue really describes this in a  strong emotional way but I think also  her feelings are probably and will  increasingly be echoed by others Google  Search is no longer the clean she writes  clean high performance tool we once relied  on and admired now it's a fedded a fedded  stew of Google plus littered screwed up  mystery mechanics running under the  misguided assumption that anyone and  everyone only wants more of their own  location their connections Google's  clumsily guest interests and Google plus  favoritism and the results served back to  them she says Google plus tells us we are  Google thinks of us as little more than  webs of flesh spun over packages of  saleable data whether that's accurate or  not and I think it actually I probably  can't say it's inaccurate I think this  is a sentiment that is going to be  increasingly popular yeah I think this  is an opportunity for Microsoft and

Transcript:  well I think we're going to take a break but come back  we will talk about actually some of the things Apple announced  to WWDC but I think this is a  real opportunity for Apple and it's very clear  they see this as an opportunity  and one of the main points  of WWDC both  with Yosemite  the next version of OS X and with iOS 8  is we're going to get the Google  out even if you do a search  in spotlight now you might have  some Google search results in there  but they will be disintermediated  Apple will show up in the Google search result not  you or in this Google  search information not you  they do offer DuckDuckGo  can I get some clarification  isn't DuckDuckGo using Google are they  just sanitizing the results

Start time: 3396.31
End time: 3400.65

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we can get sidetracked on this for an entire segment  but there's companies like Ask.com  which have built an entire  business around taking Google  search results and repackaging it  putting their own crappy  ads on top  which are served by Google  and so delivering  an ad heavy  horrible  experience

Start time: 3438.67
End time: 3442.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but DuckDuckGo's results  are just repackaged Google results  for the most part

Start time: 3443.80
End time: 3479.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google most people don't realize this  as many APIs as they have there's no  actual search API  and that's probably to prevent more of exactly  what Ask does and even DuckDuckGo  so you have to kind of creatively  reverse engineer or scrape  different results  from what I understand it and I might be wrong  and so if I'm wrong I'm sure people in the chat  or on Twitter will tell me  but I think that DuckDuckGo is also  looking to increase its own  scraping capabilities to offer their own results  too they would have to because if all you're  doing is having to anonymize Google results then  for a lot of people that's not going to be  enough of a good experience

Start time: 3479.80

Transcript:  this is one advantage Google has is a huge  barrier to entry  for creating an equivalent to  Google and it gets bigger every year especially  as Google aggregates personal information and other

Start time: 3489.86
End time: 3533.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  things. Right I mean that's my point I don't know  if anybody I don't think that the next Google  at least in the model that works now I  don't think it's possible that anybody could really build  or truly compete with it  building it from the ground up unless  I actually don't even  think because there's just not enough time  Maps is the same way you know Apple  Maps was a problematic product for  lots of reasons but one of the main reasons is that  Google Maps had  a decade almost of  built up information and  also you know for many years users  themselves sourced a lot of the location  and destination information and that  made the product so much better over time  so trying to build your own  with buying companies and say oh we can just  put this together and it'll be an equivalent  well no actually it won't. So this is what DuckDuckGo

Start time: 3533.94
End time: 3586.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  says they get their results from over a hundred  sources including DuckDuckBot  our own crawler  crowdsourced sites like Wikipedia, Yahoo  and Facebook, Yandex  which is another search WolframAlpha  Yelp and Bing  but they do also say while our indexes are getting  bigger we do not expect to be wholly independent  from third parties Bing and Google  each spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year  I think it's more than that crawling and indexing  the deep web it costs so much  that even big companies like Yahoo and Ask  are giving up general crawling and  indexing therefore it seems silly to compete  on crawling besides we don't have the money  to do so. So  I don't expect an independent  competitive search engine  from DuckDuckGo, Yahoo  or anybody else frankly although I have to think  somewhere in a laboratory  in the basement at one infinite loop  there is a team trying to create  Apple search. It really feels  like that. You don't think so?

Start time: 3588.31
End time: 3658.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no I don't think so  that's...  Then it feels like they're stealing Google's results  Christine is absolutely right  that is so  the resources that are taken  it's an entire business  to build there  very expensive  and you can do mapping  you can do  and a lot of  specialized types of information that you  can do but to be a general purpose  provider of information  at your fingertips  is a massive  business all  of itself and it's  a tar baby too  because once you get involved  in it you can't  let go you have to just keep  throwing  money at it and  if you're competing with Google  for whom it's the primary source  of business  they're going  to break you it's going to be  like the cold war  where  you finally  put the Russians out of business because they couldn't  keep up with  the cold war

Transcript:  know I'm frequently in a position  where I'm working on something either a document  or an email or something else  and I get called into a meeting and I have  to make a split second decision do I take my iPad  or do I take my MacBook Air with  me right and the ability to  pull it up instantly where I am  without having to go through that friction and I agree  it's minimal it's definitely minimal but I think  having a lack of that is  a good thing but I think the bigger thing is that  you know if you can do it  it'll work with iOS and Mac apps obviously  but it'll also work with the web page so  that means that you can you know  send off where you are in a web page or  web app too and that's really useful especially  if the web page has  maybe an iOS counterpart so I  think that you know there's a  lot of potential there for the handoff  stuff but I also really like the fact  that for instance you know I can answer my phone  call my iPhone  from my Mac now and  I can make an outgoing call from  my Mac without having to use a third  party tool or  go through other gyrations and those might be  edge use cases but that is right  I mean the way that Apple  and Microsoft are approaching  this sort of continuity thing and Google for that matter too  are all taking different approaches you know  Google it's always about the  cloud being first and foremost you know that the web  browser is the destination Microsoft it's all about  OneDrive and with Apple  whether they'll succeed with the execution or not  and again the execution here I think more  important than anything else is absolutely key  if you can't rely on it you won't use it  is to make the service aspect  the cloud part disappear and  just make it you know app based  so that you know it will  be able to kind of work seamlessly  but I think that part of it is probably  demo where but I can see real use cases  especially when I'm working on something  and then have to immediately switch locations  and I might not want to take the same  machine with me

Start time: 4463.80
End time: 4543.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that what Apple's take is  and it's decidedly different than Microsoft's  is that we are in a post PC world  but we aren't in the world where it's all  one system yet whereas  Microsoft seems to be wanting to  say that we are all in the system where we can have  the same interface the same basic code base  the same everything and you can access  you know all of your devices virtually  look the same and have some of the same you know  features Apple is  taking a very different approach in that  we can make these things work better  together but a laptop still has a different  use case than an iPad  or a phone and I personally  in how I use things  that's true I think  that it's very hard to say that more people might be  using their primary devices as a phone or tablet  that's totally fair but I think that when you are  using a laptop  most people don't use it  when they're doing things on it other than web browsing  most people use it considerably differently  than they do when they're on a tablet or phone  so rather than having you know the  the artist formerly known as Metro interface  you know kind of dominating the entire thing  it's about rather than having  everything have the same interface and  feel like it's part of the same platform  this is all about you use these  devices for different things but we're going  to make it easier for you to use those devices  together and then at some point down the  line maybe it makes more sense to unify  everything under you know one name and  in one core interface

Transcript:  Let's see home this is something that  Google is trying to do Microsoft's been trying  to do for more than a decade the idea of  unifying home automation systems  nobody's succeeded there's it's a  it's a tower of  Babel of different protocols  nothing talks to anything else  going back to the days of the  X10 can Apple  unify this system and make it

Start time: 4567.86
End time: 4755.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  work? I think they  will do a better job than anybody else has in terms  of getting people to sign up getting manufacturers to  get kind of you know the the MFI  you know made for iPhone made for iPad made for  home certification which is one big part  of the challenge right and it was  it's interesting because home kit has like two parts  so one part is that you can use  your iDevice to be your interface  controller and that you know you can use  that to control everything but the  other thing is you can still have your individual apps  and there are a lot of people who are trying  to aggregate and kind of create a central  dashboard for home automation there's zone off  there's revolve there's smart things  I think that Apple will probably have  more success just because  they're Apple and the people who are buying  right now anyway home automation things  still tend to skew more  Apple than other types of devices  that doesn't mean that won't change over time  but as we're finally entering a place where  you know the idea of home automation is no longer  Crestron and other super expensive  super difficult situations but  Philips Hue bulbs and the Nest Thermostat  and things like that drop cam  things like that they will have a  better chance of getting everybody under  one roof I don't think ultimately  they might be like the name in home automation  so to speak but I think they can definitely  push things towards a certain standard  and that's desperately needed  you know I mean I think that I've always argued  that being late is just  as bad as being early rather  just as bad as being late and I think that as  much as Microsoft has put into  a lot of the home automation stuff they were  just too early and  as they were with tablet computing?  Completely, completely you know and timing is everything  I think that right now the reason that  I think that Apple could succeed has  less to do with the fact that their technology  or that even their approach is any different  but it's because  it's the right time  the stuff has gotten easy enough to use and affordable  enough that it's the right time and I think that  Apple also by setting certain  by making it very clear that all the devices  that are home kit enabled  can talk to one another and see one another  is something that the other platforms  that are trying to  kind of bring everything under one roof have not  done. For instance if you change the name  of a device in  it's connected to home kit every other  device in your  system will see that the name is changed  so that it's not going to display  say you have living room one  and you change it to basement  that basement will show up across  things without anything having to update  and those are the sorts of details especially when it comes  to trying to do more complex  setups that I think are really important  so Apple brings  to it kind of a more humanized I think  approach to making  things work together so that you know your mom  can use it but  I think  the timing is probably the biggest reason  they will probably be successful at least at getting  people signed up. Again execution is everything  if it doesn't work correctly then no one cares  but I think that the timing right now  and the fact that they do have such  a good name when it comes to getting people  to adopt things especially early adopters  will probably bode  well for them at least in getting all the major  players to sign up and agree to  you know maybe not at the  expense of others but to add  home kit support into their devices and software.

End time: 4783.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we're going to take a break we got lots more to talk. Is there any  are there any other announcements that Apple made this week  that you guys that I have  overlooked? Swift. Swift  I was going to say. New programming language.  Oh everybody's got new programming

Start time: 4784.24
End time: 4809.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  languages. Well but a new programming  language this is one  this one just  just cracks me up because  and I  and I think it's great  that they're doing it and I'm  completely understanding  of and supportive of the reasons  for doing it but I will tell you what  if Redmond had done the same thing  the machine gun  fire would have been relentless.

Start time: 4809.80
End time: 4821.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But didn't Redmond do the same thing with C sharp?  Isn't that essentially what C sharp did was  take the old C  out of  the language and make it  more modern and more secure. Isn't that what C

Start time: 4821.94
End time: 4849.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sharp was doing? Yeah yeah yeah.  Basically and  took fire for  it but this is this is what you have to do  and so what Apple  has done is to say well we're introducing  this new language and  you should learn  it now and start writing programs  in it now but a year from now  a lot of the stuff that you've  written will probably be deprecated  because we're still learning  and. Did they say that really?

Start time: 4849.94
End time: 4850.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. That's not good.

Start time: 4851.90
End time: 4855.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No I mean I think it's. Who would write in a language  that's going to be deprecated? That's how

Start time: 4855.98
End time: 4939.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pro no it's not the language that's going to be deprecated.  The calls. The calls but  but that's how languages have  to evolve. You have to try them  and then when things don't work you  you fix them and  and the only way you get it. So  I completely support Apple's approach  on this but it is also  one of those things. It is remarkably  Microsoft like. In fact  one of the themes of WWDC  that I saw was you know  Microsoft this year with  Satya Nadella coming on board  he picked up the one Microsoft thing  where the different divisions are not  responsible for different products. They're responsible  for making sure that  all the technologies work together on  all the products and I thought you  could have just as easily  put a big one Apple  slide. Right. At WWDC  with people saying  this is no longer  just for iOS. This is no longer  just for OS X. This is no longer just for  this piece of hardware.  Everything has to work together  and everything in our frameworks  and languages and  even down to  the chip level support is going  to work together  that way. And I think  you know it's funny  how  although the companies are as  different as they could possibly be in many  ways they're converging on a lot of the same  ideas. One Apple. It's the same

Start time: 4939.90
End time: 4945.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  business. To be fair Apple never had  the internecine warfare that really  I think hobbled Microsoft.

Start time: 4946.04
End time: 5031.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No. Without a doubt.  I mean if you hadn't had the DOJ thing then Microsoft  would be in a different position than it is now.  That made a lot of challenges.  Now correct me if I'm wrong on this one Ed but I think  that one of the things that I really like about Swift  and this is something that even though A there are  two reasons why they're getting this response they're getting  and Microsoft's not. One the number of  developers who in the enterprise  work with Apple stuff is almost  non-existent whereas you know when Microsoft  introduced C sharp you have a much bigger  you know contingent of active working  developers who are going oh my god you've just  screwed up everything I'm going to do.  But the second thing is and this  is what I think Apple has always been great about  and this goes back to when they switched  from you know  PowerPC to Intel and it even  goes into the you know Carbon to Coco  transfers is they make the things  work together. So your Swift code will compile  and sit and work directly with  Objective-C code. Now it and  they will be supporting Objective-C until  you know it comes to a point where  it's so used minimally if it ever comes  to that point that it won't be used. So there's  not as much of a risk  if you're building a new app  to try to say well I want to go ahead and learn  Swift because it Swift can't do  everything Objective-C can do but you can use  the parts together. When C sharp came out  and again please correct me if I'm wrong but I don't  think that it could sit side by side  in the editor and  in the IDE and work alongside  the C and even like the  VB stuff.  It seemed like it was a completely new thing.  Right.

Transcript:  Well different era, different  customer bases and different  even size of applications.  Yes.  So the simplicity  of the app model  in the modern era is  in the favor of making a change  like this.

Start time: 5052.10
End time: 5093.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Swift is interesting for other reasons too.  It's an attempt to make a language that  the developers don't hate.  A? No semi-colons  but also that it promotes  secure programming. Eliminates  a lot of the constructs and the things that programmers  do that get them in trouble.  I love the  playground. The idea that  you can, I think this is  a smart move because it encourages  young people who are learning to program to do  it with Swift. Yes.  And so that could be a great way to kind of  grow a body of Swift developers.  I downloaded  from Git over the  weekend a, somebody wrote  Flappy Bird in Swift.

Start time: 5093.92
End time: 5109.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So cool. I love that they  did that. I personally, I learned  languages by taking stuff apart.  And I was looking at it and I was  so impressed that they were able to do it so quickly.  Like in a day.  It was up in less than a day. Swift had been out for less than a day  and there was already a Flappy Bird. Which may say more about how

Start time: 5110.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  simple Flappy Bird is. It does.

Start time: 5112.81
End time: 5170.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But isn't that why it's the perfect  Hello World app, right? Like it used to be tip calculators  and now it's Flappy Bird. And I think  that Flappy Bird works even better because  you have this kind of visualness.  But yeah, I mean I think that  the guy who was responsible for  Swift at Apple on his own blog, he said  that one of the things for playgrounds  that was his inspiration is an ID  and it was originally Kickstarter backed called Lighttable.  And  Lighttable does the same sort of instant preview  thing. And it's a great way to work  with the language, especially  if you're new to it, whether you're a kid or an adult.  Having that live preview thing is so good.  And I think having it built in at the IDE level  is just awesome. It's pretty cool.  Yeah. Yeah, I mean that's something that really  puts them, I mean Microsoft always  has had really good tools.  Google not so much.  But Apple's really stepped up their tool game  to a tremendous degree.  They've always had really good interface tools, but some of their  code stuff hasn't been as good.  That was one of the things that looking at Xcode 6  I was like, wow, they've really, really  stepped up their game.

Start time: 5196.00
End time: 5217.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Flappy Bird. Yeah, well they've certainly got to  the point where there are enough  iOS developers  and mostly iOS  to go back to my  earlier point.  Mostly iOS developers.  So the idea, I  think most of them are going to say  we don't have to use Objective-C, that's a win.  Yep. Yep.

Start time: 5218.06
End time: 5221.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a nice looking language.  I liked it. I was impressed by it.

Start time: 5221.80
End time: 5293.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was talking to a couple of current  and former Microsoft people about Swift  and one guy had worked  in their mobile division for a long time  on iOS stuff, but he worked on other stuff at Microsoft  too and he was really impressed. And one  guy I talked to, he  is basically a C-Sharp developer  by day and used to actually work  at Microsoft and he said that he's wanted to learn  iOS for a long time, but the  barrier of entry of learning Objective-C  has kept him out and that looking at this,  especially since the syntax, I mean it's most  similar to Ruby and Rust, but it's also very similar  to the way that C-Sharp  works and C-Sharp is a great  language, that he feels  much better about  going into iOS development.  And then that's something he feels like he can even take  back to the decision makers  and stakeholders at his company  if they want to say, hey, we need to build this.  We need to work on iOS.  He's not going to get as much blowback  because of Swift. So I think that there  are a lot of reasons why it's  a good move, but I think one of the big ones  as Ed points out, there are a lot more iOS  developers, but I also think if you're  looking at how do you get the next generation  developers or how do you convert current developers  into coming to your platform, having  a better language that is more approachable  is certainly a great way of doing it.

I'll actually reach back out and see if that changes  anything. But I did not talk to anybody.  But that would be really interesting to see  how that will work together.

Transcript:  Oh, they have to. I mean, that's their whole  reason for being  is to integrate  different languages so that no matter  which language you use, you can use the same  frameworks and you wind up  with code that is  portable. Currently  the tagline on their site is create native

I like it a geeky. And we  should say Visual Studio 14 is  almost ready. The first test build  just came out. I got  a little argument because I like Xcode. Somebody said,  oh, Xcode is a horrible IDE.  I said, well, it sure beats Eclipse, which of course  is what you use on  Android. But I guess Visual Studio  probably is the king of the hill on that.  No, no, no argument there. All right.  Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.  If you've got a new or  maybe a not so new iPhone or iPad  or a gadget that you want to get rid of, maybe  you're thinking of getting that new HTC  One. Oh, is that a sweet phone?  Maybe you got a Moto X and you're going to look for the  Moto X plus one. Go to Gazelle.com  right now. You can get a quote for your  old gadget even before you stop  using it. Those quotes are good for 30  days. It gives you  plenty of time to wait for the announcement,  wait for the new Amazon  phone, if that should come out.  And you'll get top dollar because I can tell you one  thing. Nothing in your closet, nothing in your  pocket, nothing on your desk is  gaining in value. All of this stuff depreciates  rapidly. So get a quote on your  old iPad. Get a quote on your  old iPhone or Moto phone or  maybe you've got a Surface tablet  you'd like to get the new one.  Gazelle.com will even buy broken  iPhones and broken phones of all  kinds of tablets. Give you a top dollar  for it. Give you 30 days to take  advantage of it. Once you've got all your gadgets  in there, you've got cash sitting in those drawers.  Then you pull the trigger, you check out  and they will send you a box prepaid postage  so you don't have to play the postage.  They'll turn it around fast and you'll get check  PayPal or  if you get an Amazon gift card, an extra 5%.  Great for people to spend on Amazon.  I always get the Amazon gift card.  It's totally risk free.  Gazelle has paid now  more than $100 million to over 700,000  customers. They really  are great. They'll wipe your data if you  can't wipe it yourself  or you forget to. They take care of that.  Really, they're fine about that.  I like Gazelle. I want you to try it.  Those gadgets are not getting any more  valuable and they're definitely  like sitting on cash  just to keep them in your drawers.  Not the way to do it.  Get your Nexus 7 out.  $67. Actually, that's not bad given  that the Nexus 7 was only $200 to begin with.  Gazelle.com.  The best way  to sell your gadgets.  Simple, fast,  and easy.  Well, if  you were a 13-year-old  Ukrainian boy  named Eugene  Guztman,  you might have  taken this little thing called  the Turing Test.  I love it that Bobby Llewellyn, who's a friend of this  network, he plays Crichton,  the robot in Red Dwarf,  and does some great podcasts,  was one of the judges  in this. The 60th  anniversary yesterday of Alan  Turing's death was  commemorated by the Royal Society  in London with a Turing  Test. Now you all know the Turing Test.  The idea is if  a computer can convince a human  judge that it is a  human itself, then it passes the  Turing Test. Alan Turing conceived  of this in the 50s.  And  I don't think any computer has ever passed  the Turing Test. But  maybe it's fitting that it was on the 60th  anniversary of Turing's death that Eugene Guztman  fooled  Robert Llewellyn and Lord  Sharkey. Llewellyn  tweeted, Turing Test was amazing. Did  10 sessions of 5 minutes, 2 screens,  1 human, 1 machine. I guessed  correctly only 4 out of those 10  sessions. Clever little robot  fellow.

Unfortunately,  Princeton's got it running, but I guess so many  people are pounding on Eugene that  I haven't been able to get in. I really wanted  to. Yeah, I was really trying to ask some questions.  Leave Eugene  alone. Leave. We want to talk.  The fictional Eugene has a father  who's a gynecologist. He has a pet  guinea pig. If you ask  him about it, he'll say things like,  my mom is always shouting that this  dirty pig is a pig anyway. In spite,  it is a guinea pig and wants me to  give it as a gift to any one of my friends for their  birthday. Now, that sounds like a bot to me, but  remember, he's supposed to be Ukrainian. He doesn't speak English  very well.  He was created  in 2001 and he's been getting  smarter ever since.  In 2012,  he fooled 29% of the judges.  But I guess  we can now say we have  Eugene, the weirdest creature in the world.  And as soon as the Princeton  site is back up, you can bet I'm  going to be there chatting with him.

International telecom giant Vodafone said in a report today that governments have direct access to the company's infrastructure.  Reading between the lines of the report, Vodafone are calling for an end to this.  Six countries have secret cables which can siphon off any data that the governments want.

Here's my only question.  Go on, Ed.  And that's their...  So their thing has also been, we'll do Android without Google.  Right.

Start time: 6468.80
End time: 6493.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but I understand why the Kindle Fire tablets make sense  and why the Fire TV makes sense.  I mean, at least in the US, Amazon's content ecosystem  is arguably more powerful and easier to use than Google's  when it comes to things like music and movies and books.  And that works great on a tablet or on a Fire TV,  but on a phone, you need email, you need a web browser,  you need search, and they don't really do those things,  and they don't really do them that well on the Kindle Fire.

I love my Kindle Fire, but I'm saying I don't know  if I want to use a phone where I don't have the Chrome browser,  especially if it's Android-based, and I don't have the Gmail app.  That's sort of the whole reason you put up with the crummy Android  overall experiences because the Google services are so good.

So I think you have to have carrier support.  And they have a really good retail presence already with the Kindle stuff,  so I don't think that would be hard.  Price?  I mean, they're willing to subsidize stuff pretty low.  So I mean, I think that if they could get...

One piece of speculation that I heard, I wish I knew who to credit with this,  but I can't remember, so remind me someone.  But someone speculated that perhaps they'll figure out a way  to deliver free 4G or LTE data to it, an amount that's big enough.  Now, that's not unheard of.

Transcript:  Yeah, the original Kindle had WhisperNet, and they've had deals.  I think that deal was with Sprint or T-Mobile, which was Sprint.  Yeah, and then I think now it's AT&T, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, it's...

Start time: 6655.86
End time: 6685.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and so it's entirely possible that they could be bulk buying  some data packages from a provider and make that part of the thing,  so that you have an entertainment device that's also capable  of doing communication of sorts.  But I don't know, I'm as curious and skeptical as anybody about what this is.  With the Fire TV, they didn't really make any...

Start time: 6686.04

End time: 6719.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but it plays games. That's the big differentiator.  And it has the voice search. That's the other thing.  The voice search is really good.  But yeah, I mean, I think basically, yeah, I mean, those are the two things.  So I'm with Ed. I'm very curious, but I'm also like...  I don't quite understand. But I'm a huge Amazon fan,  so I don't want to write off the idea that an Amazon phone couldn't be compelling.  I just kind of don't see the use case right now,  but that doesn't mean that I won't because they've surprised me in the past.

Transcript:  Well, if they're selling a phone, there may be one fewer carrier to subsidize it.  Bloomberg is reporting that the merger between Sprint and T-Mobile is imminent.

Start time: 6744.80
End time: 6751.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, he is the bright spot at T-Mobile.  He's turned that company around, and you could argue that Dan Hesse at Sprint has done the opposite.

Start time: 6752.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm sorry. His commercials alone were like...

Start time: 6760.84
End time: 6798.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Sprint is whatever, but what's interesting, I think, is that SoftBank will be buying T-Mobile from Duwesh Telecom  and then keeping the two divisions run separately to prevent, I guess, antitrust things,  which makes sense, then maybe at one point merge them.  But John Leger, the T-Mobile CEO, he is my favorite CEO right now.  I love him so much. He doesn't mince words.  His public appearances are always fantastic. He's always witty.  And they've made some really, really good moves that have kind of brought the company back.  I mean, the only thing that they're missing is a really compelling network.  They are still just in little pockets, which hurts them.

Start time: 6799.08
End time: 6801.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they'd have to unify networks to make this make sense.

Start time: 6802.83
End time: 6857.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but they could maybe do that by doing share, which is kind of what happened.  I mean, it's possible that they could maybe expand and do spectrum sharing deals,  even though they're two separate companies with two separate books.  Maybe they use the same space.  That's so kludgy.  It is, but I mean, if you think about it...  But you've got to get it past regulatory approval.  Right, I was going to say, the FTC is not going to approve it.  And the main reason I think the FTC would face...  And the FCC, for that matter, would face challenges is because Sprint wanted to buy T-Mobile when AT&T bid.  And so they got butthurt that they got outbid.  And so they used the fact that we need four carriers, three carriers is not enough.  That was the cornerstone of their argument to prevent that deal from going through.  So how do you then argue a few years later that, no, no, really three carriers is fine.  It just wasn't OK when it was the other guy who outbid it.  I think that argument is pretty easy, actually, because in every other aspect of our modern tech life,

Start time: 6859.92
End time: 6892.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we're down to one or two choices for everything.  So three is like...  Three is big.  Three? OK, we're happy to have three.  And actually, when AT&T, when you're dealing with a duopoly of AT&T and Verizon,  who basically have a very big, very big, very big, very big, very big, very big, very big, very big, very big,  Verizon, who basically are carving up the market as they wish.  Like Time Warner and Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  I really think that that's been what AT&T, through whatever naming convention you want to use,  has been trying to do since deregulation hit.  They've been trying to do everything they can to come back together, and they're almost there.  So, yeah, I mean, I'm with you.  I see the argument for three.  I'm just saying I think it presents political challenges when you spend so much time and effort lobbying for four,  especially if you're a foreign company like SoftBank, but at least through Japanese and not Chinese, right?

Start time: 6941.26
End time: 6958.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a little different, though, than AT&T trying to buy T-Mobile, which regulators put the kibosh on in 2011.  Right. No, it is.  Because you've got the two weak parties, and they can make the argument, both Sprint and T-Mobile,  that, hey, you need to let us merge because we both can't succeed.

Start time: 6959.11
End time: 6969.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think that's very fair.  I mean, you know, Indooris Telecom has been trying to get rid of T-Mobile basically for almost...  God, I don't even know how long.  I mean, they actively were trying to unload that.  They have another problem.

End time: 6990.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but that's not as big of a problem as you would think.  It's really more about the spectrum buys because Sprint, after WiMAX crashed and burned, thank you, Dan Hessey, in their face, and was a colossal failure.  Clearwire.  They've switched to Clearwire, but they also called it WiMAX.  But since that crashed and burned, they've started to shift to LTE.  And as part of the...

Start time: 6992.92
End time: 6997.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 6998.00

Transcript:  Six billion dollars in cancellation fees from AT&T, including spectrum.  Right, right.

Start time: 7003.80
End time: 7040.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they got that.  Plus, they got access to some of AT&T's LTE spectrum blocks.  So they're actually running closer to the same frequencies.  And so if you look at that, as everything goes, you know, LTE, that's not going to be as big of a problem.  The problem, of course, is that actually Sprint has the smallest LTE blanket of anybody.  So they still have to rely on CDMA.  But that wouldn't mean you couldn't sell new phones that only worked in LTE, maybe in specific markets.  Maybe you don't sell it everywhere.  But if it's a market that has LTE access, you can do it.  And then it would like maybe backbone to whatever T-Mobile's GSM offering is, which is pretty robust.  It's slow, but it's robust.  Not only that.

In Petaluma, it's beautiful, old edifice.  And I have a great ... I have a really strong feeling of, I don't know, affection for the  mail carrier, for the post office.  When I was a kid, it always meant something good was coming in the mail.  But God knows, as you get a business and you start doing mailing in your business, whether  it's bills or flyers or fulfillment, maybe you're selling Etsy or Amazon, the post office  becomes this kind of nightmare in your eyes.  Somewhere you got to go, you got to buy Stamps, you got to stand behind the little old lady  who's mailing 18 packages to her grandchildren.  It's just not fun anymore.  Fortunately, Stamps.com lets you do anything you would do at the post office, right from  your desk, right at work, 24-7, full-time, on-demand access, not just a postage.  And by the way, yes, you could print your own official U.S. postage from your computer  and your printer.  You don't need anything special, no postage meter, no special links.  But it's a whole lot more.  Stamps.com will take addresses from your address book, from your QuickBooks, from your Etsy  site or your Amazon or eBay site, automatically fill them in.  It'll fill in the international mailing forms.  It gets you discounts on all kinds of mail that you just can't even get at the post office.  It's really all about doing the fulfillment.  They even have a USB scale, and I'm going to show you how you can get that for free,  that will allow you to fully automate it so you're always paying exactly the right amount.  Even when the postage changes, it just happens on Stamps.com.  And then the mail carrier comes.  In fact, there's even a button in Stamps.com's interface that says,  get the mail carrier out here.  So even if you miss the first pickup, you can schedule another one free.  Stamps.com, you can get discounted package insurance all with one click.  I want you to try it.  Go to Stamps.com.  If you do mailing in your business, just go to Stamps.com.  There's a little special thing I want you to do.  You might see on the front page a good deal, but I want you to click the radio microphone  in the upper right-hand corner because we've got an even better deal.  You'll use the offer code TWIT, and you get a $110 bonus value.  You get $55 in postage coupons, free postage, over the first few months of your account.  You get the digital scale for free.  You just pay shipping and handling on that.  That's five bucks.  They'll make it up to you with a $5 supply kit.  And of course, you get a four-week free trial of Stamps.com, a $110 value.  Visit Stamps.com, click the radio microphone, use the offer code TWIT.  If you are still going to the post office, stop.  The anniversary of Tetris, 30 years ago today.

There's something called, I can't think of the name of it,  but there's apparently, it's like a phenomenon that they named after Tetris where people play types of games that they see, you know, the pieces in their thoughts.  You see blocks, yeah.  And you dream about it. And that would happen.  I love Tetris so much.  That is, if I have to think about like one game or one puzzle game I could play for the rest of my life, it would be that or Bejeweled.  And I think Tetris would probably win.

And I say, Alexey, what did you get paid for the rights to distribute Tetris in the United States?  And he said, they gave me IBM PC.

Well, no, because the Tengen version of Tetris for the NES was ruled illegal, but it wasn't officially licensed.  Because they didn't license it, right?  Right.  They got it from the Soviet Union, licensed it to somebody for the Tandy.  And then the Tandy developer sublicensed it to someone at Atari.  And then they made the console version.  But Nintendo had licensed it directly from whoever was running the licensing stuff.  And so Nintendo won.  It was this huge court battle.  It went on for a couple of years.  Atari had to scrap the whole thing.  Those cartridges, if you can find one, they're very few.  They're out in the wild, are worth a tremendous amount of money.  And the guy who I spoke actually with, the guy who runs Tetris Holdings, which is the company that does all the licensing and the different gyrations, both because of the Soviet Union at the time and also the fact that it was a burgundy home computer and console market at the time.  There should be and there isn't, but there should be a book just on all the weird licensing stuff that happened with Tetris.  It's fascinating.  EA owns the game and publishes it.
