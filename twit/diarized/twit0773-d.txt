Transcript:  Thankfully right now beautiful Orange County. Yeah, you know, and I want to I don't want to ignore what's going on in the United States  right now it is a terrible time not only you know on top of the pandemic and  More than a hundred thousand deaths in the US which is  Just kind of a mind-boggling tragedy over just a few months  Now, of course the horrific video  from  Minneapolis  Of George Floyd being murdered by a police officer the unrest that's resulted over the last five nights  It's horrific  We are a tech network  So and it's challenging to talk about tech when so many  Horrible non tech things are happening, but we are going to talk about that today  But a little programming note at the end of the show  I'll let you guys go and about a couple hours from now  I'm gonna bring an old friend in Baratunde thirst in the author of how to be black and I want to just have a little  Conversation in fact, you're welcome all welcome to stay if you'd like, but just a little conversation with Baratunde about what's going on  and and what he can  What he can do to help us in the privileged class be more thoughtful  So and more helpful  So that'll be at the end of the show and and I'm putting at the end of the show partly because Baratunde has his own  Show right now actually that's the main reason because Baratunde has his own show right now  But also I think it's appropriate to kind of put it in a different part of the show  So the people who want to are trying to avoid and I understand that as well trying to avoid  Politics and the horrors of the world around us and just kind of chill can do that as well  So I just thought I'd mention that although there is quite a bit of it in the tech news  In fact, I think we should probably start with the battle royale  Between the president the United States and Twitter  Sorry, you want to talk about something else what about that new iPhone I don't know I don't  I'm trying folks. I'm trying so there's an  executive order that  The president put out because he there is a strong  feeling in some conservative circles that  They've always felt this they've always felt like Hollywood for instance was run by  leftist liberals Jews  They've always felt like and I'm saying that facetiously, but I'm sorry. That's some of the undercurrent of all that  That they always felt like Silicon Valley is run. In fact, they've said it explicitly it's run by  liberals the yellow word horrible people and  Oddly considering that Twitter has been a bully pulpit for Trump wolf since long before he was elected  And really he's been the number one place. He's used to communicate to people  He feels like conservatives are censored on those platforms chiefly his executive order  focused on Facebook and  Twitter and Google and  They wanted to do something about it  This happened shortly, and I don't know if it's related  Suspected is after the president was for the first time ever fact-checked  Two tweets about mail-in ballots on Tuesday  according to protocol the direction from on high was do something and  The something they decided to do an executive order that was signed on Thursday  With the Attorney General William Barr standing next to the president  I'm gonna go to you Denise because you're the lawyer  It seems to me has no legal basis whatsoever

Start time: 514.20
End time: 548.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah, and and the reaction of  Clamping down on section 230 not only has no legal basis, but it doesn't really relate to  What Twitter did to the president right?  What section 230 of the Communications Decency Act does is provide limited immunity?  for  basically online platforms of all kinds  to  Not be sued when their users do bad things on their platforms and there are there are exceptions to that

Start time: 549.02
End time: 577.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me actually let's do let's talk about 236 because I think it's important that we understand this and I think it's often misinterpreted  It does not declare that  social networks blogs  Internet sites are common carriers  It's not giving them that kind of protection the phone company for instance is not liable for what you do on the phone  Postal service is not liable for what you write in it in a mail. They can't be sued, but this is different

Start time: 578.42
End time: 648.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is different and and it was if you go way back in time to when it was enacted in the 90s  There was a whole lot of hand-wringing about gee this this internet that we've created in the mid 90s that people are starting to use  Is great for so many things, but it's also just a cesspool  And we're really worried about all the pornography and awful things and it's section 230 of the communications  decency act so the act itself was geared towards censoring the internet and most of the act was thrown out as  unconstitutional  except for this section which survives and  What it does is as you said it does not create common carrier status Leo. It just provides  immunity a safe harbor  So that  There was a lot of hand-wringing about that whole well, we want the internet to be a nicer place  So part of the the goal of section 230 and part of how it's been interpreted by the courts  Over all that time that's gone by since it was enacted is to allow  Websites to actually take steps to make their platforms  Less toxic and not to penalize them for that

Start time: 649.80
End time: 660.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's not that you're penalized  For what goes on on your website?  It's not that you're not going to be penalized for that. It's gonna make it so that you don't get penalized for sense for  controlling it

Start time: 662.04
End time: 729.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little different. It's it's you're not penalized for all the illegal things that go on on your website now  It's not all the illegal things you can be held liable for some of them like intellectual property violations or federal crimes and  recently  FOSTA carved out an exception to  The Communications Decency Act provision we're talking about here  Where you know various sex trafficking activity was supposed to be?  not only the responsibility of the people using the sites to  Spread that information but also of the sites themselves for for being the distribution platform  So so that's really the distinction. Is it first-party?  Material or third-party material and in most instances sites are immunized from  what constitutes third-party material so  for example if  President Trump were to go on Twitter and defame someone which  Many people would argue that he may have done

Transcript:  at one point or another

Start time: 733.54
End time: 737.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That Twitter would not be liable for that you would have to go after Trump. That's how

Start time: 738.46
End time: 744.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  30 works so it is distinguished say from the First Amendment in the sense of  protecting free speech

Start time: 746.98
End time: 820.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very much so yeah  And and for anyone who's interested in a really good discussion of the you know, the interplay between section 230 and free speech  professor Eric Goldman is a professor at  Santa Clara University and  he's  if not the foremost authority on section 230  He's certainly way up there and he's done a great piece on the interplay between  speech and section 230 but the thing the  Easy primer to remember about speech the First Amendment in order  What it prevents is government interference with speech, right?  So Twitter's not the government Facebook's not the government in limited circumstances courts have found that and and pretty recently actually just last summer  Trump got  slapped because he was blocking people from following his Twitter account from time to time  and the  Court of Appeal  Believe it was the Second Circuit  back East  Held yeah, no, sorry when the president is tweeting that actually creates a public forum  And so it's government action when he blocks someone from following it. That is censorship

Start time: 820.26
End time: 894.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is censorship  That's a violation of the First Amendment. So it's by the way, it's so section 230 has been so widely misinterpreted  Misreported by even the New York Times and and you know on every television network  It is really hard to know exactly what it does. It's worth reading it. It's only a few hundred words. It is a fundamental  Rule that makes the internet possible  That there it's two things though  It is that first part which says that no provider or user of an interactive computer service  Shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided  By any other information contact provider. So that's that that you're not you know, you're not responsible for stuff  That's on your platform  But the part that is interesting and the part that may backfire on the president is the second part  Which says in section 230 an internet provider can restrict access to or availability of material  That the provider or users consider to be obscene lewd lascivious filthy excessively violent  harassing or otherwise objectable  objectionable without being held liable  So that's what lets them take the bad stuff down

Start time: 895.24
End time: 907.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right and that goes back to remember the roots of this are we want to make the internet a nicer place a better place, right?  and  To the extent that any of that survived constitutional muster. That's what survived

Start time: 908.46
End time: 936.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it is the law of the land currently  Yes, no question about that. There have been many attempts to take it down the earn it act  I think is still working its way through Congress that threatens providers who don't  You know do some things that  Attorney General Barr wants to they would lose their section 230 exemption  But there have also been other attempts what does this EO do have you have you read the EO because I can't bring myself

Start time: 936.58
End time: 962.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't bring it's really long and and it's really difficult to read and yes, I've read it  But I've also read we have in the rundown today the verge did a nice  line by line of it analysis and so did professor Goldman on his blog, so  for those of you who want the  the  Shorter cut to the chase version. I suggest you go to either of those places  To understand what's going on here?

Start time: 963.56
End time: 966.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the upshot Goldman calls it better than the First Amendment

Start time: 968.10
End time: 979.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Better than the First Amendment as as far as protecting the sites, right? Right? Yeah  That that's I hadn't thought about it that way. But yeah, I could see that. Yeah, so

Start time: 980.66
End time: 987.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By so what did the EO do? Does it did it? It's it's good. You know, I'm not sure what it will do  But what does it want to do?

Start time: 988.92
End time: 998.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wants it wants to punt a bunch of stuff first of all  So bear in mind back to your high school civics class separation of powers, right? Yeah executive branch judicial branch

Transcript:  That's been a little muddy lately though. I have to point out but okay. Yeah in theory. Yes, right legislative branch

Start time: 1005.46
End time: 1030.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what it's trying to do is undo a law  Well, it knows it can't undo a law made by the legislative branch that that that's clearly constitutionally  Not okay  So what it's doing is it's tasking various  other  So the Justice's Department is the tasked with certain things the FCC is tasked with certain things  The FTC is tasked with certain things by the way

Start time: 1030.32
End time: 1039.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's even a question whether the president can task the FCC with anything, right?  He has no legal authority to do that. That's Congress's job, right?

Start time: 1041.04
End time: 1047.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In any event even you know if we give him the authority to to make suggestions they don't have to take them

Start time: 1050.67
End time: 1064.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As with many other agencies he has  The chairman of the FCC who is somewhat of a supporter of his positions agit pie  So it's very possible that agit pie will take this as a memo that he should act on or do something about

Start time: 1065.64
End time: 1071.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's possible but remember there are other commissioners and they have and they're half Democrat half Republican, you know, right

Start time: 1072.78
End time: 1131.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not that this is a partisan issue  Honestly, it's not a partisan issue and the irony of it as the ACL use senior legislative council  Kate Rowan pointed out is that Trump has been all along a beneficiary of section 230 if  platforms lose their immunity  It's gonna be more difficult for them to  Leave Trump's tweets and Facebook posts up now  It's interesting because Twitter has not acted about this is the first time Twitter's done this  To the president and they didn't even do it to something which was in some ways more scurrilous  They've now done it again because when he talked about when the shooting start with the looting starts shooting starts  they they said they put it up a  Warning on that and said if you want to still want to read this you have to click this warning  So they're now doing it more but they hadn't been doing it much and Facebook's decided not to do anything at all  So but that's within there is that that's within their current

Start time: 1135.29
End time: 1142.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  230 right no one has mandated that  Sites do they don't have to do anything right except for things, you know like like

Start time: 1143.94
End time: 1145.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 1145.80
End time: 1185.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right so is it like foster for example that was was  Trafficking right exactly. So so there there have been various  As you were pointing out, you know people are starting to be upset that  Lots of bad things can happen on online platforms and they're wondering, you know, who's responsible for that who who should be policing that and  So Congress is starting to  Draw a map that looks like more and more responsibility is going to be put on the sites to  You know eliminate fake news. We have some  Some further discussion on that maybe later in the show

Start time: 1187.50
End time: 1198.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri wrote a letter to Jack Dorsey  Saying if you're gonna do that to the president, we're gonna take away your 230 protection, which seems to be completely the

Start time: 1199.70
End time: 1213.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Completely upside down that yeah, it's upside down to me, too  I don't think the two things yeah, it's not the one leads to the other. It's it's it's punishment kind of a head-scratcher  It's definitely retaliatory. Yeah for sure

Start time: 1215.26
End time: 1231.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if there's any logical way to parse this but I figured you're the lawyer will let you  Let you try to figure out what's going on and I think right how people react to this somewhat does  Break down on ideological lines as much as anything else

Start time: 1231.64
End time: 1246.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but right and and people may get confused because they'll look at something that that  Twitter has flagged and yet as you've pointed out Twitter tends to be pretty hands-off about what happens on the platform except for it does have  guidelines and and restrictions trying to  reduce

Start time: 1247.14
End time: 1271.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Harassment and and people having terrible issues. I've long complained about Twitter not because of any  Ideological slant that's not apparent everybody gets to say whatever they want on Twitter  but just because it's a  it's a marvelous troll trolling platform and it's  President is one of the masters of it frankly, and there's some irony in in a conservative administration

Start time: 1273.32
End time: 1324.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Deciding that now is the time to step in and try and dictate  What private enterprise is going to do and how they're going to conduct business, right?  That that seems pretty cognitively dissonant to me, but that's that's really the crux of what's going on here  You know  What can our Twitter and Facebook and anybody else and tired entitled to make decisions about how to run their platform?  Well, yeah, and even if you know your argument is well, okay  So you're flagging something that the president posted and saying it needs to be fact-checked suppose someone posted that  John Adams was the first president of the United States and would they flag that and say it needs to be fact-checked  No, they don't have to you know, they can pick and choose  Not incumbent upon them to to make sure everything on their platform is true

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Patrick from from from your point of view in Finland and as a Frenchman this may all must all seem strange  For those listening his head is on his hand  It's face palming

Start time: 1339.54
End time: 1531.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The difference the difference we have of course is that we have the benefit of  Not having everything become a partisan issue immediately  When any of we talk about any of this and it's pretty obvious that it's a giant circus  but  The the thing that I go to when I push the the  thinking about all of it  to its conclusion is a  Concern even by I think most neutral standards because of course, this is a knee-jerk reaction by President Trump with  Little it seems  legal footing  But when you go to the end what he wants  But when you go to the end what he wants is to be able to post things on Twitter without  the  Inaccuracies or the willful fudging of the truth be  Contradicted or indicated as as  Inaccurate and that is to me at least fairly concerning because the issue isn't  Really about whether or not president Trump lies. I think everyone agrees  most people on the opposing side and I  Think even most people on his side. I think that the value to his  Constituency isn't necessarily the truth of his arguments some of it maybe but everyone knows he is a showman  and the idea that he would want his  messages  His his speech to be relayed with no possibility of putting a little asterisk on  You know next to it saying maybe this isn't exactly  true is  A little bit orwellian to me and I'm using you know, the word I'm trying to be a little bit careful  I'm not saying it's the end, you know, it's 1984  but the fact that he would want this message to not be  To not have the possibility even though everyone agrees that he there's a lot of inaccuracies  In what he says all the time. I'm being you know, careful here  It's a concern and  When I push just a little bit further I don't even think he  Thinks if he's being clever about this  He might not think that this is gonna go anywhere  But what he's doing is waving a giant sword in the face of Mark Zuckerberg  to warn him about doing something like this because the election at least in his mind is  Really going to be played on Facebook as the campaign micro targets as it has you know  Four years ago and I think that might be the ultimate goal  And his fear that if Facebook starts doing things like that, maybe it's gonna affect his  Re-election chances which are interest. I should know fairly high. Yeah, that's an interesting point of view

Start time: 1532.23
End time: 1604.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  actually  Zuckerberg who apparently talks regularly with the president in fact, even just recently like yesterday had a phone call  with the president that both sides says says were  What do they call it mutually satisfactory something like that was on Fox saying and  He has a good I got to give him credit. He has a good point  He says we have a different policy than Twitter on this  I strongly believe Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything people say online  Private companies probably shouldn't be  Especially these platform companies shouldn't be in the position of doing that and I understand what he's saying  Even Twitter doesn't go through every statement on Twitter and mark it true or false and that would be problematic  if it did true or false according to  whom and  And so it's interesting that they have  There are many things that the president has said on Twitter. They're not true. They don't fact-check each of them  They pick and choose and I think that is let me ask Bill about this if you like that somewhat  problematic as well, I think Mark's point is  How are we gonna be the why should we be the ones that decide the truth or falsehood of what's posted online?

Start time: 1606.64
End time: 1817.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think this gets to the crux of the issue as it stands now because as you were talking about a little earlier Leo  The reality I think of the internet right now doesn't necessarily match with the ideology  So in the early 90s when 230 was enacted  You know, we wanted to be able to protect these companies to allow the internet to flourish  Everything was kind of new and we wanted to give people a platform  Without being you know, there's companies without being sued to death  But now we're in a little bit different space where you know, you know in order for our democracies to function  Citizens and voters need quality information about what's happening in their world about the policies  That our elected officials are enacting so that then we can make educated decisions  about who we want to put into office and so  What a lot of these platforms have become is not the blogs not the bulletin board services  Not these kind of platforms for discussion, but they've actually morphed now to become news outlets  And so when you look at the percentage of people who get their what they would call news  from a social media platform  It's the importance of that news being accurate but comes  You know is greatly increased  Because you know as we saw with the 2016 election here in the US as we've seen with the brexit election in the UK  Because of the way the platforms operate, you know, it allows for influence fake information for  opinions to be  to enter echo chambers and be elevated for people that aren't really who are busy who don't have the time the effort or  The energy to sort of do their own research or who are just looking for an outlet that promotes the beliefs that they already have  We we sort of run into problems now because I think these platforms have become something  That maybe they weren't we didn't think they would be back in the 90s and there is a double standard  So, you know Leo if you as a content creator if me, you know, I I'd take Republic and part of  Viacom CBS a large media organization if someone goes on the CBS evening news and puts out something that's fake  We can be held accountable for that  If you don't disclose your advertising not a platform publisher. Yeah, so Facebook has said repeatedly Twitter said repeatedly  we're not publishers, we're just hosting this platform and  Individuals that are posting material to this are actually quote unquote the publishers  But there's no mechanism to police that and you are right, you know, I don't know if we want private companies  You know gauging what is and what is not fact gauging what is and what is not protected by the First Amendment  But I think there is a lot of frustration right now among people of a variety of political persuasions  That something needs to change now what that is. I don't know. Maybe it's if it's a pullback from  Facebook and Twitter in the pocketbook because I think that's really the only thing that's gonna, you know change behavior when it comes to  Corporations  It's so complicated and so difficult

Start time: 1819.92
End time: 1899.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think that it's appropriate for Facebook or Twitter to become the arbiter of truth because  That's a lot more than they're required on this at the same time  I would expect tech Republic your publication to try to only publish things that are true and  To point people in the direction of truth, and I'm sure that's your goal. Certainly our goal here at twit to get to the truth  That's that's a big difference, but it's interesting  You know Mike Masnick's been very good on this at tech dirt and he's  Said that the distinction that publisher or platform distinction that we're having such a hard time with his Facebook a platform  Is it a publisher? It seems to be both he says I'm gonna I'm gonna read the quote  This publisher versus platform concept is a totally artificial distinction  Distinction that has no basis in the law news publishers like like you bill are protected as well by section 230 of the CDA  All the CDA 230 does is protect a website from being held liable for user content or moderation choices  It does not cover content created by the company itself  So you can be both  The distinction platform versus publisher its content creator or content intermediary  And so you are both at the same time aren't you  Yeah, we have blogs. We allow people to post to our community forums

Transcript:  We do our best to moderate those forums, but we are both a publisher and a  You know website a platform  Protected by 230. I think the issue that we as a society as internet consumers  That we as a society as internet consumers as citizens have to grapple with is  Where we get our news from because I think if you ask a lot of the average people like where did you get?  Where did you see this story? Well, I saw it on Facebook to them  Facebook is the source for that information  Whether it's posted by the Washington Post the New York Times  Twitter tech Republic the verge seen at or  their crazy  Relative who lives in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, right?  so I I think sometimes it's a distinction without a difference and and  We have to sort of live in the real world and kind of look at the reality and I don't know what the answer is  I wish very challenging. It's a hard question to answer. Yeah, but

You know Facebook are just platforms platforms platforms. They provide a place for people to publish  It's not their obligation or job to in any way  editorialize upon that  It's our job as consumers of the content  To do that and if you want to as an editorial function bill or me on Twitter then say hey  You think so that thing you read on Facebook or true? That's wrong. That's appropriate and a good function of the of the press  But why should Facebook or Twitter be Denise? Why should Facebook or Twitter be required to do that?

Transcript:  Are they even able to do not?  Yeah, it was so a related legal point to bring up here is that it is so hard  And so difficult for the people tasked with the role of moderating Facebook  I don't know if you remember a while ago, but when  We had terrible terrorists attacks that were  Going forth live on Facebook and various other things  Right around then is when a lawsuit  ensued from the moderators who said you know what I mean we are subjected to  So much  That we have PTSD and various other forms of  Health issues. Yeah, exactly worst job in the world. Well Facebook just recently settled for 52 million dollars with its moderators and  You know, so there's some acknowledgement that  Yeah, they've got a bad job  That Facebook just didn't you know want to go forward with that loss so hard though

Transcript:  You do you do so, but I think I  I think these platforms have to pick and choose and since we're talking about the First Amendment  That's something that's come up in this  executive order and the ramifications of a  retaliatory trying to scale back to 30  as punishment for  labeling tweets with various comments from Twitter or  information from Twitter depending on your perspective is that  private enterprises in addition to not being responsible for  Protecting the First Amendment on their platform. They actually have First Amendment rights. There is such a thing as commercial speech. It's entitled to  lesser protection than non commercial speech  But if you have been paying attention over the last several days to the messages from companies like  Nike for example or YouTube  who are  letting you know putting a moment of we are acknowledging the  Horrific events that happened in Minneapolis and we're providing  Resources for people to learn more and contribute and you know  This is all commercial speech that they are engaged in as they are pointing people towards these resources  And they lie in it  Can they lie can you lie in an ad?

It's not you can't incite  Violence, you can't go into crowded theater and scream fire. That's the example that my old  Law professors used to give us back in college. So there are restrictions on speech. You can't commit slander. You can't commit libel  So, you know, but I think that gets lost on a lot of people  because you know, they  You know, they don't know or they don't take the time to know or they only support the ideology of whatever  The person who's saying it whether or not they're on their team their side.

Yeah  Challenging right there seems to be no clear solution  And also as have been made very eloquently by bill  This is a key issue that our society is faced with and potentially we think with repercussions on  our  The quality of our democracy potentially and  I  Think that since we don't have a clear solution  It should be and again as legally has been pointed out by Denise. Those those companies have a right to  police the content on their  services  It's pretty clear that both approaches are  Valid the approach of saying well, it's  democratically should be we shouldn't be policing the truth and the approach of saying we think we need to  in some cases  Touch up on the content to indicate when it might be misleading and the key here is that both  Should be allowed to exist. I think both are defensible both are valid and  The idea that  We would want to as a society prevent one from existing meaning prevent  Companies from putting the little asterisk saying we're not sure about this  Content saying this cannot happen all content must be  Required by the government must be left untouched is what is the most concerning, you know  Do we want to I'm gonna put the question back to all of you  Do we want the government to mandate that all social networks cannot touch the content that is on their platforms all of them?

They're unique. They're so  you know, uh  Widely used  That I wonder if it could be argued philosophically not legally that there it's impossible to  Not be there if you want to be heard and be present  I think that's the case.

Do we want the government to mandate that social networks cannot?  Touch the content at all, right? And that question is non-partisan. It isn't and if your answer is yes, we want  All social networks to not be able to curate anything and touch anything  It is

You can't  Moderate you can't regulate the content there at all  You have to take a completely hands-off approach and if you are involved in moderating  Then you're complicit in what's there it was called the moderator's dilemma and section 230 was specifically  enacted to eliminate that and make sites feel like  Phew, you know some of this bad stuff and not be sued this battle exactly parallels the battle that's gone on for years on

I don't know if you even can I don't know what the answer is  I think that's the answer but maybe i'm just stupid I  I can't think of a way to solve this to be honest

Transcript:  And leo you and then we haven't even talked about it here. But then there's the technological answer  You know denise brought it up earlier in talking about the people the moderators had to watch all this horrific  Content and they were traumatized by it  So you look at some of these platforms that look at algorithmic ways to filter content because  Imagine how many posts are put on facebook or put on twitter if you had a human actually  Look, there is no way to do that without hiring  Armies and armies of people. I mean, I don't even know if it's if it's physically possible to do that  So you look at these algorithmic ways and then you have to look at okay  What are the biases that creep into the algorithms are or the are there how effective are they so?

Although there was the space race and the geopolitical aspect of it, but  There were issues on earth back then too that might have been better to deal with and it doesn't mean you can't  You know think like that or you'd never do anything at all ever about anything, right?

The power plants were still using today and  Bill gates argument is that if we designed power plants today with modern technology and insight  They are not only incredibly safe, but also  uh,  You know very efficient  Well, that is one huge difference

Yes, right before the the launch  So, you know two completely different systems one's a prototype one's been the falcon nine and dragon tested  extensively, so you know, I don't think there was any concern there but still, you know, you  You saw that juxtaposition of these two kind of systems and I you know, it gives you a little bit of pause  You want it to work?

I don't know. That's a bad segue android 11  That's a particularly bad segue we were gonna uh, we were gonna actually stream this  Unveiling of the next version of android google's showing I think a little bit of sensitivity  decided to postpone it, uh, they say due to the  Unrest in the united states in line of the protests  We're excited to tell you more about android 11, but now's not the time  To celebrate google posted on its android developer's  website  so, um, we will not be  Streaming that although sony  Does apparently not has does not have the same concerns and they're going to stream a bunch of playstation 5  Game footage on june 4th. We'll probably stream that instead  um  Let's uh, let's take another break and we'll talk about  I wanted to put one really nice happy story in there space x  Then we're going to get back to the depressing stuff and just look  I'm sorry about that our show today brought to you by  Last pass is ready  And to help you take your workforce home. It's always important to have a plan for the unexpected who knew  That here we are in almost in june and you'd have you know your workforce working out of the house  Far away from it  Far away from security  But the good news is last pass can be deployed quickly in the midst of any event to make sure your business keeps running smoothly  And every employee login  Is secure. We're i'm really glad that we i've been using last pass personally  For 10 years i'm really glad we moved to last pass for the business a few years ago  Because we do have a lot of people working at home  And you know what that means if they're working from home. They're logging in to our bank accounts  Our databases our websites all of the most important stuff our vpns our systems here at work from their house  Knowing they're using last pass, uh puts my mind at ease more importantly puts russell  Russell's mind at ease rustle's responsible for it  IT and security the last pass does this in a few ways of course you all know  It's the best password manager and you know, we still use need to use passwords a lot  Enterprise password management makes sure ensures the oversight of shadow it and enforceable policies across all password protected accounts  We require for us as two factor and we have certain minimum standards for master passwords things like that  But last pass has gone beyond just the password vault  They use single sign on now. In fact, there are 1200 plus single sign on apps that work with last pass  So your employees can log in using their phone  And it gives you an it a centralized view  So you have always have complete insight into who has access to what from  Where that's really important with people all over the place and then there's last pass's multi-factor authentication also a new feature in the last pass enterprise  Of course, it'll use  biometric like touch id face id  but it will also  Use contextual factors geolocation ip address to make sure that only the right employees are accessing the right resources  This is so important  And you will be glad to know last pass never sends or stores a master password  If it can't access your data, that means hackers can't either encryption happens exclusively at the device level before syncing the last pass  For safe storage so only users can decrypt their data last pass protects while providing a seamless workflow for your employees  Account access and passwords can be shared securely between employees even off-site again  That's very important whether they're in the office or remote employees will get secure access to their work applications with sso password management  There's an offline mode, which is great. Sometimes employees don't have the same great internet service you do at work  So they can still get their passwords and even multi-factor authentication  Even when the internet is a little spotty last pass can help make remote work simple  And secure visit lastpass.com  To find out how they can help you and your business stay productive and secure no matter what lastpass.com  We had a great last pass panel  Uh last month it was so much fun with steve gibson and  jerry buckel from log me in there see so  Uh andrew keen we're planning the next one in the fall if you've got ideas for what you'd like send me an email or  Mention in the chat room. I have an idea. I haven't run this by last pass. I want to get a hacker panel  I want to get people who?  You know and we know a few hackers  We have some friends get some people in if they want they can you know wear a mask and we'll change their voice  But I want to get people to talk about how hackers attack  And and how they how they try to breach your security and what what they do I think that would be fascinating  We're planning that for september.

Transcript:  Jeff jarvis on this week in google. He misses his taco bell like nobody's business  So we all got uh, was it last week of the week before we all got the google and apple api on our phones  I've got it on my iphone. I think i've got it on my google phone as well  The only problem with it is nobody wants to use it  France said what are you crazy?  Germany back down. They said eventually they're going to use it the first  Use of it, I think is going to be in switzerland. They've already started releasing  Uh an app in test. I don't think they've released it  To the general populace  Called exposure notification  Um  Are they what are they doing? Oh latvia. Oh latvia is going to use it too. What are they doing in finland?  Are is there any?

Start time: 4472.06
End time: 4578.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't heard about an app in finland because the  uh  The the efficiency of the apps are is kind of an unknown, especially if you don't have a lot of people  adopting it and no one wants to make it mandatory for  Understandable reasons, but you gloss over the the french thing  it is  Completely baffling what is happening with the french version of the contact tracing app, which is called stop covid  and they decided to sort of  Plant their flag the government  decided to plant their flag on this as a  political slash technological battle to kind of  Fight  The dominance of google and apple and say we don't need to use that version because our version is better  There are two competing standards  both of which  Being pretty good in theory some with you know, there are good and bad aspects to both  but the issue is with the french version since it's not  using the  validated api by google and apple  It doesn't have free access to uh the bluetooth system on ios  and  We've had a hands-on a few tech publications have had hands-on with the app as it's been tested. It's releasing tomorrow. I believe  But the access to bluetooth is very intermittent  Sometimes when the phone is woken up it it has access to bluetooth. Sometimes, of course when you launch it, it has access  To it, but there are many time windows where it doesn't have access to bluetooth so it

Start time: 4579.12

Start time: 4588.48
End time: 4632.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is yeah, it's absolutely the case. But for those who don't know that it's ironic because for  Almost a decade we've been saying oh the tech giants have too much control and  In this specific case  It's apple and google working together who can ensure  the the the governments  Don't have too much power  With these apps because they could be used, you know, this is they could be used to track location to  Gather data about you. It could be a doorway to a nightmare  Surveillance scenario and apple and google did things very right. They implemented a lot of safeguards  It's very well done their system

Start time: 4633.20
End time: 4745.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's well done. Although I think a lot of people including bruce schnire who I trust say it's a non-starter only because no app  Is is going to be successful in contact tracing you need human  contact tracers  Schneier's contention was there are two problems with any app false positives false negatives  False positives because an app that uses bluetooth or proximity might make a mistake if you drive by somebody or you know  You're on the other side of a barrier, but they can't tell  But it might it will say you've been exposed. That's a problem  There's also the false negative problem where if no not every but not 100 of everybody's using it you go in a store  You can't assume that you haven't been exposed just because your app says well you didn't run any into anybody running the app  That's tested positive. So all of this means very low level of trust in these apps  Which means a very low level of adoption and by the way in countries like singapore where they have apps that don't use the api  Adoption is around 20 percent. It's not uh going to be very effective  I want to point I want to point out a great article by zach hall at nine to five mac  He's keeping it up to date on which states are using it and only four u.s. States  Have said they're going to use the apple exposure api  alabama  north dakota south carolina and virginia  he also uh talked to health officials at each state and  many states have uh versus california says  Uh, we don't have any updates on apps at all  But if that changes we'll let you know many states are just not going the app route  They're instead trying to hire human contact tracers, which is going to be an even more intrusive

Start time: 4746.30
End time: 4779.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  conversation than any app. Yeah, but the  the the contact tracing the test and trace which has been put in place in in  extensively in asia  Is more intrusive for the person that you know that has been?  uh  Affected that has tested positive and that is important to uh get information on the issue with apps  Or the potential issue with apps would be the mass surveillance it can implement because everyone should should uh  Install them if you want them to be efficient

Start time: 4779.10
End time: 4795.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think google and apple have done a very good job that right they don't ever give anybody else the information  You don't even get the information. It'll say you've been exposed. It doesn't say to whom and they don't get your and then so no  Information is exchanged with anybody. It's all and it's deleted after a period of time

Transcript:  after 14 days you get uh  Basically ids that are renewed every every 15 minutes and they don't get your location  They just get the ideas the ids of the phones that you've been  You've come close to right? It's not tied to you, right? It's not tied to you. No, no, it's not in that system  It isn't in the french system, which is using the robert protocol  um  It is tied to one pseudonymized id which then they then can use to um  Run, you know statistical analysis and things that could be useful  but of course now that they've started releasing the  Source code as they had promised which is very much necessary  We've were finding that there are many  Security issues in the implementation that they have chosen apparently but even beyond that, you know  The the issues with these apps are so many and not everyone has a smartphone almost everyone

Start time: 4856.24
End time: 4862.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But when you need you don't have to have a hundred percent because you want to bring that are not down  And if you had 70 or 80 percent

Start time: 4863.66
End time: 4945.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Compliance. Yeah, but even you know  Even if you are at your target is 50 percent, you know  There are like 70 to 80 percent of people who have smartphones right out of those only 70 or so percent  Have smartphones that can run that are on the os that can run the apps  And so out of those everyone should install the app in order to reach that that level  so but but  The important thing to keep in mind is that the solution that apple and google  Is are offering is an api that is saying we don't know if it's going to work. We don't know if  You want to use it, but this is the safest option we can offer now  Maybe it doesn't work. But if we don't have that which is controlled by us  and and adheres to the strictest standards of security  Then we don't know what's going to happen because we don't know what other  You know systems or government are going to do with these  Systems that are implemented so it's kind of a safety net even if it doesn't work  It's important to have it  But the reality is the the thing it seems i'm not an expert  But everything i've read seems to point towards the fact that the app is probably not going to help  Much and the thing that really helps is test and trace direct interviews and that kind of although

End time: 4969.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If the app we're willing to violate privacy, it could be very useful  If a contact trace if no, seriously if I test positive  And the contact tracer can come to me and say well  I'd like to know everywhere you've been and everyone you've run into in the last 14 days  If my phone's been recording that and can hand that information over that makes their job  A lot more easier and a lot more effective. I don't know if I could remember everybody. I've run into

Start time: 4970.32
End time: 4981.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, and no because it gives you the exact location you've been  But then you still need to uh, uh talk to people to ask so you weren't but they're going to do that in contact tracing

Start time: 4982.00
End time: 5022.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The first thing they say is where have you been in the last 14 days?  Yeah, and if I could say well here it's it's on my phone and actually it is because I let google do that  so  I'm doing it for a reason  Okay, just to prove your point and it's not this is not exactly this it's apples and oranges here  But it's from boy genius reported according to minnesota minnesota public safety commissioner, john herrington  Officials in minnesota have been using what they describe without going into much detail as contact tracing  In order to build out a picture of protester affiliations  There you go  So that's the problem with a tool like this and there's the slippery slope there's the slippery slope

Start time: 5024.12
End time: 5030.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5031.86
End time: 5044.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's france's problem, right? Uh, if if I write an app as the government of france  Apps on ios don't have access to bluetooth  In this kind of beaconing information. Is that right patrick? Is that the issue?

Start time: 5045.00
End time: 5095.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly because bluetooth is restricted for security and battery saving issues, especially on ios  It depends on the version of of android, but some of them have that too  but  They apple and google have said that only official  Governmental or you know official administration apps could use that kind of technology  So my guess I haven't looked into this specifically, but my guess is they're policing the app stores for these kinds of apps  so you can't  Have you know any app doing anything with these because you have security measures on those?  Devices anyway, right and this is why as you said the french app doesn't work  Well, because you can't by default on the system use these features  Tracers

End time: 5115.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  States have already started hiring  tens of thousands of contact tracers  but I I have to say just this conversation illustrates  Why I think it's a non-starter in the united states. I don't think we we're going to give up information like that

Start time: 5116.88
End time: 5163.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but the it's important to distinguish the two we we touch on them earlier and surprisingly  We've had these kinds of discussions in france as well from a few people saying oh, but we're building a  database with people who are who have been  sick  On coveted 19 who have been who have tested positive on coveting 19  The government shouldn't know who's been you know  We're sort of losing as much as I am very cautious and actually antagonistic towards the apps  It for the the people who test positive this is how you solve it public health this requires  Yes  I by my uh conclusion test trace and isolate. It's the only thing that works

Transcript:  like the the demonstrations we've seen and then the  Post demonstration rioting that we've seen over the last few days in several large cities, you know  Whether you're talking to your contact tracer human being or you're  Participating in an app if you've been around that many people in that close proximity  Does that just flood the system? It can handle it in theory it can yeah

Start time: 5195.26
End time: 5214.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, okay in theory, but  First of all, we don't know a whole we don't know a whole hell of a lot how the virus spreads  so if i'm  And and I don't know how much information is handled is is recorded by the api  But if i'm in contact with somebody for a second outdoors

Start time: 5216.34
End time: 5235.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that no it can time it it times you can put a thread  Yes, you can put a threshold and and keep uh, basically record the idea of the person you've been in contact with or of the phone  Who which your phone has been closed to for 15 minutes then it it tags it if it wasn't, you know, you can but that's an assumption

Transcript:  See, this is the problem with honestly. This is the problem with big tech  And even bruschneier says that they solve the problems they can solve they didn't really  They based it on an assumption. We don't know. Is it 15 minutes? Is it half an hour? Is it five minutes?  We don't know we actually and it may depend on what you're doing. What are you doing? Are you singing?  Or are you my pantomiming makes a difference

Start time: 5258.56
End time: 5336.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All of these things are true  But again these systems by apple and google were designed because they knew that this was coming  They knew that governments and health authorities were saying maybe this could be used to help  And they designed them with the strongest possible security features while still making everything  That these apps would want to do possible as much as possible  um  And I am convinced the app well  It seems most people are convinced the apps are going to do very little there was I think in in norway or iceland  a  Police force that was in charge of the contact tracing interviews  Which also had access to an app that was installed. I think up to 50 or 60 percent of the population  and they also said it was  As negligible the if like there were one or two cases where it was like, okay  You didn't remember you went there and they were using gps data, right? Which might be better than  bluetooth and and and it was marginal the benefits but but still it's important to have that those  Apple and google that apple and google system which respects privacy because if you don't then everyone does what they want and we know  What happens but you can't?

Transcript:  right  Very true. EFF has a good article on it where they're pointing out exactly the conundrum that you are leo that in order to  Be the most effective app you're gonna have to have it be centralized and more intrusive and  In order to respect people's privacy privacy, it's going to be decentralized like the apple and google api is mostly  Which  You know is is more protective of other concerns, but not as effective in squashing the virus. So  It just depends I guess  how prevalent the virus is and how scared people are and what sort of

Start time: 5389.32
End time: 5412.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Trade-offs they're willing to make it's a shame that we so little trust our government  I mean that's that's also part of it. It's how much do you trust the government?  Do you assume that the government would having been given this information will then use it in other ways?  Or do you assume your government is benevolent and he's using it for public health  If you don't trust the government, you're not going to trust contact tracing. It's just not going to work

Start time: 5413.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And even if you trust the government generally  People lie, right? I mean for a variety of reasons. I mean they may fear they may have fear  Um, they may forget they may  Not, you know, they may not provide accurate information which you need during a public health crisis, right?  So it's just like in a criminal investigation, you know if you go up and you ask somebody  Hey, did you see this? What happens? Were you there?  Then that information can be used in ways. Maybe you didn't anticipate, you know  You weren't a subject of the investigation, but you provided evidence  And then all of a sudden you're caught up in that so it  It really is a a difficult  I think it's almost impossible for us to roll this out in the u.s  I really do from you know, looking at the current climate and sort of very divisive  Political environment that we have right now  I just don't think there's a lot of interest in allowing the government to watch us any more than we already do and so  You know, I just don't see people installing it voluntarily and I think it would be very very difficult for any state or  Uh the federal government to mandate that this be put on phones  I think you'd see a lot of uproar even with the public health crisis.

We talked about this  Seemingly insurmountable problem of moderating thousands of tweets or thousands of posts on you know  Hundreds of thousands millions of posts on facebook and you know trying to use algorithms to do this  And so I you know, microsoft is going to try the same thing with their  The home page there so you know, I don't  I don't think it will work very well  You know, I like to think that i'm not just biased that that's actually sort of a reflection of  the  nature of the task and humans being able to sort of curate those  You know the stories that people see because you know, it does go back to what we were talking about earlier. I think that  Whether it's a social platform or whether it's a news page or whatever it is  So one of the things that i've noticed is  Algorithms tend to amplify  Individual behavior so if I watch something on facebook like something on facebook if I read a particular type of story  then  Algorithms tend to pick up on that and usually will promote stories like that to me because that increases my engagement interaction  The purpose of the sites to increase the time that I spend there and the information that I give them  So there is something valuable in seeing stories. Maybe that the algorithm wouldn't promote to me  Now I haven't seen the the inner workings algorithm. Maybe that will you know, they'll  Incorporate some kind of counter program. It's like oh you're reading too many of these stories  We want to bring you this or maybe it won't you know have that involved in it  But you know, I I still like to think that  The human brain is often the the best arbiter  And the best curator of information if you know your audience really well

I mean, especially in the digital age  I mean there are ways you can have a judge at a baseball game that can sign a warrant electronically on their phone  I mean the the the bar the information that has to be provided to get a warrant is is fairly low  So if you've got a case at all  You know again so much you can get a warrant but hopefully what it does do is  You know edward snowden aside  Is try to sort of prevent some of the mass surveillance that we saw  Back during the warrantless wiretapping scandals we had here in the u.s.

It's good to be back and I love your your audience as well as you they love you. Yep  And uh, so and thanks for asking how i'm doing I am  Uh up and down and exhausted and a little excited and a lot nervous  Um, I think this week, you know the past literally the past seven days  Have been quite  um  exhausting  For all of us. Yes, and so I think it's sort of  and it comes on the heels of  Exhaustion exhaustion right like months of running  If not a marathon a good 800 meter run, which is like a serious track event for anyone who didn't know that  And then at the end of that race  Coach is like I need you to do the 200 hurdles. Yeah  backwards, right?  So just that's that's kind of where my energy is. It's it's kind of low a little manic, right? Uh worried  and um  and and and somewhat  Motivated in terms of the hints of good things i'm seeing  but also just like  Maybe it's not a not a full predictive commitment to like a great outcome of all this either because we've been through so much  Of this before it is is I mean what's interesting?

Transcript:  Is that the video of george floyd's murder?  Um  was so vivid and so clear  And so unequivocal  that even people like janine piro on on fox news  Had to say i'm this is awful. That's appalling. I'm shocked  Even people who would have normally made excuses  Uh couldn't look at it and and and say oh well  It was clear  Yeah, on the other hand somebody uh, uh, like a person of color an african-american, especially an african-american man  Living in a big city must have looked at this  And what what was your reaction when you first saw it? Listen

Start time: 7942.92
End time: 8249.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the way I came to george floyd's story and his tragic end was actually by way of a woman named amy cooper  Um, and and so the news junkies amongst your listeners will already know  who i'm referring to but there was a  It was an interesting coincidence on uh, one monday ago where we actually had two  racialized policing events happen in the united states in the morning in central park  Uh a black man was bird watching in a section of the park  Where you're supposed to keep your dog on the leash so they don't trash the bird  life  And a white woman amy cooper was with her dog unleashed and so the man coincidentally named christian cooper  no relation  Calls her out says hey, you need to put your dog in the leash and she's like, nah, i'm not gonna do it  Please put your dog in the leash. I'm not gonna do they go back and forth. He starts  Offering her dog treats, which he has learned as an avid bird watcher. He's literally like a board member of the new york autobahn society  If you offer somebody stranger dog treats that owner  Will bring their dog to heal put the dog in a leash because nobody wants strangers feeding their dog  so she gets super offended by this she's  Demanding that he stopped recording her on the phone which he had started doing because she was getting super agitated  She goes up points her finger in his face in a very non-socially distant  as a social distance adhering fashion  And threatens him i'm going to call the police and tell them that an african-american man is threatening my life  Just says it point blank and he wasn't  But that's what she said she was going to do and if you're black man in america, that's a death threat  That's that's a potential death sentence, right and that has been a theoretical outcome and an actual outcome all too often  I did a whole ted talk  Just about the phenomenon of white people largely women calling the cops on black people  For just living their lives and it doesn't get more life living-ish  Than bird watching right you want to talk about non-threatening  Person really? Yeah, really? Yeah, so she she offers so such clarity  And then she calls and she puts on a bit of a performance for the 911 dispatcher  She claims not only is he trying to threaten her he's threatening her dog  While she is choking the dog on camera. This is all on camera  and then she starts  Crying a bit to send the cops immediately  Is african-american she said it like five times like it was a slur african-american man. He's threatening me  He's threatening my life. He's throwing my dog send the cops immediately  And that's the video ends with him thanking her and nothing happened to him  other than he got a lot of sympathy from people all across this country because  This person abused the power that she has  And the outcome of what she did to him  Could have been what happened to george floyd  Which happened that very night also monday  thousand or so miles away in minneapolis  and we have all seen this snuff film this  assassination tape of  One law enforcement officer  Persisting and applying pressure to the human neck with his knee to a man lying in a prone position handcuffs behind his back  for nine minutes it turns out nine minutes  And three other officers doing nothing about it while it's all being filmed while passers-by are saying stop that you're going to kill him  While the man himself is saying I can't breathe reminiscent of eric garner in statin island a few years ago  Who died of an illegal chokehold?  implemented by officer pantaleo  so  I it was a tuesday is when all this stuff was coming out  And wednesdays when it really landed and so for me  it was  Partially, you know, didn't these people see my ted talk like I tried to tell you, you know  Like I put it in a format. I had the jokes, right this sort of ridiculous response  There was uh anger a ton of anger  I couldn't have asked for a better lesson for people who refused to listen  The thousands of times this has happened before  Well here it's all laid out pretty cleanly for you  and and so often as you pointed out leo the victims in these circumstances  are  um  Someone comes up with an excuse for why it was okay for them to be killed  the officer was  Threatening, you know feeling threatened life was in danger. It's a split second decision. The person was armed. They were running  They were moving  None of that  The civil rights movement, um  Often moved forward and strategically tried to find perfect victims because it knew the conscience of white america would refuse to awaken  With anyone less than perfect and so there were like castings almost  To find someone who didn't have any kind of drama in their past who could be in front of the march who could be on camera  And that wasn't the case here. It just happened that way  But yeah, it's uh, it's  Sad because it's so not new

Start time: 8251.06
End time: 8279.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, i'll tell you what else is sad is post-mortem  it continues because the coroner's report brought attempted to bring up all sorts of  Uh, did you know?  Qualifying conditions  heart condition diabetes  They even said possible  Intoxicants, even though there was no  The medical lab reports aren't out yet and won't be out for some time  It's what we know. It's so we know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We know, um  My my politics are very straightforward and your listeners know that so we'll come as no surprise my opinion about the president of this country  But I think in this regard it's it's potentially universally acceptable what i'm about to say  The president of this country does not behave in a decent way  Right, even if you love his tax plan and you love his stance on immigrants  He's an indecent  Being the way he performs the way he holds the office the language he uses the way he uses twitter  the way he bullies victims  it's just like  It's very hard to look at your child and say I want you to behave the way the president united states  It doesn't matter what his defenders say. It doesn't matter what a pundit says  Even his biggest fans know  He does not behave well  And so I think you know  The coroner is going to have a report you there was some delay in the prosecution  We all saw it. I'm seeing videos of uniformed law enforcement officers saying no  I'm seeing a police chief arch with black lives matter saying no  I love that and and it's so rare for police to break ranks with their fraternal organization  So we all know what we saw. I think that there are questions that emerge. What are we going to do?  and  I think for those who?  look down on  The actions of that officer look down on the actions of the amy coopers of the world who would call that officer to the scene  And unleash him  on  A black person for forgery or bird watching neither of which should result in death  Then then I think there's a question of what to do with the power that this country  has granted you  And and that's what i've started to look at this week and try to think about for the folks who listen  to me a lot is made about  You know white privilege and white supremacy  And and that triggers a response in a lot of white I don't feel so privileged. I don't feel very powerful  And for those who acknowledge is why it's so I don't want it. That's guilty  I'm not even have the whole white guilt thing and like it's very useless to feel guilty about something like that  But here's which true  this country confers a lot of  extra consideration  uh and higher, you know rated outcomes  To white people in this country in so many different areas and this week made it so starkly clear  Um, so so what do you do with that power?  and signs of hope that i've seen this week  You use it as a lot of white people did in the protest in minneapolis to create a line between the police  And the black protesters because you know, they're less likely to beat up white people, especially on camera  Um, you use it to send funds to the Minnesota defense league and all these bailout organizations across the country  Because you know who's more likely to get arrested  and you take that hyper responsiveness of the system and you also look at  Questioning where that power came from and talking to other white people  To start working on this thing. Just like I as a man have to talk to other men when I see them acting wrongly  Right toward women because it's not gonna a woman may not even see that thing going down because the guy will only say it around  Me, so if not me there is no check  And so the work of fixing it has to keep shifting to those who are benefiting from it being broken in the first place  And and and so that's part of how i'm feeling as well and what i've been thinking about. Yeah, you said something interesting, uh,

Start time: 8501.78
End time: 8533.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That the civil rights movement wanted to activate the conscience  of white people  And uh, I think that perhaps that's one of the things one of the maybe positive things that's happened  here  But the problem I think for a lot of us is we don't know what to do next  right  Yeah  I'm sure that's a problem for you, too. It's not obvious. Yeah, it's it's not obvious, but here's the good news, especially

Transcript:  This is why I love the twitter audience leo. I mean i've hung out in the ircs, you know, like I have seen  The tweets i've gotten so many people signing up on my mailing list or my text phone number  Explicitly because of this show so I know a certain thing to be true at least about a part of your audience  You're resourceful  Uh this of any crowd you were on the internet before everybody else, you know how to google good  Right, not the lazy kind you know how to do real internet research  Not just that front page or the top three or the the ad purchase clicks that your aunt and uncle click on  Um, and you can literally read between the lines. So now is a time  To use that ability to find good information  I have taken a step  And created something  As as a list of resources to start there are so many people building lists like these  but on instagram  Which is where i'm kind of digitally living outside of baritone.com  My bio link goes to a lot of places. There's books literally a bookshop that I set up today on bookshop.org  Which directs funds to independent booksellers instead of jeff bezos who I think  Go on the limit say he he has enough money. So we've covered jeff  Right. Jeff's good. He's good. He's good. That's good for a few lifetimes, which I think is about right  And now we can support the independent booksellers of this country and so there are wonderful books  That can help get people up to speed. There are people who do trainings. There's a woman named rachel cargill  She's on patreon. She's on youtube. She's everywhere. We are as twit people  and she has  live streams and curricula and q a's and  multimodal  multimedia  There's an organization which is designed for  The white american who wants to do something but just doesn't know what to do  It's called showing up for racial justice surge  And you can type that into the box and they've got years  In the game of just trying to help folks who want to be helpful, but don't know where to start. So so there is um  There aren't many excuses and I think especially with this community  I know the resourcefulness so you can get there  It's it's also a lot of work  and  It's um a journey  No one's perfect. I'm not perfect. I'm not a perfect human. I'm not a perfect black person not perfect man  I'm not a perfect partner  I'm not aiming for that  Try to be better  and  Opening or raising that consciousness  Is going to take a lot of that type of work. There's people working on the policies  There's all kinds of reforms that we've been reforming. We've been reforming  Since we started breaking stuff that's never ending  The consciousness shift is a lot of this softer more intimate more personal stuff and it's gonna require people  Where they are to ask  Okay  What can I do?  Where am I spending my money? What does my organization look like?  Have we ever had a person of color in this position?  Have we ever tried not that have we rejected anyone who happened to walk through the door?  Have we intentionally sought them out?  It's not why not and it's not to beat yourself up and feel like a failure of a woke person  We're all failed woke people's a stupid word to begin with  We're all  Trying to awaken  That's the goal is just don't sleepwalk  As we awaken, let's ask ourselves where we have control  Where we have influence?  What else can we be doing?  And and the lists are long  And there's very small actions and there's very big gestures and a lot in between

Transcript:  The the great thing about having baratunde in our life and in the twit family is that when things like this happen  We could personalize it  Um, the thing that keeps us apart is this the sense of the other, you know and all humans do this  If you're not like me, I don't like you  And so it's really important.

Transcript:  Thank you very much. Leo. I care for you as well. Um, and I a little pro tip for the listeners, especially the white listeners who are feeling  Like you want to reach out to the black person or people in your lives  First that is a beautiful instinct  Um  To express sympathy and how can I help and how are you etc?  I'll also be prepared for people to not want to answer. Yeah, um, just like anyone kind of in a grieving state  You know if someone in your family's just died you've been through a trauma. You're not necessarily to move to process that for your friends  And so use that energy and that desire to help  To uh, you know find someone who's made themselves available to an author who's written a book  Uh, it doesn't take any emotional labor for you to read someone else's book. They've already done that work. It's it's it's been banked  Um, so that that scales emotionally in a different way  um and talking with your own children and your own  Spouses and co-workers and colleagues about what this is bringing up for you. I think it's really  It's it's there's a level of intellectual kind of facts and figures and research that is necessary  But I think more important is for all of us  To get in touch with how we're feeling  And to be real about that  um and to talk about that with the people who we feel safe being vulnerable around  And and work through it on both levels the emotional level  and the sort of  Intellectual policy like how do we fix this kind of level because it's only when those two come together  Uh that we can really move forward in a way that lasts  And doesn't kind of feel good for a few weeks or a few months or even a few years or a whole presidency  And then roll back
