Thank you for joining us.  How many of you look like Lance is doing the connect thing.  How many of you have been playing with the Microsoft?  I got mine on, was it Thursday?  Oh, you're already playing with it.  Oh, I love it.

Transcript:  I like it.  What's your favorite game?

Start time: 282.84
End time: 318.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dance Central.  Well, I only have two.  I have the one that came with it, which is Connect Adventures.  This is the new it was originally called Project Natal.  Microsoft put as adding a camera.  It's actually a couple of cameras.  It's a video camera plus an infrared sensor to a bar that  you go goes below the TV hooks up to your Xbox 360.  And then if you have a connect enabled game, instead of using  a joystick or controller, it has voice control, pretty good  voice control.  But it mostly it's about your body and it sees your whole  body.  So unlike the Wii or the Move controller, it's not just what  you're holding.  You're not holding anything.  It's what you're doing.

Start time: 318.66
End time: 322.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it doesn't just see your body.  It sees the whole room.  It sees that.

Start time: 323.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does.  In fact, they say some people have said that it doesn't it  works better with white people.  It's racist.

Start time: 332.22
End time: 361.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that is that is not true.  You don't think that's true, Lance?  It's about the lighting in the room, right?  It's funny.  I was just thinking about this.  Just by chance, the young man who reviewed it for PCMag,  Jeff Wilson is an African American who happened to fall  in love with the product and just said how it consistently  caught all of his movements.  It was almost flawless.  So I think that's proof.

Start time: 362.84
End time: 402.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it works pretty well.  And it recognizes me.  And you know, I'm very dark skinned for an Italian.  No, I like it.  I was playing the Dance Central game.  So I have the Connect Adventures that comes with that.  But I bought Dance Central.  And that's the game where you got a guy dancing,  and then you mimic the moves.  And it's got all this modern music for the young people,  things like the Kingston Trio.  I just love it.  I really had a great time.  And my kid down here, this is interesting,  my 16-year-old kid who poo-pooed the Wii,  thought the Wii was stupid, loved it too.  In fact, his friends, they were all doing it.  So I think this might have a, how about you, Ryan?  You must have played with this.  Or does this not follow in your...

Start time: 403.74
End time: 409.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I played with it.  I wrote a little review of it.  What'd you think?  It's pretty good.  Here's a question.

Start time: 409.32
End time: 415.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will it have legs?  Yeah, I'm not a Wii fan either.  Will it have legs?  Will it survive better than the Wii did?

Start time: 416.18
End time: 444.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the Wii had a pretty good run so far.  And it's not dead, but you know,  we all heard the story, I think a week,  week and a half ago about how Nintendo had its first  net loss in a quarter.  In over seven years.  So they are clearly on the descent right now.  They're going downhill.  They're not going uphill anymore.  Wii is just not, it's, you know,  I've always kind of felt like the Wii was kind of a gimmick  and it didn't really have a lot of substance.

Start time: 445.38
End time: 482.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, one of the reasons that the Wii's  kind of going downhill is its low res screen.  It's not high def.  Right, Nintendo managed to spend the last couple of years  not updating it.  They're just riding on the initial success.  And because a console like a Wii or the Xbox  or the PlayStation, they're all more than just gaming systems.  You know, you do things like watch Netflix movies.  Well, who wants to watch a Netflix movie on a Wii  when it's going to be, you know, 480p at best?  That is the biggest problem with the Wii.  If they had upgraded the resolution in some way,  I think they'd still be running.

Start time: 483.26
End time: 491.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, look, they made a lot of money on it.  The Wii was a best selling console  for a couple of three years,  but I think maybe you're right, the time has come.

Start time: 491.76
End time: 528.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was also the cheapest console for that time too.  And the cheapest console is usually the best selling console,  but in terms of attach rate, which is what the industry,  it's the industry term for how many games and accessories  and products do you buy to go along with the console?  Because that's where the real money is made.  The money is almost never made on the console.  It's usually made in software licensing.  The Wii was the best selling console,  but it had by far the worst attach rate.  So Nintendo is not making its money  by selling a lot of video games from other people.  It was making all of its money by selling the console  and by selling first party games.  I bought the console, I bought the Wii Fit,

Start time: 528.52
End time: 531.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bought three games,  and I never bought anything again after that.

Start time: 531.60
End time: 538.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty much.  I mean, my Wii is basically sat there forever.  I've never really used it.  Every time I try to use it, I get very frustrated with it.

Start time: 539.12
End time: 553.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We also haven't seen a lot of good game releases  from Nintendo or otherwise in the last few months.  I mean, I'm looking forward to the Zelda game.  I'm hanging on to my Wii for that,  but otherwise maybe Donkey Kong,  but there's really not that much coming out  that I'm very excited for for the Wii.

Start time: 554.10
End time: 563.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is Kinect, it's the same kind of social gaming.  Is it gonna, Mark, you think it'll replace the Wii  or you think it's good enough to be the next big thing?

Start time: 564.68
End time: 574.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have an Xbox, but I have played with it  and I played with it quite a bit at E3.  And my favorite game was Adventures.  I really enjoyed that one.

Start time: 574.42
End time: 577.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That comes with it, so you get that part of the price.

Start time: 577.68
End time: 609.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I was talking to Phil Spencer,  who's at Xbox, and he was saying that  Adventures was the very first idea  and the very first game that they worked on.  I mean, they had this idea from the get-go  and they're like, wouldn't this be an awesome idea?  And then they gave sports to Rare.  And it seems like they're gonna be investing a whole lot  into this system, but still not,  not throwing the hardcore gamers out.  They've still got Gears of War  and all of these games coming out that they're focusing on.  So it's really splitting the system  into two separate audiences as far as I see it.

Start time: 610.82
End time: 660.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've only played one sort of gamer's game  on this motion control stuff.  And it was actually on the Move.  I had one of those devices with the little soft end.  For some reason on the Kinect thing,  it's been, at least at first blush,  it's been a lot of family-oriented games,  which I think is a good way for the company to get started  with this particular market  because they know that Nintendo was so successful,  but they can't ride on that.  They gotta do a whole bunch of other stuff.  But the technology is very extensible.  I think they'll keep refining it.  They'll probably be able to do a lot in software.  They have that company that actually developed  the technology behind it that's still working on it.  And I think they'll get more from them.  So once they get this in the house,  you don't have to keep selling them new devices to hold.  I think it's gonna be pretty successful.

Start time: 661.20
End time: 691.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the problem with that family-first strategy, Lance,  is that Nintendo never really did anything  with it on the Wii.  We still haven't really seen a whole lot of hardcore games  and the people who go out and buy dozens of games a year  aren't taking to the Wii  because there aren't titles that are geared toward them.  So if Microsoft wants to create  this sort of casual gamer thing,  then they have to weight it with something else  that's gonna keep their hardcore consumer satisfied.

Start time: 691.80
End time: 711.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, maybe a problem with the Wii  or the Kinect is latency.  I don't know.  I mean, it's very hard to overcome this very slight lag  as the thing sees you, senses you,  and tells the game where you are.  And while that's not a big deal when you're dancing  or ducking or river rafting,  it might be a huge deal if you're trying to shoot an alien.  I don't know.

Start time: 711.66
End time: 770.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are definitely some issues there.  I think that when you look at Microsoft and the Kinect,  though, you do kind of have to look at it  as them catering to do two different markets.  I don't think the Kinect is intended  to be your mechanism of gameplay for something like,  you know, Call of Duty or Gears of War.  I mean, they've been pretty clear  that they see those games as working best on the controller.  And I think that they do.  And I think that most hardcore games are,  you know, a gamer's game does.  And I think that that's part of the reason  why the Wii has had such a hard time  is because the Wii control mechanisms  have really worked best for, you know,  the kinds of more casual games  that you don't really have to do as much with.  I mean, you know, there are just not as many gamer's games  on the Wii, and Microsoft has that.  They've proven that they've been able to do that really well.  And they're now number one and number two  in almost every single one of those metrics  that you would use.  So I think Kinect is really about broadening it,  making a larger...

Start time: 771.70
End time: 796.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, if you think about it,  they own the hardcore game market.  They own, I think, the set-top box market.  Right now, Xbox 360 is still, I think,  the best set-top box if you want to watch Netflix,  Amazon, Microsoft has its own movie service,  sales and rental.  And then you add family or social gaming,  which seems to me a new category that we invented.  You pretty much cover the waterfront, don't you?  Isn't that the device everybody wants in their living room?

Start time: 797.62
End time: 814.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think so.  You know what I wonder?  I wonder how excited any hardcore gamer is  about any of these motion control technologies.  I still feel like they trust the controller more,  just because we were talking about...  They're very competitive.  Well, think about it.

Start time: 815.02
End time: 820.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, PC gamers laugh at consoles  because they have a whole keyboard  and the consoles just have these few buttons.

Start time: 820.56
End time: 828.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, but then they use those buttons.  I mean, if you see, for example, you see my son,  I mean, he is a master with that Xbox controller.

Start time: 829.04
End time: 835.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But then watch somebody play StarCraft on a keyboard  and you see why they want all that control.

Start time: 835.14
End time: 861.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good point.  I've heard a lot of game publishers  have tested the idea of interoperability  between PC gamers and console gamers.  It's just not fair.  For a decade, I've been thinking,  why can't I play my friend  who has the computer version of this game?  It doesn't make sense.  But exactly, Leo, the PC gamers kill them.  Time and time again, just because they're so much better  with the controls than using a cramped handheld controller.

Start time: 861.54
End time: 902.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft actually tested this a few years ago,  if you remember.  They created a system where certain games  would be compatible on Xbox Live on Windows  and on Xbox.  And they actually did find that they had to shut it down  basically because the console gamers were getting creamed.  But at the same time, you know,  it's like there are different kinds of games work better  on different platforms.  And controllers work better for platform style games  than they do first person shooters.  And keyboard and mouse works better  for first person shooters than it does for a game like Mario.  So, you know, there's no right or wrong answer.  Right.  And clearly console sales have not suffered  over the years from PC gaming.

Start time: 903.00
End time: 920.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Consoles were invented for platforms  and PCs were invented for first person shooters.  I mean, well, not invented for,  but that's where they made their name.  Doom.  Duke Nukem.  Right.  Quake.  My favorites.  Great games.  Wolfenstein 3D.  Wolfenstein, baby.  Wolfenstein.  Now we're talking.

Start time: 920.42
End time: 944.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not all about which genre of games  is best suited for which controllers.  I mean, there's some just core differences  between playing a game on a PC  and playing on a console in that.  And Blizzard has run into this too.  It's the same reason they don't put any of their games  on the console because, you know,  the console is the social experience  and a lot of their games,  they're social through the internet.

Start time: 945.02

Transcript:  Didn't Steam say they were gonna put Steam on PS3,  I thought, or maybe it was Xbox.  They announced that I think at E3.  Haven't seen it yet.  But that's a basic-

Start time: 954.70
End time: 980.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know about that.  I mean, that's pretty,  cause you know, Steam is at its core.  It's a game distribution system.  And that is what Microsoft owns with Xbox Live.  And that's what Sony owns with PlayStation Network  and PlayStation Store.  And that's what Nintendo owns with Wii,  whatever it's called, Wii Store.  I can't remember what it's called.  I'd be pretty surprised to see that.  I mean, it'd be pretty awesome, but I don't know.

Start time: 982.10
End time: 993.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Valve announces, I'm looking at the story from June 16th,  Valve announces Steam for PS3 at the E3 show,  but announcing it, I don't think they ever released it,  so I don't know.

Start time: 995.04
End time: 1005.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if that was when-  Steam works.  I wonder if that was when PS3 still supported Linux.  Maybe you would install Linux and then get Steam on it.

Start time: 1005.26
End time: 1081.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  Now it doesn't, so forget it.  Did you see Leander Kehane's story?  What a great story this was.  I don't know, a scoop.  He actually was on an airplane, he says, in June 2008,  a flight home from Europe to San Francisco.  And he sat next to Einan Baracha,  who was the CEO of an Israeli company called PrimeSense.  He had developed Baracha,  and PrimeSense had developed a low-cost  chip and software to do 3D machine vision.  The system used a pair of cameras and an infrared sensor  to highlight people and track their movements.  He showed it to them, like minority report style,  motion and movement and so forth.  And he said, we really wanted to sell it to Apple.  He said, we think that this technology  would be best with Apple.  However, he'd already had several meetings with Apple.  He said it was the first place they thought of,  it was the most natural place for the technology.  But Apple made him, he said the initial meetings  hadn't gone so well, obsessed with secrecy.  Apple had already asked Baracha to sign a stack  of crippling legal agreements and NDAs.  He shook his head.  Why didn't he want to do a deal with Apple?  No need.  He said, the technology's hot, I'll sell it to anyone.  He sold it to Microsoft, and it's the heart of Connect.  Apple, he said, is a pain in the ass.  Great story.

Start time: 1086.09
End time: 1105.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually heard this exact same story, not same company,  but like you can take PrimeSense and replace it  with company X that told me the story  and replace the CEO with that CEO, exact same story.  And now they're a very, very successful company  who's selling to basically everybody but Apple.  Right.

Start time: 1106.40
End time: 1146.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can add a company Y as well,  who I met with about a week ago and had the exact same story.  I'm working on a profile on them right now,  so I don't exactly want to say who it is,  but it's the exact same deal where they had these talks  and they're like, oh, this is sounding good,  until they get in the room and Apple says,  yeah, why don't you just make a prototype for us?  And like, oh, all right, well, you think you'll carry it  in your app store?  And they're like, no, we just want to see it.  We like what you have so far,  but we want to see one running on iPhone.  Oh, let's talk to one of the other companies  that are doing something similar.  Does that hurt Apple?

Start time: 1147.32
End time: 1149.98

Start time: 1150.58
End time: 1158.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Apple's really not doing so well these days.  Yeah, I guess so.  You got to pity them in their $80 trillion.  They're just so far behind right now.

Start time: 1158.98
End time: 1214.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Every single day.  I mean, Apple, why do people love Apple products so much?  Because they work consistently,  because they're in that ecosystem.  The companies they work with,  they make them take a blood oath,  and they control the environment.  They control the relationship from A to Z.  Microsoft doesn't.  It's interesting when PrimeSense was at E3,  they were in a little back room,  and they were sort of showing,  they were kind of ripping off the covers of Kinect,  basically to show you the guts that they had helped provide,  the middleware.  And it was weird because I kept saying,  well, is Microsoft comfortable with you doing this?  Microsoft doesn't really care.  The relationship is completely different.  Microsoft got what they needed.  They're very happy.  They're going to sell this product.  They should be.  And they sort of just walk away.  Apple, you're theirs.  You're theirs until they say you're done.

Start time: 1214.54
End time: 1232.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, I can remember a time when Microsoft  would be just as predatory.  They'd invite a company,  and they did this for years in the 80s and 90s,  invite a company and say, show us everything.  Oh, we're very interested in acquiring you.  Then they find out everything.  Yeah, we're not that interested.  And they steal it, basically.  Yeah, then they go build themselves.

Transcript:  Here's the thing that most people tend to forget  about Apple, and I'm sure that this is going to really  piss a lot of people off.  But Apple, as forward thinking as they are,  and so on and so forth, they don't really take a lot of risks.  They don't bet on brand new technologies.  They are actually very, very conservative.  Every product that they build is usually based around  an existing technology, something that's been around  for a long time.  You're not gonna see Apple with the first LTE phone.  You're not gonna see Apple with a WiMAX phone.  They're going to wait until everything is sorted out  and the bugs are worked out and the kinks are done,  and then they're gonna get into it.  So something like this, I don't think that they would  have risked it, and frankly, for what?  I mean, what would they have done with it?  They tend to wait to see what works out in the marketplace  and then adopt it very slowly.  Look at Blu-ray.  Look at USB 3.0.  I mean, the list just goes on and on and on.

The first Apple TV with this thing would have been $500,  and instead of selling only 20,000 units,  it would have sold 20 units.  And the second Apple TV, which is $99,  would have been $250 or maybe even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so there's a very fine line.  I mean, I would never argue that Apple  does not create markets and that Apple  is not a forward-thinking company,  but people forget, and they tend to confuse  these two things, that Apple is the most high-tech.  I mean, they're not.  They actually are low-tech in a lot of ways.  They wait for the technology to become commoditized  and to become cheap and to become extremely stable,  and that's when they execute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think that's kind of a generalization.  I think Apple is probably the most strategic  technology company out there.  I wouldn't call them old-fashioned  because of the way in which they're able to put together  disparate technologies to make a cohesive thing,  but I agree with you that they're savvy enough  to understand that there's a sort of a beautiful marriage  between good technology and good pricing,  a good strategy to market,  which is something that you don't see across this industry.  You don't see in Microsoft right now,  which sometimes gets it, sometimes doesn't get it right.  But by the way, that thing about you said about LTE,  you're probably right, but at the same time,  Apple still can surprise.  So I don't know if that's true  that we won't see the first LTE phone from Apple.  But LTE isn't necessarily ready for prime time.

The Supreme Court taking a look at the California law  preventing the sale of violent video games to minors.  Lots more to come in just a second.  Before we do that, though,  I'd like to mention our friends at Citrix  who have given us so many great products over the years.  And if you're a business person,  you've gotta know about GoToMeeting.  It is the way to meet online,  to save yourself money and time and stress  traveling to an in-person meeting,  but yet making that conference call,  which is normally kind of boring,  into something very engaging with visuals.  GoToMeeting.com.  If you're looking out for ways,  as most companies are these days,  to cut costs, to improve processes,  to work more efficiently,  I want you to take a look at GoToMeeting.com.  You can try it free right now for 30 days.  Go to GoToMeeting.com slash twit,  G-O-T-O, meeting.com slash twit.  It'll take you about 30 seconds to install.  Once you've got it installed now, you can have a meeting.  Send an email to a friend or a colleague saying,  I'd like to show you my PowerPoint presentation.  I'd like to work together with you on a document.  I'd like to train you on how to use this software.  You know, it's good for all of that.  It improves conference calls by making them visual.  You share your screen with the conferees.  And by the way, vice versa, if they want,  they can show you their screen as well.  They don't even, and this is important,  they don't have to have it installed ahead of time.  With GoToMeeting, you send them the invitation,  they click the link, it takes about 30 seconds to install.  Boom, they're ready and ready to go.  I just love it.  GoToMeeting.com slash Leo.  Give it a try, we know you'll like it.  Folks at Citrix have really done a great job.  GoToMeeting.com slash Twit.  So the Nintendo 3DS, I don't know if this is a leak,  I don't think it's an official announcement.  This is the product they showed.  I was a little underwhelmed by this at E3.  Comes out in Japan February 26th of next year,  and March in the US and Europe.  So it was more than a year after they showed it,  well not more than a year,  almost a year after they showed it at E3.  They showed it in June.  And in Japanese yen, it ain't gonna be cheap, $300.

Yeah, I'm totally willing to admit  that the PSP phone that we saw leaked on a gadget was,  it looks like a weird, crazy frankenstein.  That's real, it's gotta be real.  I guarantee it's real.  How could it be?  Well, I mean, you think about it,  like you can't build portable gaming devices  forever into the future.  People are just going to,  eventually their tastes are going to move  to mobile gaming on your phone.

And frankly, if I were at the head of Nintendo right now,  I would be starting a pivot to making Nintendo  what could essentially be the biggest  and most powerful game software company in the world.  But as long as they're focused on building  their own hardware, they're just going to be  in nosedive position for the next few.

Transcript:  And when they first did it, I was kind of like,  well, that's presumptive.  I mean, how do they do that?  And how do they do that?  They have a library of 300,000 apps, many of them games,  many of them, 99 cents are free,  super easy access.  You don't have to go to GameStop and buy something  to put it on there.  You just pick it out of a library online.  You just download it to your phone.  You start playing it.  I saw the Nintendo 3DS.  I went to the event and I saw it.  And I was like, well, this is,  I felt like I was looking at a technology demonstration.  Hey, look, they found a way to make 3D  on a handheld device without glasses.  I just have to move this little thing to keep it in focus.  And then after that, I kind of forgot about it  because I didn't see it as a practical device  in any way, shape or form.  And again, I go to my son, the most avid gamer in my house,  he has a Nintendo DS with the cameras.  It sits around most of the time.  He never touches it.

Transcript:  Lance, I think some of those things you pointed out  as advantages for phones aren't necessarily exclusive  to a smartphone, things like digital distribution  and cheap games.  It doesn't have to be a phone to do that.  I mean, by the argument that all gaming  will be going to phones,  and I'm playing double that advocate here  because I don't have a PSP or a DS,  but to say that all gaming will be on phones  is to make the same argument  that the iPad is gonna kill the Kindle  and that we don't want single purpose devices.  I think the DS and the PSP,  they have very good hardcore games,  but the problems there are that they're expensive.  You have to go to the stores.  I mentioned Blizzard earlier for why they aren't developing  for the traditional systems.  And the big reason they told me they're not making games  for the Wii and for the DS is that  the manufacturers build their business  around charging royalties on each game sold.  And they're like, that's not fair.  They could, I mean, Apple sells the same thing,  but somehow these game developers find a way  to go for bulk and to sell at cheap prices.  So I think the distribution model could use some work,  but the phone is not necessarily  gonna kill these systems, but it could.  I thought-

Start time: 1872.52
End time: 1904.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To say that single purpose devices are,  because they are single purpose devices,  they are therefore going to be the harbinger  of the future of that genre.  I mean, I don't know if that's necessarily true.  Kindle works, I think, one, because it's really cheap,  because the content that you get on that  is still digitally distributed.  And because it does something that the iPad doesn't,  which is in addition to being way lighter and smaller,  it's a far more effective ebook reader,  if nothing else, right?  Like reading books on it is, everybody's-

Start time: 1915.84
End time: 1941.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if you have a portable, if you have a phone,  like the PSP phone, that does have controls,  I mean, clearly the hardware is to the point now  where it's every bit as good as the PSP, if not better,  constantly getting better.  Storage is not a concern.  It's got connectivity where those other devices don't.  You're not gonna see a 3DS with 3G,  so you're not gonna be able to download stuff  wherever you are at a moment's notice.  I mean, if all we're really talking about is controls,  that is a fixable problem.

Start time: 1942.18
End time: 1990.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not all we're talking about.  You guys have all said the same thing.  The difference, the answer is distribution.  This, you can hand somebody a beautiful piece of hardware,  but if they can't get the software on it,  they can't get the software they want on it easily,  the content they want on it easily,  it starts to devolve almost immediately.  You know, it's always like, where are the apps?  For example, the Palm Pre and the WebOS,  fantastic platform, fantastic device.  Where are the apps, where are the apps, where are the apps?  Oh, sorry, we didn't get the SDK out.  Took them forever.  It almost destroyed that platform  to the point that it had to be sold off.  So that is the leg up that Apple has,  and that is also the leg up that the Kindle has,  because gosh, it is easy to get another book on your Kindle.

Supreme Court is currently considering  the California adult-only video game law,  trying to decide, as you say, Lance,  in your editorial in PC Magazine,  whether video games are publications or creations of art,  like movies and newspapers,  and protected by the First Amendment,  or more like alcohol and cigarettes,  something that minors have to be protected from.

Transcript:  Pretty much now.  Yeah, me too.  It started, we started very controlled,  especially because he started gaming,  you know, he was eight, nine,  and he was playing some of the games.  I remember, no exaggeration,  when he first got his GameCube, I picked up Rogue Warrior,  and I was afraid to let him play it  because he was like eight and it was teen,  and I was like, I don't know what's gonna be on there.  It's Star Wars, but I don't know.  It's rated teen.  So I played it, there was nothing.  And then as he got older, Halo, same thing.  It was his first sort of mature game,  and I played it, didn't see anything, gave it to him.  So he's almost 16 now, obviously, knows a lot more,  but these games let you do all sorts of things, free play.  You know, as I mentioned-

Transcript:  Yeah, it pretty much gets out of hand.  I stand over his shoulders, I'm like,  why did you shoot that person?  He goes, what?  He goes, it's a video game.  He understands that.  Yeah.  I think there's people who are in the camp  who say that young minds cannot differentiate  between fantasy and reality,  and will start to think that they can act in the real world  as they do in the gaming world.  I guess I'm on the other side of that.  You know, I know that my son plays these games.  I know he does crazy things  because the worlds allow him to do that.  And then he just goes back to being himself.  I don't think it's gonna make him a serial killer

Start time: 2137.06
End time: 2202.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, and that's a really good question,  but I think our world may desensitize us to violence.  There's a lot going on out there.  I feel like video games are the least of our problems,  but you know, the point is that California's got  this law in the books.  It's up for the Supreme Court to decide whether or not  this is a law that stays.  And I had the conversation with my family.  They're just like, well, it's California.  What does that matter?  But once they step over that threshold,  if California law stays,  they didn't say it's constitutionally correct,  other states will pass laws, similar laws.  The only thing I have to ask is now what else gets controlled.  If I still have the right to take my tween  or even my child to an R-rated movie,  because I know they're gonna say the F word.  That's why they rated it R, but everything else is fine.  But do I have the right or will it become illegal?  And that's my concern.  And that's why I don't want the law involved with this.  This is always going to be about parental controls,  always going to be about the conversation  and how you stay in lockstep with your own child  to know exactly what they're doing in technology.

Transcript:  Yeah, I gotta say, the industry's not doing itself  any favors right now.  So we've got the ESRB who does the ratings, right?  And they actually put a lot of detail  on the backside of these games.  The front side, they all say mature,  so they all seem the same.  They're not the same.  But I went to GameStop.com to just sort of see,  well, what is the real world out there?  What are other people seeing, maybe,  who aren't as familiar with the gaming world?  And if you go in, and if you go into role-playing games,  you see the very first page, the full first page of games,  all the most popular games,  all the games they're pushing are the mature games.  Next page, most of them mature.  It gives you the sense that all the games are mature,  and gaming is this dark world.  And that's really not the case.  But good luck on GameStop finding an organization  of games by rating.  They don't even show you that.  So why not make it so it's not so scary  for these people who are trying to legislate  instead of have a conversation?

Let's go, come on, get out.  And a lot of times, it's an argument.  I mean, I do try and drag him out.  I drag my daughter outside as often as possible.  But the lore of the digital world,  the lore of the bits and bytes  is so strong for everybody.  It's very compelling.  It is very compelling.  And we get, the other thing,  and I don't wanna go off on a really crazy tangent,  but the socialization of technology is part of the reason  that we're all spending so much time on it.  So now everything we do, including gaming,  and I think that my son, when he plays on the Xbox 360,  is playing Xbox Live.  He's dealing with people all around the world,  people he deals with every day.  He's dealing with his friends.  He's talking to them.  They're playing, they're actually in group games.

One is that they couldn't get the home button  in just the right color.  One is that they couldn't get the paint  for the white casing in just the right color.

But what I liked about it was that the back was white  and the front was black.  Right.  And I actually liked that because even though you  didn't really think about it, the front being black  kind of hid all of the sensors on the front of the face.  And it made a lot of the details and the mechanics up there  a little bit less obvious.  On the white phone, it looks kind of crazy.  Because at the top, you've got the proximity sensor,  the camera, the earpiece.  And the whole thing looks like a really old school iPod  in not the best way.

And there's a lawsuit, I imagine this will end up being a class action lawsuit about  the iPhone, iPhone 3G owners who upgraded to OS 4.0 and basically turned their phone  into a turtle, into just horrible, useless.  And there's no downgrade.  Apple said they fixed it with a 4.1.  I don't see any evidence.  Wouldn't you be furious if you had a 3G and you upgrade?  See you guys, you're all using iPhone 4s or whatever, so you don't care.  But I just think it's terrifying.

Transcript:  I agree.  I'm not giving Apple an out here.  I'm just saying, again, on the one hand, they're supporting further into the past, which is  a good thing.  And they are the company who single-handedly said, no, you are entitled to phone upgrades  in the future.  And you should be able to have the latest version of the operating system running on  your older phone.  And that shouldn't cost you any money.  And that's not something that the carrier should be involved with.  But on the other hand, they clearly haven't fulfilled that promise here.  I mean, they needed to devote the resources to the iOS team to make sure that 3G performance  is good.  And they have not done that.

I believe they said that this was something people could do.  And I guess, as usual with software, when people put things on the phone, there are  variables.  The thing about Apple sometimes in these situations is that they tend to ignore, obfuscate, whatever  they can until they finally have to go, yeah, we made a mistake here.  And when you have a very successful product like the iPhone 3GS, and you're going to have  a lot of users who get very excited about the next thing and the features that you're  going to get from this upgrade, and then you pump them in this way, you're going to have  problems.

Did Apple do this on purpose to force people to upgrade?  And I said, well, how do you know?  I don't know.  I don't think.  I said, is it relevant?  He said, yeah, it's relevant.  It's hell yeah, it's relevant.  It's the big question.  Is this kind of some sort of sleazy attempt to force people to upgrade?  I don't think it is.  I don't think so.

And this is just, I think they didn't just, they just didn't spend the time to get it  right and that sucks.  But I think there are a lot better ways to force people to upgrade to the iPhone 4 than  making the iPhone 3G run a little bit slower.  Yeah, I think you're right.

Let me push that button again.  I was sorry about that.  Lance, I didn't mean to turn you into an Audible ad.  If you're listening to a podcast, presumably you like listening.  Audible is a great way to get a lot more reading done.  As we all get busy, this is what you were talking about, Lance.

I've read over 400 books.  Those are books probably I wouldn't have had time to read if I had an actual paper book  or even a Kindle book because I listen in the car.  I listen at the gym.  I listen when I'm doing housework.  I listen when I'm walking the dog.  I even listen in the hot tub.  Oh, look, rendezvous with Rama.  One of the things Audible has done, they know that a lot of the great science fiction classics  haven't yet been made into audio books.  They just weren't made into audio books in the original form.  They have a program, they call it Audible Frontiers, in which they record these great  classic books.  Arthur C. Clarke's absolutely wonderful Rendezvous with Rama just came out on Audible Frontiers.  This could be your book, free.  They also have Childhood's End.  Let's do a two book deal because this is a good one.  If you haven't read Childhood's End or Rendezvous with Rama or you haven't read them in a while,  they're out now in audio and you can get them absolutely free if you go to audible.com  slash twit two, audible.com slash twit two.

Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury also just came out now on audio.  Audible.com but it's not just science fiction.  It's nonfiction.  It's current bestsellers.  It's Baba Bui's biography by Gary Del Bate.  If you're a Howard fan, you might want to hear it.  They call me Baba Bui.  I think I'll skip that one if you don't mind.  That's the point is everything is here.  My next read, by the way, Keith Richards Life.  I downloaded it.  23 hours of and then Mick said to me, look at that bird over there.  I'm going to never mind.  Audible.com slash twit two.  They play on the iPhone, the iPad, the iPod, of course, on your Zoom.  Android phones is a great app for Android and Apple phones.  It lets you listen to any of your iPod books and don't forget the big half off sale going  on right now.  Audible.com.  For your first two books, absolutely free.  Then once you remember, you can go get the half price books.  We thank them for their support of this week in tech and the entire network.  So a little border dispute for Google.  Google says it's the US government's fault.  It's a Google Maps.  I never really thought about this, but when you start publishing maps, dude, you got a  responsibility.  Wall Street Journal says that Nicaragua and Costa Rica are fighting over the border and  a Nicaraguan commander justified a raid into Costa Rica by using Google Maps.  This is invasion by Googling.  The sovereignty apparently is in dispute.  The Foreign Minister of Costa Rica has written to Google asking for changes.  Spokesperson for Google says we got the data from the US government, but it's justification  for you could have an international incident by following the Google Maps.

And the US government does not always up to date.  You know, I talk about one hand not knowing what the other is doing.  All the data the US government has about various things is typically in stovepipes.  I mean, they don't share all that well.  So I'm sure if we look hard enough, we can find other mistakes.

Gingerbread, some people are saying, is designed directly, especially for tablets.  But then what's honeycomb?  Because I actually thought honeycomb was the one that was designed for tablets.  And when I took to Lenovo, they seemed to be under that impression too because they  basically wanted to wait for honeycomb before they made a Lenovo tablet.

Samsung, with the Galaxy S or the Galaxy Tab built out like their own apps and they did  their own customizations to make it look fine on a seven inch screen.  But when I asked them about when they would be supporting, you know, this rumored Google  tablet OS, I mean, maybe they were just being coy, but they seemed like, you know, we'll  do, we'll work with them and we have in the past.  We'll just see what they come up with.

Everybody's probably going to build more customized interfaces for these tablets.  But I think the big question for us is what do we end up seeing at CES 2011?  Will we see a lot of Gingerbread tablets?  Will we see a smattering of Honeycomb?  Will we see all-  God, you guys are making me so hungry.  What's that?  Nice.  No, I'm not kidding.

Well, yeah, that's-  Slippery.  Slippery.  Does it work all right?  2.2, do the apps look okay?  Do they scale well to that seven inch screen?  How does it work?  So I think that was kind of coming.

I just feel like if you're going to go for a tablet, which is a full function device,  you want something big enough that you can put both fingers, both hands on the screen  So it can be a productivity device.  You can show larger images.  You can draw on the screen.  You can just get more done with a 9.7 inch than you do with a seven inch device, which  kind of tries to split the difference.  But you don't, I just don't feel like you've gained that much.  It was interesting that Steve Jobs did all that math with the amount of screen space  you actually lose.  Yes, it's 50%.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's a big deal.  So what can I say?  I own both a Kindle and an iPad and I read on my Kindle and I do a ton of other stuff  on my iPad.  I would not be happy if I had to, for example, draw on just a seven inch screen.  I'm so glad they made it at the size that they did.

We pump information into you and you don't give us any information back.  So finally, they addressed this by changing their contact API so that Facebook could no  longer scrape Google Contacts for information.  Was this the right thing to do?

Start time: 3926.59
End time: 3954.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Google needs Facebook more than Facebook needs Google in that respect.  A lot of people have multiple email accounts.  Gmail users tend to be...  This is a blanket generalization, but I would say if you have at gmail.com at the end of  your name, you're probably a little more tech savvy than someone who's still rocking a Yahoo  or Hotmail account.  I would guess that the majority of those people already have Facebook accounts.  So this isn't really going to be hurting too many people.

Transcript:  If you swap these guys out in this situation and it was Google scraping or crawling through  Facebook, and Facebook shut them down, I don't think that anyone would feel like there was  some love lost there.  These guys have their data and Facebook, I think, is a little bit more stingy with that  data than most.  If you look at Facebook's export tool, they just released that.  In terms of how long they've been around, they just got to this in the last eight months,  I think, or six months, that you could export all of your Facebook data.  To them, they really are like a one-way street.  They want everything coming into them.  They want to build their own internet.

Transcript:  Here's what it looks like.  These are the most recent announcements for Facebook places and then the Facebook deals  and even the new API, the location API, now you can write to.  It's almost as if they're saying to Foursquare and Gowalla and Yelp and Looped, yeah, just  come on in.  We'll be your big umbrella for location services.  You can use us.  Of course, Foursquare is not going to say no.  They have to because so many of their users are.  Foursquare continues to grow.  I don't know that they have to.  You think it's a mistake for them to work with places?

Start time: 4047.02
End time: 4071.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think that they have to though?  I think they do.  I think they do.  Twitter didn't have to work with Facebook early on.  Twitter was able, and granted Facebook was not at the place that they are today when  Twitter was getting started in 2006, 2007, but Facebook was still really big even then.  Twitter did just fine not having to build everything off of Facebook.  Yeah, I guess you're right.

Start time: 4072.04
End time: 4094.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Foursquare has actually been a holdout on all of this.  For these new places announcements, they're saying they're not buying into the whole we'll  completely write everything in.  I mean, you can post a Foursquare check into your Facebook profile, but then that brings  you back to the Foursquare page.  So I think Foursquare maybe will hold out for as long as they can.

Start time: 4097.32
End time: 4124.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to tell you that the whole when Facebook announced places and then they had Foursquare  go up and Foursquare didn't say anything.  I mean, they were there symbolically, but they didn't have any announcements or anything  of substance.  I mean, that actually spoke volumes to me.  They are at best uneasy allies.  I think Foursquare would...  Well, I'm sure they're uneasy.  Yeah, well, and even allies I'm not even sure of.  Foursquare would be really foolish, I think.

Start time: 4128.22
End time: 4153.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, when you check in now on Foursquare, if you use the Foursquare app on Facebook,  it'll show up on your Facebook.  And when they announced the fact that they now have a write API, I think Foursquare was  on that list of maybe that was fallacious, but was on that screen of logos of people  who will be using the write API, which means you check in on Foursquare and your location  shows up now properly in Facebook.  It's as if you checked in in places.

Transcript:  And it's really tricky.  I see this all the time and there are so many new startups that come up and they try to  base all their stuff on Facebook.  And I totally understand why.  It's a huge opportunity, but at the same time, it is the same problem that any company has  when they are beholden to someone else's platform.  If you're going to be an iPhone app software developer and that's all you're going to do,  huge opportunity there.  But if Apple decides that they don't like your app for whatever stupid reason, fair  or unfair, you're screwed.  Your business is done.

Start time: 4223.54
End time: 4250.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well technically I already have that.  Facebook is an open platform.  We have a Facebook app in so far as when you add a product to your want list, you can post  status update on Facebook.  And there are also semi-open standards like Facebook's open graph protocol where if you  hit a Facebook like button on a page like a gadget page for the iPhone 4 or whatever,  it will show product data and stuff in your Facebook stream.

Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's the risk that you take these days with doing a lot of this integration.  And it's tricky.  I get a lot of people kind of who think it's really weird that I have a web startup now  where the only login mechanism is not Facebook.  Right.  Like you can log in with a gadget username or you can log into Facebook.  A lot of companies now, they just all you can do is log into Facebook.  That to me is weird that Facebook would own your entire user site and that you wouldn't  even be giving people the choice to not use Facebook.  Well, you wouldn't want that, obviously.

End time: 4338.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  So I agree with you.  Facebook is making a grab for the Internet, essentially.  They would like it all to come through Facebook.  And it's a honeypot because if you mean that's a half a billion users they can offer you  potentially.  And boy, we all know.  I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the like button, it's much more successful  than any other kind of social sharing.  A like button on your blog post is going to drive a lot of traffic.  Is it not?

Start time: 4339.06
End time: 4355.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think it depends on your site and your audience.  I mean, we get more traffic from Twitter than Facebook.  Oh, that's interesting.

Google goes out and grabs everything and then Facebook just waits for you to come to them.  They're both still keeping records of everything on the Internet.  It's just a different way of going about doing that.  Yeah, that's true.

Music industry said we tried to settle with her for five thousand dollars.  She just ignored us.  So we had to take her to court.  And they keep giving her different awards and it goes on more.  Try well on Wednesday, a federal jury said Jami Thomas, you owe sixty two thousand five  hundred dollars for every song you shared on the Internet.  That's a total of one point five million dollars.  This is the third jury to consider damages.  I don't know if it's over yet.  She says, I can't pay anything zero.  You're going to get zero.  Yeah, good luck in that money.  Any amount I pay to them is money that I could use to feed my children.  Any amount I could pay to them is money I could use to clothe my kids and pay my mortgage  so my kids have a place to sleep.

Well, yeah, the law says you can go up to one hundred and fifty thousand per song,  according to the story.  And I saw the the the R.A.A.  was pushing for that.  And the the judge said, no, that doesn't make sense.  But even sixty two sixty two thousand five hundred dollars per song,  I can't there is no song that takes that much money to create.  So what where what does that number mean?  I mean, I think you could buy it.  You could buy a Mac Pro.  You could buy the software used to creating by all the instruments.  And it won't it won't come up to sixty two thousand dollars.  Great.  What is that?  There you go.

The judge said, I gave I gave the jury incorrect instructions.  So another jury found her guilty again.  Then they said eighty thousand a song.  The judge said that figure is monstrous and shocking and reduced the penalty to  fifty four thousand dollars.  The R.I.A.A.  rejected that decision.  They said they'd settle for twenty five grand.  She said, no way.  So trial number three, and now she owes one and a half million.  I just don't it seems like just.  Is this the way is this the way to save the music industry really?

Transcript:  My name is Mark and this is my voicemail.  You just call five, five, five, one, two, one, two.  Before I do that, I do want to mention our good friends at Ford, the folks who make the incredible Ford SYNC.  We talk so much about I'm driving it every day.  I drive my 2010 Mustang and I love the SYNC.  But the other day when I was at Blog World, I drove the Ford Edge and now my wife is killing me.  She says, I got to have an edge. I said, I just bought you a car.  She said, I want an edge. I want an edge.  It's the most high tech Ford out there.  It grabs attention as well as it grabs the road.  Let me tell you, beautiful swoopy doopy.  Look at it. The beautiful lines of the edge.  But when you get inside, you just get this feeling, you know, the fit, the finish, solid, beautiful instrument panel looks actually kind of like my Mustang, obviously influenced by it.  The center stack, the door trim.  And of course, the my Ford Touch, which puts two screens behind the wheel and then another big screen in the center console.  Oh, I was just talking to somebody who got an edge.  They tried a lot of cars. I said, why did you get the edges?  Tell me because I'm going to be talking about this on Twitter today.  And they said the legroom in the second row.  We tried them all and it is the most comfortable in the back row.  The available automatic Vista roof for the front and the fixed rear skylight for the back.  So everybody gets to see the stars ambient lighting.  The 2011 edge has incredible V6 highway fuel efficiency that the advanced three and a half liter TVC TV six engine.  Big engine, 285 horsepower, but unsurpassed fuel economy in the class.  Twenty seven highway miles, EP estimates per gallon.  Then there's the sport model with 305 horsepower, 280 foot pounds of torque.  I don't know what that means, but I know it's good.  280 foot pounds of torque.  I might make that my handle on World of Warcraft.  Hi, I'm tanking today.  I'll be 280 foot pounds of torque.  Also sport tuned suspension, the 22 inch polished aluminum wheels is just great.  The eight inch touch screen, the my Ford touch.  If you've used sync before, you'll know how great it is.  If you haven't, you just have to try it.  And here's what you do. You go.  I got to warn you.  You're going to fall in love with this vehicle.  You go to your Ford dealer.  You drive one this week. Take it.  Say I want to see the new 2011 edge and I want to try the Ford touch.  So you've got this two screens, right?  The left screen can display and you could switch through it or by voice.  You could tell it what display fuel economy, mechanical status, settings and information on the right.  Actually, I saw a tachometer too.  So I think it does a tachometer on the right.  Audio and entertainment, climate control, phone communications, available navigation.  And then you have the eight inch screen in the center stack.  That's like the map and the oh, man, I love it.  You really feel like you are connected.  And this one has two USB hubs and an SD card slot.  Isn't it great? Your car is an SD card slot.  RCA jacks too for AV input.  It's got the mobile in-car Wi-Fi hotspot capability.  You can either install an air card through the USB or a broadband modem.  It's got phone book contact photo download.  I mean, it's just amazing what this will do.  So when somebody rings, a picture shows up.

My wife is going to make me get one.  Mark Millian is here from CNN.  The world's most important digital network.  And from Gadget, Mr. Ryan Block.  Ballmer sells a big chunk of stock.  Now, Steve Ballmer is the number two shareholder at Microsoft.  Bill Gates has a little more than 7% of Microsoft.  Ballmer has a little more than 4%.  Now, that 4% that Steve Ballmer has of Microsoft is worth based on the most recent stock price.  Let me get the exact amount.  He's got 4.2% of the company, $9.6 billion.  So he sells a little bit.  Sells 12% of his stock, his stake in Microsoft.  That's worth it.  He's got a billion, one in a third billion dollars.  He said, you know, it's for tax planning and investments.  I want to diversify my investments.  But some say this may be an indication that Ballmer might be moving on.  What do you think?

Transcript:  Boy, you guys are both bloggers.  This story just blew my mind.  There's a print magazine called Cook Source.  I've actually bought copies of the magazine.  It's a cooking magazine.  Apparently, this magazine has some bad habits.  A blogger who wrote a blog five years ago for a blog called Code Cookery says they stole  her post and put it in the print magazine without telling her.  The magazine has a circulation of 20,000.  She said, this is news to me.  I'd never even heard of the magazine.  So the blogger, Monica Gaudio, contacted the editor of Cook Source.  I wish Lance were still here.  I'd love to hear his opinion on this.  To ask about the article, it was a history of apple pie and how it got in the magazine.  At one point in the exchange, Gaudio said the editor asked her, what do you want?  Gaudio said, I want an apology in the magazine on the Facebook page and I want 130 bucks  that you're going to donate to the Columbia School of Journalism.  Ten cents a word.  The editor who said that she has three decades of experience editing for the Village Voice  Connecticut Woman magazine and other publications responded that everything on the web is considered  public domain.  You should be happy we didn't just lift your whole article and put someone else's name on it.  And she said the article was in very bad need of editing and it's much better now than it was originally.  In fact, we put so much time into rewrites, you should pay me.

Transcript:  Yeah, back in the early days in Engadget, it always surprised me how many people would  go out of their way to lift content.  Even when we were really small publication, it was just constantly happening, especially  because of RSS, because RSS makes it incredibly easy to steal other people's content.  And so that was happening all the time.  And it would show up in places you would never believe.  I mean it was never like it showed up in established publications or whatever, but places where  you wouldn't expect it to go that didn't seem incredibly shady.  And this is a pretty good example.  I mean there were a lot of instances.  This is a legitimate magazine you see.  It's very, very, very weird what people think about these things sometimes.  It doesn't make any sense.  There's not a lot you can do about it, unfortunately.  I mean you can't have somebody arrested for that.  I mean you can file a lawsuit if you really want to, but have fun with that.

You still get it every year, dropped on your doorstep.  I recycle it immediately.  Verizon is finally stopping distribution of the white pages in Pennsylvania.  They actually had to ask permission of the State Public Utility Commission.  Verizon says if a customer specifically requests one, they can get it.  And that's fine.  There are probably some people who don't have internet access or whatever and they may need  a phone book.  But why print a phone book for a million people?  Does anybody even use the phone book?  They say this will save 2200 tons of low grade paper, 12 million books they used to distribute.  And they cited a Gallup poll in 2008 that said only 11% of households still looked up  numbers in the phone book.  I'm surprised that phone companies still do this.

And it drives me crazy to think about this, but there are actually a lot of companies  out there or retail places or food establishments.  A lot of local businesses that just don't know or understand how easy it is to put yourself  as an official listing on Google Maps and on Yelp and so on.

She said, I Google it.  I said, well, OK, and then I showed her Google places.  It's absolutely free to put a listing into it.  I said, please just do this.  Don't. $39 a month.  It's free. And this is where people go nowadays.  They look on Google.  Now, you should have a Google Places directory listing.

Transcript:  I mean, yeah, it's I think it's the service, right?  It's that they will they will place it for you.  They will list it for you.  So I actually think the opportunity here is as long as the difference between these two  businesses is that somebody is going to place your business in the listings in the local  yellow book or I guess in yellow book dot com.  The opportunity for Google is take care of it for people, you know, right.  Offer offer for thirty dollars or something to create that verified listing in Google  Maps. Do it for them.

I got two guys on who can tell me the definition of 4G because wireless  companies, particularly Sprint, a little up in arms because T-Mobile is saying our  HSPA plus. Well, that's 4G and Sprint saying, no, it's not.  So what is what is 4G?  Is T-Mobile allowed to say that they're upgraded HSPA, which is three to five  megabits, which is about as fast as clear wire is.  Are they allowed to say that's 4G?  What makes 4G?

End time: 5632.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so for 4G.  OK, so the whole G thing that is that is terminology and it's it's determined by the  ITU, the International.  So there is an official definition.

Start time: 5633.28
End time: 5637.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it's still being determined, actually.  They haven't they haven't worked out every single part of the spec yet.

Start time: 5638.68
End time: 5649.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But 4G was originally intended to encompass wireless broadband and wireless phone  networks that operated at 100 megabits or above.  So 100 megabits.

Start time: 5649.86
End time: 5652.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. So that is that is the actual technical definition.

Start time: 5652.06
End time: 5721.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody's doing that.  I know. We'll get to that in a sec, though.  OK, so the ITU determines these.  3G is different than two point seven five G and two point five G, which are we have  to get any of that stuff. But anyway, you know, the point is 4G is a is a thing.  It is defined. It is not necessarily specifically LTE or WiMAX, although those  there are a lot of standards for.  Yes. You know, 802 was 802 16 E, which is the original WiMAX standard, you know, was  considered to be a 4G standard by the ITU.  But the point is it has to operate at 100 megabits or above to be considered 4G.  If it doesn't do that, it's not 4G.  So what you actually have is these quote unquote 4G standards like LTE and WiMAX,  which are theoretically capable of operating at well above 100 megabits, but that  are actually like way down clocked, so to speak.  They're down in the zero to 10 megabit range.  So there are 4G technologies that are not being used at what is supposed to be 4G  speeds. So for anybody to claim it's 4G is a little bit disingenuous right now.

Start time: 5721.85
End time: 5769.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  None of it.  Right. To Leo's original question, to your original question, can Timo will call  their network 4G? Yes, they can because Sprint started it and they had technology  that, you know, isn't close to the standard of 4G.  Verizon's LTE is not 4G, like Ryan said.  From my understanding, I just did a story about this about a week ago.  I talked to an analyst at Gartner, and from my understanding, a lot of the slowdown  is on the end of the fiber that they're using to connect to these cell towers.  There a lot of the Internet in this country is not fast enough to reach 100  megabits. They can't get a backhaul that's fast enough.  Right. So, I mean, 4G is a marketing term.  So AT&T can say they have 4G.  They're rolling out an HSPA plus network eventually.

Start time: 5770.00

Transcript:  So, well, T-Mobile is actively advertising America's largest 4G network,  which I imagine is kind of stunning.  A few people like who T-Mobile?

Start time: 5780.32
End time: 5847.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's it's.  It's tricky because they're they do have a large network rollout based on,  you know, current technologies, not based on WiMAX or LTE,  but based on current technologies, current technologies that are as fast as.  Yes, that and then they're operating those technologies at speeds  that are the same speeds.  That is what Sprint is operating.  It's WiMAX network.  So they it's it's really weird and kind of convoluted.  But in a sense, if you consider Sprint's 4G rollout,  you know, 4G, then you could also consider T-Mobile's rollout 4G.  But it's just like it just doesn't make any sense.  It doesn't matter.  What matters is, can you get fast speeds and do you have coverage?  And and I think that there's just a lot of confusion with this,  especially because, you know, you look at AT&T, AT&T was,  you know, one of the first carriers to roll out HSUPA, which is, you know,  a speed increase to its network.  And that's great.  So AT&T now is a faster network that you can't use still.  You still can't. So it's faster.  It's like, can you use it? Right.  That is what matters.

Transcript:  It's all about performance in a specific location.  And that has a lot to do with the available amount of spectrum.  But I mean, it's all just junk, this 4G stuff.  Sprint, from my understanding, use 4G as an internal term,  because WiMAX was their fourth generation of technology  that they were using at their network.  And then they came to the realization, whoa, let's just use this as a marketing term.  It sounds cool. It's one better than 3G.

Transcript:  The one thing you won't hear about in these T-Mobile,  America's largest 4G network commercials,  you'll hear about speed, but you won't hear about latency.  And latency is is very important if you want to use this high speed connection  for things like gaming, if you don't want a connection delay between,  you know, hitting the button to fire the gun and that actually registering  with another player.

Transcript:  It is national our last story, and then we'll let you all go.  Jimmy Kimmel has announced National Unfriend Day.  And by the way, on the video on YouTube, it says follow Jimmy on Facebook and Twitter.  Naturally, you know, don't unfriend him.  Apparently, that would be that would be the wrong thing to do.

Transcript:  Here's something I've been given a lot of thought to lately.  Friendship.  Friendship is a sacred thing, and I believe Facebook is cheapening it.  I go on this Facebook.  I see people with thousands of what they call friends, which is impossible.  You can't have a thousand friends.  Here's how you can tell who on Facebook is really your friend.  Let's say on Friday, post a status update that says, I'm moving this weekend and I need help.  The people that respond, those are your friends.  Everyone else isn't.  I would like people to start whittling this down.  Here's an example of someone who has five hundred forty five friends.  Her name is Gina.  Every five seconds, Gina has something to say.  Hundred degrees in San Diego.  Oh, Gina is eating other people's food.  Coffee.  Gina is watching weeds.

Transcript:  Right now.  Yay. My weekend just started.  Robin Thicke and mashed potatoes.  Hooler.  Can the time please change already?  Who am I to come between a girl and her nose?  It's November, yay, and cinnamon hazelnut.  This woman cannot possibly have five hundred forty five friends.  If she has five, I'd be shocked.  So I say unfriend her.  Unfriend Gina.  Unfriend all the Gina's of the world.  They're not your friends.  Tonight, I'm planning to launch a new holiday.  Two weeks from today, November 17th, will here before be known as National Unfriend Day.  On National Unfriend Day, I encourage you to cut out some of the friend fat in your life.  A friend is someone you have a special relationship with.  It's not someone who asks which Harry Potter character are you.  So I mean, remember five years ago when no one was on Facebook and you didn't know what  the guy you took high school biology with was having for lunch?  Remember how that was fine?  Let's go back to that.  National Unfriend Day, November 17th.  Nudd, N-U-D, spread the word.
