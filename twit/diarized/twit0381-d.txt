It's time for twit this week in  tech.  Hey, I'm back.  How are you doing?  Thanks to Sarah Lane for filling  in for me and father Robert  Ballester.  I appreciate that.  It gave me a chance to take a  little time off.  I'm back from a trip down under  and a hello to all of our fans  down there.  Boy, this surprised me, Chad.  There were hundreds of people  showed up at this bar, hearts  pub in the Rocks for a meetup in  Sydney.  I couldn't get in.  So I'm sorry if I didn't see you,  but I just couldn't get in.  So I went on and that was on  their big game day.  He just left.  It was the Melbourne Cup.  But that was but that was just  people to see me and I saw a  bunch of people.  Allison Sheridan joined me from  the Nozilla cast.  Don McAllister, our friend from  screencast online was also there.  One of the it was it's great.  We have a lot.  So hello to everybody in  Australia, New Zealand and Anzac  or whatever it is.  Because it's great to great to  know we have such fans down  there.  Really thrilled.  I want to go back.  Frankly, it was beautiful.  Saw a total eclipse.  I'm drawing a circle with my  hand.  That's the sun.  The moon went in front of it.  It was dark.  If you've never seen a total  eclipse, it's kind of mind  boggling, frankly.  The sun goes out.  Did you know that?  It just disappears.  Wow.  Now, reposter in our show  was there.  I signed his phone.  There's proof.  That was fun.  It was really fun.  I will go back.  Osned, good to see you.  Osned was on the cruise with us.  Very generous.  Lots of fun.  Lots of fun.  Our guests today on Twitter, good  to have Mark Millian back from  Bloomberg Business Week.  Nice to see you again.  How's everything going?  Very good.  I'm glad we have a really  prestigious group here of  actual tech journalists.  So that I can get filled in on  what happened while I was gone.  There's no Internet on the boat,  but it's very slow.  So I really don't know what...  Slow and expensive?  Yeah, it's very expensive.  That's Harry McCracken of Time  Magazine.  Hi, Harry.  Good to see you and the  Technologizer blog,  technologizer.com.  Yeah, you can get online, but  it's like, well, if you're on  vacation, why, you shouldn't.  And actually, I don't know which  is more expensive.  It might be the cruise Internet  and it might be just the AT&T  bandwidth.  And then Verona, which is  the best place to go with.  And then Verizon.  You know, I'm on my iPhone  with Verizon.  I paid for an international  data plan, which I thought was  $25 for 100 megabytes, which is  not much data for that much  money.  And I got a message from  Verizon saying, oh, we're not  covering this country.  And by the way, you've already  spent $200.  Ah!  I just turned the phone on.  Ah!  So I immediately turned it on.

Transcript:  So did anything happen over the  last couple of weeks?  I saw, you know, and I know you  talked about this last week,  but I saw that Steven Sinovsky  quit at Microsoft or was fired.  Which was it?  Was he fired or did he quit?

Start time: 352.29
End time: 364.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Officially he quit.  Officially.  It sounds like you don't  believe it.  Well, you know, it's sort of the  mass exodus of the supposed jerks  is how they're painting it after  forestall and...  That's what McCracken said.

Start time: 378.29
End time: 413.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, just that he was  sort of very cutthroat within  the ranks.  There was...  Some of my colleagues did a  Business Week story about how  there was, you know, the old  Microsoft was each division  fought for their resources and  it was even encouraged to go  and coach people from the other  divisions to sort of build up  your group and it was very  competitive.  And now the new Microsoft,  that Balmer is trying to foster,  is they want everybody to work  together, metro across  everything, unified group,  unified UI, unified everything.  So it won't be just Sinovsky,  then.

Start time: 414.40
End time: 422.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if they're going to  recreate the Microsoft corporate  culture, they're going to have to  get rid of more than just  Stephen Sinovsky, right?  I think it'll be interesting to

Start time: 422.38
End time: 444.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  see if a warmer, fuzzier Microsoft  is as good as Sinovsky was at  shipping stuff on time, because  in the old days Microsoft was  reputation for blowing its  deadlines by a year or two.  And with Sinovsky, the stuff got  out there.  Right.  Well, that's the thing.  He did a great job.  And Windows 7, I think, fixed  most of the things that were  wrong with Vista, which was a  pretty remarkable accomplishment.  Is it too early, Matthew Ingram,

Start time: 444.30
End time: 445.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to say that Windows 8 is a flop?

Start time: 448.99
End time: 462.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's too early to say  it's a flop.  I think it's not too early to  say it's not a huge runaway  success.  And there's certainly quite a  bit of skepticism out there, but  I think it might be too early to  call it an outright flop.

Start time: 462.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's somewhere between the Wii U  and the Google Q.  Well, that's not a good place to  be.  That's a fairly large delta.  Yes, large spectrum.  Net applications, which monitors  Internet use, I guess, of browsers  of different operating systems,  says by this time in 2009,  Windows 7 had 3.6% of the market.  Windows 8 is just 1%.  That's such a small number,  though.

Start time: 492.71
End time: 514.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got to be.  But people were desperate to get  off of Vista.  I don't think people were  desperate to get off of Windows  It's quite good.  And Windows 8, even if it's good,  I mean, it's a big leap.  You're leaving something familiar  for something unfamiliar, and I  think it's very reasonable to  think it over.  I really think it's going to be  months or possibly years before  it's entirely clear whether this  huge bet that Microsoft is making  was a good idea or not.

Transcript:  You know, I actually went out  shopping yesterday because I'm  in the market for a new laptop,  and I went to Best Buy and  Office Max.  I'm thinking I want to get a  Windows 8 computer, but there's  just so few options out there.  I want something like a MacBook  Air but with Windows 8 on it.  There'll be some really good

Start time: 559.30
End time: 564.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  machines were announced, but  there have been some stories  saying that it's surprisingly  hard to find them.  That's weird.  I wonder why that is.

Start time: 566.48

Transcript:  Well, there are a number of  theories, one of which is that  Intel has been slow with the chip  they need for Windows 8 tablets,  although Intel denies that.  That is a struggle that's been

Start time: 581.34
End time: 613.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going on as long as I've been  covering tech between hardware  and software, and particularly  between Microsoft and Intel.  I can remember going to interview  Andy Grove almost 20 years ago  and him bitching about Bill Gates  not keeping Windows up.  You know, we're making 32-bit  processors, and these clowns are  still doing 16-bit Windows.  I mean, it has always been that  way, one way or the other.  Software blaming hardware or  vice versa.  Paul Alini is retiring in May.  I don't know if that's Germain.  He's the CEO of Intel.

Start time: 614.58

Start time: 620.30
End time: 639.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  ARM is eating their lunch, right?  I mean, the ARM processor is sort  of like this hippie co-op, but  ARM, the company, is very small.  Yeah, but everybody's using ARM  processors.  They're maybe making them with  Samsung.  So everybody's eating their lunch.  Yeah, it's more like that.  There is no ARM.  Hand in hand with ARM.

Start time: 639.36
End time: 643.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the past, Intel has always  been run by people who have been  at Intel for 20, 30, 40 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  New Egg, a senior executive at  New Egg says the Windows launch  is not the explosion we had  planned for, but it's slow and  steady.  If I'm buying a new computer, I  think I'd buy Windows 8 because  the desktop is still there.  Windows 7 is still under the  hood.  It's just a new start screen,  really, right?

Start time: 664.19
End time: 672.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but they kind of poked you  in the eye by taking away your  start menu, which I think was,  in retrospect, I think people  will conclude that was not such  a great idea.

Start time: 673.07
End time: 682.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wonder, though, if more people,  if people who are using Windows  phones would be more open to  that, say, than someone just  buying a computer.  Because they're already using

Start time: 682.46
End time: 692.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the Metro interface, or as  smart called it, the Metroid  Prime interface.  Which, by the way, the chat room  said, I'd buy that.  Yeah, totally.  It's a great game.  Lost opportunity.

Start time: 692.48
End time: 711.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do know that my daughter, for  example, and some of her  friends, they're 14, 15, they're  actually quite interested in  Windows phones.  They want them, they like the  look of them, they like the look  of the interface, which I was  surprised by.  I think those ads, maybe, and I

Start time: 711.52
End time: 717.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  also, when you look at a Lumia  920, for instance, which is not,  in my opinion, the best Windows  8 phone, it's beautiful.

Start time: 718.30
End time: 723.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been using that and the HTC  8X since the announcement.  Do you have a preference?

Start time: 723.32
End time: 726.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the 8X is the one I was  looking at.  I mean, the 920 is nice, except

Start time: 727.30
End time: 736.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's huge and thick.  It is big.  It's a nicely made phone.  It has that Nokia solidity to it.  The 8X is probably more  appealing overall, just in terms  of the size.

Start time: 737.55
End time: 744.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So young girls.  What about the camera, though?  The Nokia camera is very  interesting.  The low-light performance seems  to be quite good.  They both have nice cameras.

Start time: 744.36
End time: 753.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the big issue is apps.  Microsoft says that as a  company, I think it has 46 of  the top 50.  I was unclear, and this is part

Start time: 754.42
End time: 765.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of the problem Microsoft has,  when they said we have 20,000  apps, did they mean in the RT  store, the pro store, the phone  store?  I think that's Windows 8 apps.  Windows Phone has something like

Start time: 767.04
End time: 770.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  100,000 apps.  But the 8 apps are distinct from

Start time: 771.98
End time: 808.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  7 apps.  You can run 7 Windows 7 phone 7  apps on 8, but they're not  Windows 8 apps.  You see the problem that  Microsoft faces.  It's very confusing.  I think consumers walk in, they  see all three of them have the  same start screen, and the  impression is strong that you're  going to, oh, this is a unified  thing.  And it ain't.  I'm confused.  So Windows 8 apps, Metro apps,  Windows 8 app store.  That's 20,000.  But is it RT or?  I think it's Windows 8.  Generally speaking, Windows 8

Start time: 808.30
End time: 821.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  apps, they can be compiled or run  on Windows RT.  And generally speaking, they are,  but I don't think it's an absolute  given that they'll show up in the  Windows RT store.  If I understand this correctly,  which I probably don't.  Well, that's the problem.

Start time: 821.30
End time: 834.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think anybody does.  Steve Bomber described the sales  of Windows RT tablets surface as  fantastic.  I do not think that word means  what he thinks it means.  Fantastic.  There's some confusion about  that.

Start time: 835.20
End time: 842.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's some confusion about  that because I think he used  some, it was a bad translation  in a French publication.  He quoted saying they were

Start time: 842.36
End time: 847.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  modest.  Right.  But he meant was we're not being  full of ego.  We're being modest about this.

Start time: 847.85
End time: 856.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  That they were only available in  certain stores.  They weren't rolling it out  everywhere.  He's saying that was modest.  But the bad translation said  sales were modest.

Start time: 856.85
End time: 868.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is fascinating, at least  around me.  Basically almost every ad I see  on the subway is for Surface.  But the thing is only for sale  in a few dozen retail stores in  the world.

Start time: 869.40
End time: 871.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mostly Microsoft stores.  And the ads don't say that.

Start time: 871.32
End time: 876.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So I have to think that people  are going into Best Buy and  asking about the Surface thing  and not finding it there.

Start time: 877.72
End time: 923.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ad Duplex, another, so many of  these little companies that  measure this stuff.  And who knows what their  methodology is.  But they say that the Surface is  winning in the early race to be  the most popular Windows 8 or RT  device.  This is based on ads from the  company's network that are  showing up on these platforms.  Again, these are not, I don't  know how good these numbers are.  The Surface's number one tablet  and notebook, Nokia Lumia phones,  mostly older phones, the Windows  7 phones and the 710, are showing  an early lead within Windows  Phone.  But Windows Phone 8, they say,  captures about 4% of the  available Windows Phone views.  And that was in just the first  week.  I think you might be right.  I think the breakout hit might  be the Windows Phone, Matthew.  Maybe your daughters are a  bellwether.  Well, it's interesting what

Start time: 923.36
End time: 941.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they're interested in about the  phone.  They don't care about Windows  versus Apple or the technology.  They're interested in the  interface and how it shows them  at a glance all the things their  friends have done on any social  network all in sort of one view.  It's a lively interface.

Start time: 942.36
End time: 960.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of compelling with the  tiles are rotating.  I could see why that would be  attractive to teenage girls.  And magpies.  I like it.  I mean, it's just a snippet.  It's not like everything about  your friends in one glance.  It's slowly rotating through all  that stuff, right?  Microsoft could play that up in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The phone for little girls.  No, they don't play that up.  They did that with the kin and  it was a flop.  Google has those Chrome

Start time: 979.30
End time: 1142.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dogs and babies.  I don't get that at all.  We are talking about the week's  tech news, and I have to admit I  don't know anything because I  just got off a boat minutes ago.  But fortunately we have three of  the best tech journalists here to  help me understand what happened.  So you guys, if you just chime in  if there's a story you think was  a big story, I'll start with you,  Matthew, when we get back from  this word from stamps.com.  I'm a big fan of stamps.com.  This is the way we do our mailing  because who wants to go to the  post office, especially this time  of year, Christmas time, you know  there's all these people online  getting stamps and it's just slow  going.  You don't have to worry about that  because you have a little stamp  machine right now in your own home  or office.  It's your computer and your  printer.  No special links, no postage meter  needed, just stamps.com.  And you can print your postage  when you need it anytime.  Not just print out stamps, but  print right on the envelope, print  out all the information for a  package.  If you're doing international  mailing, you can even print out  the forms you need.  And then the mail carrier comes  to you and picks it up.  I'm sorry, I know we have a lot  of listeners outside the U.S.  This is U.S. only.  This is for printing U.S.  postage.  You'll have to inquire with your  own postal service about what  they have.  But we're lucky here in the U.S.  We've got stamps.com.  Over 2 billion letters and  packages have been sent today  via stamps.com.  And now I want you to get on the  stamps.com bandwagon.  Stamps.com has a special no-risk  trial offer for you.  Wait a minute, you see that?  No, don't do that.  It says it's an $80 value.  Click on the radio microphone.  Click here on the upper right-hand  corner.  And then enter promo code T-W-I-T  and press go.  And let's see, $80.  Look at that.  $55 in free postage.  A free digital scale.  You just pay shipping and handling.  It's about five bucks.  $5 supply kit.  And a four-week trial of stamps.com.  It really, stamps is a bad name,  to be honest, because it's not  about printing stamps.  You kind of get that feeling.  It really is about handling all  your mailing needs.  Even things like automatically  sending emails to the recipient  saying it's on the way.  If you're on eBay or Amazon or Etsy  seller, PayPal seller, this is  fantastic for you for your  fulfillment.  It turns you into kind of a  fulfillment house easily, simply,  affordably.  Stamps.com.  Thank them for their support of  This Week in Tech.  So this was completely out of the  blue, and I want to understand  this a little bit better.

They didn't try all that hard,  but the notion that them wanting  to be a phone company has been  around for an awfully long time.  Right.  I wanted them to buy it.  I think a lot of people like the  idea of them doing it, because  people like the idea of a start  up essentially competing with  Verizon and AT&T.  Yeah.  Somebody's not an incumbent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Although increasingly Google is,  so I don't know if Google's the  white knight we thought they  were going to be.  So this comes from 9to5Google.com.  Google plans to roll out a  service by mid to late 2013, next  year, which would be Voice and  SMS over VoIP.  Probably Google Voice is the  backend for that.  So maybe they would be the  provider, Dish is the  infrastructure and the data, and  Google is like the user  interface layer?

Transcript:  They're not doing it now, and  that's why Verizon, you can't use  data and voice at the same time  because they're separate now.  So the Washington Post, they're  saying, so the Washington Post  says Julius Genachowski, the  chairman of the FCC, approved the  Dish LTE or put his weight behind  approving it.  Of course, the commissioners have  to approve it.  But Dish says it's unhappy with  Genachowski's proposal because it  puts too many restrictions on  what power levels.  They want to use a 40 megahertz  chunk of the satellite spectrum,  which I guess they already own,  of the 2 gigahertz band.  But Charlie Ergen told the Post,  telling us to lower our power  levels, cripples our ability.  He is, I love Charlie Ergen.  I've actually, I met him.  He has a Charlie Chad or a show  on Dish that I was on, and he's a  character.  He's a smart guy, an engineer,  and he's kind of like an old  school mogul.  We want to enter the wireless  business.  We have $6 billion more we want  to spend on building out this  business, but the FCC could make  it extremely risky.  So this is back and forth,  obviously, to get more  concessions from the FCC.  Interesting.  We shall see.  What else happened?  Droid, go ahead, Matthew.  You give me a story, please.

This is the company that Leo  Apotheker, the former  CEO of HP, when he announced,  we're getting out of the  business, we're not going to  make computers anymore, we're  going into services and we're  going to buy for, what was it,  $6 billion?  I'm huge about it.  $11 billion.  We're going to buy a British  company, autonomy, that does  consulting services, which they  did, right?  And then Leo gets booted, and,  oh, we're going to make PCs  after all, Meg Whitman said, oh,  we're going to make PCs after  all.  But they've got a lot of  money.  But they have, but they've got  it, they've already bought this  company.  So what happened, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

And so they're taking a, you  know, $9 billion write down or  something.  I think autonomy is saying, you  know, it's, our bookkeeping  might have been a little  aggressive, but, you know, so  it's...

The changes, the new business  model, the business model of the  week.  I don't know how you'd write a  book about it, but he says, no,  no, it's great.  You know, there's plenty to talk  about.  Lots to write about.  There is like, there's no doubt  about that.  There's lots to write about.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Come back with more.  Matthew Ingram of GigaOM from  time.com, Harry McCracken and the  Technologizer blog.  And from Business...  Bloomberg Business Week.  I'm not going to do the  droopy doc to you.  I ran into somebody on the  boat who said, every time,  every time I see Bloomberg  Business Week, I think,  Bloomberg Business Week.  That's great.  I've ruined it for them, except  it's in their head.  So that's not so bad.  As long as they're thinking it,  right?  Bloomberg Business Week.  I'm going to do this next  commercialist droopy doc.  No, I won't do that to Ford.  Poor Ford.  So I decided I'm making an  official.  I'm going to trade in the Mustang,  the 2010 Mustang.  I know it's a heartbreaker,  but I found a car I love even  more.  And it's got all the features  that I want.  It's the new Fusion.  The Ford Fusion, the plug-in  hybrid.  And I'll tell you a couple of  the things that are kind of put  me over the top.  Of course, it's got a sink in my  Ford Touch, the stuff that I  require. But now they're putting  in these more and more of these  features, these features to help  you drive.  So they've, it's, this ties,  it's all, there's a narrative  here somewhere.  I would like to write this book.  There's a narrative in here  somewhere.  Because I remember talking to,  I went to the Silicon Valley  when they offered their Silicon  Valley office a few months ago.  I went there and they said, we,  we, we see the car as a platform.  You know, like Windows is a  platform.  It's a platform we want people to  develop for.  So what we're doing is putting  sensors in this car.  So there's all sorts of  information with an API so you can  access the sensors and then people  will be able to write apps on  their smartphones that will  interact with the.  So they've got these ideas of the,  of the kind of what the modern  21st century vehicle would be.  And this is an example.  They, so they put a camera in the  front.  You know, there's one in the back  as you back up, but there's one in  the front that you don't have access.  I don't think you have access to a  front facing camera.  And all it does is watch where the  lanes are.  Watch the lines go by and it  determines if you're on course.  Here it is.  So as if you've now, if you put on  the turn signal, it disables it.  So if you say, I'm going to change  lanes, it doesn't do this.  But if you drift into the lane, the  system will vibrate the steering  wheel.  See like that, like you hit the  bots dots.  And then if you don't do anything,  it will apply pressure on the  steering wheel to help you get  back in the lane.  This is wild.  This is a camera in the car that's  doing this.  Very sweet.  So you can even see the guide on  MyFordTouch.  You can see the guide about where  you are in the lanes.  This is, this is their idea.  You know, I don't know if the idea  is going towards an autonomous  vehicle.  I think that they, what they told  me is we don't, we think you need  a driver, but what we want to do is  use this smart technology to help  the driver be a better driver.  So it's information.  They also have a driver's license.  So they have a driver's license.  So they have a driver's license.  So they have a driver's license.  So they have a driver's license.  So they have a driver's license.  can you show the video is there a  video for that.  So the adaptive cruise control.  So the adaptive cruise control.  Now you've not, not only do you  have a camera in the front, you've  got forward looking radar in this  2013 fusion and it scans the road  and so you're you got your cruise  control, you're set for 55 or 65  or whatever.  But when it sees slow, when it  sees traffic ahead, it slows you  down.  It also has a collision warning  that will allow you to slow down  in the middle of the road.  And it's a very, very useful  thing to have in this car.  So you can see the driver's license  and it's a very, very useful  thing to have in this car.  So you can see the driver's license.  And it's a very, very useful  thing to have in this car.  But when it sees slow, when it  sees traffic ahead, it slows you  down.  It also has a collision warning  that will alert you with flashing  red lights not in the dashboard,  but on the windshield.  If the, if there's a potential  crash ahead.  So it goes blip, blip, blip and  its heads.  It's a head.  I'm telling you they're going to  the heads up display.  I'm convinced you can find out  more about the lane keeping  system and the adaptive cruise  control on here.  It is on the website.  This is where we're getting  these videos.  This is ford.com slash  technology.  So slow down.  So you don't even have to  get on the dashboard.  This is the lane keeping system.  So it slows down so you don't  even have to adjust the cruise  control.  It just goes, okay, here's  traffic.  I love that ford.com slash

I'm going to get that.  Let us taste Android.  Do you droid food?  Switch today.  They actually have posters at  Facebook saying switch to Android.  But as you just said, Harry, the  experience is crap on all platforms.  I think actually the iOS experience  has gotten better, hasn't it?  It's moving up.  Now that it's not HTML5 anymore.

It's often 100% in whatever car I'm in.  And so it's not surprising that at  Facebook it must be extremely high.  It's really hard to build a great  Android app if you're at a company  where people don't really use Android.  So I think it makes total sense for  Facebook to try to encourage the  people who build this stuff.  Here's another...  To use the devices that are out there.

They force whichever platform you're on,  they force you to have the latest beta,  the early version.  And if it crashes, employees violently  shake their phone and it automatically  logs the current state and sends  details to the bug, the bug squashes.  I think everything should have that.  Apparently the Google Plus team does that too.  And now they say they have access to end users.  Has anybody done a Rage Shake on Google Plus?  I would.

But is he really, I mean, how much does he have to do with this?  Is he really running MySpace now?  He is an investor, I know.  They, News Corp bought it and sold it last summer to,  oh my God.  So News Corp bought it for $580 million six years ago.  They sold it to Specific Media last summer for $35 million.  There's a write-off.  Specific Media is a private company  owned by the Vanderhoek family.  And then they took new funding from the people  like Justin Timberlake.  But I think they're using him as the poster boy.

Their plan to raise $50 million and then take it,  they're pitching this as an alternative to Pandora and Spotify.  $10 million will go to marketing.  $15 to $25 million to licensing deals with music labels.  $15 to $25 million, which by the way,  this adds up to more than $50 million.  But okay, we'll be reserved for general working capital.  And then we'll go to Belize.  They're going to run right against a buzzsaw  called Apple Computer, which everybody says  is going to do a Pandora, right?  Yes.  I believe that.  I believe that.  And they have the deals.

I must admit, I was skeptical about it,  that that many people would want to.  I thought the sort of ownership  that people would want to have, you know,  these are my songs and they live here,  as opposed to just, I get to access them.  And I know Fred Wilson has argued for a long time  that streaming, you know, would become the way people want  to experience music and he seems to be right.

Start time: 2883.78
End time: 2895.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  But I mean, being conservative basically  has worked for Apple really well.  Right.  If streaming was so obviously superior as a business,  Rhapsody would be doing more fabulously than it is  and have way more users.  And Apple would not be dominating.  Apple has managed to dominate the music business  by selling downloads up until now.  I do agree that it's not a given  that we'll be able to do that forever.

And they did the same thing they did with Led Zeppelin  where it's 99 bucks for all their studio recordings.  I don't know how many songs that is.  And then if you want all their studio and their live,  it's $149.99.  And I clicked buy.  And then I went, no, wait a minute.  Why would I buy that?  Cause I'll just listen on Spotify or Pandora.  I actually have an ACDC.  That's actually an interesting point.  There's been an ACDC channel.  I've been listening to ACDC and The Beatles  on Pandora for a long time,  even though you couldn't buy their music until recently.  So there's an interesting point.  So forget it.  MySpace is trying to cash in 50 million bucks  before anybody notices.  They're probably trying to go  to the unsophisticated investors before anybody notices  that the real player is not Pandora.  The real player is gonna be Apple.  You think when Apple marches in, it's over for Pandora?  Which sticks.  Half their business goes away.

The intention of classifying,  but still the catalog can be limited when,  the alternative like Apple Genius,  or I think Google does this,  is to just crowdsource based on what everyone  is listening to, to kind of understand relationships  rather than having a few musicians classify the songs.

Transcript:  That is the real challenge though, isn't it?  You can have a really good system  and you could even have a good app ecosystem.  We'll debate whether they do,  but you could even have a good app ecosystem.  And still people have invested in Android or iPhone.  They're just not looking.  Is it too late for Microsoft?

Start time: 3197.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a big question.  And I think a lot of people buy either the phone  the person in the store recommends to them  or they buy the phone that their friends and family  are using.  And both iPhone and Android are over that hump.  Everybody knows people who are using them.  And they're kind of an easy sell if you're a salesperson.  Windows Phone is not over either of those humps yet.

Transcript:  So I think it's like 50 bucks or something.  They're making a strong effort to get salespeople  to at least recommend it.  And maybe they've improved that situation.  But how many people are moving from a,  maybe there's still a lot of feature phone users,  people who have never bought a smartphone.  I mean, that's who's gonna buy it, right?

Start time: 3241.96

Transcript:  And depending on whose numbers you believe,  something like roughly half or a little under half  of people may not have a smartphone at all.  So that's a big market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a huge market.  If they can capture that.  Well, interesting.  Time.com is where you can see Harry's latest talk.  We'll talk about the Wii U.  Play hard is the headline.  We'll see what that means.  That could be, that's ambiguous.  That could be good, that could be bad.  We will read more in just a bit.  Talk more in just a bit.  Also Matthew Ingram from Giga Omar.  Our show today brought to you by the new Squarespace.  I know we have a lot of photographers, artists,  people who, even if you don't do it professionally,  would like to have a website that shows off your work,  your art in a beautiful way,  but that's easy to maintain and not expensive.  And Squarespace is so good for photographers,  filmmakers, writers, painters, animators,  anybody who's creating and wants to make a beautiful  public presence for themselves.  You can try it right now for a couple of weeks.  Free 14 day trial, you get full 24 seven support.  You don't need a credit card.  Just go to squarespace.com and click the get started button.  And you'll see immediately some new things.  This is the new Squarespace 6, which just came out.  It uses something called responsive design,  which is kind of the latest buzzword in web design.  But the idea is, I was so frustrated.  When you're on the boat, of course,  and I'm using a mobile device to look at all the web pages,  you see how many companies still have mobile sites  distinct from their desktop site,  and they're often terrible, and they don't keep updated.  The new thing in web design is what's called  mobile responsive design.  So you make one site, period.  There's no mobile site,  and it just responds to the platform.  And this is what the new Squarespace does.  So when you put a picture up there,  they make seven thumbnails, one for every possible site.  Everything from an iPhone to a 27-inch desktop.  It's very easy to do your own design  with just basically dragging and clicking.  Although if you are a JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, Wizz,  you absolutely can get into the guts of this.  But when you create this design,  whether you state-of-the-art code generation  or you do it by dragging and dropping,  it's gonna look good at any size.  It makes it very easy to blog, to post.  They have tools to integrate into your Flickr,  your Twitter, your LinkedIn, your Facebook.  They even have Google Maps integration,  which I think is so cool.  So I want you to give it a try.  Go to squarespace.com, click the Try It Free button,  and you get two weeks for free.  If you decide to buy, that's when we come in.  And don't worry about it unless you decide to buy.  But if you decide to buy,  first let me show you the pricing,  because this is new.  They've really simplified this.  There's just two plans.  There's the standard and the unlimited.  The standard plan, this is as low as you can go.  If you buy a year's worth, it's eight bucks a month.  That's very low.  And that, by the way, this is hosting and the software.  You're not just getting the software.  This is the hosting.  And if you buy an annual plan,  they'll even register your domain name for free  and hitch it up to your Squarespace site.  The standard plan is great for a simple site.  Maybe it's a wedding or a one-shot deal.  But let me tell you, if you're planning a bigger site,  a blog or a portfolio, look at the unlimited plan.  Still very affordable.  $16 a month, that's for hosting and all the software  when you buy an annual plan.  You get unlimited pages, unlimited galleries,  unlimited blogs.  So if you're a wedding photographer,  you have a different gallery for each shoot,  for instance, unlimited bandwidth,  no limits in the amount of traffic  served to your site visitors.  And by the way, no matter how many people come to that site,  it will be up and responsive.  They have a very, very clever infrastructure setup.  This is what I like.  Not only unlimited bandwidth, but unlimited storage.  And unlimited contributors.  So you can have multiple people.  This would be great.  You want to do a newspaper?  Done, 16 bucks a month, that's all.  And of course, the annual plan gives you the custom domain  and all that stuff.  It integrates with Google Apps and MailChimp as well.  Published to Facebook pages, 24-7 support,  and a whole lot more.  I want you to try it.  Go to squarespace.com, click the Try It button, get started.  If after two weeks you think, this is good,  you can import all your existing stuff,  all that images and links and even comments are preserved.  This is good.  Then go to the pricing page, but do use our offer.  Twit 11, because you're going to get 10% off that price.  That's why the annual plan makes a lot of sense.  You get the most savings.  Twit 11.  Or can you do two years?  Nerve says it's even cheaper if you get two years.  I don't even see that.  Yeah, do two years.  What the hell?  The more you buy, the less you'll pay.  And you get the 10% off no matter what.  If you use the offer code, twit11.  The 11 means, of course, the month of November.  We change that offer code every month.  So if you're listening to this in December, use twit12.  So the Wii U.  Did I miss something?  This was the big, this is the big launch  while I was on the boat.  Nintendo, we've been waiting for an exciting  new addition to the Wii family.

Transcript:  Microsoft supposedly is doing an Xbox,  I don't know, 720 next year.  They'll announce that at E3.  I don't know what Sony's planning with the PlayStation 3.  But you know, Nintendo's a little behind  because it's not HD, the Wii is not HD.

Start time: 3567.22
End time: 3592.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not HD.  It's basically, the Wii is basically games  and almost nothing but games.  Yeah, no media integration.  It had Netflix and Hulu, but not too much.  And the Wii U, I mean, it's Nintendo,  so it's clever and inventive.  You have this game controller that's essentially a tablet  that interacts with your TV in different ways  so you can like fling stuff up the TV  or you can hold the game controller up  and look around you.

Start time: 3594.04
End time: 3604.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I look at the Wii U ads though,  and I think this doesn't, this doesn't look compelling.  I don't wanna use a stylus on a tablet  while I'm playing a game on the big screen.  I don't even understand that.

Start time: 3605.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a somewhat hard concept to get across.  In the time I've had with the Wii U, it is fun to use.  Okay, you like it.  It's a little hard to show that in a commercial.  And I mean, the big challenge is  when the Wii came out in 2006,  there was no iPhone, there was no iPad,  Facebook didn't do games, there was no Angry Birds.  If you were kind of a casual gamer  and you wanted to do casual games,  you bought yourself a Nintendo console.  And there's just so much other choice out there.  And you don't have to spend 300 bucks on a console  and 40 to $60 on games anymore.  You probably have a device in your pocket  and can play the games for free.

Start time: 3641.90
End time: 3670.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That feels like the biggest risk to me is that,  the type of games that Nintendo has always focused on  are sort of family friendly,  easy to get into, cartoon-like characters.  So that sounds exactly like a social game  or a Facebook game.  Whereas the other consoles,  a lot of the games are really hardcore,  first person shooters or strategy or whatever.  Seems like Nintendo's at the biggest risk  from social gaming or web gaming.

Start time: 3671.14
End time: 3681.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, a hardcore player will still happily  pay $300 for a console.  And the Wii U does reach out to those folks a little bit.  They have Call of Duty, they have some other stuff.  It's a little more up that alley.

Start time: 3682.14
End time: 3706.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Chad, do you have that graphic?  So people play Call of Duty online  and the new Call of Duty is out and very exciting.  Probably the hottest game  right of this month so far anyway.  Very exciting.  Lots of people playing it on Xbox, PlayStation 3.  How many people are playing it on Wii U multiplayer?  Worldwide.  Is that, where is that from?

Start time: 3706.96
End time: 3713.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is that from Reddit?  Yeah, this is from Reddit and this was posted a day ago.  That's depressing.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

Start time: 3713.98
End time: 3773.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, Nintendo was never really about these types of games  and every time they come out with a new console,  they say, you know, we're reaching our hands across the aisle  to get as many third-party developers building for this  and this is gonna be the system where people actually go out  and buy Call of Duty and Madden.  And it never happens.  They've been saying it since the GameCube  and they were saying it with the Wii U.  They still have a pretty strong base of people  who will go out and drop $300 to play the franchises  they love like Mario or Zelda.  That's where they're gonna always do fine.  Right, but the business model is a little flipped  with this console, which if I were an investor in Nintendo  would concern me a lot because they've always made a profit  from their systems.  And this is the first console as far as I know,  maybe the 3DS after they dropped the price on it  when nobody bought it after launch  may have been losing money,  but this console from the start is losing money.  So they're banking on services and games.

Transcript:  Here's the ad.  And I just, I watched this and I,  well, first of all, they're playing off the fact  that it's the whole family, right, is playing this.  So here's Junior with his Wii U using his stylus  and then mom's doing karaoke.  And I don't know why there's all those strangers  in their home, but I don't know what he's,  is he shopping?  What does he do?  Oh, he's playing Mario Kart.

Start time: 3798.24
End time: 3800.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 3800.34
End time: 3806.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there will be,  except a lot of that did not ship with the console.  They have some really interesting stuff  using this controller.

Start time: 3807.06
End time: 3816.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But look at that thing, it's clunky.  It does not match up with modern day tablets.  It doesn't.  It looks like Fisher Price designed it.  A little bit, although I have to say

Start time: 3816.84
End time: 3823.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3826.94
End time: 3833.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure, but granted, when I've used it,  Nintendo has set it up, so it's not a living room test.

Start time: 3837.72
End time: 3873.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was just using it over the weekend  at my buddy's place to play the new Mario game.  And it's, as you described, there's almost no latency.  I mean, for a family with one big screen TV  in the living room, and dad wants to come in  and watch football, the kids want to keep playing Mario,  that's a pretty smart solution to that problem.  What, how?  Cause the kids play it on the Wii U?  Because you can keep playing on the tablet  while somebody switches TV.  Play on the tablet, kid.  But this is what they do with iPads now.  Just play on the tablet while something else  is up on TV.

Start time: 3873.68
End time: 3886.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's pretty clear that within the lifetime  of the Wii U, there will be many games  that use a tablet and the TV.  There already are, if you have an Apple TV,  there already are some games that do something  at least vaguely similar with your iPad  interacting with the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to say, you know, to go back to my sort  of internal demographic research with daughters  and their friends, no one is interested  in the Wii U even remotely.  So they're, you know, 13, 14, all they want  is an Xbox or a PlayStation 3.  And the main reason they want it is because  they want to play online with their friends,  you know, or people around the world.  I don't think they care about playing with people  in the same room as them.

Transcript:  My little friend, nine year old Michael,  has a Wii, has a PlayStation 3.  I don't even think he's ever heard of the Wii U.  He wants an Xbox.  Cause he plays Call of Duty, he wants Xbox 360.  It's mirror cast, it's a peer to peer.  This is how it talks to, it's a form of Wi-Fi,  but a peer to peer wireless screen cast standard  created by the Wi-Fi Alliance.  It's an open alternative to AirPlay mirroring.  That's what, according to the chat room,  that's what Nintendo is using.

It's the same reason you play Zelda or you play Mario.  It's nostalgia.  I love, I miss my Sega.  Sega!  And, Sega!  Sega!  And, God, I just missed that.  And so, in fact, the Dreamcast was, I think,  well, I shouldn't say this, cause I'll sound stupid,  but the best gaming system ever made.

Transcript:  I think people do have this long history  of underestimating Nintendo.  They're kind of, I mean, before the Wii came out,  people said that Wii was gonna be the number three console  and that Nintendo should get out of hardware.  Right.  So while I think it is pretty daunting for them,  despite that, I would keep that in mind.  People always think Nintendo's gonna crash.

Start time: 4062.02
End time: 4084.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think some of that is, it's like the Commodore 64,  that a lot of people bought it  and it ended up in a lot of closets.  Don't you think?  Eventually.  People got excited about the,  mom got excited about the Wii Fit.  Wii Fit, yeah.  And everybody thought, oh, this is cool  and you can play tennis.  And you do it.  You do it for the first, for a couple of days.  It's really fun.  You play, and then that's it.  It's over.

End time: 4107.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's what they're still doing with this new system.  I mean, it's the same controllers,  all the same concepts for how you play.  They've just added a tablet on.  It's gonna be a tough sell.  It's not as innovative as...

And then all of a sudden everyone decided  that it was overdone and the stock bounced back.  I did see a figure, I think their last year profit,  41 billion, I think it was,  more than Microsoft, eBay, Google, Yahoo,  Facebook, and Amazon combined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that post is all worth a read.  Longtime Mac user, diehard Apple fan,  even I will admit that Apple's approach to the web  has been, well I can't say the word, bad.  And I agree, I've been saying this for a long time,  Apple cannot figure out web services.  It is a hardware company and a brilliant design company  but that's what's scary.  If Google gets good at design and already knows services,  isn't this a problem for Apple?  His point is actually by Twitter.  Yeah.  I don't think.

Start time: 4475.10

End time: 4506.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know, I think he definitely has a point about them.  Every web service Apple has ever introduced is painful.  It's the exact opposite of what you expect  from Apple's devices.  So it's like a punch in the face usability wise.  So you have this beautiful device  and then you try to use one of their web services  and you just get frustrated.  They need to solve that problem.

Start time: 4506.86
End time: 4539.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the only thing you could say Twitter  has solved is scaling.  They've obviously gotten good at that.  They can handle, they have handled 327,000 tweets a minute  during the election.  They figured out how to solve,  we don't see the fail well anymore.  And that's bitter, knowledge won, hard won,  so that's good.  That would be valuable,  but I don't think that's the solution to the problem.  That doesn't help you become good at iCloud.  Being good at iCloud is about a user interface issue  about what kind of services, how to provide them,  how to make it understandable.  Apple just-

Transcript:  If you look at it, if you'll get his post,  part of his point is that they don't have the talent.  Right.  They don't have the engineers,  they don't have the developers who can do this stuff.  But who does?  They could get some of those by buying Twitter.

Start time: 4551.06

Transcript:  In a certain sphere, I mean, if you're a web person  or a social networking person,  there's no reason for you to want to go work at Apple,  and Apple provides very little incentives  for you to want to go work there.  They have this sort of mentality  that everyone should want to work at Apple,  so why should we pay a premium and bonuses?  And so when they're trying to expand  into say internet services,  it's kind of hard to attract those developers.  On the flip side, point to that article,  Google has developed a sort of complex  and a disadvantage recently,  which I think Apple has the advantage  in that it works very well with Facebook and with Twitter,  whereas Google is so bullish on Google Plus  that in the realm of internet services,  Apple being Sweden can be an upside.

Start time: 4623.90
End time: 4633.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And one big argument against them buying Twitter is,  well, they don't have to.  They have a partnership with Twitter.  They have a partnership with Facebook.  They're both integrated into their devices.  They don't need to buy them.

Start time: 4634.38
End time: 4641.36

End time: 4670.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, the reason they can't get people to use the website  is because it sucks.  And third-party apps are so much better.  And so Twitter's solution, kill the third-party apps?  I don't know, I don't think.  I would disagree, I would agree with Patrick's thesis  that Google's catching up fast,  but I would not agree with his solution.

Transcript:  Well, but yeah, so apparently it has the capability.  Not in the US, there's an LTE chip,  even though they don't sell the Nexus 4 as an LTE device,  it has an LTE chip, which apparently works in Canada.  All you have to do is dial star pound, star pound,  four six, three six, star pound, star pound,  and shake the phone really vigorously.  This is like the Konami code.  It is, isn't it?  It's like a video game.  Isn't it great?

Start time: 4750.98
End time: 4762.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's missing some other components, right?  I think something to do with the processor,  the amplification of the antenna,  it can't quite achieve great LTE service,  so they didn't build that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my sense of the Nexus 4 is it's not state of the art.  There are better, maybe, Android phones out there.  It's a developer phone.  It's a Google experience.  Somebody who is so sold on the plain  vanilla Google experience, that's a good choice,  or if you're a developer.  But for most other people, I mean, I like the,  I'm using the Galaxy Note 2, which I really like.

Start time: 4783.30
End time: 4789.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good phone, but.  It's not the best, is it the best?  No phone that doesn't do LTE is ever going to be.  Yeah, how can you say that?  A killer state of the art phone.

Start time: 4790.06
End time: 4798.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  But then my point is, I guess, they don't care.  They're not trying to sell a killer state of the art phone.  They don't even really want to challenge Samsung or HTC.

Start time: 4799.22
End time: 4807.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they wanted to put out one phone  they could sell everywhere.  One pure phone.  Which is tough to do with LTE.  Right, okay.  LTE is still too fragmented.  Okay.

Transcript:  So this story from techradar.com.  LG admits reason behind dropping 4G and Nexus 4  because it's secretly an optimus.  It's another phone.  So they told techradar this.  In order to provide the best possible specification  for the Nexus 4, LG utilized the same powerful Qualcomm  snaps, Dragon chipset, as in the optimus,  and that's why there's LTE in there.  But you have to put other hardware in there,  as you pointed out.  So it's cheaper.  It's in there, but you don't use it.  That makes sense.  We're talking, if we finish the Wii U conversation,  is there anything more to say about that?  Is that gonna take off like crazy?  People are gonna love that.  It's pretty daunting, we'll see.

Now we do want set-top boxes.  And I think that's why Microsoft is starting  to position the Xbox 360 as a media player.  Sony's done it, but it's not as easy to use.  It's not as well integrated, in my opinion.  It's a good Blu-ray player, though.  That's the funny thing.  It's as great as Blu-ray player made.

Start time: 4958.20
End time: 5003.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought that actually from day one.  Because Microsoft had always said,  we want to make set-top boxes.  The problem is they were too expensive,  so the cable companies would never do it.  They said, no, we're gonna get buy these cheapos  from Motorola, or Harris, and we're gonna keep selling those.  We're not gonna get this expensive stuff.  It's too powerful.  So Microsoft said, all right, well, we'll get in another way.  We'll get a foot in the door through gaming.  We'll get in the living room.  Once we're in the living room,  then we can make it be a media device.  Good point, too.  Ken from Chicago says,  and look at the cost of games on iPhones and iPads  compared to a $60 cartridge.  I'm sorry, cartridge.  Nobody uses cartridges.  What do they use?  What do the kids use now?  There's those little disks that you put  in your PlayStation Portable, right?  That's what they're all using now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, based on the sales of Halo 4  and the new Call of Duty game,  console gaming is alive and well.  And I think that will still appeal to a lot of people.  And the way that the Xbox made itself into a Trojan horse  and got its way into the living room,  as Matthew alluded to earlier,  is they went to the kids who wanted gaming  in the living room.  And then they shoveled a bunch of other features into there.  And I think they can continue to use that strategy  to a large extent with the next generation.

Start time: 5049.58
End time: 5075.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think the piece that people miss so constantly  is it's not just about Call of Duty,  and it's not just about the game itself.  It's about the social interaction that comes with...  Like I look at nephews and friends of theirs  using Xbox Live.  It's all about the other people on that network,  some of whom live in foreign countries.  They have no clue what their names are even,  and yet they're closer than, you know,  the kid who lives next door  because they play Call of Duty all the time.

But I don't think that's necessarily bad.  I mean, that's just new.  It's different.  And in some ways, I think it's amazing  that people know people now all over the world  and you could get to know somebody talking to them  on the phone or on the headset, right?

So the concept of this hackathon was to get experts  in the law together to read through privacy policies,  come up with better solutions,  but also there was products that came out of it.  For example, these stickers, little icons  that would appear on the top of websites  so you instantly know whether they're tracking you,  how long they're keeping your information.  That's good.

And that's the main reason I don't do it, because I'm afraid of getting electrocuted.  It's a dangerous sport being a ham.  So there is a number.  There are a number of things people can get upset about this week.  Just pass this along to you.  The UN, the International Telecommunications Union is going to have a meeting.  And there's Google's upset.  Everybody seems to be upset because they're afraid.  That the UN is going to take over the Internet.  I don't know if this really is the issue.  It sounds almost like black helicopters.  Because when you say UN, that's a that's a hot button for some people like, oh, the  international lawyers conspiracy or something is going to take over.

End time: 5763.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, first of all, I would like to point out that the US does not own the Internet.  Right.  This is true.  We invented the TCP protocol through with help from the Defense Department.  But the World Wide Web, which most of us consider like the key thing in the Internet,  was invented by a British guy in Switzerland.  And the Internet is in fact a global thing.  So, you know, for a long time, it was the in fact, the Commerce Department that kind  of regulated the Internet through ICANN.  Who should regulate the Internet?  Is there should there be an international body?  The ITU does a lot of this.  Because they're the International Telecommunications Union, and it is a UN  body, but I don't think that this is in fact, Michael Geist, who I really love, he's  a Canadian. You probably do you know, Michael, Matthew, all you Canadians know  each other? Yeah, I know.  Yeah, we're we're good friends.  So he's you will, I'm sure, vouch for him completely trustworthy in this regard.  Very astute.  Yeah. He says that the UN Internet takeover rumors mask a bigger problem.  You can read about it on his blog, but you and this actually goes back to June.  But he had a recent post on I can't remember some newspaper and I.  The Star.  That's right. The Toronto Star.  The Toronto Star.  So the Globe and Mail.  Is like the big newspaper in Toronto.

Start time: 5765.09

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the UN Internet meeting is not about who pays, says Michael Geist.  No, it is about who pays.  It is about who pays, not who rules.  And this is so don't get fooled by this whole notion that the UN wants to run the  Internet. What's really going on is the European Internet service providers  through a group called ETNO wants to change the way the Internet works.  So right now it's it's a peering model, the sending.  They want to replace that.  So right now, OK, if I correct me if I'm wrong, because you guys probably  understand this better than I do.  But the idea is that I pay for an on ramp to this big data pipe, the backbone.  I pay my Internet service provider and they pay some money to get on the  backbone and so on.  Google pays their Internet service provider to be available on the Internet  with servers.  So we've all paid our Internet service providers.  The data can now flow between us.  The problem is, and I remember AT&T was bitching about how much data Google  uses and said Google ought to pay for access to our subscribers.  It's effectively double dipping.  They want me to pay them.  My Internet service provider for access to the outside world, but then they want  Google to pay for access to me as their customers.  This is called the sending network party pays model.  And I can see when you have something like Netflix, which uses 40 percent of  all prime time data now in the U.S., people watching movies like crazy, that  you might want to say, well, gosh, Netflix should pay to access our  customers, but here's the problem.  You don't want this as a customer.  You don't want some providers to have more access to you because they paid  Comcast or Verizon for your access and some to have.  And I'll tell you who really is worried about this is me because I'm not  Netflix or Google.  Google can afford to pay a little extra to get YouTube to everybody.  Right.  But I can't and I'm on the free and open Internet and I want a free and open  Internet so that you can watch our podcasts, you can watch our video.  And if Verizon then says, well, if you want to access our customers better,  you ought to pay us.  So this scares me.  This idea of sending network party pays.  That's a, that's a scary model.  Etno's asking for that.  It also wants new quality of service rules, according to Michael Geist, that  are, uh, would threaten net neutrality.  The idea is we want to be run it.  We want a more reliable network like a telecom, uh, it would threaten the idea  that all internet traffic is created equal.  So Geist and I think he's absolutely wonderful.  Says, don't, don't you're getting distracted by this idea that UN is  going to run the internet.  That's not the problem.  Watch out for these, for these ISPs who are making a power play and threatening,  uh, uh, you know, net neutrality.  I hope that the, uh, ITU understands that and doesn't go for it.  You guys are completely silent on this.  I, you know, I tried to explain this on the radio show too.  And when, and that's exactly the reaction I got.

Start time: 5951.44
End time: 5976.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think Michael makes a great point.  You know, it's, it's one thing to say the UN is going to take over the internet.  Obviously we don't really want that, but I think this danger is more realistic,  which is that the ITU and its members are trying to use this as a way of, you  know, filling their own pockets.  The telecom companies that are members of this union, that's what they really  want is to squeeze more money out of ISPs and users.

Transcript:  Um, if it's, it's yeah.  And also what's wrong with an international body regulating the internet?  Who should internet?  Not the U S commerce department.  Well, I mean, ICAN plays a pretty, but ICAN is, is kind of run as I'm not clear  on this, but it sounds, I think the U S commerce department, unless they've  washed their hands of it several years ago, they did.

Start time: 6001.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, one of the risks with the ITU proposals, um, or one of the things that  people are afraid of is that countries like Russia and China and they don't  like a free and open internet.  Yeah.  Right.  So the risk is that they're going to try and use their votes and sway others to,  to impose sort of, you know, restrictions on what we think of as the free and  open internet.

Start time: 6052.18
End time: 6122.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's reasonable to be worried about as well.  If that, I mean, that's reasonable as well.  You basically have a couple of bad actors here.  You have internet service providers and you have, uh, governments, both of  whom want to control and regulate and, and, uh, and, and exploit the internet.  And what we want is a free and open internet.  All right.  Oh, anyway, we'll watch that.  That's this week, the ITU meets, but they unfortunately, they meet kind of in  secret, so that's another reason to worry.  Now this is the one that's really making me crazy.  So Patrick Leahy, who has kind of a checkered past when it comes to privacy,  he's written some good privacy bills and he's also written the, uh, IP protect  act and the Patriot act part and a part of it.  Uh, he has proposed a law scheduled for vote next week in the United States  Senate that would allow law enforcement agencies and other government agencies,  more than 22 government agencies, warrantless access to everything you've  got on the net, your email, if you're an American, your Google docs, your Facebook  wall posts, even Twitter direct messages.  Um, Leo?

Start time: 6122.83
End time: 6143.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Um, is that the CNET article you're looking at?  Yeah.  Cause they did an update, uh, or follow up.  Oh, good.  It's not.  Leahy has basically said that he has no intention of putting that bill forward.  It wasn't his idea.  He's not interested in doing those things.  He's completely repudiated.  Oh, thank goodness.  Interest that he might've had in it.

Start time: 6144.24
End time: 6159.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Declan McCullough writing at CNET.  Thank you for updating that.  Yeah.  This was updated at 5 PM.  It says, so I don't know how he did that five minutes ahead of time, but, uh, 4  28 PM, thank you for, uh, Matthew for noticing that cause this just was updated.

Start time: 6160.38
End time: 6164.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, seemed like an update that would be more useful at the top of the story.

Start time: 6164.77
End time: 6182.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cause the whole story goes on.  Well, in any event, this is something to watch out for.  Uh, God, this would be, and by the way, this was not just like the FBI and the  CIA, this was the security and exchange commission, the federal communications  commission, OSHA.  So he's saying, Leahy saying, I didn't write this.

Start time: 6183.56
End time: 6195.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's saying he never pushed for that, that this was a document that was  presented for discussion.  Um, but it wasn't, these weren't his proposals and he had no intention  of supporting them.  That sounds convenient.  What he's saying.

Start time: 6197.52
End time: 6218.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds like he says this, maybe they floated a little tribal.  Hey, would anybody notice if we did this?  Oh, they did.  I didn't mean it.  All right.  Well, let's keep an eye on that one.  Cause that is, that is, uh, that is exactly what they want, right?  They want emergency powers and they're getting closer and closer to that.  Uh, already.

Start time: 6219.34
End time: 6233.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go ahead.  I think some of that fear, you know, about that sort of thing came up during  the portrayalist thing as well.  You know, well, exactly.  I had any number of people say to me, if the head of the CIA can't keep his  email secret, you know, and who can?

Start time: 6233.82
End time: 6285.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the F apparently what happened is in this investigation, the FBI asked  permission from Google or maybe subpoenaed or maybe even they had a warrant.  We don't know.  And said to Google, we want to see a portrayalist's personal Gmail.  This is not as now they have a national security issue.  And I think that they probably in this case, cause he is the director of the  CIA, they wanted to see if he had released any secrets in his Gmail.  But of course in the process, uh, the scandal erupted and he had to quit.  Um, but I think, I don't think that that's unreasonable.  If you're the director of CIA, you don't have the same expectation of privacy  in all likelihood that I do.  Nevertheless, it just shows you with a proper piece of paper, people can read  anything you put on that.  Google may, you know, I mean, they may try to fight for your privacy, but if it,  if it comes down to it, they, they're going to adhere to the laws in the US,  just as they adhere to the laws in China.

You, I see you scanning through it, Mark Millian, anything that you wanted to  talk about before we wrap this thing up.  We talked about the UN.  Eric Schmidt says parents should talk with kids about being online  before they talk about sex.  Did your parents talk to you about being online when you were a little bit?  Oh, I'm getting an ad, skip the ad.  Thank you.  Thank you, Forbes for that fine ad.  We need to fight for our privacy or we'll lose it.  It says Eric Schmidt.  Uh, he says the justice system whites, wipes a kid's criminal record  when he or she turns 18.  But if a teenager does something incredibly stupid on the internet,  it's going to follow you for the rest of your life.  This is a good point.  So teach kids.  I'd argue says Eric Schmidt for those of you with teenagers and preteens  probably have the online talk before the sex talk.  I think that's probably true because it's anything that, you know, they  do is going to live forever and you can't wipe it clean.  New survey from the Pew center and the Berkman center says that actually  parents do do that.
