Because it's a hot hopefully interoperable mess which a couple years ago  It was a hot but closed down and difficult to deal with meth. It's still meth mess  It's still a pain  But it's going to be really interesting to watch that evolve the Internet of Things is everywhere and it's it's defined in ten thousand different ways  It was interesting to see how CEA is is kind of moving the industry forward

Transcript:  So there's a bunch of interesting things going on right Microsoft drops out Intel drops out from the big press day  You know events Intel still has a booth though. Sure  Doesn't have a booth in years Apple hasn't gone in years  Well happy yeah, I mean, you know Apple whether Apple leaked the rumors or the rumors just happened to show up during CES  I do Apple doesn't deal with CES, but they drop a few things just to keep people nervous, right?  But what was BMW had half of the parking lot in front of the LVCC and you might be thinking like who cares?  They brought like 50 BMW i3s. They were doing electric vehicles  They were showing reporters advanced version of autonomous driving technology, you know with a like an Android wear watch or an Android smartwatch  You know where they were like, you know car or BMW i3 here boy or whatever  They were saying into it and then the car would drive up to them and they would get in the car would drive itself  You would send the car to park itself  That's a pretty neat demo. But when you look at like the press days, you know GM was announcing for 30 seconds  They previewed the new Chevy Volt the night before while they were talking about on star  Volkswagen had a major keynote Toyota had a major keynote  You know that LG was partnering with Audi  So the automotive manufacturers have come in in a very very big way that I certainly would not have expected two three years ago  And it wasn't oh, yeah Ford announced sync three  There's a whole lot of the in dashboard stuff  But automotive manufacturers are talking about the stuff in the rest of the car at the Consumer Electronics Show

Start time: 711.56
End time: 721.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was one of the big things I'm surprised the cars were there because well in years past the Detroit Auto Show has been at the same  Time this this time they moved it. It starts tomorrow. That's what was so funny

Start time: 721.24
End time: 736.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why they moved in the middle of in the middle of GM's kind of like on star 4g LTE room booking and hey  And they whip some curtain backs for 30 seconds and here's the next generation Chevy Bolt and 30 seconds later the curtain goes shut  And it's like we'll tell you the rest about everything is the new volt at Detroit, right?

Start time: 737.14
End time: 753.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So obviously, you mean it does show that the cars are more a consumer electronics than they've ever been in the past  Ford Ford really was one of the first to go to these events because of sync and they wanted to get a  Reputation as a technology company. What about autonomous vehicles? Did you see any of those?

Start time: 753.38
End time: 768.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We the big autonomous vehicle pavilion was outside so you had Audi as it should be you had Mercedes  Yes, you had BMW and you had VW were they all concept cars or no  Yeah, that's the fantastic I saw that you can actually buy that car in Europe Wow

Transcript:  Well, this is I mean this is I got to talk to I you know, one of those large electronics manufacturers  You've never heard of except for you heard of once that actually provides like half the parts for half the automobile  Manufacturers in the world. I was talking to one of these people at SEMA in  2013 and one of the things I was told was like yeah, you know luxury autonomous vehicles 2017  They're gonna be all over the place, you know affordable autonomous vehicles  2025 assisted driving like is gonna show up in the it's amazing how fast this stuff is coming, right? So, you know  Autonomous or assisted driving ie like the car is gonna try to keep you from swerving in front of the the 18-wheeler  That's gonna be like 2017 2018 by 2025, you know autonomous self-driving cars should be fairly common  I had cars already have a lot. Yeah  Yeah, but there's a big difference between your Audi a8 and like me buying a two-year-old beat to snot Subaru  You know what I mean when it's in the two-year-old beat to snot Subaru that I'm gonna pay for it doesn't cost that much  Yeah

Start time: 829.88
End time: 848.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Audi system was was ridiculously impressive. I love what they did with the a7 and the RS7  Those were beautiful cars  But the one that got it for me was the VW because the sensors they used to make it assisting and self parking are  Actually already in the e-golf if you buy the e-golf package those sensors are there  They just wrote software to use that in a different way

Start time: 848.82
End time: 884.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  Well, even Ford has said we have many sensors in our cars now  Yeah  And the idea is they're gonna be there and we'll be able to take advantage of them in years to come  Even if we don't today, but there's also consumer acceptance, right?  I think the idea of that Mercedes-Benz car where you have a swivel seat  So you don't have to see out the window is a little scary the idea of saying well  Let's just have a cup of tea and we'll let the car get us there. Will people accept that?  I guess they will. Yeah, we do it. Somebody tweeted me you're doing it now already in airplanes  Yeah, airplanes flying themselves. I mean, I often landing themselves you drive in Northern, California

And then I moved to Northern California and I find out what really stupid driving looks like yeah  There's there's you know  That's not even thinking about like what are the last four things you've seen people doing in the car that was true  People are reading newspaper terrible drivers applying makeup eating meals

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shaving I think everybody accepts the idea that a self-driving car would do a better job 90% of the time  It's the fear that it'll get in a situation where it can't handle it and it'll just fail

Start time: 924.58
End time: 951.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But how do you have something for that 10% so their system uses it has near-field sensors for you know?  Pedestrian avoidance, but it also can see was it three miles down the road with lidar with laser radar and some other system  And it actually has it knows ahead of time right it will tell you if the road doesn't look like it thinks it's supposed to look  If it's not matching up to the GPS it will actually inform the driver  You're gonna have to take me wake up wake up.

I mean that's well unless you know it all depends right you know  I mean there was you know people like you know well  Yeah, I don't have a key anymore  And it's like oh well I can blue snarf your key and then I can open your car when you're gone, right  I mean it's interesting Hyundai did something really cool. They're all their blue link systems going back to the original Sonata's in 2012  Their new application which will remotely start the car and turn on the air or turn on the heat right depending on whether you're in  Florida in August or Oklahoma you know in in in December  Will work with all the cars going back  So it's obviously gonna be a big deal that they secure the living snot out of these not just the car itself  But the network connection and the applications that are running on Android or iOS that's a big deal

I think he was working at Google  He said one thing that people don't understand is that one of the biggest  Resource waste in the world is that we all have a car in some cases more than one  Self-driving autonomous vehicles can create a new sharing economy where you don't need to own a car  Oh, I thought uber was doing that well  But even better you push a button the car comes to you takes you where you're going and then takes off  He said you could even let's say you want to go camping you need an RV  Carl take you to the RV you get in the RV car takes off the RV drives you where you want to go  You don't need to own a car anymore if you have autonomous vehicles can come to you as needed

Transcript:  You know, I am excited about autonomous vehicles. I think it's gonna be revolutionary  I think it's interesting that there's a category that is totally new to CES and there is something to talk about  Let's talk about TVs when we come back  We're take a little bit of a break because if you picked another category where there's constant innovation and kind of a scramble to create  A market because frankly the TV sales have plummeted  It's that and we'll talk about what was new in television that we should get Robert on for yes  But first let's talk about how a revolution in stamps. Oh you might say what?  Mailing stuff that's as old as Ben Franklin. No, no  Stamps comm is actually one of the biggest revolutions in mailing things ever  First of all, you don't have to go to the post office anymore  You can print your own US postage from your computer and your printer on demand as needed 24-7  This is this you don't have to draw. You don't need an autonomous vehicle get to the post office  You don't have to get up from your desk and then the mail carrier comes to you picks it up  It's so easy. And and by the way, this is not a postage meter. It's a fraction of the cost no special links  You've got everything you need  In fact, if you go to our stamps comm page right now stamps comm click the microphone at the top of the page on the right  There and use your offer code Twitter. We're gonna get you something else  You don't have that you need which is a great digital scale  TWIT is the offer code that digital scale means you always have exactly the right postage  It's USB plugs right into your computer. We're gonna get you a  30 days trial four weeks trial of stamps comm and up to  $55 in free postage to use over your first few months as a stamps comm customer  $55 free postage  So there's really no reason not to find out how stamps comm can change your business if you mail stuff in business if you  Even just you know invoices or brochures. We use it all the time for stuff like that marketing kits  But if you're even more so if you're an Etsy seller an eBay seller, why aren't you using stamps comm?  I still every once in a while buy something on eBay with with postage stamps licked postage stamps on the thing  It's crazy when you can do it this way so much better. You'll even get discounts. You cannot get at the post office  It'll fill out all the forms for you. If it's a if it's you know  Priority mail or comfort some sort of confirmation mail. They'll email your recipient ahead of time with the code all of that  Just professional stamps comm click the microphone the upper right hand corner use the offer code  Twit for a very special hundred ten dollar bonus offer  That's what I looked like with hair by the way if you go to stamps comm click the microphone in there to tweet  You'll see what I look like with hair

So fork so we've been 4k look I first saw 4k displays at CES eight years ago something like that  And I even then I said this is where the industry should go  This is really an exciting development a lot of people said no, you're not gonna notice anything on a smaller screen  It's only on a 70 or 80 inch screen. You notice a difference  Did you notice a difference even on 55 or 60 inch screens? I think you do there's not much content

Start time: 1904.92
End time: 1939.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, there's there's a lot of stuff going on right? So the UHC Alliance is coming together  Which is a bunch of television manufacturers that are trying to figure out how to get more 4k delivered so they can sell more 4k  Televisions 4k screens are becoming less expensive  So 4k is are gonna be in the in the 1080p and they already are in the 1080p range in terms of pricing  Yeah, the price is plummeted. Maybe well, here's the thing. Nobody's making it like, you know, Toshiba wasn't there  Vizio wasn't there. You know, it's kind of like LG's OLED versus Samsung s UHD  Quantum dot technology, which is essentially the quantum dot. What's that?

Start time: 1939.60
End time: 1967.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see a quantum dot many quantum dots turn up to vorax bleed so that we can hear  Many quantum dots so the almost an infinite number of things. Okay  So let's let me just explain what this is. I think so these are still LCD TVs  They're still LED backlit LCD TVs, but there are now all white LEDs with a special quantum  film  Between the LED and the screen that changes. What does it do?

Start time: 1968.32
End time: 2017.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so essentially the the the quantum dot technology means gives you a more pure backlight or more specifically controlled backlight  So that they are little pieces of whatever bits matter stuff that when they are hit with a specific wavelength of light emit light  And it's specific. Yes, right. No, actually, it's not it's an expanded color gamut. It's better looking reds. It's better looking greens  It's it's physically noticeable  And I mean there's a lot of stuff going on with the OLEDs at LG one of the things that is  Spectacular is the black levels because they're black there is there is no light coming out of the monitor because it is off  You know with the Samsung s UHD and a lot of other places are using quantum dots quantum dots  It's a more efficient backlight, right? Yeah, that's part of it and it's a better  So the question is not yes, it looks spectacular whether you're talking about Sony's x900 or Samsung's s UHD

They're probably gonna go for the expanded color. It's gonna look better  It's gonna look better

It's too hot or something  Okay, so quantum dots a real technology here's something that makes me sad though  Plasma is all but dead. Yes, and I think many agreed plasma was the best-looking television sets and I bought into OLED  Now only LG is gonna continue with OLEDs OLEDs are dying with all these companies are putting all of their research and efforts into

Yeah for codec  They're gonna use HEVC's which is the same as H dot 265 and there's a there's a standards body now  it looks like finally the content and  The TVs will have something to aim for and that's good because we've been telling people  Don't buy 4k until a standard is ratified at least right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but then the nice thing is you can have someone else actually controlling where the camera is and it's all it's all optically  It's all stabilized. It's digitally zoomed  And unlike these quadcopters if you put it into a location and then you release the controls it will stay there  Yeah, so it will hold its position  Rock steady getting you this beautiful footage

Transcript:  So that's the way you go ahead. I was gonna ask what do you think about the Chris Anderson's type of drone?  What's you mean that the DIY drones guy? Well, I know that once you pre-program its route  And then you push the button off it goes to take photos it's a horrible idea

Start time: 3654.04
End time: 3661.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it depends on the drone that depends on the platform  It depends on the gimbal and it depends on how good you are at flying it because I mean it's autonomous

Start time: 3661.74

End time: 3676.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean see that's the thing. We always get people who are like these aren't drones. These are quadcopters  I understand what they're saying  But drone just means that you have some sort of autonomous functionality and any any of these will have some sort of autonomous function

Start time: 3676.56
End time: 3691.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mostly just to hover right?  Just so that they stay stable. That's right  That's what the original pair at AR did so well is it was easier to fly because it had some autonomy  Look at the is this from the bebop? This is from the bebop. How could that cup the picture be so good?

I was in Hawaii and found out that President Obama was on the island the same time that we were yes  And the FAA issued a directive saying you are not allowed to fly drones quadcopters while the president is on the island  So the first night I'm a first day  I'm on Waikiki Beach, and I really want to fly this and there's an officer that I asked him  I said am I gonna get in trouble?  Flying this thing and he says the FAA actually doesn't set policy it doesn't set law they've issued an advisory  He said they have no enforcement no FAA police to come get you so so he said fly away

Yeah, I mean yeah lifts the motors and the skids out of the way so that the camera below has an  Unobstructed 360 degree view and it's 4k. It's yeah, beautiful. It's a beautiful camera

Start time: 3889.12
End time: 3905.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It comes with a gimbal because it's one of the problems with the DJI's they didn't come with a gimbal  So you either had a static camera mount or you started hacking?  Gimbals onto it which worked with less or greater  Effectiveness 18 minutes this is a game where they're claiming like 18 minutes of flight time like a 2 kilometer range

Start time: 3907.94
End time: 3914.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dot-com and this is one of those models where you could have one person piloting the craft  And then you have a cameraman who's actually pointing the camera  Actually smart because it's very hard to do both and they've added a feature  Where you can actually detach the gimbal from the craft and it becomes a handheld so you could do like steady cam shots with it  Yeah  How much between two and three grand depending on how you?

Transcript:  Outfit it's good. We didn't buy them that other DJ that everybody wanted to get last month, right?  Because this one is the one we're gonna get right John  Next year they offered us a deal like how much of a deal  I'm not sure would it compromise our integrity no not that good. I'll just build it  I'm ready for a deal that'll compromise our integrity

Start time: 3961.80
End time: 3996.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the deal I want I don't know if you saw there was a really good article on gizmodo before Christmas the best drone for  every beginner and  Sean Hollister at gizmodo went and bought like 15 drones off of Amazon  Actually the a bunch of them  He kind of talked about which ones were best for what situation like air hogs helix x4 stunt  Which is one you can actually buy in targets?  The best miniature was a UDI  U83-9 because a miniature drone I want a drone that can hurt somebody well you can hurt  I mean you can you can you can hurt somebody should we be worried about okay?

Start time: 3998.88
End time: 4017.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's the the reason you buy a $33 drone off of Amazon is because you know  There's kind of two or three reasons one. They're hard to kill two  You're gonna make a lot of mistakes when you're learning how to fly a drone right and it's better to make those kind of mistakes  Running it into a wall crashing into the ground blowing off the landing getting them caught in trees

Start time: 4018.22
End time: 4040.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  destroying the biggest mistake you will make when flying a  Quadcopter is so this is forward right and then you turn it around and suddenly this is backwards  So if you don't keep track of your orientation, I'm confused already exactly  Your control input and what'll happen and then you'll go left and we'll go right or you'll go back and it will go forward  So you got to practice with you got a practice a lot

Start time: 4041.92
End time: 4048.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay again safety and privacy so let's talk with safety  It's possible on many of these drones to fly them outside of the range of your controller

Start time: 4048.80
End time: 4054.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 4054.84
End time: 4064.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unless you build one of the ones that we taught you how to build a know-how because it will actually start making a lazy  Left turn to let you acquire signal, which is awesome because like the DJI fandom

Start time: 4064.60
End time: 4087.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is a pretty expensive pretty nice drone  It does all sorts of cool GPS stuff if you fly it out of its range a friend of mine turned to found out it  We will actually drop out of the sky and slam itself into the ground at top speed  Which is which was great because great on camera  He was well he was in Palm Springs in the in the hope, you know, and it's like all of a sudden news  And he had to go  In this matronly woman and there been horrific injuries with drones

End time: 4135.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know but understand that this is a category that is it growing exponentially all of a sudden  Okay, so so like everybody's getting a drone now, right so that's I think that yes, maybe there haven't been problems yet  I'm just gonna I think there might be a problem any minute now  Okay, that's one  Safety, I mean privacy, so there's also this concern. They've banned drones in national parks. There's this concern that

Start time: 4136.68
End time: 4141.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, everything else like the controller. Yeah, okay. I would I would prefer to use it like I think the parrot works great on iOS  It's a pretty atrocious flying experience or control experience on Android. How about the bebop? Should I get a bebop? Oh

Start time: 4204.34
End time: 4215.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4220.58
End time: 4248.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What we've been trying to do a know-how is when you build a craft and when you have someone actually explain how it works  Yeah, you're not as likely to do stupid things with it because you have some ownership you will have ownership also like I like DJI  But one of the biggest problems with DJI is you buy these any  Fatal craft and you think that it's a toy so you send it 400 feet up and now you don't know how to get it back down  Now it's gonna plumb if you build it you actually understand the physics that go into making it work. Yeah, there's a been a site for years

Start time: 4248.52
End time: 4276.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've talked about it before DIY drones. You like this site. Oh, yes  This is this is kind of these guys have been doing this for a long time  DIY drones calm I  Don't know why Oh Golden Globes. They're gonna be drone will be used to film celebs in the red carpet  They're everywhere  Every TV operation has to have a drum. We have a DJI Phantom  Just cuz we're TV operation.

Transcript:  Yeah, so the basically the the Intel nooks the the little Intel computing boxes were there and then  One of my favorite things the show Dell's XPS 13 love that tell us about that. Okay, so I found the Dell booth and  There's two things I kind of fell in love with we're talking about this before the Dell ultra sharp 34 curved monitor  It's very similar. Samsung's gonna have similar monitor later on this year like six months out right now  You can go buy the Dell ultra sharp 34  Which actually somebody in the chat room said that I can buy it for a thousand dollars if I find the coupons  So it's a 21 by 9 ultra wide monitor that looks  Gorgeous that actually starts at 799 what you're looking at right now. This is 13 almost bezel lists. Yes, I mean inch  I mean  It's basically like a an 11 inch MacBook Air will fit inside of that thing  Because Ryan has a picture on PC perv like an 11 inch MacBook Air sitting inside of that and looking very clunky and  Wow

Start time: 4547.48
End time: 4583.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the the the graphics built into the Intel processor are gonna be significantly faster  We're hearing somewhere between 20 and 30 percent. I'm gonna call it like 25 percent  They're claiming like 90 minutes additional battery life. That's the key over the Haswell process  What are they getting for the new XPS 13? It's like 15 hours. They're claiming 15 hours 15 now  I would I mean I want to of course like if anybody wants to send me a laptop, please  But you know the other thing is but it's starting at like 800 bucks  Which is which is pretty for the 1080p screen and they're offering it without a touchscreen  Which I think is a great idea because I think the touchscreen thing is kind of run itself down the new

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know  It's funny you say that because I'm running a Dell XPS 13 right now  And I've been in a bunch of situations because I'm doing a bunch of work like what's the code for Squarespace one last time?  twit thank you  You know where I where I want to have my Squarespace window up and I want to have the patreon window up  And I want to have something else up  And I'm actually kind of dying for a higher resolution monitor because I spent a few months working on a on a 4k desktop monitor  So you want the quad HD I want the quad HD  I know you can't get touch touchscreen in the 1080p one you have to be honest with you  I use the touchscreen like when I'm opening up the laptop instead of hitting the spacebar  Yeah, and then you once in a while. I'll touch it again. I've been using touch screens in all-in-one desktops  I've been using touch screens with Windows 8.1 and with Windows X or Windows 10  So you'd say get QHD. I'm not a huge fan of touch screens on on tablets  They're amazing on desktops and laptops

Start time: 4643.98
End time: 4659.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not not as fascinating to me so 999 for the non touch 1080p screen  12 or actually as little as I think it ends up being $300 to get the quad HD screen. That's not bad  Yeah, and double the memory. Yeah. Oh actually no you got eight gigs in the yeah

Start time: 4659.92
End time: 4673.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, eight gigs is what the XPS 13 is gonna max out at but I mean the new processor  They're claiming, you know significant I don't know about significant but a but a healthy reduction in  Power consumption which equals like they're claiming like 90 minutes additional battery life. It's a talk

Start time: 4674.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I figure here's why I didn't pull the trigger on this XPS 13  In fact, it's kind of a surprise usually Apple's a first out of the gate with a new Intel chip, right?  And in this case it's Dell first out of the gate  But I imagine that there's we've heard this rumor there'd be a MacBook Air 12 inch  With super thin design and stuff.

Yeah, it's like Kleenex. Yeah  Yeah, I stopped using Google search. I use Bing  I will admit to that because it actually for what I searched for it's more relevant  Wow, it cuts out so much of the junk. Yeah, yeah is being by the way. Yahoo is being yeah

Start time: 6345.94
End time: 6373.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I only only two. Yeah, I think it also varies a lot depending on what category you're searching  And and how much that particular like if you're I remember at one point  I haven't done it a while trying to search for a particular chunk of information about transmissions and on Bing  I got like 19 pages of fly-by-night transmission companies or or or places that were like sort of link farms related to transmissions  And in Google I could actually get somebody with information about it  But it's it's curious to take a look at the at the different search engine

Start time: 6374.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 6395.30
End time: 6445.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because no one's trying to game Bing. They're all trying to game. Oh now I did search for out of transmission now getting a lot of ads  Okay, it's a little less useful when it search for me, that's good  All right interesting, maybe maybe this is why Google's getting into insurance  Yeah, there's no future in that search stuff  It's no insurance. I have an idea. Yeah, there you go. That's the future  Google is lobbying for  Cheaper airwaves Google's it, you know Google has for a long time  Let's talk about the FCC because real quickly next month the FCC says  they're going to make a decision on open internet rules and  Tom Wheeler the chairman of the FCC has kind of been according to some  Telegraphing that he thinks he's gonna go title tool

Start time: 6447.84
End time: 6453.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 6454.94
End time: 6509.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pure title first. Well, yeah, that's the thing. I mean, there's no rule that says they have to forbear right he was speaking  He was speaking at CES. I think no, I'm sorry. Oh worse. He's at the NCT a oh, yeah  Oh, no, that's an old picture. This was in a one-to-one conversation with Gary Shapiro of the CEA  He he implied according to ours technique of the title to will be the basis for new net neutrality rules  This is what a lot of internet advocates have suggested  Others have said we're very worried about this because this this is this is a very sweeping thing when you make broadband providers  common carriers the  FCC has all sorts of power to even regulate rates  Wheeler told Shapiro on Wednesday the FCC considered both sides first you want to make sure this is a quote that innovators have  Access to open internet on the other hand you have to create an environment to provide sufficient incentives to ISPs who want to invest and build out

Start time: 6512.26
End time: 6556.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But why would we listen to those ISPs this is this is the same group AT&T  Remember they had their temper tantrum when they did the latest spectrum sale and they said well  We don't like the rules that you're you're using for the auction. So we're not gonna play they ended up playing anyways  It was a big bluff. They're doing the same thing here  The the modified title to plan that the FCC wants to put into place would basically say you can do anything for consumers  You can sell your services the way that you want  But as soon as you start making the interconnect agreements, that's going to be held under title to regulation  That actually makes sense  It's not super heavy-handed the the telcos and the ISPs can still sell the services that they want to sell at the prices  That they want to sell it  It's just saying that they can't be restrictive on how the net the information transfers between networks

Start time: 6556.52
End time: 6591.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting because Wheeler pointed out in his interview that it was 20 years ago that he negotiated  He was a negotiating on behalf of the wireless industry for something called section  332 which said that wireless should be regulated under title to as a common carrier  But instruct the FCC to forbear from owners owners provisions and inappropriate provisions  So and just as you say to enforce the proper part of title to but John you you're an anti-government guy  You say this is just the government this is the camel's nose under the tent you like the government  Can we get that as a sound bite?

Start time: 6592.96
End time: 6642.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Government  Well, I'm concerned that anytime these guys but in they start to you know, they they just gives them something to do they  They work for a government agency  They always looking to take over something so they can give them they can be expanding get bigger  And that means if the bigger you get the guy at the top gets more money  So you want to get bigger and bigger and bigger and that's and it's they're gonna just take over the internet and tell us  What what's what and then if you can say that yeah a little bit of title to a little bit of this  It's not gonna be as bad as you think  But then all of a sudden the public itself thinks that the FCC's got something to do with it when they may not and they're gonna  Start demanding I would like better service. I would like me for example, I get the worst Comcast numbers  I used to say Comcast think I won't say that anymore  It's just a crappy service because I have to upgrade to business  Obviously, I was just the way they operate by the way now

Start time: 6642.08
End time: 6656.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to cancel my home and they didn't cancel the home when you upgraded the business and then when I call they said  Oh, I totally got screwed because they call and say well you have an early termination fee at home  You can't cancel unless you pay us a lot of money. You know, I'm actually with John

Start time: 6656.34
End time: 6698.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I do believe that the government can screw this up  I would only suggest this use of title to as a method of last resort  Problem is we are at the method of last resort people don't realize this is not a new thing  This goes back 30 plus years go back to the 1986 Telecommunications Act go back to the the broadband act go back to the sale  of NBC to Comcast the  proposed acquisition of dish by AT&T each and every single time the ISPs and the telcos have made promises that they will look out for  the the good of their customers and they never have and then they get fined a couple million dollars in its business as usual  So we're now at this place where this is it. This is all we have left. They're not keeping their word

Start time: 6698.56
End time: 6734.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the only stick we have left in the quiver Google and all the big tech giants have kind of stayed away from this debate  Not knowing exactly how they feel but Google did file a brief last week  Saying the one thing we like about title two is would give us access to the polls  So that would be good for Google fiber. I almost feel like that was like  Like there was something there's some sub subtext to that. I'm not sure what it is  Well, if you did do title two then we could put Google fiber everywhere now the NCTA the National Cable television  Vision National Cable and Telecommunications Association says oh no Google can already get on the polls. Don't believe them

Start time: 6735.09
End time: 6753.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's totally not true  We know that because we have a friend at Sonic net and he'll tell us it cost  $5,000 a house a house that he passes in San Francisco to get his fiber up because they they will file every  single procedural motion to make your cost go up

That's literally what the court said  Judge Marsha burrs on writing for the majority said the business owners may deem the  Where is it? What is this? No, it's the Ninth Circuit. It's your it's here  My god business owner may deem the posting or order of user reviews as a threat of economic harm  But it is not unlawful for Yelp to post and sequence the reviews as Yelp has the right to charge for legitimate advertising  Services the threat of economic harm that Yelp leveraged is at most hard bargaining  Yeah, like when Tony Soprano comes over with a baseball he's just hard bargaining  I just want to hit your knees. Don't mind me in any event. I love the response of  Botto bistro just up to the road a piece  They're in Richmond, California  They are offering 50% off a pizza if you give them a one-star review on Yelp  They were so pissed off about this. They said alright, we're gonna completely pollute the reviews  good for them a  According to Botto bistro Yelp has removed over  2,000 one-star reviews  Let's say you can't do that those are fake  It actually it actually looks like a good place.
