Transcript:  It's time for Twitter This Week in Tech.  What a great panel we have.  Christina Warren joins us from Microsoft.  Brian McCullough, his first time on the show.  Give him a great big welcome.  He's from TechMeme's new Ride Home podcast and of course the Internet History podcast.  Plus Patrick BÃ©ja, our favorite Frenchman.  We're going to talk so much to talk about Google Duplex.  Was it unethical?  The advancing GDPR starts Friday.  The impact of ad tech, China's renewables and Ireland's taxes and the Seattle business.  I can go on and on, but I think what you should probably do is just sit back and relax and  enjoy Twitter.  It's next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They set it in cold type, one letter at a time, inch by inch.  So we got a little, we have a few things to talk about.  I want to ask you, Christina, I haven't seen you since Build.  Was Build fun for you?  Did you have a good time?

Start time: 305.14
End time: 339.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did.  I had a great time.  I was extremely busy because I was executive producing the Build livestream.  So we had content that was airing in between the sessions we were broadcasting live and  ahead of the keynotes and then, you know, end of the day wrap ups.  And then we were also recording things on that stage when we were not live on the air.  And so I was hosting stuff, but I was also coordinating all the content and guests and  stuff.  So I was very busy, but I had a great time and it was a good show.  And it was, it was really interesting to be at Build, not as a reporter, but as a Microsoft  employee.  It was a little weird, but it was, it was cool.

Start time: 339.82
End time: 346.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was a very different way to see Build.  What was your takeaway?  What do you think was the most exciting stuff?

Start time: 348.20
End time: 380.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Obviously, I think a lot of the focus on AI and kind of the future potential around that,  especially some of the IoT edge stuff was really interesting.  I really liked that DJI demo from a consumer perspective.  I really want to see whatever the, you know, the phone, the Your Phone app on Windows 10  to see how well that will be able to integrate to kind of mirror things from your phone  onto your computer.  I think that's very cool.  And we had, we had many horses, Leo.  Like that was...

Start time: 380.88
End time: 383.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There were many, a lot of wood behind those arrows.

Start time: 383.94
End time: 401.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, there were many horses.  Like we had like little like bunnies and puppies.  Actual horses?  Actual horses.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I misunderstood.  There were actual equine animals.  Yes.  There were therapy animals and they were amazing.  Are you teasing me?  No, I'm not.  I swear to God.

Start time: 402.72
End time: 404.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would there...  Okay.

Start time: 404.72
End time: 411.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Therapy animals because it was amazing and people very much enjoyed them.  And that was, I know it wasn't like a tech announcement or whatever, but I was very excited.

Start time: 411.92
End time: 413.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Full-size horses or ponies?

Start time: 414.24
End time: 416.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 420.40
End time: 429.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Really cute.  Can you bring them on a plane?  It's great.  No, it's from a local therapy animal place.  So wait a minute.

Start time: 429.96
End time: 437.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not only was the keynote so long, three hours and 45 minutes, that they had you do exercises  in the middle, but then they trot out mini ponies for you to feel better afterwards.

Start time: 438.13
End time: 444.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  But that's why they had to have it.  The keynote was so long by the end of it people needed the mini horses.

Start time: 445.16
End time: 460.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what's funny?  And I probably had something to do with how many things Microsoft announced at Build,  but they held, I thought, one of the most interesting announcements for after Build.  And I'm talking about the Surface Hub 2.  Yeah, the Surface Hub 2.  Yeah.  Now, are you using this in your conference room yet?  Because this is the sweetest thing.

Start time: 460.28
End time: 483.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I have not seen one in person yet, but I have used the first Surface Hub and  that's amazing.  And just this demo video, I have to say, like, and this is not a reflection of where I work  at all.  This is seriously cool.  Like, this is the sort of thing.  It wasn't until I worked in a big corporate environment where you see a lot of these things  that I actually understood the potential of this sort of stuff.  But it's very cool.

Start time: 483.74
End time: 546.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Microsoft bought a company called Pixel Perfect, which made giant displays.  They released the hub a year ago, right?  Their initial hub.  But this is the follow up Surface Hub 2.  They haven't announced pricing.  They say it'll be next year, I think that it'll be available.  But it's a giant Windows based display that has a couple of interesting features.  There's one right now on the video we're watching, which is it can rotate from landscape  to portrait mode and you can then do Skype calls with a full size human standing across  from you on this giant display.  That's wild.  And then, of course, you could put two side by side in landscape mode or even cooler if  you put them in the portrait mode.  I think you can have, was it eight?  You can have a bunch of them.  It's four.  There it is, four like that.  All communicating with one another.  Microsoft said they'll be less expensive than the existing Surface Hub, but I don't know  what that means.  The existing hub is like $8,000 for the 55 inch.

Start time: 549.41
End time: 566.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, now Christina though.  That's really impressive, but I wonder how does it actually work that well that you can  send data from your computer to the thing?  How integrated does your system at work have to be for that to actually work like that?  Because if it does, it's magic.  This is so cool.

Start time: 566.99
End time: 568.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at that.  That's the four.

Start time: 568.64
End time: 624.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's basically, I can't speak for whatever the new one is, but the existing one, which  has some of the similar features where you can just wirelessly transmit things, it uses  kind of like a custom version of Windows 10.  And so if you have a Windows 10 device and if you're on the same Active Directory thing,  and I'm not really sure how it all needs to be configured, then you can wirelessly send  files very easily and it actually does work really well.  And then if you don't have, if you're using like an iOS or an Android or Mac device, you  can either use, like it has Miracast built in.  So if you were like on Android or Chrome or like a non-surface, like Windows machine that  didn't have something, you could use Miracast to send stuff over.  But there are also, there's apps like AirCast or AirServer, sorry, that'll kind of add like  an AirPlay type of feature.  So you can still use that as a way to wirelessly send information.  It works really well.  Obviously, it works far better if everything you're using is Windows 10.

Start time: 625.48
End time: 632.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's easily doable because this is so expensive.  A company is going to buy this, they're going to buy it, and it's an integrated solution.  I mean, you're going to wire a whole conference room to use this.

Start time: 634.88
End time: 665.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  And then it works with your phone system.  So the really brilliant part, assuming your phone system works, and like let's be honest,  everybody's offices, that's always the part that's the big thing is you can walk in and  a button and start the Skype call that's already been programmed into the room and you can  touch the screen or start it from your computer and then fling it to the hub that's then recording  stuff but also projecting whoever is presenting information.

Start time: 666.52
End time: 816.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want, I'm hoping the price will be sub five, maybe sub $4,000 because I would, we, when  we first set up this, so right now we're doing the show there.  I'm in the studio, but the rest of you are all on Skype.  And what we do is we put you in TV screens around the round table.  So it's like you're there.  But I always wanted to have it be portrait mode or full size.  I could tell I would dig it if you guys were, you know, like right here at the table.  It would be, that was always the plan.  You know, we just couldn't, it was too hard to make it work, too expensive to make it  work.  But maybe this will, maybe this time next year, Christine will be right here just like  that.  That would be awesome.  So you do at these events, you see demos and, and as many people are quick to point out,  there's a big gulf between a demo and reality.  And now two weeks after Google I.O., we're hearing more and more people wondering about  the Google duplex that they demoed.  That's the very accurate voice assistant that called and made reservations for dinner, that  made haircut appointments.  And maybe we were a little too blindly accepting of that.  Google's now admitted, yeah, we edited it a little bit so you wouldn't hear the restaurant  location.  And that you could tell they didn't put last names in things like that.  John Gruber said, hey, let's figure out what restaurant they're in because they, they on  the, on the blog posts for duplex, they posted a picture.  They said we're eating the lunch that we booked with Google duplex.  And people responded on Twitter and found it.  And then Mashable, yes, Mashable called the restaurant following up on this and it was  called Hong's Gourmet in Mountain View, of course, near the Googleplex.  And here's, here's Jack Morse at Mashable writing, when I called a woman answered the  phone after explaining I was a reportable with Mashable and I was curious about Google  employees eating there after using an AI to make reservations.  She said, oh, well, let me put you on the phone with Victor.  Victor got on the phone.  I asked him if the AI had made a reservation.  He said, yeah.  I asked him, and this is important, if Google had let him know about the planned duplex  test in advance, he said, no, no, of course not.  When I asked him to confirm one more time that duplex had called Hong's Gourmet, he  appeared to get nervous.  They said he had to go and hung up.

Start time: 818.52
End time: 831.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Leo, I mean, obviously we're going to get into the idea of the consenting to talking  to a robot thing, but is the other half of this, are people starting to say that this  was all staged and maybe this technology doesn't work?  Okay.

Start time: 832.36
End time: 870.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the reasons they say that is because California is a strict two party state, as  you know, Brian, which means you cannot record a call unless both parties give consent, explicit  consent.  I'm recording, I would not even, I'm recording.  I know this because I work in radio in California.  You can't say, you can't have somebody on the phone be recording and say, I'm recording.  Is that okay?  You have to say before you record, I would like to record this.  Do I have your permission?  When they say yes, you press record.  Then you say, I got your permission to record this.  I would like you to say again, I have your permission, right?  Yes.  That's the only way you get to stay out of trouble.  None of that seemed to have happened with Google.

Start time: 872.40
End time: 887.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the other thing is, is because as people then did follow up right away and on the blog  post, Google admitted this, that it's already a very constrained system.  You can't, you couldn't talk to the computer right now and have it pass a Turing test or  whatever.  You wouldn't be fooled.

Start time: 887.60
End time: 892.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I was, and this is my fault because I thought it passed, I thought this is the  Turing test.

Start time: 893.12
End time: 900.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But only for ordering or checking hours or making a reservation.  Still.  A very constrained use case.  Right.

Start time: 901.92
End time: 914.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the human wasn't asked to distinguish between a human, a computer, and a human.  And had they been asked, maybe they would have been able to tell that voice.  Well, that was a little odd, so maybe it wasn't a human.  But it was pretty impressive.  Right.

Start time: 915.69
End time: 916.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was a great demo.  Sorry, go ahead.

Start time: 919.42
End time: 935.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is my question.  Are people now starting to suggest that, oh, this technology, it's kind of vaporware-ish  where like, oh yeah, that'd be great if it works, but it's still five years away and  they tricked us off.  Well, we don't know.

Start time: 937.00
End time: 974.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it comes down to whether or not you trust Google with these kinds of things.  And I can imagine that it's not completely ready yet for prime time.  But if Google is making that kind of demo, I can't imagine that it wouldn't be close  enough that in a few months or maybe a couple of years, it will work reliably well.  It will not be as perfect as this.  But I would be very surprised if it's completely doctored and fabricated.  And this is what some people are kind of implying, like, oh, it was edited.  So it holds no value, basically.  They lied to us.  I think that's a bit over the top.

Start time: 975.82
End time: 1077.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with that.  Although I do have to say, I definitely think that the most people who watched it when I  first saw it, and I think it's a very impressive demo, and I think we should acknowledge the  fact that nearly two weeks later, the fact that we're still talking about this, regardless  of it's because people have questions about it or not, is goes to the strength of the  demo.  We are still talking about this.  But for me, when I saw it as impressive as it was, my spidey sense was kind of like,  OK, well, this is not ready the way that they are showing this.  This was a very specific scenario.  This is a best case scenario demo, as most demonstrations are.  And this has probably been edited even more so.  That said, I think that because there is so much ambiguity around, you know, how do they  call, what were the parameters, what types of information is required on the other end,  what signals does it pick up on, what are some of the broader privacy implications,  what are some of the broader ethical implications, people are starting to ask those other questions.  But I kind of feel like they're two different things.  And while I'm perfectly happy to have people kind of talk about, like, how real of a demo  is this? Sometimes I feel like some of the criticism about this, which is getting into  the two party consent laws and all that stuff, is kind of going into a rabbit hole, which  shouldn't really be the focus.  I feel like if we should be focusing on the ethical implications of this, we should be  talking about the broader AI implications of talking to AIs and things calling and how  should they be identifying themselves and not trying to nitpick a doctor demo and say,  well, did they, you know, did they announce they were making the recording and did the  restaurant know? Because I don't feel like Google would have put recordings on the Internet  if they didn't have them cleared in some way. I don't know. Maybe they would.  But I feel like Google's lawyers wouldn't do that.

Start time: 1077.06
End time: 1138.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They need to step forward and say that because I would disagree with you to this extent.  If they play fast and loose with this now, that is a problem down the road because companies  that are creating AIs are going to, I think, have a very high ethical bar that they have  to cross. And so if there's questions at this early stage, that's a little troubling.  It's mostly TechCrunch, by the way, and we should say this is TechCrunch has decided to make this  be their, you know, they're going to really go after Google on this one. But there are others.  Here's Zeynep Tufekci, who I really love. I think she's brilliant. She tweeted,  Google assistant making calls pretending to be human, not only without disclosing that it's a  bot, but adding um and ah to deceive the human on the other end with the room cheering it.  Horrifying. Silicon Valley is ethically lost. Rudderless has not learned a thing. No?  You disagree?

Start time: 1138.28
End time: 1203.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, completely. I mean, I understand, you know, there's such a thing as hyperbole,  and I think this is a fine example of it. I understand why there would be concern  about the way they went about doing it. But the phrasing she uses and the phrasing that some  others have been using, I think is uncalled for. And that is the problem with the internet, right?  Everything, every little issue becomes a world and a problem.  Yes, yes.  Yeah. And I completely understand that we should ask the question and go to Google and say,  hey, wait a second now. So this is what you did. Did you start thinking about the  ethical implications of this? Should we know when a bot is calling? And in this case,  the point is that we shouldn't know so that it can use systems that haven't been prepared for  automated booking. But going that far, I think is, I'm not going to say disingenuous. I don't  know who she is, but it's at the very least, it seems like hyperbole that I'm wary of these days.

Start time: 1219.14
End time: 1274.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's fair. I mean, look, I think that there are very serious ethical questions.  I think there are huge ethical questions around this. My bigger question, honestly, though,  other than this specific demo, and this is where I kind of get hung up on this, I feel like there  are very big 10,000 foot questions we should be asking about this whole project. I just don't know  if it behooves us to focus on the intricacies of the demos they showed off. I bet we should be  asking questions to the program. When we talk about two-party consent, I don't really care if they  asked on these calls for two-party consent if Hong's restaurant gave permission to be recorded  or not. That doesn't really- That's going down a rabbit hole. What concerns me more is,  are they going to be capturing these calls? Because presumably they are,  because they're going to be using it for their machine learning models. And in that case, how is  it going to be identified and how is that going to work with the law? And how are people going  to be notified that they're talking to machines? That, to me, is a much bigger question.

Transcript:  Back to Leo's point, though, I think the fact, what he said right at the beginning,  that this is so early in this sort of AI stuff that we're going to have to encounter over and  over again. There was a great, I don't remember if it was a Twitter thread or a blog post or  whatever, but it was some computer scientists that made the point that every other discipline has had  its moment of being chastened by their technology being more than they thought it would be.  So the reason we have a Nobel Prize is because chemists thought that they were discovering-  Yeah, for Nobel invented dynamite.  The building blocks of the universe. And then obviously physicists thought they were unlocking  the secrets of the atom and the Big Bang and then they created nuclear weapons. And so his point was  computer scientists and computer science as a discipline hasn't had that moment yet.  And he was like, I would hope that as computer scientists, we would get ahead of that. It  wouldn't take, oh, we've created a nuclear bomb to-  Right. Now let's figure out. Now let's solve the problem.  Right. If you're a biologist, I think to Leo's point and to Zainab's point is that  computer science tends to, oh, this is a cool thing. Let's just do it. Whereas if you're a  biologist, you don't just create a new virus just because you can. You think about it and you put

Transcript:  ethics. I was going to say, I mean, and I'm trying not to come across like a shill here, but one of  the things that I think about a lot and the people that I work with think about a ton of people who  are actively involved in the AI stuff. And I'm certainly not. I just kind of talk to developers  about things around it, our ethics. And I think that it's something that every major company who's  involved with AI, including Google, is very involved with. Now, how much of an emphasis you  put on that in your consumer-facing demos is a different question. But I am heartened and at  least I'm hopeful. I mean, maybe I'm a little worried as well, but I am hopeful that the experts  who are working on this have to be aware of these things, because if they're not, governments who  don't understand the tech are going to start putting limitations on what can be done. And that  has, in my opinion, the potential to be even more damaging. So there are companies who are actively  thinking about ethical concerns with this stuff. And I think that it's a conversation that  everyone needs to have and that all of the scientists doing this really serious, the  engineers doing this really serious work need to be thinking about, because you're right,  we don't want to be in a situation where we've created a nuclear weapon before we know it without

But this is timely because tonight on 60 Minutes,  there's going to be a piece that already has hurt Google's stock price. The price went down on  Friday called The Power of Google, that's, I think, going to be a little bit critical of  Google's power. There's GDPR, which is becoming law on Friday. We're going to talk about that.  This is what Scott Galloway was talking about in the four. There is a reckoning coming to  Silicon Valley. It hit Facebook, maybe it's Google's turn, where people are saying to them,  we expect you not just to do it because it's cool. I think one of the things, Patrick,  your response, I think, was my response too, which is, oh, this is cool, this is great.  Let's not shoot the baby before it's born. But I think some of that comes from,  tell me if I'm right or wrong, Patrick, the fact that we think it's cool and I can't wait.  I'm excited about AI. But that's the problem is that engineers might not think about the

Transcript:  consequences because we're just so excited. I think we are currently in a context where  we are overly sensitive to ethics in IT issues. Certainly there's a good reason for it and it is  needed. I do also think, however, that in this specific case, the concern is putting a little  bit of the cart before the horse. This is a very specific use case and it couldn't have been done.  You don't lay down ethics rules before you even know what the system is going to entail. This is  basically a test. You do the test and you see what happens and then you start, you might be  thinking about the ethical implications beforehand, but you don't come out with this demo and say,  I mean, okay, let's try this. Well, then shouldn't you come out with a demo if you  don't have those things there? Apparently, according to some articles here,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  both sides of this because for two days, all I was doing on my pod was talking about how great this  was and describing the demo and reading the blog post. Me too. And that's why I feel guilty, Brian.  And then I start hearing these other things and it makes a lot of sense to me. And your  response where you said, well, let's just do it because it's cool. Let's not cut it off before  we find out what it is. But I think what Zeynep and people like her specifically are saying is that  you can't run things that way anymore. You can't just do a cool thing and release it. You should  at least give some thought to the implications. And the fact that it seems like Google thought  this was just cool and it worked. It worked on me. It worked on Leo. But then didn't do any  further thinking beyond that. I think that that's what, when we talk about these ethics and things  like that, that's what all people are asking for is do the next step thought, maybe one or two steps

Start time: 1773.60
End time: 1825.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  down the line. So just to clarify, I'm not saying there aren't ethics implications. That's not what  I'm saying, but it's about the hyperbole. I think what people are asking for is for the Google  Assistant to disclose the fact that it's the Google Assistant at the beginning of the call.  That's my impression of what most people were asking for. And that doesn't appear to me like  it's a huge deal. Like if the bot is calling you and it's saying, hi, this is the Google Assistant  and I'm calling on behalf of my client, blah, blah, blah, and then you're fine with it, then it wasn't  a huge deal to begin with. It wasn't the world ending scandal that many people are making it into.  Right? If you don't want these things to exist, it's a different deal. But if the disclosure in  the beginning of the sentence is enough to put your mind at ease, then it's not worth flipping  the whole table over, I think. It's worth talking about. Fair enough. And by doing it, of course,

Start time: 1825.96

It's, hey, it was impressive. And like you, Brian, I feel a little guilty at being so impressed.  I'm still impressed. Don't get me wrong. I'm very impressed. I feel like, hey,  we just saw something that you're going to look back and say, I saw the world change on that day.

Start time: 1854.14
End time: 1876.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's that important. And it's going to happen as well.  Right. Well, there is a little bit of fear of something new that I think is not going to be as  fearful, afraid, scary, is the word I'm looking for. Once it's a little bit more commonplace.

Start time: 1877.82
End time: 1955.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, though, that there are valid reasons. Because as you said, this is going to happen  regardless. We don't know when. I think that there are valid reasons to question how far along this  really is. I'm a little bothered, maybe with the rollout and the way this was kind of productized,  if these issues haven't been worked out or if Google is not willing to share their thoughts on  them. I think that's a little problematic if you're going to sell this as a productized thing.  And yet you don't have some of these very, I think, reasonable questions to have answered.  But this is going to be a reality. And then eventually it's going to become more mainstreamed.  You look at deep fakes and how real and how easy those tools are to use. You have to start thinking  about, well, what about if this sort of thing starts being used in other contexts and people  just put it up on GitHub or wherever and start sharing models and using these in more nefarious  ways? And that's, I think, like I'm not trying to be hyperbolic. And I understand your point in not  saying this is the end of the world. But I think the reason people become concerned about this is  because we do know how fast this is moving. We do know that this is an eventuality. And if we don't  start at least having the conversations now and putting basic practices into place, then it will  be much easier for a deep fake type of situation to come up where people can have really not great  scenarios where you feel like someone's calling you to do phishing scams or to get personal  information from you that you're not aware of. I think that's also like a thing.

But it's the reality. It's like deep fakes. And the fact that we got used to the idea that Photoshop  exists and any image could not be real. It's more pervasive than that, though,

Transcript:  that you could go through your day. I guess we already do that to some degree with email and  stuff, but that you could go through your day, talk to people, interact with people  that aren't people. And you may not know. There's something a little disconcerting  about that, but maybe that's just something we'll all get used to.

Start time: 2017.04
End time: 2077.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick, you could say that, right. But the point is that you could think through those things now.  So if Leo's right that he doesn't want to live in that sort of a world, if you're Google and  you're the closest to this technology, you could think one or two steps ahead and start to think  of ways that would maybe ease Leo's mind a bit. Right. So it's the not thinking about it. Like  one of the reasons that this got picked up is because every single talk radio show in the  country talked about the next day. Everybody played it. I played it. Everybody. The next color.  Will the next color be real? How will we know? So if you think even for a second,  well, you would know that it would be the thing that would be picked up on. So again, in not even  just the ethical sense, but clearly they didn't think it through in the PR sense. And so all we're  asking for is maybe think a little bit and then maybe put in place some safeguards.  And do what? And do what? Tell me what they should have done.  Safeguards that would ease the minds of people like Leo.

What's a fact and what's not a  fact. It would be disorienting if you're interacting in the world. Our biology is that we're interacting  with other humans, but we can't tell it would be highly disorienting. Christina, do you think so?

Start time: 2134.60
End time: 2201.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it would be disorienting. I'm not opposed to the idea of interacting with AIs, especially if  they can respond appropriately. The fear that I have, frankly, in some of this stuff, and we've  already seen this with the first generation of assistants, is a lot of times they don't work the  way that the demos show that they will. Instead, you have to have very specific inputs and outputs  to get specific outputs. If these things can trick people to hand over a credit card number  or a social security number, that's really scary. But then if I'm actually just trying to have  something book an appointment for me and the person on the other end has to say a certain set  of keywords for it to trigger, then it's not even accomplishing anything. My fear in some cases is  that it might not work that well and then might work well enough to trick people. But for me,  and maybe this is just unrealistic, I almost feel like if I knew I'm talking to an AI,  I would feel better about it. It's not like I would necessarily have a problem interacting with  it. I would just know what to expect and maybe know how to augment my responses better if I don't get  the expected response back. I don't know.

I'm talking and we're having a conversation and it's like a real person.  I think that sounds really cool. But now as we get closer, I'm starting to think maybe it's not that  cool.

They had the moment after they realized  what the wrong use was. I think to an extent with the fake news issues and with the very targeted  campaigning that we've seen on social networks, now we understand how these things can be used  badly. I'm not sure. We look at this AI technology and conversational AI and we're thinking, oh,  it could be used for phishing scams and stuff like that. But we're just applying  the issues that we already know of in another context. It's going to be all new stuff.  It's going to be completely different. It's hard to regulate this yet. Either that or I'm really  just trying to look really good to our AI overloads when they finally get over. They can look at this.

But overall, I think we would agree that the research on the atom was more beneficial than  it was detrimental. Once the bad thing happened and we knew what it was, we took the steps to,  until now at least, maybe it's going to change in the next few years, but until now,  we've managed it barely, but we've managed it.

Start time: 2423.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You said earlier, it's inevitable. And you're right. The idea of the technology  fission to split the atom, once people figured out it was possible, it was inevitable that it  would be done at some point. So I agree with you in the sense that there was probably no way to  put a law in place that say we will never create fission technology. But at the same time, that  happened at an accident at a moment in history when we were at war. So immediately the government  took control of atomic energy and things like that where it remains today locked down within  government control and things like that. Which is probably a good thing.  Right. So just things like that. Again, if we have another thing like that, will we have the same  ability because we won't be at war or we might not want the government to do it or whatever.  But not everybody can create a reactor and a shoebox in their bedroom for various reasons,  but also because all the governments in the world immediately found ways to control it and make it

But it's extremely complex and I don't know what the  right answer is. And there's a lot of reasons why we had to do it first. If the Germans had done it  first, that might not have been a very good thing. You can make the argument that the war would have  gone on a lot longer had they not used it. And at the same time, I saw a child's bicycle fried  by an atomic bomb. I mean, it's very difficult. It's very difficult. And this is the problem.  And I think this is exactly what Nadella was talking about. As creators of technology,  it's really important that we constantly be aware of what we're creating. And this is,  I think, I'll end it with this, that the reason this comes up is because we have seen with social  media a technology gone wild that we really didn't anticipate the consequences of. And maybe would  have worked better had we thought it out a little bit more clearly ahead of time. I don't know.

I want to talk  since you're here, Patrick. Patrick's in Finland, but obviously he's French. And I would love to  talk to a European about GDPR and its impact because Friday it all happens. Our show today,  though, brought to you by ZipRecruiter. If you're hiring ZipRecruiter, it has completely changed  the most important job in any company. If you were, let's say you're America's Cup skipper and  you're trying to hire a crew, that crew is going to make or break you, right? You can have the  technology, you can have the boat, you can have it all, but you want to get the best people.  Any company, it's like that. You're creating an entity where everybody, if everybody works  in the same direction and works well, you're going to go to the moon. But it's easy enough  to get somebody who's just going to bring you down. When you've got an opening, it's important  to remember you're actually creating something really important. And it's nice to have tools to  make that possible. ZipRecruiter takes technology to hiring to really improve the process. So in a  couple of ways. First of all, it helps you reach that perfect person. Let's assume that a great  employee is out there, but where are they? With ZipRecruiter, you post to 100 sites with one click.  So you're reaching the maximum number of people. But it does even more because they already have  tens of millions of resumes, current resumes on file. So ZipRecruiter builds a platform that goes  through them and finds the right candidates for you, identifies people with the right experience,  and invites them to apply to your job. They become your ally in finding the perfect person.  It's really revolutionized how people find their next hire. 80% of employees who post a job on  ZipRecruiter get a quality candidate through the site in one day. And you know, when you're down,  a man or woman, filling that job becomes pretty important. ZipRecruiter, by the way, doesn't stop  there because whenever you use ZipRecruiter, all of the applicants, they don't come to your phone or  your inbox. They all flow into the ZipRecruiter interface. In that interface, they spotlight the  strongest applicants. So you're never going to miss a great match. Look, the right candidate is  out there for that job. ZipRecruiter is how you find that person. Businesses of all sizes,  including Twit, use ZipRecruiter for their hiring needs. Right now you can try ZipRecruiter free.  Right now free, if you go to ziprecruiter.com slash twit, ziprecruiter.com slash twit, the smartest  way to hire. ZipRecruiter.com slash twit. We thank them for their support of the Twit podcast.  So I read a great article which made me feel a lot better about GDPR. I have such mixed feelings  about GDPR. On the one hand, this general data protection regulation that the EU put into law  two years ago, but now is actually going to go into effect on Friday, does things that everybody  would agree are good. For instance, requires companies that have a data breach to disclose  within 72 hours. I mean, really fast. And also, put some real teeth into those laws. These  regulations have existed, but there was no enforcement in the past. Now there will be.  In fact, this is a really good example of what happens if you make a law or you make a regulation.  There was a privacy. What was the name of the privacy regulation, Patrick? It's been in effect

Start time: 2806.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right to be forgotten. No, not that. But there's a general privacy regulation that effectively  was GDPR, but had no teeth and has been in place for a while. I'll look it up. In any event, the EU  decided, well, we've got to have some, if this is going to work, we've got to have a significant  penalty. And the penalty is fairly significant. As much as 20 million euros or 4% of your global  revenue, whichever is higher, that's enough even to scare a big company like Google or Facebook.  Clearly, it's intended for them. But, so some things I think I'm in favor of. Then there are  other things that I think a lot of people are very worried about, that compliance will be  difficult. I read a good article. This is Jacques Matei, I think you pronounce it. He wrote a piece  on his blog called GDPR Hysteria, which calmed me down a lot. He said, you know-

Start time: 2874.62
End time: 2904.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it. Which was kind of a first attempt, but didn't do anything because it had no teeth.  So, he's pointing out, look, this isn't going to happen overnight. If you're out of compliance,  you're going to get a warning. That's the maximum fine. There may not be a fine at all if you fix it.  I am in favor of privacy. But I think also here in the States, a lot of people say,  how dare the EU tell us how to run our business?

Transcript:  Well, they're not. They're telling you that that's what you have to do if you have customers in the  EU. They could perfectly make two different sets of rules and settings, one for the EU customers  and one for the US customers. Now, of course, it would get interesting reactions from the US  customers and the press, I'm guessing, because the EU customers would have settings and rights to  delete their data, portability of their data, downloading what you have used on their network,  and magically the US customers wouldn't. Actually, for a while, we thought Facebook

Start time: 2943.34
End time: 2955.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  might do that. They might implement it just for EU customers. They said then later,  no, we're going to implement it for everybody. In fact, it's great. You can download your Facebook  data now. You can delete your Facebook data now if you want. That's a good thing.

Transcript:  Yeah. It's the power of government. Yes, government is sometimes overbearing and cumbersome,  but sometimes you need it because it's the only entity that can have some kind of influence on  other more very potent entities like some huge companies. Europeans have always been more  concerned with all of these issues than the Americans for a couple of reasons. Historically,  we have more genuine concern about all of this and the way our data is used. Of course, those big  companies are usually not in the EU, so we have an easier time looking at them and saying, oh, these

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  successful American companies again. Yeah, but no one is saying that what is  being required of those companies is completely unreasonable, especially for the big ones.  It's things that really they should have implemented themselves a long time ago. I went  off on a tiny, tiny rant on Twitter because after the 25th email I received from one of those  saying, at company X, we value your privacy and this is why we're doing this. If you valued our  privacy, you wouldn't have waited until the law obliged you to do these things and put them into  place. I would have preferred that some of them would say, hey, so the GDPR is coming into law  and it requires this and this or so we're making these modifications. You didn't have to put that  hypocritical PR spin to it saying, well, of course they did have to do it because that's how they  work. But it's a little bit frustrating, but it's, you know, I understand the concerns and again,  I think it's good to ask and discuss them. But overall I have a hard time justifying  a full criticism of this GDPR  ensemble of requirements. It seems like things that should have been put into place maybe  earlier. And I have to admit that myself, I might have been a little bit skeptical about all of it  until a couple of years ago, but I think now it's clear to everyone in Europe that it's needed and

Start time: 3102.20
End time: 3141.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm guessing in the US most people agree. I agree that it's needed and I think that you make,  I basically agree with everything you said. I do have some questions still about how this is  actually going to be enforced. I think if you're a larger company at Facebook or Google,  a Microsoft and Apple, a Samsung and Amazon, you obviously are going to be in compliance because  you're going to be watched very carefully. But if you are a Chinese based company or if you are  Eastern European based country who's not part of the EU or if you are just smaller and don't care,  I am curious about how these things are actually going to be enforced.

Start time: 3141.52
End time: 3175.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think actually that's why Leo mentioned this piece specifically because I read this earlier  in the week also Leo and the point that he's making is that he's specifically saying,  are you just a person that has a blog? Are you going to be on the hook for  $20 million or whatever it finds? And he's saying, no, that's not the way that the EU works.  Things like the DPD, the European Data Protection Directive, he said  that's been in effect for two decades.  Two decades?  Have you never, but you've never even heard of it because the point is not that they wanted to  suddenly fine everyone. They wanted to have the laws in the place.

Start time: 3176.12
End time: 3219.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Right. And I understand that what I'm saying is I'm not necessarily talking about  like your website or a small company who I'm talking about potentially big conglomerates,  big industries, big players who are based in countries that just aren't going to care.  How are they going to enforce this against someone like Tencent, for instance, or someone else?  You know, if someone's really going to come back, that becomes the interesting question.  Are you going to start blocking access to their traffic? How much teeth is this really going to  have? And I guess we will have to see on that because what we've seen before with Right to  Be Forgotten and other sanctions that have gone against Google and other companies,  those companies tend to fight back even when it is the law. So I don't know.

Start time: 3219.32
End time: 3233.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but the Right to Be Forgotten has been implemented. Initially, I thought it was a  horrible idea, but it has been implemented by Google and it seems to work relatively well.  Of course, there are always issues in every sense.

Start time: 3234.04
End time: 3255.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I still think that one's a horrible law because instead of saying pull down the original  content, they're putting the burden on the search engine to pull down the search results.  They're also putting Google in the position of judge and jury. Google has to go through each of  these requests and judge whether it has merit or not. That's not something Google should be doing.

Start time: 3255.98
End time: 3302.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but Leo, this is the practical approach to problems. Sometimes the solution is not perfect,  but it's better than doing nothing. This is what we're asking of YouTube, of Facebook, of Twitter.  We're telling them take away the objectionable content within 24 hours. This is horrible. It  shouldn't be on the internet. My initial concern was we're asking private enterprises to be the  judge of what is acceptable or not acceptable to say. I agree this is a valid concern. However,  on the other side of it, and I'm sure some people would have more to say about it than me,  but you see some horrible things on Twitter. Sometimes you are very frustrated that it's  still there and that the accounts aren't blocked.

Start time: 3302.90
End time: 3316.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is the right thing to do to go to Google and say hide that Twitter search result or to go to  Twitter and say pull the tweet down? That's the problem I have with Right to Be Forgotten. It  makes Google responsible for this, not the site that hosts the bad content.

Start time: 3317.16
End time: 3343.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think in the case of Twitter, obviously you would go to Twitter, but there are many other instances.  The Right to Be Forgotten is about Google.  Yes, absolutely. It's not about the link to Twitter. If it's a link to Twitter,  you're going to go see Twitter. In practice, Google is our doorway to the internet,  especially in Europe. Remember, they have 80% to 90% market share in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Andy in Germany is in the chat room and he says you still have to delete the content from the  original sites by yourself. You go to those sites, but the reason Google is in the equation is because  they cash all this stuff, so you have to get them to kill the cash as well, I guess. I don't know.

Transcript:  Absolutely. Leo, I completely agree, but I will answer to you what I basically would like to  formulate to Christina about the concerns that he was voicing, which is you're always going to have  issues in any system, in any rule, in any law. You can point out instances where it doesn't work  or where it breaks something, but having a few exceptions where it doesn't work out well  doesn't mean that you shouldn't do something about the problem.

Start time: 3417.60
End time: 3470.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Without a doubt, I agree. To be clear, although I actually have a lot of issues, especially from a  first-minute perspective with the right to be forgotten, I have serious, serious issues about  that. I don't have a problem with GDPR. I think that these are things that I would view.  They're very different.  Absolutely. I think these are things that, frankly, most of these big companies should  have been doing already and that they were actively avoiding. I think that the fact that  we've had two years and there was all this pushback is proof. Facebook being publicly forced through  the terrible press it was getting to not have two option screens, but one is kind of proof of that.  I agree with you. I'm just saying, not to say not to do it, obviously you still do it,  but I do have questions that other than some of the biggest American-run conglomerates,  that you might still have some very big services that will just not respond to this.  I think that that's just something that people should reconcile.

Start time: 3472.32
End time: 3510.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure. The thing is, if one of those big companies, let's say a Chinese company for the sake of  argument, if they do business in Europe, if they are big enough or serious enough, at this point,  they still do have to have some kind of presence in the country. Usually you need to have a company  that is created in Europe to do business with European customers. You might have employees,  you have someone who's responsible. So if they're big enough, the likeliness is that if there's a  big problem, there is someone you can point to go after a company you can find, stuff like that.  Yes, there might be a few instances where this doesn't happen, but it's...

End time: 3534.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, if you have a French... This is the reason why...  What are they going to do though? Close your office? What are they going to do?  Yes, absolutely. If you don't pay the fine, then you're liable to criminal... I'm guessing. I'm not

End time: 3581.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In theory, yes, Leo. Yeah, I know. I'm too small. They're not going to, obviously.  Yeah, exactly. But yeah, I mean, I guess Google's going to pay or at least they've appealed it,  but Google's being fined, what was it, 1.7 billion or something. They'll eventually pay that.

Start time: 3581.90
End time: 3622.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, or they'll get it knocked down. Well, because this is my question. This is what I'm  saying. Speaking of Google specifically, they've been fined multiple times by the EU. To my  knowledge, they paid much smaller fines than what's been issued to them before.  2.7 billion is the current one. That's... Yeah, but there was a Google shopping thing that I  think this might be a separate one. That's the shopping one. Okay, there was another one too  that they've put off. I mean, they've been putting this off for years. So part of me does kind of  wonder like, when are they actually going? I mean, I'm not opposed to this law at all. As I said,  I agree with it. Part of me though, does wonder like how much of this is bluster and how much of  this is just going to carry on in the courts ad nauseam. Listen, how many emails have you gotten

Start time: 3622.44
End time: 3625.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of big companies implementing this law? Right. They're taking it seriously. As they should,

Start time: 3625.94
End time: 3695.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because it's the right thing to do. Well, I agree. When I first joined Microsoft,  I joined Microsoft a year ago. They were already deep in the GDPR rollout plan. It was already  deeply underway. And I'm sure that that's the same way that it's been at every other major company.  This is not something that two months ago people were like, oh, we've got to get on this. This has  been probably in the works for two years at most of these places. I agree. I'm just saying,  if people find that there isn't enough being done or Google or another company were to do something  that people claimed violated this, I have no doubt in my mind that there would be an appeal  as you know, for Bernie is sort of fine. And actually, I mean, I think this is a good thing.  I'm just pointing out. I think that sometimes we say, oh, it's fixed now. And that's not necessarily  going to be the case because companies will look for ways to still capture what they can.  I do have a question because I'm not clear on this. If you ask users to opt into your  agreement that says I will willingly give you this information, can you bypass some of those  restrictions if you are able to get them to agree to a different user agreement that says

Start time: 3696.12
End time: 3706.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's fine, you can capture my information? Well, I think that's the point. I think you have to  explicitly have them agree to giving you this information instead of implicitly doing that.

Start time: 3707.60
End time: 3712.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And right to delete it. They can come to you and say, I delete my information.

Start time: 3712.90
End time: 3795.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that is the other point I wanted to make. We can argue about whether or not they would  comply or not. The fact is they are complying. You now have the ability to delete all of your  information from all of these networks. Of course, most people are choosing not to do that and are  probably going to keep choosing not to do that. But if you want to talk about how much teeth  that law has and how much weight the EU, you know, ultimately, it's all about money.  All of these companies are making a lot of money in the EU and they're willing to invest a little  bit of money in modifying their systems. First of all, because it's ultimately the right thing  to do. I think a lot of them are saying now, well, maybe we should be a little bit regulated  if it's the right way. And second of all, it's a small investment compared to the money they're  making in the territory. And yes, they could close down their offices in the EU and have everyone go  through amazon.com or whatever, you know, US site it is. But in practice, that's just not the way  it works. If you want to do business, even in the age of the internet, you need to have a presence  in the country or at least in the EU. So it's it's currently working. Now, of course, if they end up  having a fine of 20 million euros or however much it might be 4%, they will fight it, it will take  years. But that's not even the point. The point is the deterring effect is working because they're

Start time: 3796.62
End time: 3862.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  already doing it. So Doc Searls, who I love and has been on the show, wrote an article, I thought  was very interesting. He says one of the side effects of GDPR is it's going to pop the ad tech  bubble. Remember that there are a lot of companies, Facebook and Google, certainly, that make money by  basically collecting information about you and selling it to advertisers. He says, the main  problem is tracking people without their knowledge approval or a court order is just flat out wrong  the fact that it can be done is no excuse, nor is the monstrous sum of money made by it.  He says without ad tech, that's those, you know, that's basically what this is, is ad tech, the  technology's ability to track you and then sell ads against you. The EU's GDPR would never have  happened, but the GDR did happen. And as a result, websites all over the world, suddenly posting  notices about their changed privacy policies, use of cookies and opt-in choices and email lists are  doing it. And he says, that's a good thing. Well, Leo, you know, this has already happened with

Start time: 3862.72

No, see, that's the point is that  so the, whoever bought clout and whoever owns clout now said that it just wasn't a, it wasn't  a strategic fit anymore, but everyone's, you know, doing the math and being like, oh, it's funny that  that's happening on the day that this new law is coming into effect. Well, but the other, the other

What I'm saying though is this  is what's kind of interesting is the only thing I would push back on Doc Sears a little bit,  because I do agree that I think this will definitely impact, especially ad tech firms  that have like a European targeting base. But I would not be surprised if some of them or plenty  of them are like, okay, well, we're just not going to target these markets because we don't have to,  and we can still capture a lot of information from, you know, Asian and, and, uh, U S and, and, and,

What he doesn't  like is ad tech. And he has all the reasons why ad tech should go away. It's built to undermine  the brand value of all the media it uses. This is interesting. In other words, it's, it undermines  the content because it cares more about eyeballs than the content itself. And it causes negative  associations with brands. He says, not one brand known to the world has been made by ad tech.  Ad tech wants to be personal. That's why it's tracking based ad tech spies on people and violates  their privacy is full of fraud. It's a vector for malware. It incentivizes publications to  prioritize content generation over journalism, link bait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that stuff, which yeah, but Christina, sorry, sorry. I got to do the history thing. Good  Internet historian. Yeah. Ad sense and AdWords were 2001 2002. So they don't buy double click  till 2006, I think. So actually in in a way, they don't get the sort of ad tech that Leo is talking  about until they've already IPO and until they're already this huge company. Okay. And that was sort  of that was sort of the thing that one of the reasons a couple years after the IPO that then  the stock starts to rise again is because Wall Street was waiting for them. If you think about  it as as as genius as the auction model of AdWords is, it's not very technical on the side of buying  ads and placing ads because you're just picking keywords and things like that. So Wall Street  wanted them desperately to do this personalized targeting and things like that. And it's the  acquisition of AdWords or not AdWords of a double click that that brought that into their stable.

You know, the the cookies, not agreement, but you know, you have to be informed that didn't do  it. People just I just go, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I think it's it's it's the the saddest thing that  these companies didn't do it before because I don't think it's going to change much. Most people,  even, you know, myself, I looked at it and I figured, you know, they're going to be displaying  ads anyway. Do I want them to be relevant to me or do I want them to be irrelevant to me?

Start time: 4171.84
End time: 4224.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's one thing I live in public. So one point that Leo just made from reading off the  Searle's thing is, you know, when we're talking, if people aren't familiar with this, the simplest  example is what are we talking about when you're talking about ad tech is you go, you you research  hotels in Macon, Georgia, and then the next thing you know for the next month, everywhere you go,  you're seeing ads for hotels in Macon, Georgia, or the thing you looked up on Amazon is suddenly  you're seeing it on Facebook. It's when when Searle says that it devalues the content, that's  what we mean, because what the advertiser cares about is they were able to track that you came  and did a search once or you came to their website once. And so they don't actually care,  as opposed to in the old days, where if I want to sell a car, then I would go to a website that has  car content and buy ads. They don't care about that. Wherever you go, they follow you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right about is a lot of especially the last decade, and I can even say this as someone  that's bought a lot of ads as an advertiser, is a lot of the bubble has been specifically that  it's called retargeting where we can follow you around. But it is that and then and then,  you know, Facebook came around at the right time when the ability to slice and dice like we were  talking about off air before before we went on air, it like that it has been what has caused the  explosion. So if there's a bubble, like, obviously, we all know that this is it's a  general, it's a it's a once in a generation thing, they're standing in the tidal wave of history of  all advertisements moving online, we know that. However, it got like steroids injected into it

Start time: 4296.00
End time: 4312.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

He says compared to advertising, ad tech is ugly.  Ad tech relies on misdirection. It's I mean, and I agree with him because we do ads, but we don't do  ads based on what information we collect about you. We do ads based on the content. We know,  you know, that our advertisers want to reach tech enthusiasts, and that works really well for them.  And everybody's happy, right? It's not a, you know, it's there's a big difference between surveilling  you and targeting you via the content. All right, I'm gonna take a break and do an ad. How about that?  How about good timing?

Oh, I basically when I left Blizzard a few years ago,  I wanted to talk about gaming in English and French and I launched those two gaming shows.  And yeah, and the Fillius Club, which I invite a few people from different countries, different  places in the world. And we talk about what's been happening in the world with different  angles and interpretations from different cultures. We did a few months, a couple of  months ago, an episode about gun control that was specifically interesting with American  guests. And it was really hard because we did it from the point of view of gun owners and gun  friendly people. And as we always do, we try to do it within a friendly, friendly and and not  really. I don't know how to describe this. A civilized debate. And I think we were all surprised  at how rational it all ended being. But anyway, so the Fillius Club is one of the interesting ones  about difficult topics, but trying to have a rational conversation about them. What game are  you playing these days?

I think the biggest appeal of Fortnite for a lot of people, and I'm definitely  counting myself in this is the spectator aspect, whether it's in game or if it's on Twitch or on  YouTube or whatever. I mean, there's just so many amazing players and you see so many cool things.  And then, you know, the mod community is so insane too. So yeah, it'll be interesting to see, you  know, obviously there's, there's the iOS version, which is pretty good, but it'll be interesting to  see what happens when the Android version launches.

Transcript:  This game has been so insane. I mean, last year, all we could talk about was Player Unknown's  Battleground. And when Fortnite pivoted from their co-op campaign to Battle Royale, everyone  was thinking, oh, you know, they will, they're cute, but PUBG is the big dog here. And they  were free to play on every platform. And I'm telling you, every person I know that interacts  with middle schoolers is telling me this is all they can talk about. Fortnite is their life.

There's a certain, I think we  almost reached this place with the PS4 Pro and the Xbox One X and where like the realism is great,  but it's kind of fun to have a game look like a game. It's so funny.

Yeah, I love these games.  He loves the 8-bit, you know, it's like black and red. It's not even colorful. And he loves it. And  I think, is it the gameplay that makes it so good? Same with your kid, Karsten. Is it the gameplay  that they like or do they like the retro? The retro look can't mean anything to them. They don't  remember that. Good games are good games. It's just a good game. Yeah. That shows you after you've  spent all this energy making great graphics and high-end hardware and, you know, he has a fancy  Windows 10 machine. He's playing on his Switch on the big straight TV. He's playing some 8-bit game.  It's kind of funny. Our show today brought to you by LastPass. This, I almost feel like I should do  these ads as a public service announcement. That's how important I think LastPass is. 13 million  users. I love it. I've been using LastPass since they started. In fact, I sold it to, I was, you  know, selling it, singing its praises as a password vault to Steve Gibson. He said, well, I'm going to  look into this because that's how Steve is. He interviewed Joe Segrist, the creator of LastPass.  Joe very generously showed him the source code, showed him how it works. And Steve said, this is  great. He started using it. That was several years ago. We now use LastPass in the enterprise. So one  of the things that happened to us a few years ago, one of our guys put all the company passwords on  a public website so he could remember them. And he doesn't work for us anymore. And we immediately  adopted LastPass Enterprise. Last, look, there's too many passwords to remember. I actually am  kind of sympathetic. He couldn't remember all the passwords. But really, if you're, what you want is  a way to keep all those passwords in a super secure encrypted vault. You remember one password  that lets you unlock the vault and then it fills in your credentials no matter where you are.  It generates strong passwords for you. It makes it easy to change passwords. One of the things I love  about LastPass, when there is a breach, I can change the password in an automated fashion quickly. In  fact, there's a security check you can run LastPass and you can go through and fix all of your  passwords. You know, if you've not been using a password vault, you probably have duplicated  passwords, things like that. It'll make strong passwords. It'll remember them. It'll fill them  in and not just on your computer, but on your Android device, your iPhone, everywhere you are.  Plugin for Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, even Microsoft Edge. I trust LastPass so much.  I put all my important documents in there, my passport images. That way I have them as I travel,  my driver's license, my social security numbers. Everything's in LastPass. And with LastPass  Enterprise, our entire business is protected. In fact, I believe in LastPass so much. Not only  do we use LastPass Enterprise, but we offer it as a benefit to all our employees,  a free LastPass account because I want them to use it for their personal stuff, not just my stuff,  but their personal stuff too. Sensitive data encrypted at the device level with AES 256-bit  encryption. It protects you from man-in-the-middle attacks. Your stuff is safe. Your stuff is secure.  It doesn't slow you down. It makes it easy. Once you start using LastPass, you'll never go back.  Now, they have a number of products. We've got the Enterprise for Business, LastPass Premium for your  personal use, LastPass Families for the entire family. By the way, that's great too because Lisa  and I have to share passwords for common stuff like our Comcast account, stuff like that.  It's the easiest way. I just share it with her. Actually, I have a family folder. Everything goes  in there. There's LastPass Teams for smaller businesses, 50 or less. At work and at home,  fix your password woes with LastPass. The number one most preferred password manager. It's got the  Steve Gibson seal of approval, mine too. Lastpass.com slash twit. Try it today. Lastpass.com slash twit.  Let's see which product is right. Oh, there's a big picture of me on the page. Wow. Lastpass.  This is actually, that quote is apps. I actually wrote it. It is literally the first program I  install on any new device or computer. First thing I do is put the LastPass plugin on the desktop  or the LastPass app because then all the other apps which I need to log into, I have LastPass.  Makes it much easier. Lastpass.com slash twit. We're talking about countries operating,  oh actually before we go on, I want to go talk a little bit about Apple, but before we go on,  I think we should probably show you our little highlight reel from this week on Twit.

I actually went around to several of the young women, no longer young women that were there.  I said, I didn't harass you, did I? And they all said, I'm very proud. Oh no, no, of course not.  I'm trying to remember. Did I harass you? No, no, no, no. So you got to check in, right? Every  once in a while. I said every guy in the Me Too movement, every guy who worked in broadcasting is  trying to, was I okay? Was I creepy? No. I'm glad to say, unless they're lying, but they got nothing  to, they got nothing to, no reason to lie now. Was I creepy to you, Christina? No. No. No.  That's why you're over there in Seattle, far, far away. Apple is, this is interesting. This comes  back to what we were talking about, getting, doing business in a country. You have to obey the laws  of the country, right? Yeah. Apple has continuously kind of agreed to do what China's government  wants it to do. They took VPNs out of the store last year. Now they're cracking down on apps that  use the call kit API. This is, Christina, what is, do you know what call kit does?

Start time: 5321.78
End time: 5371.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do. I do. So basically, you know how, if you look up someone in your contacts,  there's the option for you to call or send them an iMessage. And if you have certain apps installed  like Skype or I guess for a while WeChat or WhatsApp, and there are a few others that support  it, you can actually make like a WhatsApp call from your contact list. So you don't have to go  into WhatsApp. You can just go into your contacts. And so that's, that support comes via call kit.  And it uses the VoIP protocol to plug into the contacts map. But I guess in this case, China  is saying that we don't want any calls going through VoIP because they're encrypted.  Exactly. So Apple's way around that is just to say, okay, you're using call kit, remove it  from your apps or we'll remove apps that are using that.

Transcript:  I mean, I understand if you want to do business in China, you have to adhere to the laws of China,  but I kind of admire Google's principles stand here. They still don't do business in China,

Start time: 5381.18
End time: 5435.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right? No, they don't. I mean, but it is becoming very difficult, you know, for, I mean, it's created  lots of issues with the Google Play. I mean, they found some ways around it, but it's become very  difficult for Google Play and for Google to even distribute safe apps because people in China aren't  using the official store. So, you know, instead you're using, they're using these third party  stores that are kind of scraping things and that's how, you know, malware gets spread. So there are  trade-offs and obviously Apple doesn't even have the option. You know, you couldn't even have,  there are third party app stores for people who have jailbroken iPhones, but, you know, there  isn't an alternative way for people to get apps. So yeah, I mean, I kind of, I'm kind of with you.  I, part of me wishes that they could take a more principled stance, but the other part of me, you  know, kind of understands that as a business, that's not really something where they can  say no to one of their biggest revenue generating countries.

Transcript:  You know, Apple, it's easy for Apple to be principled in the United States and say to the  FBI, we're not going to unlock that phone. Although I got a big fight with a waiter at a  restaurant the other night who said Apple should unlock that phone. And I said, well, but yeah,  but if they do, if they have a back door and then you're unsafe, he said, no, no, look,  you're supporting terrorists. So Apple has this great principled stand in the United States. And

Start time: 5463.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so. Potentially. But I would just, I mean, I would hope, and I don't know, obviously,  I don't work there and I'm not trying to speak for them, but I would hope that if that were  something that were coming down, that it wasn't about VPNs, if it wasn't about VWIP protocols,  if it wasn't about, you know, what the concessions they'd always made about where they store Chinese  users' data, that if it were about something as potentially, you know, overreaching as you have to  give us a back door to the OS, that there would be much more pushback up to and including, you know,  pulling out of the market or at least a thread of that. I don't know for sure, but I feel like there  are variations. Like you can work with countries to abide by certain things and then there are  certain steps where you can just say, no, I'm not going to do this. And for Google, you know,  part of it is that they, if they were to abide by, you know, China's laws, and, you know,  they would have to change fundamental parts of their business and they're not willing to do that.  So in Google's case, it's easy enough to move Google search to Hong Kong.  Well, that's the thing. That's the thing. And they are still having Android licensed phones  sold in China. They just don't have the Google Play, you know, Google services running.  But they are, it's not, but you're right, they still have things in Hong Kong and, you know,  the savvy users are still potentially able to touch into their services. But, you know, it has  created problems for them and they are, you know, it is going to be an issue they kind of grapple  with going forward, which is, you know, when they, you look at, you know, Tencent and Baidu and some  of these other like really, really big Chinese service companies that, you know, Google doesn't  have a play in that market, but Google's business and Apple's businesses are very different. I mean,  Google's selling data, Apple's primarily selling, you know, hardware.

Transcript:  Yeah, with a VPN thing, I think they could kind of skate it because you could still use a VPN,  you just can't get it in the app store. And so that's not the end of the world, you know,  if you're a Chinese dissident or whatever. I don't, I just, it's unsettling.

Transcript:  I agree. I agree. I mean, I would be curious to know how many Chinese iOS users have accounts,  like iTunes accounts they created in other countries in order to get access to,  you know, different apps, because, you know, you can log in with like the U.S. account and then you  can log in with the Chinese account and download different apps. Now you've got to log in each time  that you want to do an update, but it's relatively easy to just, you know, log out and then log in to  another country's account if you need to download a country specific app or if you need to, you know,  get an app that's not available in another country. So I would be interested to know how many savvy,  you know, Chinese iPhone users also have either American or European iTunes accounts.

Transcript:  Well, that's kind of an interesting thing because they could, but some of them, I mean,  enforcement is selective. I was talking to somebody, an expat who lives in China,  married a Chinese wife and he travels a lot. And I was asking about the VPN thing. He said, well,  you don't want to get caught using a VPN, but they also look, turn a blind eye to it. A lot of the  intelligentsia uses it and they know that, you know, they're, they're, they expect to be able to  use that. They want access to the internet. And so they just turn a blind eye to it. On the other  hand, he, he got in trouble. It was a minor thing, but he got in trouble. And now every time he  enters the country, he has to be, he gets questioned for two or three hours and he has to present  himself when he goes anywhere in China to the local authorities and say, I'm here. Just so you know,  I might be spying on you. I'm here. And so it's, it's a, it's an interesting country in that,

Well, I was going to say,  and I have friends who, um, some of them are like actually Chinese nationals who will go there to,  you know, get their visa renewed or whatever. And we'll then be communicating with me,  use Facebook messenger, which is blocked. It should be blocked, but it's not blocked yet.  That's how I'm communicating with them. I'm like, I, and I would even say, do we need to use WeChat?  Do we need to use, you know, whatever? No, no, no. Messenger's fine. So I, I don't, I don't,  I'm not going to pretend to know the intricacies, but I feel like the savvier people, which probably  tend to include people who have more monies, which tends to align with people who are iPhone users,  have methods of, of getting around some of these things, I would assume.

Transcript:  Apple is interestingly finally giving Ireland. It's due. Remember one of the reasons, one of the  ways Apple and many companies were able to defer us taxes is by opening essentially shell  companies in Ireland and then transferring IP rights to the companies and then paying the companies  fees for the use of their technology, thereby getting the money out overseas. Now, of course,  with the new tax law, Apple's repatriated a couple of hundred billion dollars. And then the  EU goes to Ireland said you, you should have been charging Apple tax on this. Apple has been told  that they, Ireland has to hold 13 billion euros in disputed taxes. Apple has started to pay that.

Transcript:  They paid 1.76 billion dollars. I will point out that they have not actually paid it. Oh,  it's going into an escrow account because it's not technically, there's still appeals and things like  that. So yeah. Now is it earning interest while it's an escrow? Isn't that what escrow is for? I  think, right? No, escrow means the third party holds it. It's like third party is just holding it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  important to point that out, I guess, anymore. Well, isn't it much of it repatriated? Or are  you saying it's still there, but they just don't want to talk about it? My understanding is that

Start time: 5894.52
End time: 5911.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there's no rule saying that they ever had to say what it was. So the implication is that by them  always reporting that there's all this money they can't touch, that it was like getting shareholders  to apply pressure that we need to bring that money home. That's exactly right. Because that

Start time: 5911.28
End time: 5946.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was always the implication, which was we this is money that could be in the United States. If only  you would relax the tax laws. And now that that's gone, they don't have to mention that. And in  fact, I mean, in some cases, it works out well, because, you know, if there were currency, you  know, if the dollar was stronger, for instance, then, you know, all that cash would be worthless.  So, you know, in some cases, they would it would be a negative even sometimes kind of applying  those things. But yeah, I think you're exactly right is that that's now it's like, well, who  cares? We got what we wanted. And now we can not not talk about that. Yeah. Which, by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  money. Oh, and the shareholders are very happy because most of the time, in most cases, this  money is being used to buy back stock, which makes their stock worth more. It's I don't I  guess some of it might be used. Actually, isn't Apple aren't they didn't they announce a new  campus? They're shopping. They're shopping around. So maybe they're spending, I think,

Start time: 5990.70
End time: 6054.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  30 billion, something like that. Well, they know they claimed Well, remember, it was a couple  months ago that they said that they were going to spend I think the number was $200 billion.  Oh, wow. And bring I think the number was 20,000 jobs to the US. And so the rumors this week,  again, I think both of the things I mentioned recently are Mark Gurman scoops. Of course,  they are. Is that they've been poking around DC. But then also Carolina. Right. What's that the  new Virginia? Sorry. No, no, it's North Carolina. The research triangle. Yeah.  Research angle. Raleigh Durham. Yeah, exactly. And by the way, Tim Cook got his MBA from Duke. So  when they already have the data centers. Well, and apparently, though, the if I again, I don't  have the article in front of me. The I think that the amount of office space they were looking for,  at least in Virginia was like half of what Amazon was looking for, for its entire second  headquarters. So this is this would be a significant location if they do do it. So

Start time: 6054.94
End time: 6082.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no, it definitely would. Because Amazon has I mean, granted, a lot of Amazon's employees are  in their warehouses and things like that. But I believe Amazon has more engineers, corporate  employees than Apple does. So if they're looking at half the number of HQ two, which is, you know,  supposed to be a true second headquarters, and that's that's very significant, considering,  you know, the number of employees that are typically at non Cupertino Apple campuses.

Start time: 6083.36
End time: 6089.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. No, but they said it was going to be technical support and something else. So yeah,  yeah, it would. But and also, this is not the first one, because they, again, the size of this  would not at all rival what they have in California. But the point of the articles I read was it was so  significant that, you know, the states are bending over backwards. Apparently, Cook has met with the  governor of Virginia, the governor of North Carolina. So they're almost going and all of  these cities have already sort of put on their best, their Sunday best for Amazon. So it was very  easy for them to do the same thing. They're just going to flip the application. What's interesting

Start time: 6130.16
End time: 6153.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  those obviously of these cities are bending over backwards, you know, for Amazon and now Apple.  I live in Seattle, which, you know, has dealing firsthand with some of the good and the bad  things that happen when you have, you know, Amazon in your backyard. And it will be interesting to  see, you know, sometimes these things, these deals that cities make with these companies  aren't always as beneficial as you would think. And there's a lot of people feel about Amazon.

Start time: 6153.90
End time: 6158.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Seattle, because I've heard mixed reports. I mean, they pretty much are kind of in the

Start time: 6158.40
End time: 6257.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  downtown. They're not like a stand alone. No, they are. They own the downtown. Like the downtown  is Amazon. Like the South Lake Union, West Lake Union area is Amazon, period. Is that OK? Or is it?  It's interesting because I'm sort of biased and that I have a tremendous amount of friends that  work there. And like my building, my apartment building, I would say there are 88 units. I would  say 80 of them, the people in them work at Amazon or Microsoft or Google or Facebook.  You know, like it's it's I would say genuinely like that's probably the breakdown is you might  have a couple of people who don't do those things. But Amazon has a huge workforce in that building.  And, you know, Microsoft does, too. But when I talk to locals like Uber drivers or Lyft drivers  or people who've been around for a while, their opinion is a lot more negative. And so I think  for people who are in the tech industry, there's one perspective for people who aren't who  especially have been in the city for longer than in the area for longer. I think they kind of blame  Amazon on some of the housing issues and some of the housing crisis issues and home prices in Seattle  area have just exploded. And it's what's happened. What happened in New York and in San Francisco is  happening in Seattle. And the growth has just made it really hard for people to buy homes,  let alone, you know, rents go up, too. So there's a lot of I think locals who don't like the company.  And then you kind of have this flip side where a lot of the new people who are coming into the city,  which obviously are what's making the city kind of boom, it's because they're working in tech.  And Amazon is obviously one of the biggest employers. So it's kind of mixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is exactly what I was going to say. I mean, I'm definitely not going to speak against it,  because I take advantage of it. But I also can understand that there was the city council is  imposing this tax, for instance, on companies saying that if you generate more than a certain  amount of revenue in the city proper, then you have to pay a tax. And it was originally supposed  to be, I think, five hundred dollars per employee. And they've since settled to two hundred and fifty  dollars per employee. And Amazon's response was a pretty significant hardball to say, OK, well,  you know, these two skyscrapers were working on, we're just going to abandon them. And they've  since risen construction on one. And I think they're still in talks to the other. But I mean,  it was significant enough that I think the city thought that they kind of had Amazon by the  proverbial, you know, balls, so to speak. I was trying to think of a short hair.  Short hair is exactly that was the better euphemism. But they didn't because what ended  up happening was Amazon said, OK, fine, we'll stop. And then all of a sudden, you know,

Start time: 6324.36

Apple has I mean, it's small, but Apple has has a  presence. So it's not as if other companies wouldn't want to own this office space. But,  you know, at the same time, you don't want one of your biggest landowners to  say we're done either. So it's they ended up compromising. But I would say I feel like the  city blinked pretty hard. Like, you know, that's what's happening with Apple, that Tim Cook,

End time: 6424.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is I think what happens, though, is, you know, the city's at first, they look at how great it's  going to be. And then you start to realize some of the side effects if you're not prepared for  that. And then if you want to start taxing and start expecting more, that's when it becomes  difficult. And that's why I do think that for whatever, you know, either any city looking at  taking on Apple or HQ two or any other tech companies, like you need to look at places like  Seattle to kind of see like this is what happens when when you kind of give them the world.

Transcript:  thanks. Amazon gave us some notes. And we're going to we're going to we're going to fix this city up.  Well, I guess, you know, tax base, right? I get it. Yeah, I want to take a break.  Because I have to have some wine. But I, but I want I'm wondering now, somebody said something  in the chat room that kind of got me thinking. He said, this isn't tech, these are big companies,  they just use tech to make money. Are big companies bad for tech? Have have has the big companies  taken over tech? And is that hurting us? Is that hurting innovation? Is that it's an interesting  question. Let's take a break and talk about it. Because I have a little delivery I've got to open  up here. My monthly, my monthly would even made a sound. My monthly Wink is here. I love the Wink  wine. It is a really great idea. If you go to W INC, actually, it's try try W INC.com slash  twit, you can go through their taste questionnaire to figure out what kind of wine you would like.  They ask you about things like do you like how do you like your coffee? Do you like  salt? Do you like mushrooms? Do you like citrus? And then the taste profile, they'll build you  your first W INC delivery, you get to choose all white, all red, a split, you get to actually,  if you don't like a wine, you can replace it as well. But W INC is neat. W INC is not,  it's a wine club, but they're the winemaker. That's really important. They're not, you know,  reselling old wine from some company that couldn't sell it. It makes such a nice sound when I open it  up. They are making the wine and they make some amazing wine. Here's something from New Zealand,  Outer Sounds, a beautiful Sauvignon Blanc. I love it when my delivery comes. This is,  look at the labels too. They're great. Vee Bass, a Merlot from Pay Doc, a French Merlot. Actually,  I'm going to see, you know, what I usually do, we go through about a bottle a week, you know,  you have it with a nice dinner and maybe three bottles a month. And then we always have one and  I always decide when I open the box, oh, this is the one, Folly of the Beast, a Pinot, probably  from the Central Coast. Yeah. So I always look, oh, this is the one that I'm going to bring  when we go to visit people, you know, it's nice to bring a little bottle of wine.  And we actually did that last night and it's nice. You have a little something to give.  So do the quiz. They work with the best winemakers and growers from around the world  to make this wine. Each month there are new delicious wines. Summertime's coming,  you got to try the summer water rose. It's amazingly refreshing. And frankly, this is my  favorite. We always get at least one bottle of this. It's the Field Theory Blau Frankisch  Passelrobel. So it's also Central Coast. This is the most delicious wine I have ever had. And I  love the bottle. It's kind of a cool, almost looks like a whiskey bottle instead of a regular wine  bottle and the labels painted on. This is, I think this is the wine that they pick the grapes at  midnight. They pick them in the dark because they don't want the hot sun. They don't want the grapes  to warm up when they're picking them. They also partner with local artists to make these beautiful  labels. Each bottle, a work of art, each bottle, great wine at a great price. Shipping is covered.  If you don't like a bottle, if you say, ah, yeah, that wasn't so good. Don't, no questions asked.  They'll just replace it with a bottle you love. You don't have to send the other one back.  Sit back, relax and celebrate with Wink. Don't forget, you know, I think a lot of us get in wine  ruts. This is a great way to try new wines, find new flavors and that you're guaranteed to like.  Why settle for the same bottle of wine you always get?

Now all we need is  glasses and a corkscrew and we can continue on with the show. What do you think? Am I,  that is an interesting point of view. Do we need the big companies or do they really not help?  Do they get in the way of innovation and tech? I think that for some of the bigger problems that

Start time: 6722.68
End time: 6736.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we solve, like artificial intelligence, like machine learning, like robotics, I do think that  you probably do need the bigger companies only because you need the money to be able to fund

Start time: 6736.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  research and development. You agree guys? Well, that's one of the problems for the two big areas  of growth that we have for the future, AI, machine learning, all of this, and VR. You need to have,  well, the data on one hand and the R&D and all of that on the other hand. It's really difficult  for a small company to get in that game. Especially when the big companies are buying all of the  up and comers and sort of taking them for themselves. I'm wondering if, like many others  are wondering, if we haven't reached the point where they are a little bit too big.  The thing in tech is that there can always be a newcomer that changes everything,  but the new things are now those areas where the old comers are already snagging everything there  is to snag. It's the first time in the 20 or 30 years I've liked tech where I'm wondering if there  can be a change or if they're really just those behemoths are, I mean, have they ever been this

Start time: 6810.92
End time: 6836.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  large? Has any company ever been this large? My problem is that I think that they stifle innovation  ultimately. I mean, you see things like Google, and I know Microsoft does this too, really trying  to preserve that small company point of view within the big company because they know that's  where innovation happens. Yes, you need resources, but it's the guy in the garage or gal in the  garage, even in things like robotics and AI, that often makes the big breakthrough that then can be

Transcript:  leveraged by a big company. There's, again, forgive me for putting on  history hat here. Please do. No, that's why you're here.  But what we've never had, and it depends on your definition of what technology industry we're  talking about. What we've never had in previous eras, there was always one big company that  everyone was afraid of. So it was IBM for a while, then it was Microsoft for a while.  We've never had in at least computing, and again, this is debatable going back to the Traders 8 and  all the companies that came out of that and stuff like that. But so now you have essentially these  big four dominants. So you have an oligopoly as opposed to, so if there's only one target,  if everyone, I'm sorry, Christina, going back to a different era, if everyone hates Microsoft and  is gunning for Microsoft, that's a different ecosystem than there's a club at the top.  And it would seem to me that it would be much, much harder to break into a club  than to kill off the giant if there's only one giant.

Start time: 6902.60
End time: 6919.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with that 100%. But I would say I think that it is, and you're the history expert, so I  would like your perspective on this. I don't think it's necessarily fair to say we've never had  anything as big as this, because I do think we've had companies that have been equally as powerful.  I think the difference, as you say, is now there are multiple, right? So you might be able to-

Start time: 6919.96
End time: 6964.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, that's the point I'm making. That's the point I'm making is that so IBM, no one will ever  be as dominant as IBM was through the early 80s, right? In computing, not in consumer  electronics or anything like that. And then a similar argument can be made for Microsoft in  software. But this is my point is that those were always one giant. And so all of the little  Davids were running around nipping at their heels. But what happens when there's a club,  when there is an oligopoly? And so that even though Microsoft is competing with Google,  is competing with Apple, is competing with Google. But at the same time, it would seem to me that  it would be easier to close the gate behind you if you're in that club.

And if we want to talk about should companies be split up  or not, I mean, I don't know. I mean, I think you can make the argument that AT&T was split up  and ultimately nothing changed and then it just reformed.

What Amazon does, look at what Apple does, look at even what Facebook does. It's in every single  thing. Why were publishers pissed off in Europe and actually in the US, I'm sure as well.

It was able to get significant  funding. Now I think that's the key, right? Is that it got significant institutional funding.  I agree with that, what you're all saying, but I feel like I'm not going to say that I don't  think there's any way that others can innovate. Do I think it's extremely difficult? Without a doubt,  the bar is so much higher than it's ever been.

I have a vivid memory of this because when Internet Explorer 3 came out,  this was in 1990, I want to say four or five, I went on TV on NBC and said,  you might as well close the doors at Netscape because Microsoft's giving away a good browser.  It's all over for Netscape. It was better. I mean, it's not just good. It's better.  And somebody told me later that Mark Andreessen had the TV on and he heard me say this and he  went screaming down the, who is his ass? But I think I was right.

Transcript:  You're right. David doesn't always kill Goliath. But what I'm saying is, it's much harder if there's  six Goliaths and they're in a club and they'll have their disagreements and they'll sue each other,  but then they'll also do business with Samsung still making the screams.

Transcript:  David and Goliath is a story we remember because it's the exception, right?  I'm going to borrow your history hat for a moment because here's an article from Digg that I love.  This is a great article, a little history. The largest company of all time is not any of the  companies you might think of. It was 1637. The Dutch East India Company, if you adjust for  inflation, was worth $7.9 trillion. Trillion! We're talking about how Apple might hit a trillion  later this year. These are the 20 tech companies that combine to make the one  Dutch East India Company. So now that's an exception. Obviously, that was a blip  and it wasn't worth 7.9 million, a trillion a few years later.

We've even had, if you look at, obviously we view things, I think most of us  through a Western lens. I mean, three of us on this panel are from the United States and  we also have our French compatriot. But if you look at Korea, for instance,  their Shy Ball system, where Samsung, I think it's important to note-

They run the hospitals,  they run the insurance companies, they run the manufacturings, they make,  I mean, they're involved in clothing. I mean, they were literally involved in every single  industry. It is not just Samsung Electronics is the most well-known and most profitable,  but it is far from the only part of that business. And so, and that was the same thing with the  West Indies trade company. It was this huge touch into everything. And I think that's kind of,  what was going to be said earlier is that tech is no longer just one thing. It kind of goes into  everything. And by extension, it means that if you do have a club, it is going to be harder  for anybody else to get in. But it's not-

It's only kind of lately that it's become these  dominant giant companies. I find that less interesting. I mean, it's interesting in other  ways. There's the philosophy that we were talking about at the beginning of the show.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, but I mean, and I agree with you, but I think, do you think that maybe part of it is  that until we kind of maybe reach this next big technological breakthrough, we're trying to solve  really big problems. And so whether it's one big company or six, you have to be big to be able to  solve those problems. And potentially once we reach that next breakthrough, maybe then it'll be the  next time for the upstarts, the startups, the smaller places to come in and innovate. But it's  almost like the big challenges that we have to achieve now require for better or worse,  a tremendous amount of money, a tremendous amount of talent. And you just don't get that  unless you're gigantic, unfortunately.

Transcript:  You guys know what a stingray is. I'm not talking about a fish. I'm talking about a device that  impersonates a cell phone tower, captures your cell phone traffic, and as a result can intercept  your calls. The Washington DC NBC affiliate, Channel 4, drove around the DC area with a  mobile security expert and some hardware and software. They were able to detect in the DC area  40 stingray devices that were being used presumably to intercept calls by members of  Congress, the Department of Homeland Security, President Trump. He said, we got picked up twice  while driving along K Street, the lobbyist's corridor, and then they drop them. So you could  actually see the stingray pick up the call, examine the traffic, and then pass it off and say,  you're not interesting. There's nothing to say about this except, wow.

By the way, the longest connection that the Channel Four team had was next to the Russian  embassy. The phones appeared to remain connected to a fake tower the longest.  Oh, and the Chinese and Israeli embassies and then the Romanian and Turkish embassies. Apparently,  they're all running stingrays. By the way, here's the quote from the security expert,  you know governments do this to each other all the time and laws schmaws.  Laws schmaws. We'll take a quick break. We got to wrap it up. This has been going on for a long  time. We got to go, what is it? The Billboard Music Awards or something. Lisa said, come home early.  We got a show to watch.

Dan Harmon, of course,  the founder of Quicken Loans has done amazing things to revitalize downtown Detroit. It's a  really cool company.

You have to go to a bank. You go, please, going to have some money. Put on a tie  or a dress. It's just no fun. Then you have to go to the attic and find pay stubs and bank statements.  It takes a long time, weeks. The last house Lisa and I bought when we bought our house  three or four years ago took two months to get a loan. We almost lost the house.  Fast forward to the 21st century and Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans, an entirely online  loan approval process. You could do the whole thing on your phone. You could do it so fast.  You could do it in an open house and say, we're approved before you leave. That's how easy it is.  Go right now, actually. Set up the account rocketmortgage.com slash twit two.  Twit in the number two. Set up an account. You don't have to go to the attic to find anything.  You just answer a few questions, things you already know, birthday, address, things like that.

Transcript:  Of course. Of course. We talked on security now about e-fail. Not in PGP and SMIME, but it has  that impact of breaking PGP and SMIME. If you use it in a mail client that supports HTML mail,  patches are being worked on as we speak. This is a big deal. Actually, the problem e-fail was found  some months ago. I know it because I got an email from mailmate, which is the Mac program I use.  He said, I couldn't say anything about it, but the last update, the update we put out in March,  specifically addressed this and we fixed it. But at the time, they had told us ahead of time,  we patched as fast as we could, but I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to  tell anybody else that this thing existed. So check with your email client. Make sure it's  up to date. If you want to use PGP or SMIME for security or signing, you should.  Do you care about Yanny and Laurel?

So one, the New York Times has an article that says  it's these one teenagers. They were in a class that what is it vocabulary.com and then it went  to Reddit. Then it went to YouTube, but then Wired's piece were different teenagers, but it  was the exact same story. I don't know if that has ever been solved. Right. That's the part of the

Start time: 7879.20
End time: 7892.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 7944.74
End time: 7961.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we did an experiment. I think this actually was why I thought this is dumb  because Yanny is recorded at the higher pitch and Laurel's at the lower pitch  and it depended on the speaker you played it through. So when we played it through  tinny speakers, you heard Yanny. When you played it through bassy speakers, you heard Laurel.

When Mickey Mouse was created in 1928,  at that time, it was 55 years. Then in 79, it was expanded. In 98, it was expanded to 2023.  And so that's when we're going to have to, come on, guys.  And I guess it was 19... They must have named it after Sonny Bono died.

Start time: 8195.92
End time: 8208.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, maybe.  But I think it was named in his honor, but I think he'd fought to spin those things.  Oh, yeah.  But I think it was after he was in his accidents that I think that's why it was named after him.

They, the EFF, bless you EFF, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, did an inter partes  motion, got the trademark patent office to overturn it.  In 2013, it was then appealed by Personal Audio all the way up to the Supreme Court.  As of May 14th, the Supreme Court has rejected Personal Audio's petition for review.  Unless the EU wants to take this on, there is no higher court. It's over.  You saved podcasting, everybody.  Thanks to people like Adam Carolla, too, who actually went to court.  We were prepared to go to court.  When they asked us for, I think, two and a half million, something like that, we said no.  And then we never heard from them again.  So thank God, because it would have been expensive.  They made a mistake, though, because it wouldn't cost us that much to defend it.  Just a tip to future patent trolls, always ask less than the cost of defending it.  So if it's a million dollars to defend it, which is about what it would have cost us, probably,  ask for 9.8.
