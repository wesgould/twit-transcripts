Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this your air or her air?  This is her air.  And an installation of 16 gigs of RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really?  The eight way motherboard?  I'm sorry, are they calling people who use the air an airhead like they do  Mac head?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The cost alone.  That is ladies and gentlemen, devorak.org slash blog, Mr. John C. Devorak.  Host now of Tech5 on the  Podshow Podcast Network and Cranky Geeks  at Cranky Geeks.tv.  Also here, I hear in the background,  he's been teething, but he's feeling better now, Mr. Patrick Norton.  Hey. How are ya?  Well, Merthin, good cheer.  Techzilla, they wrenched away from you,  Ms. Jessica. Now she's doing the dig review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And she's got another show coming up. Oh, is that why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. I'd rather watch her than you, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you in a co-host search mode?  We are in a co-host search mode. I'm not doing much. I could come down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can't afford you unless you're going to lower your day rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What search mode?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I know that Veronica's been doing a great job

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  filling in. Veronica's amazing. Unfortunately,  she has that silly hallow daily thing. Damn that Calacanis.  Damn that Calacanis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Veronica is such a star.  It's going to be fun to watch her ascend to the heavens.  I've seen this happen before.  Every time, in fact, I work with a woman, they go on to bigger and better things.  And I say, stuck here in my little Garrett.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're doing all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know, Gina Smith, same thing.  She started on the river, that, John? She took over from you on the radio show.  And then all of a sudden she's on Good Morning America, an ABC's tech correspondent.  And now she's gone back to school. She had a baby, she's gone back to school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, she became a CEO in the interim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, remember that Larry Erlison was ThinkNIC.  The network computer.  So the big story of the week, of course, continues to be  Yahoo held hostage day eight.  Microsoft offered $44.6 billion.  The latest from the Wall Street Journal on Friday,  the Yahoo board got together via phone  and said, no, we don't want now.  This is the interesting thing.  We don't know what the letter to will look like to Microsoft.  That'll probably go out Monday.  But they leaked to somebody leaked, probably the board leaked to the Wall Street Journal  that they thought it wasn't enough, that they wanted $40 a share,  which would have made it a deal for $56 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what was the share price before this Fura launched itself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they offered him a huge, like 61% share.  What a huge, like 61% over the stock value.  And that wasn't enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They offered 30 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so that's 33% more. No, 50% more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this one of those scenes where it's not going to matter what the board wants  because the shareholders are going to go berserk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's when it's the barbarians at the gate. That's when it's a hostile takeover.  And look, at Microsoft's not going to pay $40 a share.  I think it's a stretch for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have to borrow money already to pay the $44 billion.  And they're going to have to borrow more money.  They don't even like borrowing money at all. So they're borrowing money to do this deal.  This deal is not going to happen.  Or, no, I think it's a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if it does happen, the EU is going to kill it. This whole thing is taking...  I agree with you, the EU will never let it happen.  But Microsoft could, as Patrick implied, end around the board  and throw the board out. We're giving you 50% on your dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what's the advantage to...  Is there any advantage to end users to Microsoft owning Yahoo?  Other than it not being Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's bad for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's bad for Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google can't do it because they'll be in a monopoly situation.  So they're not even going to bother.  And the last thing Google wants is Yahoo's development practices tainting its way.  We tried to get Mike on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was going to be on the show, but now we only have his answering machine.  And we'll be giving out his cell phone number a little later on in the show.  But Mike points out, and I think quite rightly so,  and very interestingly so, that the Microsoft stock  took such a huge hit after this offer,  it in fact went down the equivalent of $44 billion,  or something close to it, $38 billion.  So it's almost exactly the same as the Microsoft stock.  Is that a coincidence, or the stock market knows something?  They didn't like the deal.  They didn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Microsoft's already got a bad rep.  The stock can't move at all.  It's ridiculous.  In fact, I wrote one column calculating that this would be five bucks per share.  So anyone who has 100 shares of Microsoft,  they should have been getting a $38 billion offer.  So anyone who has 100 shares of Microsoft,  they should have been getting $500 in a dividend  rather than throwing money away at some bonehead deal like this.  That's what I'd be mad at. If anybody should be mad,  it shouldn't be the Yahoo stockholders. It should be the Microsoft guys.  Microsoft's never paid dividends, have they?  Yeah, no, they have a little dividend of some sort.  Oh, they do now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I don't know if they're still paying it, but they had it some time ago.  I mean, I may be wrong, but my sense is that there's nobody at Yahoo  from the guy on the ground floor to the guy in the executive suite  who wants to go to work for Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I would say that's probably true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but what's going to happen with Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, they're not doing too good right now.  They're not doing too well.  Either. They're not doing either. Good or well.  Thanks, Dad.  So I guess the question is, was this a crazy deal from the beginning?  Cringely wrote a really interesting article in which he posited,  I think I mentioned this last week, that the whole thing is basically  Microsoft's attempt to become a general electric,  a conglomerate of a lot of diverse technology companies  so that they can withstand the winds of change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I had written a column saying that because of the influence  of what's-his-name, Buffett,  I think they're going to become a kind of a Berkshire Hathaway  kind of investment group.  Jimmy Buffett?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Warren Buffett.  Warren Buffett.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought maybe they'd become Parrotheads. I didn't know.  You said Buffett.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you said Berkshire Hathaway.  But to a certain point, Microsoft already is a loose conglomeration  of divergent technologies and applications  that are pretty much only tied together by links on the desktop.  And in subsets of Windows, I mean, they're already in a lot of pies.  I mean, if they wanted to be GE, shouldn't they invest in something  that is not a desktop or that is not something that directly impacts  on their existing businesses? Isn't that kind of the whole point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the four businesses Balmer says they're in.  They're in desktops, they're in enterprise,  they're in entertainment with Xbox and Zoom,  and they're in online with MSN.  But what they're not is in cloud computing.  I mean, live, I guess, sort of. Hotmail, yes.  But they haven't really done well in cloud computing.  Google's starting to eat their lunch in the office area, right,  with the Google Suite that's free? Well, they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's not even having snack after it's nap at this point in the office space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But don't you think that's a threat to them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, okay, so offline app.  So when the Google appliance, my per-seat charge for my...  You know what I mean? How many times have we watched  desktop applications, like the big thing?  Now it's Google is doing... I think cloud computing's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're saying it's that same old thin client thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're calling it cloud computing, which is kind of like Web 2.0.  We've got sophisticated forums that allow user interaction.  We have a new name for it. It's better.  So now it's not just, you know, it's not like server-client computing.  It's not server-hosted applications. Now it's cloud computing.  But wait a minute, Patrick. What do you use for your email, Patrick?  I use Gmail. Cloud computing?  No, more software as a service. It's HTML-based email.  It's cloud computing. Software as a service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look, instead of running a desktop email client, downloading your mail to your desktop  and reading it there, you're doing it all on the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do most of it, not all of it. But I also check it off online in an application on my desktop.  And I know a fair number of people who actually, you know, who actually...  I know a shocking number of people who use Hotmail.  Or who use Yahoo Mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Hotmail and Yahoo Mail are ten times bigger than Google Mail anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, what Flickr's doing with photo editing online is going through to a cloud computer.  Same thing.  But that's cloud computing. The editing of the photo online.  I submit that creating or not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your download... I mean, it doesn't matter where you're doing it.  It's still a big step for a company to go from, you know, 500, much less 5,000 or 50,000 seats  of an office application to, you know, an online application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you don't think Microsoft's looking at that at all?  Do you think they're just looking at the online advertising and search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're probably looking at advertising revenue in a way to amortize the investment into live  and some of the other stuff. They're probably looking for eyeballs.  They're probably looking for growth that's going to jerk the stock out of the, you know,  relatively stable position it's been in because, as John will probably back me up on,  the whole point of Microsoft's stock was to make up for not paying people a lot of money.  The idea is you're going to go to work for Microsoft and you'd be a millionaire if you stayed there for ten years.  You know, they've got to figure out a way to pull more talent than Google.  Or yeah, Google may in the long run end up eating Microsoft's lunch.  But they have to be able to pull the best programmers and the most talented managers,  and they can't do that unless people think they're going to get rich there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's a different culture, boy. I mean, the Yahoo culture is open source based.  It's not, they run Linux servers, not Windows servers.  I mean, Google.  I mean, Google. No, no, Yahoo. I'm talking about Yahoo.  Both of them. Both of them.  But that's what I'm saying is that the culture clash between Microsoft and Yahoo is dramatic.  And I don't think you're going to keep the Yahoo employees happy.  I mean, you're right. They'll have to offer them a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're also assuming the Yahoo employees are happy now.  I mean, a lot of them are, but a lot of them are.  Many of them will be unemployed any minute now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As I say, 10% of them weren't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I talked to a lot of those guys and they're all very happy.  They like the company. They're a little disappointed in its performance.  And there is this issue with the nobody knows who they're.  You know, Jim Lauderbach was offered a position there,  or at least he was always trying to get one there at one point.  I remember him telling me that he couldn't figure out who was reporting to who.  The place was a mess.  And then you send that peanut butter memo came out.  And it sounds to me as though they need a restructuring of some sort,  at least maybe at least a minor one for starters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who wrote that peanut butter memo? It wasn't Terry Semel, was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, it was someone of the hotshot executives, but some guy you'd never heard of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He said, we're spread too thin, likes peanut butter on a sandwich.  And he was right.  But that started back with broadcast.com.  I mean, that, I mean, Yahoo, and that's the other thing.  Yahoo is notorious for its slow, plodding, and ineffective acquisitions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't get its acquisitions. They're not nimble.  Microsoft gains no nimbility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just puts another lead boot on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I got to write down that Microsoft gains no nimbility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it better the lead boot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is we, you know, we only have one lead boot.  We need another one.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this the point where we should all openly acknowledge that neither,  none of us in this podcast could do a better job managing or working  at a middle or senior level management job.  That's a given.  We're pundits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a given.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just feeling really honest today. Maybe the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's called back. It's called. It's called armchair quarterbacking.  That's what this show is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. But you know, everybody agrees with us.  Yeah.  It's not as though we don't know what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not saying we do or don't.  I'm just, I'm just, I'm just having a moment of being like, I couldn't do any of these jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could. I could do it. I could run the whole company.  Yeah.  Right into the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you would turn it into a big giant podcast.  I would. I wouldn't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As a user, I just want the stuff to suck less.  That's all we're looking for as regular users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I might as well ask you this, Chris, because you've gone Mac.  Why? What happened?  I remember when you said, I'm not going to use Vista.  I'm going to use XP.  Even XP didn't do it for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that operating systems.  Well, several years old.  I don't know.  There wasn't really a tipping point, so to speak.  It was just a long series of events that started years ago.  Certainly Apple's move to the Intel platform helped.  The release of Vista didn't help.  I mean, it didn't help Microsoft's, you know, point in all this.  Position.  Yeah. Position. Thank you.  I'm having a problem with the language this morning, apparently.  I know the feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, given that it's four in the afternoon, I think you are, actually.  When did you get up?  I was pretty late last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was taking phone calls late last night.  I open up my phone line now and I get all sorts of anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you give out your phone and then you have you stream going and you just answer the phone.  Is that what is that the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, it's not really the show.  I mean, I do a lot of things, but that's part of it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you call it Saturday Night Live is over.  The wine bottle is empty.  Chris is going to take her out and I might tune into this.  I would. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a blast.  It's an absolute blast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, have you figured out how for us to hear that both ends, though, because you know, how about getting back to the point here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, OK. OK.  Sorry, Dad.  Anyway, I think a big push.  I like it.  With Leopard, it really caused me to take stock in what I was doing, how I was using OS 10 versus how I was using Windows.  How what I use for email and contact management has been in Outlook.  I moved to an exchange server, so that's all hosted.  I use Plaxo to synchronize between all my points, including Google Calendar, iCal, so on and so forth.  So then I waited to see what Apple was going to do with the new Mac Pro.  And then I was I was just in heaven.  I was like, OK, that's it. I'm done.  You like eight ways.  I can write Windows in a full machine.  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. That was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would I would be I'll be really curious to see how the new Mac Pros hold up because I had a couple of the early or I should say MacBook Pro.  Do you have the are you going for the Mac Pro or the MacBook Pro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got a MacBook Pro, the 17 inch 1920 by 1200.  Yeah, I never use mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's too big.  It's like a pizza.  It's a pizza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'll take the size for the speed any day and the resolution.  I can't beat it.  But no, a Mac Pro is what I'm talking about.  Patrick, the tower.  He wants it. He's got our.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's that should be pretty stable.  Those are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been using this four way as Zeon for almost a year and a half.  I love it. I mean, it's a rock solid machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm just ready to use more than two gigs of RAM.  And, you know, quite honestly, I could go with Windows 64.  But unless I'm doing video editing or audio editing in a 64 bit app, it's relatively useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what Windows says in two gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm trying to think, but nothing happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just that's for you, John.  John's new show is the sound effects show.  Now, instead of a MacBook Air, had you bought Ponzi, a red Zune 80, a Valentine's Day Zune,  you might have got that for free.  Microsoft can't get them out fast enough.  Believe it or not, to people who ordered the Zune,  expecting it would come by February 14th,  Microsoft has sent out messages saying,  we wanted to provide you an update on your order status due to some issues in fulfillment.  We may not get that Zune to you by Valentine's.  We're working to get as fast as we can.  But just in case, in order to provide a smooth customer experience,  we're going to refund the entire amount of your order.  And we're still going to send you the Zune.  Yeah, but she still wouldn't use it.  Oh, that's a, yeah, you're still stuck with a Zune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, the Zune's pretty good.  I think I'm going to order one now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, yeah, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Say, I want it by Valentine's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I have a Zune.  I did the iPod Zune sex video.  It's got like millions of hits on YouTube.  And that's really the only time I used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is the iPod Zune sex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, don't ask him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's going to Google it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, you know what I could do, and if Dane's sitting right here,  and I have to ask Dane's permission,  but I could play the Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci,  Muppet version of the Casino movie.  But they'd have to bleep like three quarters of it, Dane.  You're willing to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you also have to watch it.  It's not something to listen to because it's just a sexual...  Oh, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would sound just like the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why don't you post the link?  Why don't you tell everybody the link?  I'll put the link in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll just Google YouTube De Niro, and you'll find it.  There's a lot of...  Hey, I'll put it on dvorak.org slash blog.  It's good for the blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, does it ever take a moment,  run and grab a peanut butter sandwich,  watch that video, and then rejoin us in the podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll be back in a moment.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, wait a minute.  Now, let me understand.  We're going to stop now for a couple of minutes or we can keep going.  For what?  I guess we stopped.  OK.  Welcome back.  I hope you enjoyed that peanut butter sandwich and De Niro and Pesci.  And now on with the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is like working with Ernie Kovacs, man.  We're breaking new rules.  We're breaking barriers in the medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're inventing crap, even as we speak.  Or at least we're making crap.  There you go.  Let me see.  Other big stories.  Yes, there's quite a few.  50th Grammy Awards tonight.  No writers, but who needs writers when you've got YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You thought Stuart was having a rough week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't wait to see those 50th Grammys.  Kid Rock go up on the stage, look for the propter and they go,  uh, now what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, Kid Rock, I think Kid Rock can probably carry it off.  Can he ad-lib his way through it?  He can ad-lib his way through it.  in front of thousands of people.  You know, he'll do fine.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is the deal they did with YouTube,  which I think is kind of clever.  YouTube had a channel that they asked people.  The channel is youtube.com slash my grammy moment,  which sounds like French kissing with your grandma or something.  It doesn't sound right.  But anyway, my grammy moment.  It doesn't sound, does that sound, is something wrong there?  Maybe it's just me.  Is it just me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Something wrong with you even thinking that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My grammy moment.  Oh, I know why.  before we started.  OK.  Got me in the mood.  So YouTube asked its, I don't know what you call contributors.  Is that what you call these guys?  People who make the videos.  They said, here's the Foo Fighters, the Pretender.  We want an instrumental version of it.  And we're going to put it all on this site.  My grammy moment.  And people will vote.  I'm sorry, Chris.  Like, you know, it's you.  It's your fault.  And people will vote on it.  And then the top 15, this is amazing,  whether they're playing violin, cello, trumpet.  There's actually a trumpet version of the Foo Fighters,  the Pretender.  They're at the Grammys tonight.  They've been practicing for the last two weeks to play together.  Yeah, brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With my grammy.  With my grammy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to hear the trumpet one?  I think I have it here.  Let me see if I can find it.  Chocolate rain for the win.  Chocolate rain.  Every time I sing chocolate rain, we lose.  I feel a thousand angels die.  So let me see.  That's OK.  Here we go.  This is the my grammy moment.  Guy on the trumpet playing the Pretender.  Take a little gander.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see.  This is Lisa on her violin.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  She's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good.  She's also topless, which helps.  This cello.  Remember that with that?  That the whole movement with topless cellos.  I don't know what that was.  I think that was.  Yeah.  You know, I missed that.  You missed that or you miss it?  You didn't miss it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You miss it.  We need this more bottomless male cellos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't want.  Thank you.  No.  Back to Star Trek.  Let me see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Walking on gravel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, get this one.  A British travel company which owns the website cruise.co.uk wanted cruises.co.uk.  They paid one point one million dollars for the S.  Wow.  That's more than.  Makes sense to me.  Yeah.  That's more than a wheel of fortune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cruises are bank.  I mean, that's their bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, but they already own cruise.co.uk.  Doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If the SEO doesn't work for cruise.co.uk, then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if people normally.  Sounds like a waste of money.  Well, no, if they're typing in keywords and it's a domain that's, you know, cruise versus  cruises, maybe people in research were typing in cruises instead of cruise.  It makes sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I understand what you're saying, except for the fact that a million dollars would have  to amount to at least a minimum of 10 million dollars in sales.  That's a lot.  That's a long term investment.  That could be six months of sales for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It depends on how much they own.  If they're doing a lot of business, John.  You know, I can tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They should be on top of the business they're already doing.  Cruises are bank.  So they're saying that they're going to do 10 million dollars in addition to what they're  already doing just by having that extra domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's find out if they're a publicly traded company.  All right.  You guys carry on.  I'm going to research this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to give you, this is, it's quiz time on the show.  What technology that was so big, so big for so many years went out of business, went,  went away?  I'll tell you what.  Polaroid.  Oh, yeah.  I was going to play the song and give you a tear too fast.  Listen up now.  Listen to this.  See if you recognize this.  Hey, beat the swinger, Polaroid swinger.  It's an audio daily double.  It gives it away with the word Polaroid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  It's not hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much did the swinger cost?  Remember swing it up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very good.  John C. Dvorak for the win.  Very, very good.  It was the, according to a PC world, the 43rd greatest gadget of the last 50 years, the  Polaroid swinger in 1965.  It's kind of sad.  I mean, I think Polaroid was a great name at one point, 21,000 employees.  They're down now to 150.  They will phase out the, they phase out the Polaroid.  They'll phase out the cameras last year.  They'll phase out the film next year.  And then I understand they're going to make a bid for Yahoo at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the, I'm taking bets that somebody's going to pick up the patents for the film because  there's too many of those old cameras out there left that people want to buy film for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't, don't a pro photographers still a lot of times use a Polaroid back to test the setup?  Yeah.  What are they going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, the more and more of them are using a digital, just using the digital.  They have a, they have a monitor and then they shoot the picture and then they look  in the, as a big picture, big monitor, not just a little back of the camera.  Yeah.  And that's what they're using.  Oh, you're right.  The Polaroid thing is dead.  You're right.  I was just trying to save them.  But that wasn't sustaining the company anyway.  It was, you know, these gimmicky little cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rebrands of knockoff.  I just remember seeing Polaroids putting up on DVD players and VHS players and stuff a  while ago and just being like, oh, that's a bad sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's because they went, well, that's because they actually, they, the company, I think  went into chapter 11 and half of them was bought out and went this way and that way.  And then they started licensing the name Polaroid so you could buy a license to use the name  on a camera and it wasn't a Polaroid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There, but for the grace of God.  Now I can really say this there, but for the grace of God goes Kodak.  I mean, it's kind of impressive how Kodak saved, turned on a dime and became a digital  company.  And Polaroid just couldn't do it.  Yeah, they got lucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, I think they're still fighting it because, you know, there's still the old timers  at the place.  If you talk to them, I meet with Kodak quite a bit and they're always, you know, there's  still a bunch of guys there that still, you know, film, you know, still looking.  Film is king.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but that'll still serve a niche market.  I mean, it, film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Same people buy vinyl albums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's still going to be around.  It's legacy.  It's here.  It's here to stay.  It's just the, you know, how much is it worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Kodak went to when they, I think what saved him is that they got into the sensor business  really fast.  And I think their cheap little cameras are probably as good as anybody's.  Their point shoots are very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're not bad at all.  And they have a brand name.  And, you know, I think they, they bought Ophoto, remember?  I mean, so they immediately had an online developing and presence.  And I think they kind of got it.  They were a company, a lot of people thought that they're gone, their history.  Well, they're still struggling.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not all over, but.  Let's see here.  Comscore says 10 billion videos viewed online in the month of December.  Massive growth.  Geez.  10 billion videos.  I was a fraction of that.  That's over a hundred percent growth over last year, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not ridiculous.  That's reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's ridiculous reality.  It's amazing.  No, it's not ridiculous.  No, it's ridiculous.  So there's 10 billion views of of cats playing the piano.  Give me a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, come on.  It's more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We just played three YouTube videos in this show alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's this is it's big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's bigger than how many how many videos do they say during the during the month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ten billion Google sites, which I mostly is YouTube, but I guess Google video accounts had three billion views.  32 percent market share.  Fox Interactive Media, aka MySpace, 358 million, one tenth the number.  I mean, YouTube is totally dominant.  Yahoo, third place, with 340 million.  Viacom, which I guess I don't know what Nick at night MTV 237000.  HBO.  No, is it Viacom HBO?  Viacom's Nick and MTV HBO now.  Comedy Central.  That's what it is.  It's comedy.  Botherload.  Yep.  Bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Rever, I don't know if you guys caught this, but Rever is on the on the block.  Really?  Yeah.  And whoever is going to buy it, it's going to incur a million in debt right up front.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm assuming someone buys it.  That's the problem with these is the bandwidth consumption has got to be, you know, through the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, for independent publishing.  There's a case of managing bandwidth consumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but look at I mean, how much.  OK, 10.  What was it?  Three billion videos viewed on YouTube this month.  How much bandwidth is that?  And how much revenue do they get from advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it may not for somebody for somebody like YouTube, which is Google, who is essentially, you know,  essentially is appearing ISP, right?  They they they have ways of managing their bandwidth.  Right.  You know, it's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I explain how that works, explain how that works as a peer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, traditionally, right?  The bad, you know, the major backbone is the big ISP, whatever you want to call the Internet service providers.  You know, they kind of meet it up somewhere like Equinix, for example,  and they exchange packets going to other parts of the Internet.  And they do that free at that level just because it's otherwise they're sucking too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, for instance, if you're AOL, I think this is one of the reasons AOL provides us with so much bandwidth.  I mean, they give us a terabyte a day.  Right.  At least.  Well, if you're using everybody, all your customers are using everybody's bandwidth.  Boom, boom, boom.  The only way you can kind of even that out is by having other people draw bandwidth from you.  Well, I don't know.  That's a peering relationship.  So you'd make with the level one, you'd make a peering deal that you say, look, we won't charge you for your bandwidth.  If you don't charge us for our bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's essentially what's going on.  I mean, once you once you get to a certain size, everybody kind of swaps packets for free.  Right.  And, you know, if I'm getting that wrong, by all means, you know, I think that's right.  I think that's right.  I think that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's what Jay Adelson told us when back when he was still at Equinix.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Equinix was founded to foster basically free and equal places with gigantic amounts of bandwidth and connectivity to allow those exchanges to take place between, you know, huge ISPs and backbones and all that good stuff.  Thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I couldn't do Twitter.  If it weren't for these deals, because if AOL and Cashfly didn't give us the bandwidth, it'd be 30 or 40,000 a month.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A non-trivial expenditure.  Yes.  I mean, the donations are good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't get me wrong.  And let's not forget the great support we get from folks like, let's say, I don't know, audible.com.  Nice segue.  I do want to thank audible.com.  Their support really does make a big difference.  We really appreciate having them on all the shows on the network, including this one.  Audible podcast.  They have a new URL.  Make a note of this.  Our URL has changed.  Please listen closely.  Audible podcast.com slash twit.  Audible podcast.com slash twit.  And why do you go there?  Because if you go there, you could sign up for Audible and get a coupon, a credit toward a book.  Now, they have a lot of choices.  And that's the thing about Audible.  Sometimes you go there and you go, wow, what do I listen to next?  And one of the things I've really noticed with Audible users is whenever we get together, we get a lot of people that are going to be listening to us.  And we get together very common.  Every time I meet somebody, when we were in Egypt, Steve Levine, who runs the Levanger catalog, the catalog for readers, audible listeners.  So we were going, well, what do you like?  What did you listen to?  It's inevitable.  Whenever I see friends who are audible fans, they say, well, what's good?  And we're always looking for books.  So that's one of the reasons that we do recommend titles on the shows here.  Do you guys, Chris, I've never asked you, do you ever listen to audiobooks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I listened to one last week.  The author was, well, he had a pseudonym, pen name, but I believe his real name was Theodore Geisel.  Geisel.  Oh, yeah.  I wrote a book called The Cat in the Hat.  Love that.  Yeah, it was compelling.  It's a very short audiobook.  How did it end?  Well, it took me a couple of weeks to get through it.  But once I got into it, I really couldn't put it down.  That's why, yeah, it didn't end very well.  But then at the end, there was like this twist.  It was pretty exciting, wasn't it?  Very Deus ex machina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Roller coaster ride there.  Yeah.  Poor Dick and Sally.  Oh, man.  You had to feel for them.  I did.  I really did.  And the fish.  I mean, come on.  Let's listen to a little bit of The Cat in the Hat.  This is what makes it.  Something went bump.  So exciting.  How that bump made us jump.  We looked.  This is Chris's pick for the audiobook of the week.  And we saw Kelsey Grammer reading The Cat in the Hat.  Yes, it's Dr. Seuss, ladies and gentlemen.  Actually, I don't recommend using your coupon for this because it's only two dollars.  But you could if you wanted to.  They actually have a lot of kids.  Chris, remind me, did you just have a baby?  Who had a baby here?  I didn't have a baby.  I had a baby.  Patrick, you had a baby.  Now, you probably your Seamus is four months, so you're probably not reading a lot to him yet.  Or are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, we're reading a lot to him.  Sarah's been working through The Hobbit and then she's going to start in Lord of the Rings.  And I've been reading a lot of Raymond Chandler and some other of my personal favorites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I find the one year olds really like the noir genre myself.  He loves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's a big fan of Black Flag, too, which I think has just been a real treat for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the Flogging Mollies, I'm sure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he gets his bouncing going.  You should see him go in a bouncy seat, man.  It's awe-inspiring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got into Vonnegut right around the age of two.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Vonnegut is for the younger set, frankly.  I've always thought of him as a juvenile, as a children's author.  Anyway, as Seamus gets a little bit older, there are a lot of great kids books.  Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.  Wonderful.  In fact, Prince Caspian is coming out as a movie.  You should read it first, really.  Don't go see the movie without reading the book.  That's available and audible, too.  In fact, I'm going to make that my pick.  Those C.S. Lewis novels are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always like The Magician's Nephew out of the whole Chronicle series.  Really?  That's your favorite?  Yeah, my favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Always was.  Which one is that?  Is that the fourth one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't remember where it fits in the series, but essentially it's kind of like the prequel  book that explains how Narya was created.  See, I have to read that one.  That was fantastic.  I loved that book.  They have them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Magician's Nephew.  Let me see who that's read by.  Oh, this is neat.  It's dramatized on here.  The publisher is focused on the family.  That makes sense.  So, if you are interested in audiobooks, whether for grownups, they've got Raymond Chandler,  they've got all the great stuff, 45,000 plus titles, audiblepodcast.com slash twit.  We thank them for their support.  It's so much, I really love.  You know what?  You're going to mock me.  But one of the best things I ever read on Audible is also from C.S. Lewis.  It's something, you know, he was a Christian.  It came to it later in life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That on Audible or you listen to it on Audible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I say read, but to me it's like reading.  But John Cleese reads the screw tape letters.  You probably know the screw tape letters.  Yes.  Wonderful.  And I have to say, I am far from religious, but I just love it.  What it is, is it's a series of letters from the devil to his nephew, Wormwood, and telling him how to tempt humans,  how to get humans to really screw up.  And it's wonderful.  And if John Cleese makes it just come alive, the screw tape, actually I'm going to make that my recommendation.  Thanks for reminding me.  That's such a good book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like something, like a Nixon autobiography, the screw tape.  Doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me play it.  You just got to listen to a little John Cleese is the devil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And withdrawing his attention from the stream of immediate sense experiences.  Your business is to fix his attention on the stream.  Teach him to call it real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You would like this, Patrick.  It has your kind of wicked sense of humor.  Evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Evil.  Anyway.  Did you ever hear Cleese's eulogy for Graham Chapman's funeral?  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where could we get that?  Well, on YouTube, but it was both sad and hilarious at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it was amazing, amazing, breathtaking.  Yeah, I guarantee it's on YouTube or it's out on the internet.  It sure is.  I just found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I am such a John Cleese fan.  I interviewed him many moons ago when A Fish Called Wanda came out.  Spent an hour with him.  And I'll never forget it because at the beginning I started asking questions about comedy.  He said, look, I could tell you how comedy works.  I could tell you all in great detail the mechanics underlying it.  But you don't want me to do that, do you?  And I said, yes, I do.  And we spent an hour.  And this man had clearly made a study, you know, like a scholarly study of what makes people laugh.  And he communicated it so beautifully.  I wish I could get it on tape.  Of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but there's I think A&E is coming out with a special on the history of jokes.  And I just caught a commercial for that the other day, but I can't remember now.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, while you're on the topic of jokes, people should go catch the Gilbert Gottfried dirty joke session that's on HBO.  Is this like the aristocrats?  Well, the aristocrats is the joke he finishes with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the one that's that's a movie about one joke that he's on.  The joke is in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's basically just an exposition of just about every crappy, but is it him all the way through?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are there other comics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, just him doing a whole set, one hour set of dirty jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't listen to Gilbert Gottfried for more than a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's actually pretty funny here because he goes into other voices.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he's always like really intense and I can't damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He actually does a Seinfeld that is quite amazing.  And he does a very good Bill Cosby, which is really funny when he tells a dirty joke in that voice.  Is that HBO?  It's on HBO.  It's been playing for the last month or so on and off.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pirate Bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you torrent dot com.  You torrent.  You torrent dot com.  I mean, I'm sorry.  No, I don't mean to.  You know, I'm not encouraging piracy or anything.  I use it for Linux distros.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I use BitTorrent 2 for as well.  So what do you go to download and you download it?  Oh, that's right.  And you search.  I've seen this in action.  I don't have it.  What you torrent?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why are you torn is a great new search site that is amazing.  It's not a site, though.  It's a program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you hit it from what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From what?  From the old time torrent comparison search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not you torrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not the not mute torrent.  Why you why you torrent dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like does it run in a browser or how does it work?  It's a web search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't you hear about that?  What's that?  This is an FBI site.  Is it really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they did an excellent job.  You know, wait a minute, guys in their tracks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you who knows?  It could be.  They've done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd like to apologize to everyone at you torrent, assuming it's not.  Didn't if do that.  Didn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If it was, it could be a Kafka esque kind of thing you did.  So what's the name of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's that name of that?  Godfrey?  Well, let's see.  I'll do Godfrey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just Gilbert Godfrey's dirty jokes.  Dirty jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, most people don't go out of their way to not only record themselves.  Oh, yeah.  Look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's only three hundred forty nine megabytes.  Not bad.  Yeah, that's easy to get.  Or should I get the I'll get the HD version.  Well, now here's a question for you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a question.  I I've got Comcast.  I've got a subscription.  I pay for HBO Cinemax, the whole kit and caboodle minus the sports package.  Why am I not justified in watching the content that I've already paid for in another way?  Why?  Why would someone not be just in that in that medium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but wait a minute.  Is it the medium or is the content?  Well, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrick is giving you the line that HBO would give you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm giving him the line the cable company would give him.  I'm not even getting up to HBO at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then but I agree with you, Chris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You paid for you know, you own the content because you paid for it.  It's no different than you Tivo.  I don't own the content.  I don't own the content.  No, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've purchased the right to watch that content distributed through their system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I can DVR it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, on their VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  They don't really like it.  So then the Tivo or Slingbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you need to grab a lawyer and have the lawyer read through the terms of agreement

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and see what they've agreed to.  Well, at some point, the cable companies are just going to well, they're not going to disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the cable company and these content providers are just going to find themselves in the same  position in the music industry has found itself.  And guess what?  That's why they hit stuff like this.  No, no, but I was on a panel with the scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I was on a panel with the president of the cable television company.  And the guy that basically runs NBC interactive.  I mean, talk about feeling like you brought a penknife to a gunfight.  But one of the things that they're saying is certainly NBC is going that is has basically  looked at what happened to the music industry and decided that they are not going to go  out that way.  So, you know, they're working at Hulu.  They're working in other distribution and sales mechanisms.  And they're specifically looking for ways to deliver high quality content.  I sound like such a great guy.  Patrick, you're such a tool.  You're a tool.  Such a tool.  I'm a tool of the man.  But I mean, it's interesting to watch them look around.  It's interesting to watch them look around and go, OK, obviously, this didn't work so  well for the big record companies who are now after, you know, a long drawn out nasty  fight with their users starting to give away the stuff for free anyway, or at least, you  know, sell the stuff unprotected.  Now, not every not all of the maybe not everybody makes videos.  But I think the, you know, and the movie studios are going to be interesting to watch, but  certainly the television networks are approaching this with a much more open mind.  They have to.  Well, but they look at the look at NBC did with Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, what they did was they pulled it off YouTube, where it was widely where I think  was a great PR venue for them.  And they put up Hulu, which nobody's going to use.  Well, I would say that Hulu is OK.  But I think it's a great thing.  Well, I would say that Hulu is OK.  But I mean, it's no, it's good.  But you have to sit in front of your computer to do it.  And I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, then look at where Apple TV is going.  I mean, yeah, but that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  NBC, not just YouTube, NBC, pulled it off iTunes and they said, no, you have to watch  it on Hulu.  Well, I'm sorry, dudes.  That's I'm not gonna.  And the thing they have to remember is there's always the alternative to download it illegally  in high def.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it would be what you're doing right now.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to actually tell you the truth.  I never do torrents because you can torrents are not impersonal.  It's easy.  It's trivial to figure out who downloaded what a torrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if you what if you go through a Tor network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you'd have to go through a Tor network and you get it at one K per second later.  Yeah, no, you can't.  I would never do a torrent from anywhere where I'm attached to that IP address because that's  basically public downloading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, why don't you do what I do, Leo?  What's that?  I go to people's houses asking if I can use a computer for a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I talked to somebody who said every time I come to Canada, I download movies because  A, I'm in a hotel, B, I'm in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So wait, wait, Devorak, are you saying you're pulling a rain man knocking on the door and  saying Wapner is on Wapner?  I watch Wapner.  Time for Wapner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Download Wapner.  Definitely Wapner.  Definitely Wapner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's not what I'm saying.  But it's slightly amusing.  No, but you could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's one reason not to have, by the way, an open Wi-Fi access point because that's  exactly what I would do if I were to steal movies is do it from somebody's open access  point.  And by the way, that's why I keep an open access point so that when they do knock on  the door, I'll say, well, it wasn't me.  It was that guy.  It was Dane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then they look at the what's on your Mac address on your Ethernet card and they go,  yeah, it was that guy, Lepore.  That was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can spoof the Mac address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, is he spoofing the Mac address?  Are you spoofing the Mac address?  Yeah.  I don't download movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't care.  I watch enough TV.  I mean, there's not enough hours in the day to be watching movies all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I tell you what?  I just bought one of the new iPod Touch, the 32 gig, because finally it's big enough to  put some video on it.  And what did I do?  I went to iTunes and I bought like five shows, five season series.  I buy that stuff if I can.  If I can, I buy it.  HPO is notorious, though, for not offering their stuff.  Eventually they'll put it on DVD.  I think HPO is really missing the boat by not offering it on places like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they get their stuff because the wire is on DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm saying they do it on DVD, but that's a year later or two years later.  I want to watch Rome now.  I can't because it's not yet out on DVD.  I really wish they would speed it up.  Yeah, and I think that's a mistake.  It's on from Cincinnati.  No, it is totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the last season, the fourth season of Rescue Me, it would be nice to have all  of this stuff out much faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm still on the fifth season of West Wing.  I'm like five years behind West Wing.  I love that show.  But you know, when Aaron Sorkin, I didn't realize, but Aaron Sorkin left after the fourth season  and the show really became pedestrian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, then he went over to do that show about the backstage studio 60.  Loved that show.  Yeah, I liked it too, but it dropped dead.  You know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the only people I know who liked it were in television.  Yeah, it's inside baseball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Totally.  It's like Sports Night.  Same thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sports Night is so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know if it was funny for anybody.  I loved it.  In television.  Right.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you've worked in TV, you go, I recognize that guy.  Well, that's why I like the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, if you're going to make one of those shows work, they have to be like a kind of  over the top and not even close to being honest, like that show 30 Rock or whatever it is,  Tina Fey.  Rock is funny.  It's a funny show, but it has nothing to do with reality.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's actually, come on, there's moments that are absolutely has to do with reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, from the from the first few minutes of the first episode, there's a lot of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a couple of items that are okay in that regard, but it's not like that other  show, which was like the real thing.  It almost felt like you're in the back rooms.  Yeah, but it doesn't have to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, because 30 Rocks.  That's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll be honest, though, when I watch Sorkin's stuff, whether it's West Wing or Sports Night  or Studio 60, I feel so stupid.  Those guys talk so fast and everything they say is, you know, perfect and brilliant.  That's why I like Howard Hawks film.  Yeah, it's like a Howard Hawks film.  Exactly.  Robot chicken is much more my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel I feel smart watching that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So talking about what's on your computer.  Here's an interesting story.  Sebastian Boucher crossing the U.S.-Canadian border.  Agents said, we'd like to see what's on your laptop.  This is happening more and more, by the way.  Yeah.  They saw some titles of video files that really caught their eye.  I'm not going to read them because they're so evil.  But they said this is child porn.  They're encrypted.  And now he cooperated right up to the point where they said we want the password.  Then he said no.  And now here's the interesting issue.  Some think this would violate his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.  It's actually they're going to go to court.  The EFF is involved defending him.  A federal magistrate has ruled that forcing Boucher to surrender the password would be unconstitutional.  He's protected by the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think?  That's the law.  And that's absolutely right.  It's unconstitutional.  It's unconscionable.  Well, we don't know what he was transporting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't know.  The least offensive one is preteen bondage.  But there's worse.  But that's just titles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He even said I download porn on the internet.  Occasionally I accidentally get, and this happens to everybody, I accidentally get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is this again?  It happens to everybody?  Dane, could you mark this point on the video?  Preteen bondage by accident.  It happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you accidentally download something.  He says as soon as I see what it is, I delete it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was by Theodore Giesel, also a pseudonym of Occupy Cigars, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, okay, let's stop the story right here and say, yeah, it probably is true in the United States, but going into like, there's some laws like I think England and some other places that you by law have to give up the password.  That's right. In England you do.  Now, I'm not encouraging people to be storing crap on their computers, but there may be some sensitive information that people want to save.  You know, it could be documents, personal things.  Two girls in a cup.  The latest version of Drive Crypt, and I think there's some other encryption programs that do this, have multiple step encryption systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  TrueCrypt is so cool.  TrueCrypt now, by the way, TrueCrypt 5 now available for Mac and Windows and Linux.  And one of the things it does is it makes it, they call it, what do they call it?  A plausible deniability.  It doesn't even look like a file.  It looks like random data on there.  So even if the law looks at your laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, this is true with Drive Crypt, but the cool thing I was going to mention here is that if you're forced to give a password, you give a password and it unencrypts something else, making it look as though you've unencrypted.  And you can just have like, you know, a picture of your, you know, Aunt Mary or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. Two girls in a cup.  That's all it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Easy there, Luke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never watched that video.  I gotta say it right now.  Two girls in a cup?  Don't ask.  In a 2002 case, the FBI, now remember, Patrick, when we talked to the Secret Service, because that's one of the things we asked them.  And they said, you know, usually we just ask the guys for the password and they just give it to us.  Right.  They're like in a state where they go, yeah, whatever, here.  That's crazy.  Or they'll build a case using keystroke loggers.  So they'll get up, they'll get it.  You have to, in that case, you have to get a warrant and so forth, but they'll put a keystroke logger on there.  In fact, that's what happened in 2002.  The FBI used it to obtain gambling records.  They used a keystroke logger from a mob boss with a mob boss.  In another case, though, an officer, here's this is from the Globe and Mail.  An officer found child porn on the laptop of a man who flew into LAX from the Philippines.  A federal judge later suppressed the evidence saying electronic storage devices are extensions of the human memory and should not be open to inspection without cause.  That wasn't a password.  That was just you shouldn't be looking at the laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Increasingly, though, we're hearing stories of in many countries, confiscation of laptops, confiscation of all kinds of electronics.  I think it was the FBI confiscated a woman's corporate laptop and she never got it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, here's an interesting side topic to this problem.  There's a more one of the biggest trends in computing today is people using their laptop as their only computer.  Right.  And they take it to work.  They take it home.  That's all they use.  They don't.  I mean, I see as a pod show.  Adam Curry is one of these people and they have this one machine and they use it for everything.  If this thing is confiscated, which is possible, then I don't think most of these people back up properly.  Stolen or lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  Happens all the time.  Just lost your whole life.  I got an answer for that.  Jungle Disc.  I've been using that lately.  I love Jungle Disc.  That's that uses Amazon's S3 storage and you run this thing and it backs it up to Amazon.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Jungle Disc, you know, the Crypt, Mozi, Time Machine.  Mozi's great.  Carbonite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's the best one, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think it's a toss up between Carbonite or Mozi.  Carbonite's super simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love, I use Carbonite and they're an advertiser on the radio show.  Disclaimer.  But it's really nice.  Yeah, you right click a folder and it just does it.  And I have four.  That's actually how I back up the podcast tracks after we record.  The machine continues to back up.  I have a NAS here.  I have a local backup.  But I also want an online backup in case, you know.  The house burns down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now that's the reason you want it.  I tell people this, you know, that you've got to have something out of the house because yeah, you can have your whole machine backed up on the little disc, right?  Sitting next to the computer.  But then the house burns down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at, John, you should look at Jungle Disc.  It's very cool.  Jungle Disc.com.  Partly because S3 is cheap.  You know, the thing about Carbonite and Mozi, it's 50 bucks unlimited.  Jungle Disc you pay as you go because it uses Amazon's S3.  So it's 20 bucks for Jungle Disc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sets up basically a web dev server so that in a lot of cases the unlimited accounts actually limit the amount you can upload on a particular day.  Oh, really?  Oh, I didn't know that.  That's interesting.  That's something to be aware of.  You know, if you have like hundreds and hundreds of gigabytes of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jungle Disc is pretty amazing, you know, because it uses S3.  I trust Amazon.  Amazon's very cheap.  I think it's a what is it?  It's nothing.  It's a few cents, 15 cents a gigabyte storage.  15 cents?  15 cents a gigabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For what, a month, a week, a day?  A month.  Every time you do, 15 cents a month?  Yeah.  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a deal.  Look into Crash Plan.  It's been a while since I looked at it, but they seem to be pretty competitive too.  Cross platform, online backup, local backup.  You could use your local network to backup machines or define a remote machine as a backup.  See, that's the negative of all of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The real problem is the speed of the internet.  So if you're using a LAN, that would be a better...  Upload speed of your network.  Right, right, right.  Crashplan.com.  Cool.  Yeah, it's still around.  WinMac and Linux.  Free trial.  I'll have to take a look at that.  Well, we're going to wrap it up, unless anybody has anything salient and critical to say.  Chris, where are we going to see more of you?  Is it live.parillo.com?  Is that where we go these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been doing it for about a year now.  Number 73, most subscribed on YouTube with the videos we record with the community.  Really?  Yep.  Wow.  I've been doing about five videos a day.  I break up the segments, so if someone's searching, they can find what they're looking for and find the rest of the community.  I get about 20,000 to 30,000 unique viewers a day on the live video stream.  And it's really cool.  I mean, it's engaging the community in ways that I couldn't do before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the streaming things, you use Ustream, right?  Yep, ustream.tv.  And Yahoo just launched this live.yahoo.com, which I've been playing with.  It's pretty cool.  There's Stickum.  Now, you know what?  I know you crashed it, but I used it today on the radio show.  We got about 400 people, worked fine.  Every once in a while it drops off and you have to press send again.  But I think it's a very, I think obviously Yahoo's not up to speed yet.  It took Ustream a long time, took Stickum a while.  You know, it takes a little while to figure out how to handle all that bandwidth.  But I think the fact that these are free and allow you to do this is pretty amazing.  I love it.  And you store them, so you store them and then put them on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pretty much we use the live video feed to record the video segments we want.  And of course I encourage anybody to take a screen capture or a clip and upload it to their own accounts anywhere.  I don't care.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course not.  Why would you?  You know what I like about live is it has that Stickum thing where people who are chatting with you can also put their video.  And I think that whole interface is kind of interesting.  We're going to play with this because I'm running the downstairs.  We're going to start playing with the idea of doing something similar to what you're doing.  I think it's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Live.Pirillo.com.  Place to go.  Something like that.  I believe I'm correct.  But you know, just if you search for Chris, you'll find them everywhere.  Now Patrick's still doing Tekzilla.  Don't forget Tekzilla.  And System.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Oh, that's neat.  That's really neat.  Tekzilla.com.  And if somebody wants to be your cohost, should I just show up or do you want me to call ahead?  Email Roger at gmail.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can email me directly.  It'll be Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I emailed Kevin, but he never calls.  He never writes.  He's too much of a big shot now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think he's just getting too much email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He never even says, I see they're doing Dignation in St. Louis.  What's that all about?  I can't remember.  This is what we always want to do, do the show on the road.  They did a show in England.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huge.  And about 42 zillion people showed up for that one.  So I think they're just having fun with it.  Well, you remember when you and I went to St. Louis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that is a great market.  It was a great market for Tech TV.  We got a ton of people.  Absolutely.  We signed.  We were in the parking lot of the CompUSA and we signed and we signed.  I think that we were scheduled to be there for two hours.  We were there almost six.  We were there six because the line kept going and we kept signing.  Pretty soon the guys who rented the tent, the equipment, the speakers came.  They took it.  They packed it.  We kept signing.  It was just two guys on a fold up chair and a table in the parking lot of CompUSA and  they still keep coming.  It was great.  I loved that.  That was fun.  If you go to revision3.com, you can see Patrick cut off his pinky.  Actually, that looks painful.  I didn't realize I cut off my pinky.  Did you see that picture?  It's you and a big cable chopper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's a cable crimper.
