End time: 322.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's talk because this of course is the week it's funny usually when Apple announces a new phone  It seems to be bigger a bigger news story than it was some somewhat  I think there's plenty of innovation in this new iPhone effect more than I would expect for a s  Model phone, but I think at some point we've just gotten to kind of a maturity in this  Sector where it's hard to get people all hot and bothered about I think they are also holding back

Start time: 326.00
End time: 353.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So let's just you know quickly mention what they announced this week. I'm sure you all know  We did our live coverage on the Tuesday. There's two new iPhones is the 5c as  We posited last week. I think the C is for kids. It's for younger people  It's colorful. It is essentially the old iPhone 5 with a little bit more battery and  A colorful plastic back. It's what did they call it unapologetically plastic, which is a nice way to say

Start time: 354.30
End time: 359.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're not apologizing. It's plastic. It sounds it sounds much more elegant when you say it with Johnny Ives English

Start time: 360.64
End time: 386.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unapologetically plastic it is what it is. It is what it wants to be  Plastic and then they added the Crocs case around it, which is kind of plastic on plastic  Obviously realizing that they were missing the boat with all the accessory sales that  Apple should probably have a high profit margin  You know nickel case that they could sell for 30 bucks weird though, because if you look at the pictures the holes are not well

Start time: 387.64
End time: 398.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Situated I got I have to agree with you. I think the the holes are I I think Apple's case design  For the iPhone 5c is how not to make a cover

Start time: 399.18
End time: 413.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's a nice rubber cover and the idea is you could do it contrasting  So you could have a yellow phone with a green back or you know  but if you look closely if you zoom in you can see that the word iPhone appears partially through one of the holes as

Start time: 414.84
End time: 432.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Non hun what look we're nitpicking here  I mean if for those of you who don't think that the the cases for the iPhone 5c are gonna sell I have two words  For you iPod socks. Yeah, did those sell? Yeah, absolutely  If it's from Apple people love to get there

Start time: 433.28
End time: 451.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and if you know, you know, they know what what happens which is when you're in the store you buy the phone and  Verizon knows this is sprinting everybody else too. And you're gonna buy a case  You just gonna you may not be the case you end up with but you just buy that whatever the cases that's there  And so hey, that's 30 bucks like that and then it can't be a high, you know high-expense item to make it's made out

Start time: 451.80
End time: 457.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Rubber yeah, I mean if you can't be with the one you love love the one you're with right of the Crocs you're with

Start time: 458.88
End time: 473.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So not much to say about that. The biggest surprise with the iPhone 5c is this pricey?  I think a lot of people thought and expected and hoped and even the stock market may be  Demanded that this be the cheap iPhone C does not stand for cheap. Yes, that's what C was for

Start time: 473.74
End time: 477.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 487.94
End time: 513.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is only a hundred dollars less than the big boy 5s  And I think that's why I really think it's aimed at people under 25 who don't really care about the features of the 5s  They're probably not even that aware and there and hey, it's a hundred bucks. But more importantly, it's pink  To me, I think that's really the market for that right am I wrong? I showed it to my daughter 21  She was much more interest in the color. Yeah, that was that's the selling point

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 554.68
End time: 573.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But but I do think that that's I just read the fact from Apple's point of view  This is a much higher margin product they could they could have charged as as the market and Ming-cho Lee wanted  They could have charged 350 or 400 for this, but they don't they charge only a hundred bucks less  But I've got to think their margin is very good on this because it's much easier to make I have to admit

Start time: 573.86
End time: 605.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was on that bandwagon too  I thought this was going to be less expensive iPhone than what we'd seen previously but  Understanding what they did which was pulling the old five out of circulation altogether instead of making it last year's model that they would sell  A hundred dollars cheaper, you know, they're introducing an entirely new model and they are making some improvements. It's got better battery life  It's got right that better FaceTime camera that a lot of the kids use for selfies nowadays  You know, so  You know, it's see is for selfie see us for selfie. You just want to have everything misspelled. I

Start time: 607.94
End time: 624.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do think this is gonna appeal to younger people that's that's really what they say together and and of course in hindsight  It's obvious Apple never has chased the bottom of the market  So why should they do it now?  They're content to be not the biggest but the most profitable

The flagship is the 5s which comes in three colors  Space gray, which looks awful. I like the black iPhone to me  White which looks exactly like the white iPhone 5 and then then this thing you got that's a case  But this is space. Well now is how do you pull that thing apart? It's hard to get it open here  Okay  So is this the same as space gray or because this is the old iPhone 5 black  Where's the note that it's a lighter. It's a lighter black, right?

There's a blue flash and a yellow flash  so you've got a cooler color and a hotter color and the the camera apparently will take two pictures first to sense the color  balance of the room the white balance of the room and then adjust the  flashes  Adjust the flashes which is something this camera is not doing although it has a xenon flash, which is nice  It will just the flashes into one of a thousand different colors to best match the color temperature there.

Transcript:  Okay, I'll get to this I'll get to this  I'm trying to be organized. I'm never organized. I'm just trying this one time to be organized. So  All right, well, we'll do the line you can order and have been able to order since the 13th the 5c  No problem on the 20th. It'll arrive as it usually does by FedEx. That's what Apple's been doing the last few years  Unaccountably they are not allowing pre-order on the 5s  and  If anybody has an idea of why this could be except to make a line your artificial line  Did I what did I say on this show your print sense Apple is saying that we want to train you

Start time: 974.52

Start time: 978.44
End time: 981.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 982.32
End time: 1050.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Get back here. Tell me about this is this is where Apple wants to turn things into barter town from  From from from Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and there's gonna be blood sports outside each of the Apple stores  People are gonna have to fight the earth to get their iPhone 5s PR people get trampled for a 5s  Well, you know, it's interesting because you can actually or you will be able to starting  September 17th if you want to pre-order your phone you can you just have to live or be in China  You mean they can pre-order but we can't that's absolutely true if you check Apple's Chinese websites  They said they tell you September 17th and in Hong Kong and in mainland China. You'll be able to pre-order  And they are encouraging people to buy them directly from the Apple stores  I forget what the phrase was but it was clear that they're making a play for  Direct sales of iPhones, which is very consistent with what we've heard  Tim Cook wants to do which is drive more traffic to  Apple stores for the for the phones instead of letting you know all the  Cell phone stores and big box retailers grab the lion's share of those sales

Start time: 1051.20
End time: 1056.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because we're gonna buy a plastic case a colorful case. So which makes them another ten dollars

Start time: 1056.70
End time: 1085.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so they're either going to you know, because they want the foot traffic so they can make more money or  They want a line out front because it's good to get on the six o'clock news  None of this is to or maybe I don't know why this would help because there's a shortage of fingerprint readers  They can't make enough them check this out  But it sure seems to me like Apple is  Disadvantaging its customers in you know, really kind of I mean people would want it on the first day in the past  We've able to pre-order it. I don't understand so lines. I told you this earlier wrong for a company to do that

Start time: 1086.32
End time: 1107.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But who says that they were manufacturing?  enough capacity to to you know to  To be able to support massive pre-orders on these devices. This is brand new technology guys  There's a 64-bit chip inside there. There's the touch ID fingerprint sensor  You know, it looks the same as the five as the five does but it's entirely new under under the hood

Start time: 1107.90
End time: 1113.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I understand but why does I mean the five is entirely new and I torment the public is what you're asking

Start time: 1113.54

Start time: 1119.34
End time: 1126.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 1136.88
End time: 1155.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I said if pastors prologue my bet is that the iPhone or that the Apple stores themselves are going to get the lion's share  At the inventory and that everybody else is gonna have to make do with whatever they get and they're gonna be shortages  If you go to a Verizon store or an AT&T store on Friday, you'll likely you know, unless you're you're one of the first people  They're probably gonna be turned away

Start time: 1156.74
End time: 1165.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 1175.98
End time: 1195.40

I don't know if that's true. That's your thing  Including the issue that you cannot use the fingerprint sensor to to plead the fifth. That's a big issue  Sorry, I'll talk about that in a moment first word sounds scandalous scandalous is right carbonite comm if you have not backed up  I had a status call. Oh my god on the radio show  Rico called and he said my son lost my iPod touch and it had all my  pictures of the baby pick everything on it  And I said, oh, did you turn on iCloud? He said no  Said have you ever backed it up? No, he says there any way I can get it back. I said no  Because you didn't back it up  I it just breaks my heart if you and and the sad thing is I think everybody who watches the show  Everybody's in the audience. You guys know about backup. I don't have to tell you about backup  Everybody who's been in tech for any like the time has had a hard drive fail or is accidentally deleted a file  It's the people like Rico who just don't know who are so vulnerable  I try to get the word out tell your friends tell your family  This is a great solution for people who don't know about backup who don't want to think about it, but do need it  It's carbonite.com. Why is it great? Because it's automatic. They don't have to remember anything  In fact, I put this on my son's and my daughter's computer when they went to college on their laptops  Because they wouldn't have to think about it whenever they're connected to the internet. It's automatically backing up securely using SSL  It's affordable. It's $59.99 a year for everything on that laptop. You never have to meteor the amount of data. It just does it all  I really like it for a student because you can log into your carbonate account on any computer or the smartphone or the tablets  They have free apps and there's your data. So it's cloud storage, too  So Henry doesn't have to take his laptop to the library go to the library log in the library computer work on his paper  Come home. It's it's a really great solution for students for businesses  If you're a small business and you won't aren't backing up  You gotta have off-site backup always one low flat yearly rate for unlimited data  Mac or PC I want you to try it free two weeks  All you have to do is use our offer code twit when you decide and by the way no credit card needed for the two  Week free trial so I don't want to hear any excuses. Just go there and try it if you don't like it  No big deal. If you do, please I ask you when it says offer code that you type in twit  Because you'll get two free months 14 months for the price of 12. You've got to back it up to get it back  Please don't be Rico use carbonite carbonite comm use the offer code  Twit thank you. I apologize for interrupting. We were talking about the fingerprint  Wait, this guy lost all his photos was sad. I was actually almost in tears. He was called from Ontario, California  I was and he said but isn't there any it's no  If you if you don't have a backup, I said there might be hope if sometime you ever connect

So there was pressure on Apple to do something about it  I don't think that's the only reason they did a fingerprint  I do know police are happy about this because well for two reasons one it means the phone is authenticated properly and locked  Here's how you do it. Yeah, but and I have to  Admire Apple because they put their thumbs where their mouth is they also said you can buy stuff in the app store

I use it for authentication. These are the Motorola skips  So when my phone is on the skip, I don't have to lock it. It unlocks itself  These are all I think very valid uses of NFC now Apple has I think a competing technology this eye beacons technology  My guess that Apple has decided it owns eye beacons.

The point of this is now with the new iPhone as I get closer to this beacon using the I beacon  Technology that's built in the new iPhone it can tell how close I'm to this device and can cause things to happen  So like what well like I could put my phone next to my eye beacon and then

We will we're gonna talk a little bit right now about how to get your new iPhone 5c or 5s  How to maybe sell your old iPad or at least get a quote before the new ones come out  I think maybe we'll see some in October. I'm talking about gazelle commas  You've got gadgets gathering dust in a drawer in a in a closet in a small rental space above a gas station  John C. Dvorak then you need gazelle comm gazelles buying your old iPads your old phones  Your tablets your iPods your MacBooks they're buying surface tablets. They're buying  Nexus 7s and Kindles they're buying iPhone  fives fours  threes three G's  Here's a chance to get cash and you might be amazed. Let's say you tell you like the look you like the look of that iPhone  5s you want to sell your old iPhone? I've got an AT&T iPhone 64 gigabytes worth  $320 by the way, this is cool because if you accept this offer now normally it's locked in for 30 days  They're gonna lock it in through with the end of October  Which gives you plenty of time to get your new iPhone even if there's a shortage transfer your data over  And then mail it to gazelle. They'll pay the postage. In fact, they're gonna send you a box prepaid  So you might as well throw in the old iPad you want the new iPad?  Let's just get a quote because I don't think this iPad is gonna gain in value once the old the new iPads announced  So what do you got a 64 gig LTE 350 bucks boom throw that in the box, you know  I've got an old Microsoft surface. I think I probably don't really want this surface RT anymore  Let's just see how much that is worth. I love doing this because this stuff is like this is like cash in your pocket  I've got the power supply. I've got the touch type cover  Hmm interesting iPads worth 350 bucks surface 173. Hmm. Oh, well, hey, it's money. I'm not gonna turn it down  Gaze le calm once you get the new stuff you've transfer your data over  Throw it in the box. They pay the postage you send it to gazelle their data experts  By the way, we'll wipe it if you forget to they'll also check the quality to make sure it's as good as you said  It is and here's something nice. If it's better, they'll give you more money. They actually do that  I've heard from people many times  Then they'll either send you a check you can get a PayPal credit if you want to get it right away  If you spend a lot of money on Amazon, I'd get the Amazon gift card. It bumps it up by 5%  Isn't that nice? Find out why gazelle has sent out over a hundred million dollars to over 600,000 customers  over the last couple of years  gazelle calm lock in today's price send it in by October 31st and  You're gonna get money for your old iPhone.

Transcript:  I just read an article. Uh, and I can't poke any holes in it  If you have an android phone you do you probably notice when you get a new phone and you log into your google account  It immediately starts downloading apps and data and logs you into your wi-fi access bot and knows the password  Have you ever noticed that? Yeah, there's a check mark in the settings scobalizer if you come over my house, okay  There's a check mark in the settings that let google back up your data and settings  And it's a great convenience  I mean it's in fact one of the things I love about android you get a new phone and you're kind of up  Running but somebody's pointed out. I think quite rightly this means google knows every single wi-fi password  Probably in the world at this point  Michael Horowitz defensive computing column in computer world  Points out that a in order for this to work not only would this have to be sent up  To google and stored on their servers. It would have to be unencrypted  To be sent back to you and to have it work  google  According to google there are 748 million  phones out there  most of them android phones and tablets and probably most of them set to automatically back up your data  And now i'm not worried about google knowing every wi-fi password in the world, but of course google is um, and has been subpoenaed

There's  That's a guy made phil zimmerman does it he's got navy seals working for him which makes it all the more secure. I'm sure  Yeah, of course, they've got out of the email business because they realized they couldn't secure email. So  So there's the silent circle option which you know remains to be seen how effective that is  There is the fourth and I think the most important option  Effective that is there is the fourth and I think the most important option  The the let's lobby our members of congress and fire some of these fire them  Do whatever we need to do to get them to stand up  and say these are the constitutional protections against uh  Illegal search and seizure and we want you to honor them. What's the next election? Now you're just talking crazy  And besides that am I wrong but that seems to me the four options that are reasonable. I've got for the last one  Yes, that's what I vote for.

Start time: 4454.68

So, uh, you know, they're introducing the technology with the 5s  They're introducing the technology for developers with core motion  Uh, they're giving them the opportunity to start building apps and we're going to see a ton of cool stuff come out for the 5s  In the coming year and you know every device that apple produces, you know with ios on it from here on out  It's going to have the m7 or some variation thereof, you know, it just seems like a real natural for people to have right?

Start time: 4495.98

Transcript:  How about 64 bit is that a marketing term? They've the apple does have pride of place  They're the first mobile platform to have a 64 bit system on a chip. They are of course using the v8 arm  Core in this but this is a the first to do it android can't do it samsung  Immediately stood up stop saying well, we'll do that but android is currently 32 bits  So you'd have to have a new android for this. What's the point? What is the point anybody?  Peter bueler

Start time: 4523.32
End time: 4637.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bueller. Well, okay  I mean first of all there's the most obvious thing that that that a lot of journalists have pointed out and that's the 64 bit  Gives you the ability to address more than four gigabytes of memory and no phone alive does that or even the ipad?  Right, we don't know what the 5s has in it  But let's assume that it's pretty similar to the iphone 5 it might have a gigabyte, you know  It's it's not that big a deal, but you don't want to put more ram in because it uses a lot of battery  That also means that 64 there there are 64 bit registers inside the thing. So it not only can it take  Uh, not only can it address more memory, but it can also take the data that it's got and process it in bigger chunks  You know people are doing more and more sophisticated  Graphics on these things game developers  programmers who are making apps that do any kind of  video recording or image recording  You know high resolution sound all this stuff has benefits under  64 gigs  Another thing that is really interesting to speculate on and this is something that renee richie at i'm more and I have talked  about on the i'm more show is  What this means for apple's processor roadmap for its desktop machines in the future does this signal some kind of convergence?  Um, you know where apple might stop using intel processors in macbook air someday, you know  renee pointed out it would be really nice to have a macbook air that ran for 24 hours on a single charge as efficient as  Those as well processors are you know arm processors can probably do a lot better  so  I think that there there are a lot of ramifications for this is  as we go out and  You know, I I don't think that it's a marketing gimmick. I think that  Um, it's it's not 64 bit for 64 bits sake  I think this is apple laying the groundwork for a lot of cool stuff that it's going to introduce on the mobile platform  in the coming years

Transcript:  That's I guess that's the reason I think it's marketing. Yes, all of that's true, but the word is years  You don't need a chip now  That can do all of that  It will help in some areas crypto, you know, you can use bigger numbers you have higher precision and graphics  Programmers probably won't rush to take advantage of that  I think maybe down the road you'll have an iphone or a mobile device with four gigs of ram  But it's or more it has to be really more than four gigs of ram  I don't think that's in the next few years apple in fact puts less ram in its compute in its mobile stuff than anybody  They're always very careful to put just the right amount of ram in  Uh the galaxy note has three gigs and that's a lot  Note three  Uh, I I just I I don't see a lot of advantage to 64 bit. Uh, it's a bigger number  It's double 32. It's twice as good

Transcript:  There's really no rush, you know what?  I think they did it because they could because the v8 was out they had an arm design that was 64 bit  And they knew it looks great. I'm as they get used to coding early  Every you know, there's no change in how you're coding it  Really? You just flip a switch in the compiler  So I don't I don't think anybody's working at such a low level that they're going to say oh I can have a 64 bit  Register, let me take advantage of that. I just don't think people work at that level. Yeah, not today  Not and and I really am skeptical at the notion that that ios may be the desktop platform of the future

And the more you can lock people into the ecosystem the better you lock them into pages numbers  Keynote your it's just more lock-in. How much did they make on these apps? They were 10 bucks  Uh, ifoto is a great app. Everybody should have that five bucks. You're gonna get that for free, too  Everything with garageband

So they may have given up some revenue there  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. And I mean, you know incrementally it's been improving year over year, you know that the  uh, the the part of apple's revenue that uh,  um is  That comprises the revenue from the stores has been growing. That's something a lot of analysts have noted  Especially over the past couple of quarters. So i'm not sure that they would want to  Um kill the goose that laid that golden egg even though it's just an incremental number  But I gotta tell you leo that would be really exciting  I mean a new mac pro with like every pro app loaded on it that would be you  that would be a  I mean, I want the new mac pro anyway, because i'm an apple guy but um  And because i've got a five-year-old mac pro that me too.

Start time: 5196.50

A lot of uh digital video people have come back to final cut after kind of putting the version 10 aside  um  You know that was a tough transition, but a lot of people are headed back to it now  So, you know anything apple can do to improve the value add the real question that i've got is what that box is going to cost  It's gonna be so expensive
