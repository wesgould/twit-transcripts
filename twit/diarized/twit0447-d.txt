Transcript:  a lot of the security experts said ever after ever since the story that RSA had accepted 10 million dollars from the NSA to  compromise  to compromise its recommendations for  Encryption so that the NSA would have back doors into what we but one would hope would be secure encryption  No, everybody's kind of turned their back on the RSA

Start time: 254.98
End time: 262.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No funny thing about that story is that it was only I mean if you're gonna sell out sort of the backbone of your company  Why would you do it for only 10 million?

Start time: 266.94
End time: 277.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thing about the interesting thing about RSA conference is that every single keynoter  Ranted and ranted about the NSA so it was kind of this ironically the place where the NSA got trashed from the stage

End time: 328.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Frankly, I don't know if Stephen Colbert is really the right guy  A lot of people said he should have turned it down, but he said I'm not that if the check clears I'm here  And of course he plays you know, I believe he's a liberal comedian playing a  Conservative commentator on the Colbert report and apparently his talk was a mixture of both. It wasn't really clear  Yeah who he was and so forth  It's really I understand the need to  Boycott it. I mean it really is appalling that they would for a mere  20 pieces of gold in a fact

Start time: 329.02
End time: 349.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think essentially you have to go look at NSA and say well played well played.

Don't don't in any way encourage them  The metreon where they were supposed to be was trying to kick them out because RSA warned the metreon  That's the that big mall next we've done stuff and typically I mean this is actually pretty common

End time: 392.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything that happens in the Moscone Center, they'll pretty much shut down any place that you can have an event anywhere near that  That's that's not specific to this that's specific to any conference that's kind of a that's part of the  Not allowing people to set up parallel conferences, which you know, I have attempted to do myself.

Transcript:  The according to the bits blog on the New York Times  There were t-shirts made for folks from the Electronic Frontier Foundation featuring the NSA logo  Except that the Eagle was using its talents to plug into the American telecom network  prominently labeled AT&T an AT&T executive who was at  RSA said there are many of us at AT&T or disturbed by what we've heard at the about the NSA  But when you see those t-shirts a conversation becomes impossible  There's nothing more to say about it I just thought I'd mention that and I was curious if anybody was here for RSA  And you know in years past  Audience jammed with people here for RSA, right? So I think that's telling I think that that really shows that they've come easy to get a seat

Start time: 443.56
End time: 446.26

Transcript:  Breaking news this afternoon from Kara Swisher at recode  Tony Bates who was joined Microsoft when Microsoft acquired Skype a couple of years ago and  Tammy Reller who's executive VP of marketing leaving the company according to numerous sources close to the situation  When Satya Nadella was picked as CEO, it's not surprising  We even speculated on Windows weekly that Tony Bates and others who were in the running might in fact leave the company

Start time: 476.08
End time: 492.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they now know where the glass ceiling is for them  I mean, you know it once that once you have a young CEO  You know that if you if your plans were to become a CEO at Microsoft  Those are those are and Tony Bates was a CEO so  But he if his path he's now at the highest point in his path, you know, so

Start time: 493.16
End time: 497.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely, and I wonder frankly about Stephen Elam and any thoughts on that far-haut

Start time: 499.46
End time: 537.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I mean I think the whole Nokia  Acquisition seems  Questionable. I mean, I think that's like the biggest  The biggest decision that you know  Nadella will have to make is what to do with the hardware strategy and I think Nokia plays a big part of that and I think  You know if they keep it around or if they keep it as a big part of it  I think that's a good thing for Stephen Elam. So I mean, you know, he could be ahead of that strategy, but  But yeah, I mean it sort of all depends on what their bigger bigger strategy is regarding hardware regarding smartphone hardware  And you know, I think that seems still up in the air

Start time: 537.38
End time: 580.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it certainly became a big question this week at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona where Nokia still not a Microsoft  Company we're waiting for regulatory approval from China, but imminently  Becoming a Microsoft company they bought the mobile it into mobile phone business from Nokia  announced new phones  Based on Android, right?  the Nokia X the Nokia X plus and the Nokia XL look just like Windows phones and  Use Windows Microsoft services Bing and OneDrive, but they are based on Android  They don't support the Play Store. Although I've seen hacks already  That allow you to add the Play Store to these phones. They have a special Nokia store

Start time: 582.54
End time: 616.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it's the same strategy great idea. I mean, it's a great idea. It's brilliant  It's the same thing as Amazon Kindle fire, right? It's Amazon  You know controls the hardware but more important they control the services  they control the stores and they understand where the money is and I think Microsoft realizes that  Operating systems are really not the future of its business  I mean they've said it over and over again its devices and services  And if they can get people to use their services instead of Google services on their devices  Then why should they care who wrote the underlying code?  That that's at the bottom of the operating system isn't there a risk though?

Start time: 617.54
End time: 626.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Far had that that this is sends a message that Microsoft is not  100% behind Windows phone that it may be even Microsoft itself will shift to Android. Oh, yeah

Start time: 627.24
End time: 688.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I think I I mean, I think that's the risk, but I don't think that's a risk  I think they shouldn't be a hundred percent behind Windows phone. I mean they Windows phone is a  very long shot game and  Sort of doing it this way kind of getting Microsoft services out to people  Through other, you know through other operating systems seems like a much smarter play  I mean, it's what it's what every other tech company does, you know, they they  recognize the  Recognize the  That Android is going to be around that iOS is going to be around and instead of sort of trying to defeat those they get  Their services on on those platforms  You know if there was office for iPad that would be wonderful for Microsoft and there will be we know that it seems like  Yeah, it seems like there will be at some point  But the fact that it's been years since we've had the iPad without office on it is you know, because Microsoft sells operating systems  And if it didn't have that strategy, you know, we would have had office faster

Start time: 689.24
End time: 697.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I also think I think that the the the Nokia phones are the credible hardware being held up by its up until now  Being held up by its office. This hasn't said cheese

Start time: 697.64
End time: 700.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd love to get one of those 1020s or those 1520s if it only ran Android

Start time: 701.10
End time: 707.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and the folks at Nokia have to be you know clamoring at we have to move on I'm gonna defend Windows phone though

Start time: 707.76
End time: 723.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean  Windows phone is a great operating system. It's slick. It's fast  It's easy to use the only negative as far as I could tell and I don't use a Windows phone for this reason is it  Just doesn't have the availability the app availability and you have for Android can then yeah

Start time: 724.68
End time: 743.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You need a great deal. I think that if you were if you were like if you're about to buy any phone for the blooming  1020 is a great thing to choose but it's not so much better that you can sacrifice the  You know all the all the apps that you're getting on the other platform, right?  It's just it's just good enough

Start time: 743.96
End time: 764.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then it has this huge shortcoming and you lock made a very big deal at the announcement that  Develop Android developers are being wooed  He said it said they can simply move their their products right over the store within hours within hours  They can now so so clearly that's their strategy now  They've got an operating system or a platform that supports hundreds of thousands of apps

Start time: 765.46
End time: 791.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is which would take forever on Windows, you know who I feel sorry for and it's fortunately  It's a small group is the Windows phone developers who are now saying well crap. I  Mean here we bet on it on this platform and Microsoft's basically throwing us to the wolves  Did actually is it Microsoft? That's the question. It's Nokia  Did Satya Nadella wink and nudge when Stephen Elop said as he must have we're gonna do this

Start time: 792.30
End time: 797.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look he's gonna bout to become a Microsoft employee he'd be crazy if he didn't talk to his overlords or his future

Start time: 797.14
End time: 808.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he's not allowed to if I'm not mistaken when an acquisition is in process  He's not allowed to go to the new owner and say what do you want me to do sir?  right, I

Start time: 809.98
End time: 818.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mean, I think I think there must be  But this is must we have been a long enough term project that they might have known about it before but

Start time: 819.10
End time: 824.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some say that was the threat that was the threat that Nokia said if you don't buy us we're gonna make an Android phone

Start time: 826.30
End time: 839.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I mean it seems like  This is a good way to play it though, right if you're Nokia and you want to keep the end if you want to  Go into Android you do it right before the acquisition. So it can't stop you

Start time: 841.22
End time: 886.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and they and there's plausible deniability  So  You can say well, I didn't know that and fire  The Nokia according to Stephen Elop at speaking at the event at Mobile World Congress  The Nokia X is a feeder system for Lumia  Lumia is the Windows phone version. It takes people to Microsoft's cloud not Google's cloud  that's one of the big problems really is Microsoft wants to be in the platform the on the cloud platform business and  Google is a direct competitor on cloud forget  Operating systems the clouds where it's all gonna happen, right?  So it gets people to Microsoft's cloud not Google's cloud says elop  We are deliberately using Android but substituting Nokia services. This is a gateway to Microsoft credible

Start time: 888.44
End time: 906.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Slightly credible. I mean there's one question right which is if you get one of these phones and you get a whole bunch of Android's app  Apps on it then like you can't then move to a Windows  Your Android actual won't work on it  But you will be a part of all the rest of Microsoft services get get them hooked on one drive the renamed sky drive get them hooked

Start time: 907.04
End time: 915.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on Bing  Get them hooked on Microsoft services  Maybe it won't be such a big transition to leave the Android apps and come to Windows phone

Start time: 915.90
End time: 940.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, but I think that the  obviously the the danger here is that  It creates so much uncertainty within the market between people buying the phone people developing for Windows people  Buying Android apps on these phones that the question is is that going to overcome any kind of advantage they were gonna get  By kind of trying to create some kind of feeder system  We should also point out Paul throughout was furious Paul throughout his stack on Twitter

Start time: 940.86
End time: 956.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he pointed out that the Lumia 520 which is Nokia's low-cost  Windows phone is pretty much the same specs the same price. In fact, it's even a little less expensive than a Nokia X  So Nokia already has this gateway drug this entry-level

Start time: 958.29
End time: 959.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's one of their best-selling phone, it's a great phone

Start time: 962.41
End time: 976.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's a huge seller worldwide. This is the phone when when you hear  Steven Elop and others say, you know Windows phone is out selling iPhone and you know market X  This is the phone they're buying in Russia and right and I mean, I think they're high-end devices aren't doing well at all

Start time: 976.20
End time: 989.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that those low-end devices are doing really well  And it's because of right all those all those countries where  You know where the low-end devices sell well and and this is sort of competing well against the cheap Android phones  so question for the panel

Start time: 992.97
End time: 1000.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Presuming China approves the Nokia acquisition in the next month or so Nokia becomes part of Microsoft  Does such in the Della kill the Nokia X Farhad?

Start time: 1003.81
End time: 1017.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't think he kills the Nokia X specifically  I think that I think that they might I  Don't know. I think that deciding what to do with with Nokia generally is it will be his first decision  But I but I don't know. I don't think he kills this project specifically is the is it gonna be kind

Start time: 1021.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Larry Magid are they're gonna kin it  No, my my sense is if they're smart

Start time: 1026.06
End time: 1068.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They will embrace it and they will really push a Windows looking UI  They will really approach Microsoft services and they'll think about the the potential to actually really build a platform  I think they'd be you know, he may be stupid. He may say hey, wait a minute  Windows, you know all about Windows, but he'd be smart. He'll stick with it  I think it's actually a brilliant move and maybe for legal reasons Microsoft had nothing to do with it  But I I'd like to think they were smart enough to encourage that it's jiu-jitsu  Do you think that the Microsoft then drops Windows Phone?  No, I think they continue Windows Phone at the high end that's a nice ultimately it's gonna it's gonna wither on the vine  That's a to they already I mean Microsoft's already bemoaning the multi multi OS problem that they're in

Start time: 1070.72
End time: 1074.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think they will they'll keep they're not gonna kill Windows so now one more OS. What do you think?

Start time: 1075.56
End time: 1078.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they don't kill it eventually and but they eventually kill one of them, you know, like

Start time: 1080.88
End time: 1091.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The both of them aren't going to last forever  They're gonna they're gonna let them both run for a year or two  Last forever they're gonna they're gonna let them both run for a year or two and then something then they're gonna start  allowing one of them to

Start time: 1092.12
End time: 1105.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know not get updated. I predict they're gonna add a lot of value to this Android phone  They're gonna make this Android phone look just like just like Amazon did it's gonna look and act  Different enough that it will still have a unique Microsoft signature or unique Nokia signature on it

Start time: 1106.40
End time: 1126.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean I think if it starts at the low end if it starts on their low-end devices and they see it doing well  They might extort sort, you know expand it up the line and then if you have a  Lumia type phone that comes in Windows and comes in Android  You might get the Android one because you know, it runs the apps, right?

Start time: 1127.36
End time: 1169.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We all have more from Mobile World Congress Barcelona in just a bit. We've got Larry maggot here  Oh, by the way, I didn't give you my prediction. I predict the day that Stephen Elop walks in the door in Redmond  They kill no key acts immediately  It's gone. It's kid Microsoft's done it before the kin lasted one month. They don't keep they don't mind and  I think they kill it immediately. I think while I agree. It's an interesting strategy. It's just too much of a mess  And what's sad is the damage is done Windows developers are already gonna be very nervous about this  You you wrote an article Larry and Larry's world calm Microsoft's bold new Android strategy. It's it's Nokia's I'm not sure it's Microsoft's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would actually talk about this Andreessen post on his blog and Andreessen Horowitz the future of the news business a  Monumental Twitter stream all in one place  That's that's the blog post where he mentions that the New York Times is getting it right among others  We'll talk about that and a lot more news from Barcelona  There's a there's Bitcoin news  I don't know what to make of that maybe when I use can explain what's going on at Mount Gox  And a lot more I showed today brought to you by our friends at stamps calm  I can tell you one thing you don't want to be going to the post office  Right about now with a new postage rates. Of course, everybody's going in to buy stamps  if you do mailing for your business if you do  Fulfillment for your business. It's crazy to bring a armload of packages to the post office  The cost of the stamp just went to 49 cents and a lot of people are at the post office to buy new stamps  When you could just be sitting at your desk printing out postage like like crazy on your computer your printer  I'm not talking a postage meter. I'm not talking special links  I'm talking stamps calm with stamps calm you actually pay less for postage than you will at the post office  Whether it's first-class mail priority or priority mail express packages. They have discounts. You can't get at the post office  It's very easy to you actually can print if you want they have the labels to print stamps or whatever  You don't go to the post office, but you can also print right on the envelope  So if you do mailers in your business or invoices your logo the return address is automatically added  The address for the recipient is taken from your QuickBooks. It just spits them out  It couldn't be easier. And of course the postage is printed right on it  They keep the rates up to date.

He was known to ask the same question ten times in a row  They call him or he called himself the Attila the hun of inventory  But that's was he was always known as a brilliant operations guy  Yeah, and I have I know I've read the Brad stones book about  Amazon the  The everything store  Very similar stuff, you know claims of Jeff Bezos would browbeat employees and say, you know, you're ruining my company  I've heard the same thing from Steve Jobs many times  Legendary it seems to me maybe to run a big company like this.

I think that also I'm very interested  Beyond whatever we're using it for now for updates or people use it for hacks  The the USB connector is to me very interesting in the in the it still does nothing, right?  So does nothing and I mean the thing is is that I think that there are a lot of opportunities  Whether this Apple TV can handle it or not  I mean we have to remember number one is this Apple TV is basically an iOS box  So, you know what we you know, I think the idea of opening up games for instance  Who cares about the media stuff immediately?  But you open up game games on the platform where your iPhones are controlling, you know our controllers  I mean Apple is like two inches away from doing that. I believe it's saying that's the thing. I know I know and  But I think that these are the things that that I think that they could still be doing that could move forward  I think that also  Being able to hook up a webcam to my Apple TV and be able to use my TV as a way to talk to my grant  My for my kids don't talk to my grandparents is very good.

Thank goodness on the future of the news business a  monumental Twitter stream all in one place, but he talks  About and I think he's right  He says I'm more bullish about the future of the news industry over the next 20 years than almost anyone else  I know you were you will see it grow ten to a hundred times what it is today  Hmm and boy people have been bemoaning the future of journalism  This is this to me is really good news and I and while I don't think he is  Necessarily, you know a brilliant media analyst. I think he's right on and almost everything he says  He says distribution is going from a lot thanks to the internet going from locked down to completely open anyone can create and distribute  There's no monetary premium for control of distribution anymore. That was the thing that kept a lot of publishers in business  Formerly separate industries are colliding on the internet  It's newspaper versus magazine versus broadcast TV versus cable TV versus wire service  They all compete and that and those two factors drive down prices at the same time market size is exploding  And this is the one people might disagree with but I agree with a hundred percent  We are essentially a news operation more people are consuming news now than they were before

Start time: 3505.77
End time: 3561.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good  It's because it's because I can promote my stuff on Twitter and Facebook and that I think is sort of the key  Advantage for people like me, but it's also I mean I think the big question that that mark didn't address  I mean, I mostly agree with what he says  I mostly am more bullish now on the media than I've ever been and like it's always been this kind of doom and gloom business  And I think for the first time it doesn't feel that way  But I do worry about the power of  Facebook and the power of Twitter less than that more mostly the power of Facebook because Facebook can sort of  Kill entire industries by itself. I mean everybody that I know who works in web publishing  They get a huge percentage of their traffic from Facebook and if that  Turns off which you know Facebook has been known to do various changes to its algorithm  You know that affects their business profoundly. So just ask up worthy  Yeah, exactly

Start time: 3562.66
End time: 3576.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although I can't say I'm crying over the loss of traffic to up worthy  In fact, you can blame up worthy because they carefully crafted what they were doing for  to precisely  Game Facebook, don't you think?

Start time: 3578.88
End time: 3593.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so I mean  they like a lot of people kind of  Determined that they could you know crack the code and they did they crack the code and then Facebook changed the code, right?  And I think that's the danger there for you know for all these sites when I think in the end

Transcript:  What really matters creating great content? I mean, you know that you know  You can try to definitely try to engineer  Ways to get better search results on Google or or get better  Search results on Facebook, but in the end  I think most of the the the upstart organizations that have not been part of the mainstream media that are doing well  What they do more than anything else is consistently create great content and find ways to interact with the you know  With their readers with their viewers with their followers

Start time: 3621.86
End time: 3637.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. I think they create great content and also are doing the other thing that mark focused a lot on is  Experimentation and the business model so, you know in the past there was just basically one way to pay for media  And now there's a whole bunch of different ways beyond advertising

Start time: 3637.78
End time: 3779.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's the thing that that is really the most interesting in this post. I agree. Yeah, he says advertising and of course  We're ad supported so I agree with that  But he also points out subscriptions a paid tier of premium content on top of free ad supported content conferences and events  That's what tech crunch does so well  Cross media he says Tina Brown was right  But too early with talk news is a key source of material for books TV and film  Which also happen to be growth businesses  So in other words you can you can take advantage of other businesses need for your content  Crowdfunding is huge right now. I look at patreon just raised 21 million dollars  This is a crowd forming funding platform for podcasts and and other similar audio content  Bitcoin for micro payments and then he also points out philanthropy and that that route that you know, that's of course Pierre Omidy are  Throwing 250 million dollars into his startup, although I'm not sure that's philanthropy that may be I think he wants to make money from  And Jeff Bezos, it's no there's definitely not charity to buy the Washington  Post on the other hand ProPublica clearly is  Philanthropic in nature. Yeah, it's exciting. He points out a number of very successful  He says people and companies are doing it right and non tech the Atlantic buzzfeed  I might disagree on that the Guardian for sure. Yeah  Politico search engine land the verge vice wire cutter  Wired talk he mentions his own investments  And then he also mentions and finally the New York Times  It's great to see the Times has evidently cracked the code on the transition from print to digital after extremely hard effort  So so I think that very interesting a blog post and you know, the issue is in the chat rooms raise this  Absolutely, it's it's not that the the the the distribution doesn't exist the means of funding is what the issue is  Quality and I agree with you Farhad the risk is the companies like Facebook become so powerful in determining what is  News that they can undermine the quality equation. I think Google's safe because Google's kind of algorithmic and yeah  When you say it's content Google's absolutely surfaces content, but we don't know what Facebook and marker

Start time: 3797.88

Transcript:  The difference between Google and Facebook is that Google is very transparent about I mean they have this whole arm that you know talks  To webmasters about what works what doesn't what not to do what you can do and Facebook is very opaque  Like they just change the algorithm the newsfeed algorithm  Yeah, you know really nilly and and they don't really you know  Talk to publishers as much about what not to do and what what you should be doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he did a really interesting experiment where he bought Facebook likes  You know spent that money and  Then created he created a number of fake Facebook pages that nobody would ever really like  And and then tried buying likes and so forth but the the key finding I think  When you can buy likes from Facebook you can buy likes from third parties if you buy likes through  Third parties you're going to illegal click farms. Basically, they hire people in mostly in poor nations  To click likes right and you can buy a thousand five thousand. They're very cheap  He then says he used Facebook's own algorithm. Here he is  Derek Muller  He used Facebook's own algorithm  And what he found was that it's actually there it is virtual bagels limited it's fake he actually  4000 likes on something that doesn't even exist because he bought him he then  Played around with not buying likes and what he found out is that the the actual  Buying likes is actually a very bad idea and it hurts everybody  Because what happens is Facebook's algorithm apparently its news algorithm  Surfaces posts based on engagement  Right if you were going to put it in a in a capsule, it's engagement  And of course these fake likes and it's by the way percent of engagement related to the number of likes  So these fake likes build up your likes, but would generate zero engagement  So as a result posts from those pages never surface  From those pages never surface  And here's the real risk as a real page  These click farms in order to look like they aren't click farms have to go around randomly liking other pages, right?  So he found that even when he didn't buy likes he got a lot of likes from click farms  And that those phony spurious likes hurt his engagement hurt his posts  So is it it's ruining the Facebook ecosystem  That you could buy likes at all has ruined the ecosystem by creating this whole market of third-party click farms  Not sure it's Facebook's fault, but it is definitely a problem
