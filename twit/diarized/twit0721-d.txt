Transcript:  Second time in studio.  And I say the last day of the internet because unaccountably there's a bunch of red dots on the G Suite status dashboard right now.  And if you go to down detector, which is kind of a I've just learned not the best place to go to find out if something's down because it's scraping tweets.

End time: 295.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this message is the only message we have right now from Google.  This was at about an hour ago.  Our team is continuing to investigate this issue.  We'll provide an update by two thirty three, which is five minutes from right now with more information about this problem.  Thank you for your patience.  They say we're experiencing high levels of network congestion in the eastern US affecting multiple services in the cloud G Suite and YouTube.  And that's how I learned of it, because many of our live stream watchers are watching on YouTube.  Yeah, exactly.  And the chat room started reporting this a couple of hours ago.  They're saying, hey, you're down.

Transcript:  I want to give a shout out to an excellent piece that Gizmodo's Kashmir Hilton back in January.  I could Google out of my life.  It screwed up everything.  Yeah.  And she was a marvelous piece of journalism.  Oh, all of that was fantastic.  The series is phenomenal.  It was brave.  What she points out is since Google is woven into the fabric of a lot of other third party applications that when she cuts out Google, she also cuts out her ability to navigate without maps.  She as Uber doesn't work anymore.  And so if Google continues to go down like it's going down right now, it's going to be a ripple.  Airbnb photos don't load.  New York Times articles don't load.

Start time: 338.44
End time: 355.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People will know by the time they hear the show probably what really happened.  But what we don't know is if the other services going down or going down because they're using Google's OAuth or they're using some Google service for their back.  Or they're using something related to Google.  You know, this is we're now in such an interconnected world.

Transcript:  This is why I don't have a smart home to balance with you.  I mean, well, there's a couple of reasons I don't have a smart home.  But turning over control of my infrastructure to a company that I have to rely on to keep it running is up there along with what I do with my data.  What would we do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What would life be like if Google were down for a week?  I'm thinking back when I was a kid in 1965, the entire Northeastern seaboard went dark for 13 hours.  Oh, yes.  In fact, wasn't there a spike in the birthright about nine months?

Start time: 409.73
End time: 452.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a story about a kid who had a stick and he was hitting telephone poles and lights went out just when he hit one of the phones.  Just when he hit one telephone pole and he thought for years he caused it.  Wasn't it was an interconnect.  It was similar situation where it's an interconnect.  But that was pretty bad.  This isn't like the power going out.  We still have lights.  We have cameras.  But I have to think there are people watching live who can't see us.  We are using Google Docs for our show rundown.  So we know what to do.  You're not, Wesley.  You'll be the only guy who knows what's going on.  The rest of us will be going, I don't know what's happening.  So what if you didn't have Google Search for a week?  What if you didn't have Google Docs?  What if you couldn't log into anywhere?  What if Uber didn't exist for a week because of it?  It would be kind of interesting.

Transcript:  I think Amazon would be a lot worse though.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 457.44
End time: 459.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 460.50
End time: 466.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For all we know, Amazon's down and Google's just running on AWS.  That would be ironic.

Start time: 468.95
End time: 487.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like getting locked out of your consumer accounts would be less impactful than, again,  some of the infrastructure, like, again, AWS or Google Cloud or all of the tools that Google has aimed at app developers.  I think that's actually worse because that's a layer that you can't see or perceive  and that you don't understand how it impacts you until it's gone.

Start time: 487.60
End time: 503.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think also we've got a slight advantage in that we're all of an age where we got around without the internet.  We know how to read a map.  And I do worry with...  I couldn't get anywhere if I didn't have GPS.  Oh, come on.  I just sit in the middle of the road.  You managed it perfectly well before GPS.  I know.  I know.

Start time: 503.42
End time: 514.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But now I don't know.  I don't know.  Where do I turn?  Lisa and I are driving down the highway arguing over whether the GPS says to turn at the next one or not.  Nobody's thinking, well, what does the sign say?

Start time: 514.40
End time: 523.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you see, even with them, it's just like, I'll be giving my wife directions.  I go, turn right.  No, not that right.  The other right.  And then you realize, yeah, okay, it's me.

Start time: 524.24
End time: 589.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I don't know if this is related, but I do remember in 2014, August 12th, 2014, much of the internet went down because of something called 512K day.  And there has been some concern that we're getting close to 768K day should happen soon.  In fact, it might have happened today.  This is a weird problem.  512K day, AT&T, British Telecom, Comcast, Sprint and Verizon all went down because their BGP router tables could only accommodate 512,000 addresses.  As soon as there were more than that crash, this is the same problem.  These are older routers, I would guess, 768K limit.  And we are.  And by the way, you can check.  There's a Twitter account that we could check.  BGP4-table.  It's only IP4 addresses.  Currently, 778,915 IPv4 prefixes.  So I'm wondering if maybe we hit that 768K limit.  And if anyone's going to hit it early, it's Google.

End time: 613.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to a huge argument earlier this week with someone who insisted that the Y2K problem had been a complete fudge and it was just computer programmers jobs.  And it nearly came to blows.  It was just like, look, idiot.  The reason it wasn't a bigger problem is because everyone pulled the stops out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bring us back to tech.  Tomorrow's WWDC.  Right.  And Apple's doing a pivot to services.  And this has got to have a cloud, I don't know, positive or negative about the announcement about them rolling out all the stuff and services and how everyone should rely on them.  If the cloud is not reliable, if Google is not reliable, how will they adjust what they're going to present saying that you can trust us?  We're always there.  I don't know how well that's going to go.

Start time: 664.40
End time: 685.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, they're presumably they've got some very...  I mean, they've built the enormous campus.  They've built the presentation room.  If they haven't built a decent solid fiber fiber link in there, then they've only themselves to blame.  But it's a valid point because the more we come to develop on these, we come to rely on these services and the more the companies themselves come to rely on them as a service stream, these outages are going to become more and more expensive.  Yeah.

Start time: 687.32
End time: 755.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The question I have is one of the reasons Apple's done as well as it has is for quite a while.  And I want to say quite a while because I'm not sure this is the case recently, but for quite a while they had a premium retail experience.  I know that recently there have been a lot of...  Are we saying overpriced with that?  Premium can mean so many things.  No, but they were selling the idea of a premium retail experience was very high touch, very hands on.  And when you move to a services based revenue stream, what I'm curious about is whether or not Apple's going to replicate this sort of high touch experience that they've had with customers or if they're going to go the same way that other services based revenue streams have gone where it's all, here is the FAQ.  Feel free to guide yourself through the FAQ.  Here is a chat bot you can talk to.  The FAQ doesn't work.  Here is the email address that you can send a frustrated email to.  We may respond in three days.  In the meantime, we're going to keep auto charging your credit card $9.99 a month.  Enjoy.  I mean, this is something that I feel hasn't been adequately covered whenever any tech company says we're launching a services stream is what's your infrastructure for supporting customer relations on that?  Because people are going to want something for their $9.99 a month.

Start time: 755.50
End time: 787.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does anybody really run their own cloud 100%?  I mean, I know for a long time Apple was using Microsoft's Azure.  Yeah.  And then they told folks that they were using S3 and Google Compute.  I'm just looking at the current iOS security guide where this stuff seems to leak out.  It looks like this is as of May of this year, last month, Apple does in fact use Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform for some of its authentication.

Start time: 787.40
End time: 800.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the strength and diversity argument comes in here.  If you can get your thing working on multiple platforms.  Multi-homed cloud.  And then if you can always switch from one to the other and if every major cloud provider goes down, then we're all buggered anyway.

Start time: 800.54
End time: 809.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember when they used to say the internet was designed to survive a nuclear attack?  Nobody says that much anymore.  Partly because I think it was apocryphal, right?

Start time: 809.50
End time: 850.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, no. I interviewed Roberts about this because I say interviewed.  We were stuck in a taxi for an hour and we got talking.  Good way to interview somebody.  And yeah, they sold it to Congress on distributed computing so that in the event of a nuclear war, you know, one hub gets taken down, it can reach around it.  And he said, yeah, no, that was honestly just what we told Congress to get funding because any idiot would know that if you detonate a nuclear bomb, the EMP is going to knock out vast waves of infrastructure.  You can't round a giant hole in Pittsburgh.  But it really sold it to Congress.  And they heard this and were just like, yep, okay, we'll give you the funds to do that.  It does. The internet does route around damage.  Oh, it does. Yeah. But you can't route around a nuclear war.

Start time: 850.78
End time: 853.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're the scope of the damage it can route around.

Start time: 853.78
End time: 863.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So but yeah, even saying the internet routes around damage, you could see things like Google just go down.  Why isn't it? It's not routing around whatever is going on right now.

Start time: 863.97
End time: 888.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Google's just such a model.  You know, it's these large cloud services are so monolithic that it's kind of like the 1990 telephone exchange that went down, the AT&T outage that went out to somebody installing a standard upgrade,  which caused a feedback loop and spread throughout the entire network.  If something like that can take out a major cloud or a major telcos network, you've got to have diversity in there because otherwise you're wide open to losing everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it points out the physical limitations of the cloud.  I did hear a lot of people.  You just talked about how the fact is that we haven't had it roll.  It's not as if one data center went down and the rest of Google's infrastructure said we're picking up the slack until we can fix it.  It's gone widespread, which means that someone at Google is going to have a lot of explaining to do after they fix this.

It's like every time Facebook has some really bad news, they drop it at five p.m. on a Friday afternoon because back in the days of print, that used to be a good way to kill a story because no one read the Sunday and Saturday newspapers.  What it does these days is piss off an enormous amount of tech journalists who decide, right, that's tomorrow.

Transcript:  My contention is this will be the last iPod ever.  You can salute it as it sails off into the sunset.  Why would they waited four years to update it.  They updated it with the A10 processor, which is the same processor in an iPhone 7.  Three year old iPhone.  And they're just 400 bucks for it.  They want 400 bucks for something that is obsolete as hell.  I mean, look at the bezels on that thing.  Four inch screen.  Home button.  No fingerprint.  No face ID.  Why did they even bother?

Start time: 1333.86
End time: 1342.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm thinking nine or 10, you're going to give the kid a phone  because it's a convenience for parents,  because you want to be able to have the kid call you  if there's an emergency or if they're being picked up.

Start time: 1342.46
End time: 1370.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are devices that they have marketed at that age group  where it's a communications device.  Give him a phone.  What do you want to punish your child?  No, but I have misgivings about letting them onto the wider internet  or to communicate via social media or even rich chats.  Because they're going to get a lot of robocalls.  But you just teach them not to answer.  It's actually human interaction.  They can't have that time shared.  I want them to get a little bit more fluent in human interaction  and what's okay and what's not before.  I give them a device that launches them into the world.

Transcript:  I'm also concerned about how those kids are being tracked  or what kind of data the places that make these devices  or offer these services.  Because I've sat in on product meetings where basically  the minute you mention, oh, it's a service for parents and kids,  the dollar signs start pulsing in people's eyes  because they're like, oh, I can track their data and monetize this.  There's no reasonable expectation of privacy or data integrity.

Start time: 1483.50
End time: 1498.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, you give me an idea then.  I don't think this is going to be the last iPod.  There's no way Apple is going to miss up a marketing opportunity like that.  They will do the final edition iPod.  The 20th anniversary edition?  You'll be able to buy gold and crust it with little crystals.  A 20th anniversary.

This is a kind of retro gaming device.  Looks like a little bit like a Game Boy with a black and white E Ink screen and a crank.

End time: 1801.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or it just becomes a dead device?  12 games should be enough for anybody.  No, they're encouraging people to write more games.  Brianna Wu was on last week, said she couldn't wait to get one because she wants to use Lua  and she wants to write some games in Lua.  Okay.  I don't know why I keep giving them a plug for that, except that at $50 less than an iPod touch,  I think it seems like a more desirable device.  I'm just saying.  Anyway, let's talk about WWDC in a bit.  Fun panel today.  I'm not going to get a word in edgewise because we've got Ian Thompson here, Lisa Schmeiser,  Wesley Faulkner.  We are talking about the week's tech news.  Also a great audience, by the way.  I guess a lot of people in town for WWDC.  We've got people from all over the world, from London, Israel, even Cincinnati and San Jose.  So thank you, everybody, for joining us today.  Our show today brought to you by a cloud service.  I'm thinking they probably...  I'm not going to check if they're up or not.  Check if they're up.  Go ahead.  Wasabi.com.  I guarantee you they're up.  Wasabi is hot cloud storage.  They've rethinking the whole idea of what cloud storage could be.  It comes to us from David Friend and Jeff Flowers.  I've known David for a long time.  They've come up with a way to save 80% on your cloud storage costs,  to increase the speed 600%,  uses the same S3 API you're used to,  but costs a lot less.  Plus there's free egress.  They never charge you for egress.  Maybe you should be thinking about wasabi.  It's just as secure, actually probably more secure than on-premises storage.  HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant.  Very, very reliable and very affordable.  I love this immutable storage idea.  This is such a brilliant idea.  You can designate some of your data or all of your data if you want.  Untouchable.  This is what you need in this day and age of ransomware and or fumble fingered employees.  That data can't be changed.  Move stuff up to the cloud where it'll be safe forever.  Never have to worry about getting charged for egress or API access.  And are you ready for durability?  11 nines.  11 nines.  80% cheaper, 6 times faster.  11 nines of durability, immutable storage,  redundant data centers, and they're up right now.  Maybe this is a good time to go to wasabi.com.  They have a free one month unlimited storage trial for twit listeners.  You have to click the free trial link and use the offer code twit to get that.  W-A-S-A-B-I dot com.  Please use that offer code.  Let them know you saw it here.  I am really a fan of these guys.  I've known them for years and I know they're doing something really exciting.  And I just want the world to know.  I know you're going to have three names on your list.  I want you to add wasabi to that list.  W-A-S-A-B-I dot com.  And you could try it out.  Unlimited storage with the offer code twit for the first month.  Let's just check the Google cloud.  This is exactly the time to be promoting smaller cloud providers.  Wasabi might have a real opportunity here.  That big red dot is getting bigger.

I know as we said, system issues with Apple as well.  WWDC is tomorrow.  Apple will announce all these great new online services you won't be able to use.  They'll also announce iOS 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think they will offer iPad Pro mouse support?  I mean it's rumored.  The first time I was on this show I said the new iPad Pro is going to be the platform for their next Merge OS.  And this is moving closer and closer to that being a reality.  They said, and the rumors is that it's for accessibility.  But when you have keyboard support supported, mouse support supported, merged apps on the desktop.

End time: 1936.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mark Supine will let you put your iOS apps on the desktop sometime soon.  And you can use it as a second display possibly.  And you know what hastened this in my opinion is the failure of Intel to provide Apple with the chips they needed.  That just made Apple think even harder about moving to their own chips.  That's what they're doing on iOS.  They're having great success with the chip development there.  That A12X Bionic is amazing.

Start time: 1937.54

Start time: 1942.19
End time: 1943.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because Intel is getting out of the 5G modem.

Start time: 1944.82
End time: 1961.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the feedback we're getting at the moment is that Apple settled with Qualcomm, signed a five year deal.  Intel's getting out of the business.  Apple buys Intel's IP.  That gives them a five year start to start developing their own kit so they can own the entire supply chain all the way down the line.

Start time: 1961.48
End time: 1973.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Intel did say interestingly that their decision to get out of 5G did not predate the Qualcomm announcement.  Once they heard the Qualcomm announcement they basically said, let's get out of this business.

Start time: 1975.44
End time: 1994.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple, I think we even heard this in a previous lawsuit.  Apple actively forced Intel.  They pressured Intel to do 5G modems because they wanted to get out from under Qualcomm.  Once that was settled Intel said, alright you fine, you take it.  But I wonder what the future is about Intel right now.  I mean I feel bad for Intel.

End time: 2052.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Low power, distributed computing, the ability to run multiple threads on a single processor without Spectre and Meltdown.  So that's security.  ARM seems like it could make an offer.  Linus Torvald said one of the problems with developing ARM software for Linux and ARM for Linux is that most of the time when you're running in the cloud you're going to running on x86.  But that's interesting.  Maybe you won't be.  Maybe you will be running on ARM in the cloud in the future.  Maybe the whole future is ARM from Apple on down.

Start time: 2055.21
End time: 2081.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ARM has a problem still scaling out.  They're scaling up but they can't scale out right now.  So multiple cores on the same motherboard is still a problem right now.  So they have to fix the interconnect problem before they can actually really run super efficiently in the data center.  Are they working on that you think?  I'm guessing.  I mean keep in mind also AMD has an ARM license.  So a variant could be coming from them of like a low power server.

Start time: 2082.78

Transcript:  Intel's got the grunt but that's really about it.  And they've really sort of dropped the ball.  I think they've had cobalt problems with the manufacturing process and getting down to 7 nanometers.  And everyone else is so far ahead of them now that all they've got to rely on is the x86 market which is a reliable money spinner.

Start time: 2101.54
End time: 2108.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're still spending a lot of money in the graphics business too trying to see if they can.  And their AI chip is a joke.

Start time: 2111.47
End time: 2121.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But some of these chips are obscenely expensive.  When you're talking 20 grand for a single processor, I can't see that as a sustainable business model.  It's just kind of like Apple and iPhone pricing.

Start time: 2121.56
End time: 2131.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is overall going to be a good thing for Intel.  It's going to make them stop.  Really?  Yes, absolutely.  Because I think they've spread themselves way too thin trying to do all these things.

Start time: 2131.82
End time: 2157.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well I do remember the last time Intel was really challenged by AMD.  They were able to come back.  They went to the Israeli Skunk Works and said, what do you got guys?  Because x86 is, we've got to keep x86 going.  This titanium project ain't working so well.  The Ultron was eating their lunch.  Yeah.  And so they were able to fortunately find an x86 architecture that worked for them.  And they came back.

Start time: 2157.54
End time: 2173.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's when Tittok really started pushing hard on that.  So they have responded well to that kind of pressure.  I think they do.  And they have enough cash to be able to say, let's scrap whatever we have and start over.  And they could still, I mean, not start over of course, but they could still, they probably have.

They have an ARM architecture license, but they bought PA Risk.  They have literally thousands of chip designers working under that roof.  They want to make every chip that goes in there.

Transcript:  It was so clever of them to just collect all of this data on all of these cities because now they can take a look at secondary and tertiary lines of business.  And they already know, hey, if we want to set up something that has to do with industrial IOT, these are the cities that have the best talent bases and already have existing third party vendors where we can poach their talent.  They're currently planning on building out and hiring out in Kentucky, which is where FedEx is located.  So you know there's going to be a big battle of talent there since FedEx and UPS both have huge presences in Kentucky.  And that's a hub for a lot of shipping.  I mean Amazon now has data on how many cities?  Yeah.

Transcript:  I mean Northern Virginia always made sense because that's how you service your government clients.  There's all the federal cloud contracts.  In New York to an extent.  New York made sense and then Amazon is like, well if you don't want us we'll just take our ball and go home.  And the truth is it's not going to hurt them that much to leave the center of finance and fashion because there are other parts of the world where they can get the same benefits and the same access to talent.  But there are other cities throughout the US that have access to really specialized line of work, whether it's agriculture.  For example, Illinois has Caterpillar, their HQ is there.  It's downstate from Chicago.  But Amazon now has a lot of data on Chicago so they can go back and...  It's not just that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, when the first couple of iterations of the software, it went around the office.  Okay, downside, everyone could see what your music collection was.  There were some pretty embarrassing apps on that one.  But it was actually a pretty good system.  And then they jiggled about with it.  It feels like they just piled stuff onto the core.

Start time: 2540.80
End time: 2558.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they do this with a lot of their apps because their Contacts app at this point,  where you manage all of the people in your phone and in theory in your email address book,  that's another thing where they just keep laying around cruft and it's fundamentally unstable.  And there are sync problems between all of your devices and or your accounts.

End time: 2575.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is why I don't think it's going to be an announcement at the show.  Because they're going to want to ease us into this and gradually degrade it.

Start time: 2576.26
End time: 2603.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe they'll do the Mac OS update sooner because it depends when they ship a Mac Pro.  Presumably they would do it with the shipping of a Mac Pro.  They cleared the deck for other hardware with the Macbook Pro last week, the iPod Touch this week.  So if there's going to be a hardware, the theory being if there's going to be a hardware announcement,  they want everybody to focus on it.  And if it's anything, it's got to be a Mac Pro.  I guess it could be an iMac Pro, but it's got to be a Mac Pro.  They promised that two years ago.

Transcript:  The question is with Intel missing their targets, will the Mac Pro miss it?

Start time: 2613.40
End time: 2675.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mac Pro traditionally runs Xeons.  Is there a 7nm Xeon? No.  No.  Probably not even a 10nm Xeon.  But it's got a lot of cores.  It's really a different beast, not for you and me, but for people who want many, many threads for video rendering or 3D design.  It's a professional machine.  They have said all along it will be modular, which that was the problem with the last Mac Pro.  By the way, the last Mac Pro was announced in 2013.  2013. They've been selling it to this day.  You could still buy it. I don't know why you would.  A whole different world.  It may be too little too late for the Pro community.  They may have all moved to Dell Precision Workstations, as we did for our video editors some years ago.  But I think if we see it, if Apple doesn't say something about a new Mac Pro tomorrow, maybe not that it's shipping next month,  but if they don't say something, I think that's the kiss of death for Pros.  And maybe you're right, Wesley, when you said Apple's moving to the iPad. They don't care.

Start time: 2675.64
End time: 2687.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And also, AMD already has their graphics business.  It would be a shocker if they saw that Intel was slipping and then they moved to the Ryzen processor for their Pros.  Ryzen and Radeon.

Start time: 2687.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the only reason I bring that up is if they're going to get rid of iTunes,  if they're not releasing a new Mac and a new Mac OS to go with it in the next couple of months, you're right.  They're not going to say anything about iTunes yet.

Start time: 2715.90

Transcript:  The rumors, and there are a lot of them, including Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, who's usually very accurate,  are that they're going to make three new apps, music, video, podcasts.  Some said that they were going to take iTunes and put it in a folder.  Because you can't get rid of iTunes without completely replacing its functionality.  People use it right now to back up their iOS devices. What are you going to do if you can't do that?  Maybe music is just a rebranded iTunes.

Start time: 2743.54

Start time: 2755.94
End time: 2761.40

Transcript:  I feel like I'm overcharged, underserved.  I think Mac OS is great for developers and designers and pros.  But you put Linux on a good PC and you certainly have many choices of PCs these days.  You're going to get much of that same functionality.  Maybe not for the designers and the videographers and the photographers.  I don't know what they do. I guess they use Adobe on Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I come at this from a little bit more of an enterprise perspective since that's our core audience.  But when I'm taking a look at the products and the markets that big guys like Microsoft and IBM and Google Cloud  and the rest and collaboration companies, they're all aiming for what they call first-line workers now.  These are people who are not traditional desk workers.  They may be people who either are in industries like construction where they're on site or they may be retail workers or they're healthcare workers.  And almost all of these companies to a person are pushing a model of computing that is mobile first where a tablet is your primary computing interface.  And so we're sitting here talking about the Mac Pro and it's kind of surreal to me because I'm like that's almost a completely different direction  than it seems like the money and the attention should be.  If anybody knows that better, Apple knows it better than anybody. They're the ones who sell it. They know the numbers.  Well this is the weird thing is, I remember the first moment I went to an Apple store and they did everything over an iPad.  I'm like, it's the future.

Start time: 2870.20
End time: 2875.33

Start time: 2876.74
End time: 2896.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I really do feel like we may be moving to, as jobs get much more siloed in a lot of ways,  we may be moving to a model where mobile computing works for significant percentages of a population both on a personal and a vocational level.  And the number of people who really need a desktop to do their job, that will stay steady or it will decline over time.

Start time: 2896.74
End time: 2914.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that works only as long as people are still working at desks because the big failure of the tablet form factor is...  I've tried various different tablets.  You can't do it in your lab.  Yeah, you can't do it on the train.  You've got to, unless your fingers are up down there and people look, it's a very bad look.

Transcript:  What's really funny is the muscle memory because I do take iPads to press conferences now and I've got an iPad keyboard.  It's a lot easier for me to do it that way.  And then when I move from an iPad keyboard back to a regular one, I always have a few minutes of really disturbing typos.  But I've also seen reporters who now just have a pencil and an iPad Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll tell you who's not going to go mobile is developers who really need a keyboard to sit down.  And honestly, you can't develop for all these great new apps for iOS unless you have a Macintosh that you can sit down at.  If nothing else, if Apple even says, all right, photographers, bye-bye. All right, editors, video editors, bye-bye.  If they've got to have people writing software for iOS, maybe the thing to watch for tomorrow is an announcement that Xcode, their developing environment, moves to iOS.  That would be huge. That's the day, right? When that happens.  Is the experience going to be...

Start time: 2993.44
End time: 3013.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to do it.  Yeah, that's a risky move because like you said, the hardware hasn't been there for so long.  And if you pair that with a subpar software experience with something that just doesn't seem to quite get to where your old hardware you already have is not there.

Start time: 3013.50
End time: 3036.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that because we're old timers though? Because I agree with you.  I feel like I want a nice keyboard. Apple's not doing that.  I want a nice screen. I want a big screen. Maybe I want multiple screens for development.  Right, you need big screens.  But I also... and whenever I use an iPad, I bet you feel the same way. I feel like I'm kind of compromising. I have to work extra hard to make it work okay.

Transcript:  Let's hope that's the case.  I can tell you one thing they're doing right now at Google and all over the world, firing up a thousand eyes to see what the hell is going on.  A thousand eyes is the way to see what's going on in the cloud. Everybody wants to move to the cloud, and then these things happen, and you're going, what are we going to do?  And the problem, I think any cloud engineer will tell you, you can know everything there is to know about your infrastructure, the stuff on premises, the stuff you own.  But the minute you go out to that puffy little thing, that's why it's a puffy cloud on all the diagrams, it's a black box.  You know, your data goes in, it doesn't come out. What's going on? You don't know.  And that can mean you lose control of your cloud app or your service. Your customers are hollering at you.  You're scrambling to find the root cause. You're losing revenue. Employee productivity is going down. Your brand may even be damaged.  What if you could see into that cloud? What if like a squeegee cleaning a dirty window, you could suddenly see the entire service delivery path from the cloud right to your end user, including all the stuff you don't own, you don't control, down to the local coffee shop.  That's Thousand Eyes. An amazing story. Thousand Eyes was created at UCLA and immediately received funding because these guys had something that no one else could do.  They put sensors everywhere on the internet. More than a thousand eyes. They should really call themselves million eyes.  A massive array of vantage points on spanning the global internet, cloud providers, local Wi-Fi. This isn't old school IT monitoring, which is passive and siloed. This is unique.

And for things like kayaking, things like anything where water is involved, which admittedly is not a majority of people who use it for health related things.  I'm actually really interested with the doses app that they are rumored to be coming out with that reminds you when to take your medication.

Transcript:  There are rumored to be three new apps coming with watchOS 6.  Again, we'll hear about this. Presumably we'll hear about this tomorrow.  You mentioned one dose, which will. And by the way, if you have an iPhone now, it'll download automatically to your watch.  You'll get it. There's also cycles, which is a menstrual tracking app.  By the way, Fitbit and Garmin already do that.  And the store.  And then there'll be a store where you that's going to be the key, isn't it?  Yeah. Separating the watch from the phone. If you can download and install apps from the watch directly.  Absolutely. Yeah.  Calculator, voice memos and books. You'll be able to buy books and listen to them on the watch.  That's actually kind of cool. Right now I have to copy it. It's kind of laborious. Copy my audio books or music over to the watch.  Then it'll play, but I have to make sure I do that before I leave home.  You know, Apple should double down on the watch. The watch is arguably a big part of any services it's going to offer.  It's a big. They apparently make a lot of money on the watch. It's not selling watch, not just smartwatch, but selling watch out there.

Our privacy experiment showed 5400 hidden app trackers guzzling our data in a single week, a lot of it in the middle of the night.  This is Jeffrey Fowler writing lots of apps. Some of the apps, you know, obviously if you have one drive, it's got a phone, the home office into its mint.  Yeah, Spotify. OK. Even the Washington Post own app, IBM's Weather Channel app, one app, which is has always been a little skeezy.  And if you ask me, Citizen Citizen was the app that's supposed to scare you about living in San Francisco.

Thank you.  And they were trying very hard and they're trying to put it forward.  It's about time.  We care about, we are making our third party developers care about your data.  But again, it seems like a little bit of a run around where Google can say we're not really the problem.  The problem is the third developers.  And again, Apple has the same cover of plausibility where Tim Cook can talk about how privacy is a fundamental human right and value.  But look at what's being sold and look what's being offered in the Apple Store and look at the complete lack of enforcement.

Transcript:  I talked to Phil Zimmerman, the creator of PGP.  He said I will never carry an Android phone.  I always carry an iPhone.  But he said, very important, don't install any apps on it because while you might be able to trust Apple, you can't trust anybody else.  And we know Facebook, we know all these companies.  Their total goal is to get on your phone because then they have information about you, your location, what you do.  They can sell to other people.

Transcript:  But to be fair, Apple, in fact, somebody called me the radio show asking about this.  Apple does allow you to go into the settings and say, don't let this contact this home office.  For a lot of these apps, they'd be useless.  If you can't, if OneDrive can't see what's on your cloud or Spotify can't download music, you're not going to be using it.

They allow people to hack WhatsApp with a phone call, not even a pick up phone call, phone call WhatsApp on the iPhone.  And so, a, that's problem number one is that you may have a perfectly secure iPhone.  You put WhatsApp on it.  Suddenly, it's going to be owned easily.  Yeah.  And then the problem came up.  A lot of security researchers pointed out because of Apple's restrictions, the way it's locked down, we can't tell if it's actually almost impossible to tell if an iPhone has been compromised.  You can't get into it.

You have to continue, remember, to say remove this data or don't opt into this data or do this research into each app.  That they say that that's why their system is the best is because they care.  They check every app.

Start time: 3949.44
End time: 3989.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a theory on this.  I think this is in the wake of GDPR and privacy regulations in California and elsewhere.  This is what you're going to see is all these companies say, oh yeah, we completely agree.  That's why we've given the user the choice.  And they know because they know from their own experience that the tyranny of the default users are just going to use whatever the default is.  So they actually have it both ways.  They look like they're giving you lots of choice.  They're giving you lots of control of privacy.  Apple does that.  In fact, it even says, you know, this program has been using your location in the background.  You want to let it continue?  And most people say, well, maybe in that case, they'll say no.  But I think in most cases, people just say fine.  And these companies know this.

Start time: 3989.40
End time: 4007.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google knows this.  Facebook knows this.  Well, they actually designed a couple of companies being fined in Europe for this for so-called dark patterns.  You design your website to push the user into certain paths of doing things and certain default settings.  And this is actually illegal under some sections of European law.

Start time: 4007.40
End time: 4012.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 4013.46
End time: 4056.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think we're going to see this become an emerging story because, like you said, the California the CCPA goes into effect next year.  And California privacy.  Yeah, the California consumer privacy.  It's the strongest law in the United States.  Well, here's the thing, because California now consumers will have the right to corporate disclosure of how their personal data is being collected and used.  So they have the right to disclosure, but it doesn't specify how it's disclosed.  They'll have the consumers will have the right to access the personal data that has been collected by companies.  They'll have the right to request that the personal data be deleted.  They'll have the right to know how companies have been sharing their personal data.  But the scope of the law is actually kind of limited because the company has to earn more than twenty five million a year in revenue.  And there's incidentally no punishment.

Start time: 4056.40
End time: 4056.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has to make.

Start time: 4059.10
End time: 4074.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this company that makes more than twenty five million a year in revenue has to has to make at least fifty percent of its revenue from selling personal computer data.  So if you're a company like Amazon or Microsoft or Apple, it's probably not going to affect you because you can say plausibly it's a very tiny.

Start time: 4074.62
End time: 4101.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These were all later amendments made to what was a very strong privacy law.  And then these companies came in and said, well, let's change that.  Let's change that.  Most importantly, let's eliminate any punishment.  And then go ahead, pass your law.  And that's the dark pattern.  That's what you're going to see time and time again, is these companies paying lip service to privacy.  While in fact, people aren't going to have the choices or they're not going to, you know, they're going to be pushed in the wrong direction.

Start time: 4102.06

End time: 4124.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  I think the other issue is that while many, many companies are collecting data on you, it has been up to now siloed.  But increasingly, it's being distributed, sold, going to data brokers who are then selling it on other parties.  Amalgamating it.  And as it gets added together, they build a ultimately perfect picture of your behavior.  Like the mortgage scandal where they dice up all these mortgages and like so awesome.

Transcript:  So I'm reassured everything's going to be fine because apparently the FTC and the FCC and the Department of Justice have divided up the tech world.  And they have said who they're going after.  The latest is the Department of Justice is now picking up the dropped FTC investigation of Google.  They dropped it in 2013.  They're going to start.  Meanwhile, the FTC has been given Amazon to look into.  And so they've kind of divided the world up like Spain and Portugal.

Well, I think that's your starting point right there is because if you've got, although there's a revolving door at a political appointee level, if you're talking institutional knowledge, exactly what incentive has there been for employees to know about this stuff?

Transcript:  In fact, in the face of California's privacy bill, I think it was Marco Rubio who said, no, no, no, no, there shouldn't be state privacy because there'd be 50 different rules.  We'll take care of this.  We're going to make a federal privacy law.  And then that was that.  Yeah, it was very interesting.

Start time: 4347.40
End time: 4376.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was private.  You can't see it.  It was very interesting.  After the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, a lot of tech companies shifted their position for years.  They've been.  We should not have a national privacy law that should be down to the states.  And once they realize the scale of the mistakes that have been made, it was kind of like, OK, let's get a national law.  We do is the largest lobbying spender in the entire tech sector.  They're just like, OK, we need a federal law.  We've got the lobbyists.  We can get exactly what we want.

For example, I feel like it's kind of noteworthy that Microsoft has been leading the charge on a lot of things like data privacy and facial recognition.  Because my question is, well, if they're advocating for these really specific standards that do these really specific things, what's the downline?  And so that's what you should be asking any time if Tim Cook is like, oh, privacy is our premium.  But what's the downline?

Transcript:  Let me ask you this, because Senator Warren and a number of other presidential candidates for 2020 have said we should break up Amazon, Facebook, Google.  Is that a solution?  It seems to me that's draconian in the other direction.

Transcript:  It's the same with Huawei naming companies and then saying we're going to go after them does not fix any future problems.  You have to figure out what the problem is.  It's not those companies.  It's that's that's maybe an example.  And whoever's eyes that that's where the problem is.  But outline what the problem is and come up with a solution for the problem.  Because let's say you kill all these big companies or you kill Huawei.  How are you going to tackle the next problem without having some sort of way of describing what the problem actually is?

Transcript:  I don't know. Part of me would like to see Facebook, the sort of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp thing broken up into separate companies.  It's kind of getting like AT&T.  But at the same time, I don't see a real benefit for it.  Yeah, but AT&T came back together.  Yeah, I know.

Transcript:  I would make an argument that breaking up Google isn't such a bad thing.  I bothered me when Google got into the content business when Google was a search.  It seems to me a search engine should be a search engine.  Yeah, sell advertising. That's fine.  But when you acquire YouTube and maybe they're not maybe they are.  But there's always been the accusation favoring YouTube content and search.  That is a problem.  And so there's no reason Google needs to own YouTube.  There's no there's no synergy there except in advertising and a privacy invasion synergy.  So if they got rid of YouTube, if they got rid of I mean, maybe the moonshots you have to keep because who's going to fund that?  If you don't have the deep pockets, you're not going to the way most not going to make any money for years.  Verily not going to make money for years.  Project Loon Looney.  I don't know.

End time: 4646.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're fixing search for one thing, because when search is compromised, in fact, even Larry Page said this when they first wrote the first papers about PageRank.  They said we should never take advertising because no matter what if you do, it's going to taint your search results.

Start time: 4646.42
End time: 4668.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So shouldn't there be instead of break up or separate shouldn't be like you cannot do this with search or X or.  Well, that's another way.  Or just like find a way to define that fully exactly what is wrong instead of just targeting them because it doesn't fix when Twitch and Amazon become the next behemoth in terms of content and search.

Start time: 4669.34
End time: 4688.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the combination of multiple entities and the synergy.  And this is why they bought YouTube for three point two billion dollars.  The synergy of all these videos.  We know what you like tying into Google and Google search and Google advertising.  That's that's to me.  That's the incentive for surveillance.

Transcript:  I think if you I think if you will, I think actually if you were to pass legislation that forced companies to assign a dollar value to data.  Yeah.  You said measurable things get results and companies do assign dollar values to specific users when they repackage your data and move it on.  If you force that information to be public for publicly traded companies, I think that that kind of transparency gives lawmakers something to hold on to and start moving.

I have to be conversant in what the privacy lists.  Yeah, I have mailing lists.  And since I'm not responsible for administering those mailing lists, but because I do use them, I have to know.  And in the privacy training, I have to go through every year.  They're very, very careful to say you can't send out this kind of email in Germany because of Germany's privacy laws.  You can't send out this kind of email in Australia's laws.  And so we do have a case where globally speaking, different people have different experiences based on their country's conception of what online privacy is.

They just have to do it differently.  And I think sometimes we tend to conflate making money easily with making money period when that's not necessarily going to be the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple after losing in the Supreme Court.  And it's the issue is going to be whether they could be sued or not as a monopoly by consumers.  The spinkrat said, yes, consumers do have standing.  So that lawsuit to go forward.  Apple's response was to create a what do you call this?  A advertising propaganda, a propaganda page app store dedicated to the best store experience for everyone.  What a number of people pointed out is that Apple really this whole document just really underscores Apple.  The fact that Apple does have a monopoly.  It's our store and we take responsibility for it.

Transcript:  But this is one of these investigations.  These legal cases are so useful because, you know, Apple responds to their legal problems with this.  We've just seen Facebook is going up in court is that going to is going to try and literally argue the case that you have no expectation of privacy because you use Facebook.  That's just the lawyers.  I know it's just a lawyer's thing, but it knocks onto their public image.  People reckon.  And this is why Apple's doing this kind of thing.  You're going to see a major.

You could watch if Google isn't down at Twitter TV slash.  Actually, we probably won't put it on YouTube because Apple has for some reason some aversion to us streaming its conferences on YouTube.

Start time: 5086.68

Start time: 5092.24
End time: 5114.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Vision research has shown humans prefer dark on light because that's the real world.  Yeah, you're out there in the sky and the sky is bright and the sun and stuff.  Humans evolved outside were generally active in the daytime.  We go to sleep when it's dark.  We like to be able to see things.  And so a lot of research says that dark mode is in fact not as good.

Start time: 5115.08
End time: 5147.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would like to see this and see how updated this is in terms of the studies.  I think in general, yes, but it feels better to me.  We are spending way more time in front of screens where the net value is a lot higher than they have been ever.  It's like you're staring at a speck of the sun.  Exactly.  And so yes, I believe that was the case.  But with the screens and how they're pushing out all these photons, I think maybe it's maybe not the case anymore.

Start time: 5147.42
End time: 5156.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's certainly more comfortable for the eyes.  I noticed when I've been using dark mode for a while and then I go to a page with like this, which black text and white screen.  I got my eyes.

Start time: 5156.42
End time: 5178.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually quite useful.  I would say the real use of dark mode is if you're angry, it was the middle of the night because if you turn on a non dark mode screen, it blasts your eyes.  And it's the brain just like, oh, stay like, wake up.  Whereas in the dark where you've got a much better chance of being able to just say, oh, it's an important right.  Go back to sleep.

Start time: 5178.60
End time: 5188.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5214.78
End time: 5223.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's what I do is I'm in Do Not Disturb all the time.  Yeah.  And then that way the phone isn't bugging me.  And if I want, if I can look at it and see what I, what people are saying.

Transcript:  But I also try not to look at screens for like half an hour before bed.  You also have a watch though, right?  I do.  And I put it on theater mode at 10 o'clock at night.  OK.  Wow.  She's serious about this.  I am dead serious about sleep hygiene because I think as long as you, as long as you set  down the boundaries for yourself, where you're like, look, no notifications, put the watch  in theater mode so that even if you're moving your arm around, it doesn't accidentally activate  and give yourself, give your brain about a half an hour of not looking at any screen  whatsoever.  I think that is important.  That last half hour.  Clear out the buffer.

Transcript:  Well, this actually raises it.  So I told you before the show started that we recently cut the cord.  We no longer get cable and we use Apple TV for everything now because all of our streaming  services can be accessed through Apple TV.  So there's a lot of Siri.  My daughter loves doing the Siri rewind 25 seconds and watch another scene.  I love that.  I do that all the time.  Here's the thing.  I don't know how to find out what Siri's microphone policy is.  It's ambient listening policy.  And this could be coincidence or this could not.  What I have noticed in the few months that we've been going through this Apple TV as  our primary TV interface and our only IoT device in the house is my search engine auto  fill results have been uncannily tied to the things I've just been talking about.  And it's creeping me out.  I'm glad that Alexa has that.  I hear this a lot and I have to think that mostly it's coincidence.  Well, I'm trying to figure out like how much of this is me looking for a pattern that doesn't  exist and how much of this might be me observing a pattern that I'm not supposed to notice.

Transcript:  Alex has been with us practically since Tweet started.  He came almost straight out of high school to work for us.  He's going to work for Como in Seattle as a professional TV engineer.  So we're very, very proud of the Flowmaster.  Thank you.  Thank you for your years of service, Alex.  Our show today brought to you by Eero.  I love my Eero at home.  Eero is the smartest Wi-Fi I've ever had.  Wi-Fi was easy when you had one or two devices.  Your neighbor didn't have Wi-Fi.  You weren't trying to stream Netflix.  But these days, the single router model just does not work very well.  And you're probably all experiencing what I was experiencing at home.  Honey, the Internet is down.  After about the 18th time I heard that, I decided to get an Eero.  And I have to say, it's awesome.  The best analogy is it's like a light bulb.  Wi-Fi does not go through walls very well.  So if you have a lamp in your living room and you hope it will light up your bedroom, good luck.  With Eero, you have lamps all over your house, Eero beacons, which bring the Wi-Fi closer to you.  It's essentially what enterprises, including Twitter, have been using for years now in your home,  an enterprise-grade mesh Wi-Fi system.  And it's so easy. It's not complicated to install.  You install the Eero app on your iOS or Android device.  It'll walk you through the process, help you place the beacons.  Depending on the size of your house, you might have one or two.  We have five base stations in our house because it's a big place.  It's about 1,500 square feet per unit.  And then the Eero app lets you manage your network.  In fact, I love Eero Plus.  In fact, we do. We have our 16-year-old's Wi-Fi turn off at 9 p.m.  Time to go to bed. No more Minecraft.  We also have our devices stay up as late as we want because we're grownups.  State-of-the-art WPA2 encryption.  There's a guest network, which is great, so you can let guests have access to Wi-Fi without getting onto your network.  And the most important thing these days for any device that's on the Internet in your house,  especially the router, is automatic over-the-air updates.  Eero updates automatically, so you not only have the latest features, but the latest security at all times.  And they do updates fairly regularly, which is fantastic.  If you ever have a question, their customer support is amazing.  30-second response time, and they will stay on the phone.  I know they stayed on the phone with me until they fixed the issue.  Eero Plus is well worth the small amount of money it costs.  I use it for everything.  It protects my network against malware, spyware, phishing attacks, unsuitable content.  I could block it across the entire network.  And by checking the sites you visit against a database of millions of known threats,  Eero Plus protects you from accidentally visiting malicious sites without slowing anything down.  Violent, illegal, or adult content is tagged.  You can decide who sees what whenever you want.  99 bucks for a year is well worth it. I love the Eero Plus.  Right now, we got a great deal.  $100 off the Eero base station plus two beacons and a year of Eero Plus.  $100 off when you go to Eero.com slash twit and enter the code twit at checkout.

Transcript:  So we should explain the backstory here. Of course, T-Mobile and Sprint planning to merge.  We mentioned earlier that the FCC said, you go right ahead.  The DOJ say, whoa, hold on, wait a minute.  But the real issue, I think, for everybody is it's good to have four different wireless carriers and four major wireless carriers.  If you only have three, I as a T-Mobile customer want them to merge with Sprint.  As a Sprint customer, I want them to merge with T-Mobile.  You especially. They'll get better.  So the plan is let's make a fourth carrier.  And you say that the candidates are.

Transcript:  Build out their own and acquire their own licenses to in order to compete.  And there's an article on the rundown about how Amazon is possibly thinking about buying it and getting into the space.  But Microsoft is a better fit because if you look at what was in that highlight reel about Microsoft's modern OS,  how they're talking about how portability is part of the new future of seamless updates, bug fixes, so on and so forth for the laptop space,  being able to sell something that comes with cellular access would be an advantage.  And also, Microsoft is one of the only big players in gaming that has not come out with a handheld.  So Sony has so is Nintendo.  But Microsoft has not.

Steve Gibson on Tuesday was saying it's going to be the end of the world.  I don't know.  Maybe that's what's going on.  I don't know.  But watch out for Bluekeep.  And if you have a Windows XP machine or Windows 7 or Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2008, please update it so that you're not part of the problem.

Transcript:  So this blog post from Microsoft was very, very strange.  We did talk about it at length on Windows Weekly.  This is from Computex, which just ended in Taipei, Taiwan.  And it starts off talking about all the new laptops.  There's some very interesting PCs and laptops coming out, some really nice ones.  And then Paul Thurotte and Mary Jo Foley thought maybe this was a cut and paste error.  All of a sudden, there's a paragraph about a new operating system.  These machines can't run and probably never will run.  That Microsoft is dubbing a modern OS, sometimes with a capital M, sometimes not.  So it's not even clear if that's the name of it.  But it's a manifesto completely separate from the rest of the blog post, a manifesto for what the next version of Windows  should have, automatic seamless updates.  This is what we were sold for Windows 10.

Start time: 6215.56
End time: 6243.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They just released a browser plugin that allows you to...  Run Internet Explorer in Edge.  Well, the argument they're using here basically is if your enterprise has a list of sites that are white listed,  and then one of your users is like, let's go to another site, and they go into a site that is a known hazard,  it automatically sandboxes that session so that nothing can escape that browser session,  get onto a user's machine, and from thence hop onto the network.

Start time: 6243.74
End time: 6266.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They also use a sandboxing Windows Defender now, the antivirus.  So when they say secure by default, they say the state is separated from the operating system,  a compute is separated from applications.  So I think they're just saying we want the entire thing, kind of like, what is it, cubes OS, which is everything is...  Every process is sandboxed.  I think that's interesting.

I mean, one of the biggest challenges in IoT can be inconsistent connectivity, especially if you're talking about cases like in oil fields or some agricultural things.  And so if Microsoft is rebuilding an OS that is comparatively lightweight and still allows connectivity so it transmits data when you need it and when it's actionable, this seems to aim right at it.

I don't know, I like to think the moral of this is if you're in politics, don't be a dick.  Without questions on citizenship being included on the 2020 decennial census questionnaire, Mr. Hoffler wrote, the use of citizen voting age population is functionally unworkable.  They wanted detailed citizenship data to draw the maps.  So anyway, it's, yeah, it's kind of the smoking drive, not a smoking gun, but the smoking drive.  Right. Yeah.  Anyway, that's that's neither here nor there.  Let's I mean, it's not just in the US.  Let's talk to you, Mr. Oh, no.  What have we done now?

Transcript:  There was a there was a ghost protocol.  This is a utterly bonkers piece of mental justification.  Basically, what they're saying is the intelligence agencies in the UK appear to come around to the thought that may be permanently backdoor encryption so that anyone who finds that back door can read all your communications might be a bad idea on the security front.  So they come up with this new thing.  So if you're chatting with someone, even on an encrypted line, then the telco will have a legal duty and they've already implemented this in Australia to allow law enforcement to silently come on.  Listen to what's being said.  Wasn't this the flaw in Apple's FaceTime protocol?

But with the makeup of the Supreme Court as it stands at the moment.  And with two of the Supremes who are actually strongest on privilege on privacy and security in their 80s, you know, the next 10, 20, 30 years is going to be really, really difficult unless, you know, there's some serious public education and public demand going through.

And we're losing moral ground here by not speaking out wherever it happens or wherever it could happen around the world.

I mean, look at what smart homes are or look at the expectation that we've trained people to with web browsers where we've now got people clicking except on cookies because they think, oh, it's perfectly reasonable for any company to monitor what I do online.  And in return, I don't have to deal with a bunch of pop ups on a web screen.  Yeah.  And one of the shrewdest things that people have done over the last 20 years is normalize folks to the idea that surveillance is a fun perk of modern life and makes things more convenient for you.  And in a way, mobile devices and again things like my watch only make it much more so because we've voluntarily bought the instruments that allow everybody to keep tabs on us and erode our privacy.

Yes, if we if the US is going to start lobbying around accusations of backdoor kit and that sort of thing, it's a very thin glass house to be lobbying bricks like that around in.  The US has been doing this since the 1950s with crypto AG stuff and with, you know, in terms of the dual point of the dual curve elliptical stuff.  This is common knowledge and seems to be saying, well, the Chinese are going to do it.  And with the political situation in this country at the moment, I think there's going to be a lot of countries overseas looking, you know, who's looking more sane and stable at the moment, China or the US?  Who would we rather have backdoors from?  Yeah.  So we'll see.

But I do see lots of red dots on services, except, of course, for Google Plus, which is a good thing.  Google Plus, which we're so happy.  Apparently Google Plus uses no Google infrastructure at all.  Yeah, we're running that on Azure.  Our show today brought to you by LastPass.  Then we're going to get to the good news.  Happy, I promise.  Happy news coming up next.  LastPass is happy news for anybody.  LastPass generates long, strong passwords and remembers them for you.  So you don't have to.  All you have to do is remember your master password.  And the minute I get home tonight, I'm going to use LastPass to change all those old passwords.  They have a great security audit, which will automate it so I can go in and find all the places where I reused passwords and fix it.  That's the kind of thing a great password manager should do.  I am a huge LastPass fan.  I know you will be too.  And LastPass has a plan for everybody.  LastPass premium for individuals, LastPass families.  That's what we use at home.  One of my features I love about LastPass families, besides the fact that I can easily share family passwords with my wife.  So we have a folder, the family.  And any time I put a password into that family folder, Lisa gets access to it.  But she's also my emergency access contact.  If anything should happen to me, she can have access to my password vault, which means she's not left out in the cold trying to figure out how to get into my bank account, my Facebook and all of that.  I think that's a really nice feature.  LastPass is great for enterprises too.  If you have a team of 50 or fewer people, that's LastPass teams.  We use LastPass Enterprise here at Twitter.  And that is awesome.  A hundred plus customizable policies to give you more flexibility and control when it comes to managing access for your organization.  You pick the policies that are right for your business.  For instance, we have master password requirements here.  We enforce a minimum length, the number of digits, things like that.  We also have admin to customize reporting so we can track changes over time, determine trends to continue to improve password security with seamless background sync, offline access and app for almost every device.  Actually, that's why I use LastPass.  I have extensions for all the browsers.  It works on iOS.  It works for Android.  It auto fills on iOS and Android.  That's nice too.  In fact, it's the first app I install when I get a new phone because then all the other apps I'm going to install, just the passwords just auto filled in by LastPass.  I just love it.  And it's secure.  Your password vault is trust no one encrypted everywhere except on device.  LastPass doesn't have access to it.  Only you do.  LastPass.  Join over 13 and a half million people who sign up for LastPass and are loving and trusting it.  It's my choice.  It's what you should use, what we use here at Twitter.  If you want to know more, go to lastpass.com slash Twitter to find out how they can help you.  LastPass.com slash Twitter.  They're nice guys too.  Nice guys and gals.  I really like the LastPass team.  LastPass.com slash Twit.  Thank you, LastPass for supporting Twit.  Thank you, Twit listener for supporting us by using LastPass.com slash Twit.  All right.

So they thought, aha, I've got an idea.  Why don't we go to our client, in this case, overpriced TAP manufacturer, North Face,  and say, right, we'll do some lovely pictures of these landscapes,  have someone with your logo in in the background, stick it up onto Wikipedia,  and then you'll get lots of brand recognition in Google searches.  And instead of somebody saying, well, hang on, that means spamming a public interest group  with advertising images, they went, great.  In fact, let's make a video about how we did it.
