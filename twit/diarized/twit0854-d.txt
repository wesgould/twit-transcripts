Transcript:  Uh biggest, uh, I you know, they're calling this  log four shell exploit the worst  Security vulnerability in a decade somebody call it. I think it's the worst  ever and it's the gift it's going to keep on  Giving discovered, uh the weekend of thanksgiving  Uh log4j is a widely used java-based logging tool from the apache foundation. It's used  Everywhere first discovered in minecraft  Servers, it's very easy to exploit. It's it's literally  You can you could put it in the url  Uh of a website and it'll get it entered in the log and as soon as the log gets executed and remote command execution  profit  Uh, it is now we see being used by nation states dramatically china  And others it was a zero day. Uh, so uh, and it was so easily exploited  That the minute it was revealed everybody knew how to do it. So everybody's working very hard to resolve this  We're also hearing from uh, other security sources that this isn't the only flaw  In log4j that there will be others  Uh that even though you fix, you know, you you close the the back door you update to the latest version of log4j  Which fixes it  Your if you've been compromised it's the gift that keeps on giving and  People say for years we're gonna we're gonna run across servers that have this problem  Uh, as the u.s officials said this week  That adversarial governments would inevitably inevitably seek to exploit the security hole  But companies like mandiant and microsoft have said that they already have dudes they already have including china  Ransomware attack groups are using the attack. Go ahead

Transcript:  Yeah, I was gonna say thankfully so far most of what we've seen has been, you know  The typical bot farm and crypto mining stuff, but yeah, it's still very  Early days. I've got a good friend who's uh, since we've been at a very large company and he had a very long week  Oh, I bet patching up bank systems and it's been about I used to be a software engineer and an architect  It's been about 15 years since I've written any code and I remember using log4j  In everything and i'm sure some of those things that I wrote way back in the day are probably still running on production servers  Right now and hopefully someone's got the keys to go in and do some updating

Transcript:  Well, this is the irony. It was created by one guy  Uh, it is of course there as with all open source projects now, there are other committers, but they're all volunteers. They're all part-time  Open source developers and suddenly they're you know on the line  Uh, it's used by everybody it's java. So, you know, there's always that notion that java is somehow  Sandboxed and safe but this you know, it clearly shows  Uh that there's uh that it's not it's the I think part of it is  The problem is that it's so ubiquitous as you say tim stevens. It's everybody uses it. It's so it's just the default logging  tool  Part of the problem is it's so easy to exploit I could do it anybody could do it. It's a it's simple text string

Transcript:  By tuesday running to to system logs and really needs kind of pretty low level access to to these systems to do its job  Effectively and so it tends to be given a lot of permissions and that means it can do a lot of harm in the wrong hands

Transcript:  Yeah  Checkpoint software says it had counted six hundred by the by the way, this is tuesday  This is almost a week ago six hundred thousand attempts to exploit the bug by malicious cyber criminals  44 percent of corporate networks worldwide had been hit by these attempts  Uh, as you said tim a lot of it  relatively benign like crypto miners  But once you see china and other nation states starting to use it, it's going to be about data exfiltration and perhaps worse  To date cisa is unaware of a federal agency being breached  But federal agencies have been given till christmas eve  To patch their uh software

Transcript:  God  The attack worked. This is what the wall street journal says the attack works reliably and is trivial to exploit  That's about as bad as you can get  Uh crowd strike adam meyers senior vice president of intelligence with crowd strike one of our sponsors says it's a surprise  It's not more widespread  The question everyone's asking is what aren't we seeing and that's really where this is going to be  a long-term problem because  I would guess many many servers have been  impacted and affected but  The people who have used it are laying low they're in there but they're sitting in there  And they will uh, you know do something later with it  so  Terrifying terrifying just  Just really awful  Uh cisa is actually saying that it probably will affect hundreds of millions of dices now the thing i'm I say all the time  Just to reassure people  It's not affecting your individual computer. You're a home user a business user of windows or mac or linux  It's not it's not going to affect you. It only affects servers. It's the logging tool used for servers unfortunately  Because it affects all servers including apple's iCloud  From minecraft to iCloud and everywhere in between it's very likely that something you use is impacted by it  And it could then turn around and bite you  That's why it's really important that you keep your own systems up to date because it will be looking for  weaknesses in your systems  So, uh, and and really the people's most affecting people who like tim used to be sys admins people have to keep their servers  running  I guess I mean there's I mean  Normally on a show like this we go. Well, let's point a finger of blame or  You know, there's no blame. This is just you know, this happens it is, you know, somebody said  Oh this shows you should never use open source. I don't think that shows that  Yeah, that that's not it  Every time i'm saying that everything's got a problem. I mean every software is going to always have bugs  In fact, I think you could say the fact that this got patched almost immediately  Is testament to the fact that you know these unpaid part-time volunteers who maintain this thing  Care a lot about quality and fixing it. Well, i've also heard a number of people say this has been a problem for a lot longer  Than anybody's admitting  I don't know about that. I haven't seen that evidence of that yet, but  So just to be careful

Transcript:  As far as I know you can run arbitrary code. Um, you can basically inject whatever you want to  Um, so as far as I know worst-case scenario is basically complete control of of any any system that's available publicly  You know, hopefully things are properly firewalled or even air gaps, you know  Truly secure systems like that obviously should be fine  But anything that's got some kind of public access  Potentially is completely exploitable and then at that point you may be able to get inside of a firewall  And gain access to some more secure system that way so the the potential damage here is really problematic

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thanks, tim wired magazine the next wave of log 4j attacks will be brutal and this was three days ago  Uh the really that's the omicron wave in other words. Yeah, exactly. We've only seen delta so far  Because I it's my guess that a lot of servers have already been compromised  But that the nation states who've compromised those servers the bad act the really bad actors are not the script kiddies putting crypto miners on there  But people who are saying good we got access could be you want the real nightmare scenario?  It really is going to depend on how well these uh  Servers have been secured if they're open to the public and a lot that's kind of the nation notion of a server  Is it's open to the public, you know, it's a minecraft server or it's iCloud or it's amazon people are using it  Uh, and and if somebody with malicious intent is one of those users you can do it. So  You know what we don't what we've seen in the past is things like our electric grid  Not super secure  Uh, in fact, there's evidence that virtually every electrical provider in the country has been compromised in one way or the other  I think fairly likely that nation state actors Russia  Probably already in the electrical grid  financial services  I have to think most financial services probably do a better job of securing themselves than the nation's electric providers  But they probably still some of them are online somewhere  That could be devastating you could bring the grid down, which is worse bringing that turning the power off or destroying america's financial system

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, I meet your and ceo of tenable cyber security firm and founding director of us cert  Says it is by far the single biggest most  critical vulnerability ever  And I and I have to agree. I can't think of anything, you know people might say well look at intel's meltdown inspector problem  Yeah, but that was really really hard to exploit every machine has it  But it was really really hard to exploit  And as far as we know we haven't seen any exploits in the wild because it it took such skill to implement this I could do  if any idiot  Could do it's not hard at all  um  Checkpoint says they've seen 1.8 million attempts to exploit the vulnerability in the past week  Uh in some cases a hundred attempts per minute  China and iran have been spotted using it  To establish footholds and that's really the thing  Foot holes is the thing and so I think you know china and iran they're not going in there and putting in crypto miners  Or defacing your website. They're going in there for the long haul. They're going in there to live  And no way to to detect it  Uh, well, of course, there's always a way to detect apts. There's always a way to find somebody in your server. The problem is  They're savvy they're good. They're probably leaving very little trace  And they're probably being smart enough not to trigger any trip wires  So I think it's it's a safe bet that they'll be there undetected for some time

Start time: 1277.22
End time: 1325.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really a question of how well your network topology is defined because again  This is giving easy access to to public servers and and realistically if you're designing your network  Right, you should be able to prevent some kind of or have some kind of firewall or some kind of a  Barrier in between these public servers and anything in turn with really truly mission critical stuff  But like you said leo, there's this perception  Of course the job is inherently safe and so therefore I think a lot of admins out there probably  Were a little bit relaxed in setting up access permissions to these and from these job servers thinking well, you know  There's there's really low likelihood of anything really dramatic happening  So if those network topologies aren't correct if there aren't the the proper checks and balances kind of in place to prevent someone from  Hopping from a public facing server to something internal that's supposed to be kind of blocked off from the world  Yeah, that's when this starts to get really problematic. Yeah

Start time: 1327.60
End time: 1519.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, you know  We don't have our usual pundit level  Information to park it to talk about this because it is and there's not much we can say about it  It's just this is this is the gift that's going to keep on giving probably for years  They're saying that they'll be they'll be compromised servers in closets everywhere that nobody even pays any attention to  That will just be sitting there and one day, you know, you'll log in and boom  You'll be sorry  Uh, because because because I think probably most servers will be patched pretty quickly the patch is out there. It's easy to fix  Uh, but the problem is patch doesn't eliminate the person who already got in  It's just closing the barn door after the hackers already inside. So  Anyway, well, this is a depressing show. Okay, i'm gonna cheer you up  Actually, i'm looking at all the top stories there's nothing nothing to sell over there nothing happy  Uh, all right. Here's the good news. Here's the good news  Disney's back on youtube tv  I hate I have to say I really hate these clearance  Negotiations it happens all the time. It happens with cable networks in local television stations. It happens with roku it happens with  apple tv youtube tv  Disney said look if you want to carry our channels all 18 of them, you've got to give us more money  Google said well the heck with you we went back and forth  Uh, it's really a game of chicken  Whoever blinks first, right? We've seen it happen before and almost always these are resolved the day before  They're gonna pull the plug. Well, it didn't happen this time and on friday disney pulled the plug  A lot of tisney channels disappeared from youtube tv. Now. This is not youtube. This is youtube streaming tv service  I actually subscribe to it. It's expensive 65 bucks a month, but it's basically like cable has some nice  features  Uh, it has a dvr for up to six people everybody in your family can be unlimited dvr  Yeah, except we learned something with this something really important not only did the channels go away  espn fx national geographic your abc locals  But all your dvr recordings for those channels went away  They're not recordings. They're not permanent  They're, uh, i'm not sure how it works. I'm not sure what the mechanics of it are, but when you lose that channel  You you lose the dvr recordings so like everything else in the cybersphere. You don't own it. You're ready  They're just pointers. They're just pointers. They're just pointers  Yeah, uh google said we've had good felt good faith negotiation with disney for several months  Unfortunately, despite our best efforts we've been unable to reach an equitable agreement before our existing one expired  Their channels are no longer available on youtube tv  We're going to give you 15 bucks off.

And so I think that that that level of  Corruption or whatever is it probably roughly the same place as it was before  It's just so much easier to do it now that more and more people are doing it

There's always been crime  There's always been theft is just on different levels ask alexander great how he acquired so much  Did he just get it for free or did he do something extra to go get it?  Okay, so getting the halloween costumes is stummy for sure  But I mean human history has shown that we are beautiful evil creatures throughout the arc of our time on this planet  So i'm not saying it's worse right now than it was yesterday because my great grandfather would disagree about how i'm living  Talk on a show with you guys as opposed to how he had to go.

Transcript:  You know, I have to say there is one social network. I really like there, you know  I know you're a big twitter fan jeff and uh, but I to me reddit gives me the news I want  It's the social network. I want I realized I was thinking the other day why I like reddit  Because I am an enthusiast, you know  I get in I get little  I get excited about a thing and I want to go all in on it and with reddit  I could say good i'm going to follow those three subs  And then when I move on to the next thing I unfollow them and I follow the next three subs  So reddit always kind of is perfectly suited to the thing i'm interested in right now  Uh, I happen to think it's a really good social network. They have apparently  Announced they're going to do an ipo owned by kandinas right jeff

Start time: 3406.26
End time: 3457.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, uh, yeah the majority so kande  I told the story on twig. That's not here. My old boss steve newhouse was desperate to buy dig  And they weren't interested and so he bought what was then kind of the second choice  Yeah, so it was the second choice was oh this thing called reddit. They're pretty cool  They're a little weird and different but they were a big clone initially. They clearly copied dig. Oh, yeah  Yeah, and and steve taught me interactivity steve newhouse. He's he's he's visionary about it  So he got reddit and he owned it fully for not much money at all  But then very wisely kind of spun it out a bit. So he created equity to to motivate the  Former owners to keep going and new staff  And and then they were able to acquire things and work that way  And so now going to a full ipo was really kind of a brilliant arc of the story  Where they could get the full value now of reddit

Start time: 3479.28
End time: 3512.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so  It's so interesting because you can I think it's I think it's a good ipo  I think this there are definitely issues like with every social network. I mean  reddit was hosting a lot of  horrible stuff  But they uh under kande, I think for a long time  Under uh alexis ohanian and steve hoffman. They kind of wanted to be the free speech  uh  Wing of the free speech party like twitter, but I think they realized that's not going to fly and kande certainly didn't want to be  Host to some of the horrible stuff that was on reddit. So they've gotten rid of all of those

Start time: 3512.20
End time: 3517.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think have they got rid of all of it. No, there's still not visible now. There's it's like tumblr

Start time: 3518.40
End time: 3546.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's still adult content. But the thing about reddit is you don't  You only see what you want to see so you get to follow what you're interested in  uh, and I think that I think  I don't know. I I believe in anyway, I think the ipo I think will be very interesting. I feel like they'll do well, let's  Let's just say that but maybe that's just me  They wanted to be the civil somebody dwindle in the chat room saying they wanted to be the civil 4chan  Yeah, they I think they predate 4chan. Maybe not

Start time: 3547.40
End time: 3570.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But uh, yeah, I think they do I mean Steve dude  My old boss did call me after I left the company kind of said what what do we do with this bad stuff here?  Yeah, because as you say the owners the the founders wanted to keep it as free speech  um, and and as the difficulty  Of number one setting a policy and number two enforcing it at scale, right?  It's a problem with everybody says but the thing that reddit does differently that is different from say twitter

Start time: 3571.98
End time: 3604.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not different facebook. It's different twitter is you have moderators for each sub reddit  So they are kind of responsible for what that sub reddit's rules are and so because there are people who have some ownership of it  They're not paid but they have some ownership of it  Uh, I think it works pretty well. Um  I don't know. How does how does your point money go ahead? How does red make money advertising, right? It's advertising  Yeah, there is advertising there. Yeah, but mostly for a long time and I pay for reddit  I mean there is you can you know pay for gold coins or something? I don't know what I get

Transcript:  No, i'm just i'm just wondering how much money they have is for having ipo  Like I just don't I don't know if the market's gonna I guess the market cares about that. That's right  Yeah, I'm just  I still think of reddit is like nerdville and like  Hyper finite nerdville. So I mean as far as money for the masses, I'd be interested to see it  I just don't think it'll work. But that's just me. I don't know anything. Yeah  Yeah

Start time: 3631.90
End time: 3653.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So leo actually your point about reddit proves what you keep on whining about with facebook  Um and twitter is how you want what you want to see and you don't want to see anything else that somebody else recommends to you  That's why you like reddit so much, right?  Yes  That's exactly right. It's not algorithmic. That's another point. I for one like my algorithmic masters, but you don't

See, I don't I disagree. That's up to me to make it  What I want it to be  Where do you fall on this, uh tim stevens

Start time: 3679.50
End time: 3715.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it depends on the platform. I actually genuinely enjoy on instagram, for example seeing  Kind of interesting things on there for twitter  I absolutely want a linear feed of the people that i'm following and I maintain pretty  Strict lists in terms of what I want to see and so i'll hop from one list to the next depending upon what kind of content  I'm looking for if i'm looking for  You know news that we need to hit for example  I have one list for that if i'm just kind of checking out with what my friends are up to I have list for those  sorts of things too  Um, but I definitely like the reddit model in terms of subscribing to what you want to see  It does bubble up things to the front page that are just genuinely interesting  I think does a pretty good job of that too, but I tend to prefer to curate my own things when I can

Start time: 3718.92

Start time: 3733.28
End time: 3812.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say you should pick some and a small number of sub reddits. So where it is  It's kind of like forum software. It's divided into sections of interest  I would pick a few things that you are really interested in  And follow those so I follow for instance slash r  slash politics  I think that's a good one. Obviously, you know, you're not going to follow rlinux or  Slash r slash valheim. That's not going to be in your  There's pixel six. See, that's a good one. Let's say I know you have a pixel six  You've had some problems with it. That would be a good one to follow. Unfortunately  uh, the pixel six sub reddit has a problem a lot of reddits do where  Uh people post pictures of stuff  The mac subreddit. I don't know why everybody posts their picture of their new mac like I could care less  um pixel six, uh subreddit got uh, all of a sudden a lot of cats  uh, but  But pick politics or news  Um, you know, I follow the succession subreddit. I follow the chess subreddit things like that  I also follow a lot of tech stuff. So pick three or four things you're really interested in  Because they're you know, a lot of these are very active. A lot of them will have multiple, you know dozens of posts  But they're not like twitter active  And they're very very specific

Transcript:  I think reddit is the one social network where you should always read the comments and I think you know on youtube and elsewhere  You you kind of say well don't read the comments  But in reddit you really should because quite often something will bump up to the home page and the first comment will be  Actually, this is fake and here's why it's fake and here's how you can tell it's fake and you wind up learning  Oh now I could identify this as being fake in the future and you don't really see that that level  That's good point commenting that's a very good point.

Yeah, there's a there's a meme going around  And and you will and the redditors are smart and we'll say yeah, see you could tell this is faked  But what I usually will do is i'll read the comments until it gets to the point  Where it starts to descend into reddit, you know punning  And then i'll say okay this comments this comment is done  Let's go to the next one  Uh, I I don't know. I really like it. I i'll be very curious how well it'll do. I think you're right  I don't know how the markets will  React to this but they have but buzzfeed was a disaster  Well exactly right.

Yeah, we definitely want to buy buzzfeed. Here's you know, we'll put in a million bucks  I didn't realize they could say no never mind and take it out afterwards  And apparently that's what happened to buzzfeed  They had uh raised I don't know tens of millions of dollars for this spack  And most of those investors withdrew  They decided not to participate  How can that even?

Jonah Paredi who was the founder and she stood probably to make a lot of  Uh money on this. Um, Jonah let's be clear is brilliant  He's a visionary and very smart  Yep, um probably hoped for you know, a nice exit in effect  And it's an exit without an exit, isn't it?  That's that was the other side of it and probably one of the reasons it didn't do well is  It wasn't really an ipo or a sale or a merger. It was just give us some money  And we're gonna still run the place does it assign that buzzfeed's model is not good

Transcript:  No, I don't think so I mean but but so I I I  What it inspires in me we talked about this a little bit on twig  Is that I think we're seeing the last gasp the last supernova of scale  And what what paredi said is that is that we've got to we've got to ramp up together and do and do roll-ups  To compete with the big boys, even though they're tiny compared to the big boys, uh, google and facebook  Uh, you saw vox  and um group nine  Uh merging and another effort saying scales it  Uh, you see the magazine companies are you know, look at what happened to the time inc and meredith came together and then sold off a couple  And now they're just on the on the on the content factory floor for barry diller  Uh, because it's scale  So I think scale has been has just cheapened media to its extreme here scale allowed all kinds of new things to start scale  Created the mass market scale created the advertising market the consumer economy  But the internet ruined all of that and they haven't realized it yet  And so I think that's what's happening here is that is that what I don't blame these guys jonas brilliant  uh, the management of both vox and  Group nine are brilliant, but they're doing what they have to do with the present advertising market because they depend upon advertising.

This is sponsor  I almost feel like this is a public service announcement because i'm a big believer that the internet should be accessible  We have a lot of blind listeners who can't use your website because their screen reader just chokes on things like images  That have no alt tags or weird navigation menus, you know where you really want  Those screen readers to work on your shopping cart. You're leaving behind  Millions of people who would like to be your customers because they can't use your site  Now I i'm also sympathetic for anybody who runs websites. That's a challenge because I know I we thought oh  What are we going to do? This is going to take a lot of extra development  A lot of extra time along comes user way. This is a big big  Big break user way.org is amazing  Every website has to be accessible the ada requires it user way is an incredible ai-powered solution  That automatically remediates and enforces the hundreds of web content accessibility guidelines and it does it with one line of javascript  It could do more than an entire team of developers making your website accessible  I know it can be overwhelming but user way solutions make it simple easy  And I really want to underscore this cost-effective  It's much less than you think  Probably, I mean it's less than we spend on web fonts every month  It's it's really affordable. Now first thing to do go to user way.org slash twit  They've got a free scanning tool run it see if your site's ada compliant if it's not now  That's cause for concern. You're open to ada related lawsuits. You're also leaving behind a lot of potential users user ways  ai and machine learning solutions  Are used by more than one million websites some of the biggest websites in the world coca cola disney ebay  FedEx walmart unicef unicef uses user way to make its site accessible  And now user ways taking those  Best in class enterprise tools that are used by the big companies and making them available to small and medium-sized businesses at a price  small businesses can afford  Operating an accessible compliant website just makes business sense  And if you do take off you suddenly scale user way can help you there too  I mean if they can work for disney they can work for you  You'll automatically generate using user ways computer vision the code for those image alts  It'll it can it's it'll see the golden gate bridge in an image as an example and say that's the golden gate bridge  By the way, it gives you an easy way to add to that  That's the golden gate bridge at sunset with bicyclists or whatever you want to have it say  But it gets you the base level there gets you the basic description in there  It'll take those complex nav menus that are the bane of screen readers and make them accessible  All the pop-ups will be accessible all the forms your shopping cart will be accessible  And you'll get a detailed report of all the violations that were fixed plus an easy way to modify it to enhance it to improvement

This is supposed to be the the most um, you know news  impacting individual or group of individuals of the year and uh, you know  It's hard for me to to say that he was the one who was the the the person that was most talked about in  In the past year that seems uh  That seems unlikely to me.

Thanks to joe mansion  But that was going to include a fairly hefty uh incentive the current ev incentive is  7500 only available to car makers who have sold less than correct me if i'm wrong tim 200,000  Units so tesla's over you can't get an ev credit for that, but I did get one for my mustang mock e  Uh, how how important is this?  To ev growth these incentives

Start time: 4849.42
End time: 4902.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh right now it remains to be seen because there are such  Dramatic supply chain shortages that I don't really know that it's going to impact the economy that much  But certainly there were a lot of pricing decisions on these evs made with the expectation that incentives were coming  And so these going away has a pretty significant impact but um, you know  It remains to be seen we may see this come back again  And I hope we do. Um, you know, the incentive was going to get even stronger, especially for us made  and union made evs, which was you know, a  controversial addition to the thing but ultimately meant that a lot of people would get up to  1200, excuse me  12,500 off of a new ev which would really substantially bridge the gap between  A traditional gasoline powered car and an ev and get a lot of people into these things and I think ultimately  That would be very good for the economy for the environment  Um, so I do hope that we see this come back  But um, but yeah, i'm not sure exactly what it's going to mean given these things are so hard to find right now anyway

Transcript:  I think you would lose about 4500 off the top. I don't have a problem with that bringing auto manufacturer back in the united states  That creates jobs a part of the incentive was for union jobs again  I don't have a problem with that you get more money if the battery's made in the u.s again. That seems like a good idea  um  I'm sure it makes a big difference in the purchase  I mean if people feel like they're getting a nice big chunk of change  Is it a tax credit or is it actual money? It's a tax credit. Yeah, but but it depends on

Transcript:  Some manufacturers and some dealerships were actually kind of taking that off with the lease price, for example  So it would be often factored into the price of the car it depended  You know on state incentives too, which would sometimes get factored in that way  But it would definitely you know, that's a significant amount of money on a car  That's you know in the 40 to 50 thousand dollar price range you're talking about  Maybe 20 discount and that really would be enough to to encourage someone to go to an ev  You might not have been thinking about it.

Start time: 4984.32
End time: 5059.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I definitely think it is it's one of those things where right now we're still in such early stages  You know evs make up less than two percent of the the u.s  Overall car market at this point  And so we're still kind of in that unfortunate chicken the egg state where there aren't enough charges to make people comfortable  But there aren't enough evs out there to really make the investment in a charging network worthwhile  So this was really you know  It continues to be an attempt to to kind of kickstart that industry to get more of these cars on the road to make it  Make more financial sense to incentivize other companies to come in and build more chargers  Which will then encourage more people to buy more cars, which would mean more chargers and everybody's happy at that point  So that's definitely good  And while you know  You can if you take the worst case scenario in terms of if you are charging your car based on electricity that comes from a  coal-burning old school power plant  At that point the emissions are roughly the same as a gasoline-powered car  So you can make the argument that it's actually maybe not helping things  But you can also you have to look at this as kind of a transitional period if we can get more people on to evs  Well, then there's more incentive for us to get more renewable  Power sources and more opportunities to to get more green energy into more people's homes  And that just helps to kickstart that industry  So there's a lot of carry-on secondary tertiary effects here, which I think are all very positive and ultimately this could be a bit of a

Transcript:  I'm happy so to the end about the renewable energy tim because the thing that cracks me up the most about these things is  How do these batteries get made? How do we mine these batteries? Are we just taking flowers and making batteries?  Are we just blowing up big parts of the earth with large machinery?  And exposing things and digging and drilling to get the materials to make all these ev batteries  That only lasts a certain amount of time and then the way that we charge them like if we were a solar wind water  Generating power place. It'd be great  But I mean we're destroying the planet to get the batteries and then  Half the places aren't even using good power to regenerate the power for the battery  So it's a gas 22 on whether it's better for the environment or not. I mean  It's absolutely better for the environment. No, it's clearly better gas. It's definitely better pollute

They're getting very good at that  So you're not always pulling lithium out of the environment  To make these batteries they're lasting a pretty long time surprisingly long time. It feels like  longer than we expected

Transcript:  And there's this perception that you know having more EVs on the road means that in 10 years  We're going to have a bunch of you know  Lead acid batteries sitting in landfills kind of dripping into the earth  Which is absolutely not true even after 10 years even if these battery packs are down to 80 capacity and they're not good enough  for  Powering a car anymore. They're still going to be incredibly valuable batteries much more valuable than any component of a  Use car that we have right now  So people are absolutely going to spend a lot of money researching ways to to get those batteries out and some of them will  Be in industrial applications working as you know, industrial ups  But certainly we've seen a lot of interesting research into how to basically break those batteries down  and as you said leo extract those raw elements back out because  If you have a lithium-ion battery pack that's 10 years old and it's not good enough to power a car anymore if you can  compositionally break that down you theoretically make a new battery out of those same raw elements and  And start new without having to to go to those  Those really unfortunate parts of the world as you mentioned and do some unfortunate things in the environment to get those batteries  So those elements once they're mined out they can be reused and in 10 years  We'll see some really interesting recycling technology to make this work.

No, although it was a very social game when it came out in 2016  Yeah, it was but even then it's outside.

Transcript:  I'm gonna make a game and use my my favorite  Revenue model, which is i'm not even gonna name this game, but i'm addicted to this game  And the way they got me to pay them money is that every single thing that I did  Came up with an ad after my accomplishment and to get to the next thing  I had to watch another crappy game and I was like, you know, what what was it 499 take my money?  I got I paid them instantly because after it took a day where I was like, oh, it's not a big deal  And i'm like, oh  I have I don't have time to do this. So they got my money. That is the best model to get me to pay  For a game. So i'm just working on something addictive. I'm going to just throw spam at somebody  Just give me two dollars and you feel fear to play this game for the rest of your life  That's that's the best model they got going. We're none of these games in that list do that

Transcript:  Speaking of making money now, I'm curious what tim what you think about this  This was toyota got a lot of heat for this. I don't know if they deserve it. They made its key fob  Remote start this is the ability to start the car from a distance a subscription feature  But i'm not sure this is as bad as it it plays out to be or is it was initially reported

Start time: 5624.02
End time: 5701.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and it was perceived to be pretty gross and it is still kind of gross  But it's not as bad as it was perceived to be basically, um, if you have a toyota of a certain age  I think this is 2018 and onward cars  Many of them have a remote start button on your key fob, which actually makes a direct connection to your car an rf connection  So it's not going through the cloud or anything like that. You hold that button down the car starts  So the the belief would be well, this is connecting directly to my car. It doesn't use the cloud  So it doesn't matter if i'm subscribing to toyota's premium services because it's directly connected to the car  However, it is actually included in part of toyota's package of digital services  It's just that those cars got that for a certain amount of time for free and that is now  Becoming no longer free those  Customers are kind of falling out of that free window and now they're being asked to pay eight dollars a month or 80 bucks a year  To continue to use this feature, which again doesn't use the cloud at all  um, so it I can see both sides of the argument, you know, it was kind of always the way it was it's just that people are  starting to realize it now, but  um, it is kind of it's almost like you know when  We used to play games on physical media and they would charge you money for quote-unquote dlc  That was actually already on the disk and they were just kind of unlocking it  It's a little bit like that and that it kind of makes you know  It tastes bad in the back of your mouth, but it is ultimately something that that's not really a change as it were  It's just really unfortunate. So tim and it's the way it's going to be

Transcript:  All that stuff. Yeah this time of year. It's definitely an invaluable thing and  You know it there are multiple ways of looking at this services-based economy as applied to automobiles one of them being  You know, would you pay a couple thousand dollars extra for this feature?  Certainly a lot of people do but you really only need this feature  Maybe four months out of the year five months out of the year  And so maybe it's actually cheaper in the long run if you only pay for it in  October through april  You can cancel it and re-up you can actually do go month by month if you want to so that's kind of the argument that a  Lot of people are are making bmw has been an early proponent of this kind of software  Based application to to seemingly hardware based services in cars and tesla certainly doing it as well  Where you can kind of pay as you need for these sorts of features. It's going to be coming a much more common thing  You know recurring revenue is everything in the modern economy and the automakers want to get it on that  I don't like

So I drive honda's and i've driven them for a while now I pay  uh  It ends up being like 12 dollars a month, but I pay for the year, but guess what? I can be in california and start my car  Warm up my seats turn on the defrost and do what I need to do. That's what i'm paying for  I'm paying for that and if I drive in a ditch  They send out a beacon and somebody comes to me even i'm unconscious and then come help me  That's what I pay for you're going to charge somebody 899 for a physical connection that they've got to be  Visibly being able to see their car with our connection to do that. Guess what go to your local best buy  Car dealership guy pay 1.99 for a remote start on your car and be done with it for the next 10 years of your car's life  Or 20, wait a minute. There's no reason some third party solution  America  Viper is in the future right now. You can have viper be your whole new key fob where you don't have to have a secondary key fob  Okay, i'm not saying I know what i'm just saying there's products out there where you don't have to have three key fobs anymore to do that  But the fact that they're doing is just irks me so much because if you're going to charge me then give me full service  Don't tell me that my key that already costs 500 dollars to replace when you lose  I got my car key in this plastic bag on my desk because if I lose this and my life is over

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they because there's a fair bit of  Encryption going on in keys, so you basically got a private key encryption setup going on and it is keyed  Correctly to your vehicle. So the process of replacing is a little bit complicated  But certainly there's some technology and the big thing is is proprietary technology  So it's not the kind of thing they can really mass produce viper can't sell a key fob that necessarily

Transcript:  Sorry that's okay. So so some of these  Third-party ones would actually entail kind of installing your key inside the car  And then having always be in there and then the third party thing kind of takes over functionality and kind of  but but yeah  one of the exploits to get around these things and the encryption involved is basically to do like a man in the middle attack where somebody  triggers the car and then  Is close enough to your home to trigger the key and then they can kind of trigger the the response  And enable your car to start and then drive it away at that point  So there are some vulnerabilities in the older versions of these things anyway in 2018 is probably old enough

Transcript:  All right our show today it's great to have neum speaking of actually owen  I'm gonna this is gonna be my prescription for you  You've seen the ads I want to tell you lisa and I have been doing neum it works we  Love it. I have done every diet in the world  And i've learned one thing diets  don't work  When it and one of the things you saw me eat that gingerbread cookie, right? So the trick with neum is there are no bad foods  There are no good foods  There's no pressure  neum  Is here to how to is here to change how you think of food  It's a psychology based approach that looks at what you eat  But also more importantly how you eat and with neum I discovered i'm doing a lot of fog eating  Unconscious eating I was able to track down those habits that weren't supporting me. I could still have a cookie  In fact, I remember very early on when I was doing neum you get a coach you get a group you can talk to  I told my coach tia. I said to you  I had a hot dog. She said that's fine. That's not nothing wrong with that. You logged it. I said, yeah  She said there are no bad foods and that was a light bulb went off  Because I don't I think my psychology I bet it's many others as well is if I am feeling deprived I overeat  I compensate I said well screw you i'm gonna have an extra piece of cake  Neum instead of making you feel guilt or regret empowers you to keep going  I got to tell you it really works. You don't have a strict set of rules neum weight empowers you with the practical knowledge  To build smarter more sustainable habits and behaviors. It's using something that psychologists have known about for a long time  I'm a big believer in called cbt  Instead of instead of you know getting you know, weird and deep with it you focus on the why  instead of the what  I don't know is that isn't really these changes your relationship with eating you understand why you eat when you eat  And what's going on and by just simply the knowledge helps you control it. You are now in charge of your eating  Everybody's journey is different though. I don't want to say this is you know, but i'm just gonna say neum  Knows it's about progress not perfection. There are no bad foods. There are no good foods. There is no pressure  To change yourself to fit someone else's expectations  You just find things that work for you and that is freeing it feels good  Not everybody needs to be or wants to be on a strict diet  You know two days at the gym two days at the gym or you know  Weird teas or anything like that instead of trying to kind of fit yourself into the to the jam yourself into the lifestyle  That somebody else tells you try new it's a psychology based approach to find a healthier balance  That's moldable to your life as a result is more sustainable by the way one of the reddit  Sub forums I follows the neum sub form. It's sub reddit because it's great. There's even more support from numerous there  Talking about our experience. There's a new group that you get the new map  It starts with a new map on your iphone or your android device  And I have to say, you know, I I can have a cookie  I write it down  I put it in the new map and I write it down and it it helps me understand what i'm eating when i'm eating why i'm eating  And that helps me lose weight  You don't need rules to lose weight. You just need knowledge  And wisdom you need empowerment so that you can build a smarter more sustainable relationship with the food you eat  New habits neum's cognitive behavioral approach helps you better understand your relationship with food  How to be more mindful of your habits gives you the knowledge and support you need for long-lasting change  It all starts when you go to neum.com  Answer the questionnaire it's by the way, that's a great onboarding process because it's it starts right there. You start thinking about  You start thinking about it your relationship with food  Neum is very effective 75 of neum users finish the program  and more than 60 percent  60 keep the weight off for a year or more  It really really works. I feel like I it's changed my life  And lisa will vouch for it too. She uh, it's amazing what she's done  With neum taking care of your health is empowering instead of stress inducing because you know what happens when you get stressed you eat  So why did I have stress yet? It's crazy. No need to fear ruining the whole program with one off day  Believe me. I have when we went to mexico. I said to lisa i'm not neumann  I'm not neumann. She said i'm neumann. She did she she knew the whole time did her lessons  Logged her food got her exercise  She lost weight  So bad at her  I gained a little bit, but you know what I was able to lose it right away because  Neum got me back on track  All you need is a daily 10 minute check-in. It's by the way this that's the other thing. It's very very very easy  No grueling early mornings or huge chunks of your day spent doing stuff. It's simple. It's fast  It's a lifetime habit that will stay with you forever start building better habits for healthier  Long-term results. This is not a diet.

That is the trick neum  uh big big big believer in this we really in fact  Uh, we started doing that beginning of this year. I think in march something like that. Maybe january march  I started doing it lisa said i'll keep you company because she was going to be a supportive wife. She did she looks great  Then she kind of fell in love with it  And she you know, she's lost  She didn't need to lose a lot  But she's at her lowest weight that i've ever known her and sustaining it and she's very very happy about that  Uh, she's always been slim me on the other hand  I've always battled with my weight and it's just a really nice way to kind of handle that  For my health and for my long-term  Uh goals, I just i'm really really really happy with it.

This isn't a regular drill something's wrong. So I go up to the school now mind you i'm not rambo  But I like for her to know that i'm close by so I sat at the edge of the school parking lot  They got amber lights up. You can't approach the school and I just find out where she's at and we're talking back and forth and  You know her mom starts texting me because now her mom's a teacher her school started shutting down  And then after you realize it's more than just one  School one location and then you start hearing about the threats being made online and tic-tac and twitter and all that kind of stuff  And so it made me feel a little bit better that there wasn't an actual threat at the school  but mind you last year our kid had a knife and there was the school got shut down so things do happen, but  This this freaked me out because they don't  Schools aren't really equipped for like things like this that really do happen in the moment

Transcript:  so um  We are human beings and we collect things and we save things that have value can I buy your cleats, right?  So again, the cleats thing isn't a big deal, right?  Like that's dumb because it's a physical let's say let's take the mona lisa, right?  How many people have put up pictures of the mona lisa on their background or on a t-shirt and they've worn it just because  It's the mona lisa. They love the mona lisa that picture doesn't have value but the actual mona lisa does  So when people say oh I can just copy and paste the picture the real value is in the ownership of things  So like let's say I wanted to make doctor bots and put them out of my discord and give them to people that were fans  Of mine, right?  So let's say I have a thousand fans and I make a thousand things and they want to save them and collect them  They'd be the first ones to have them if they wanted to resell them one day down the line  What if I died yesterday to be worth some money?  I don't know but as humans is what we do we collect baseball cards and songs and music and records  It's what we do  So I fully understand and get the concept and grasp of nfts  But there's also like with everything like I said beautiful horrible human beings that are stealing people's content and distributing it and  Monious eyes and things that make me angry too  But I I just understand the stored value of nfts and the process that we're doing it  And it's also something that is disruptive in a new way for artists to get paid for their stuff  Like if you're a musician, there's no reason for you to go slave yourself out to a big company  That's just going to advance you some money and rip off your royalties for the rest of your life  Go make your song put on an nft put it out to your fans and say hey  You'll get royalties as I get spins on spotify  Which means they're going to put you on their playlist and listen to you every single night because they're going to end up getting  Two cents a day or whatever. There's multiple different ways I can rain on it forever  But I just believe in the power that is given back to regular people and content creators  And I know that there's also things wrong with that too by humbug. Merry christmas buy my nfts when I start selling  Right now I do all my stuff in public I've made some good money flipping some nfts and I just believe in the process  That's all i'm saying, but I know that I know that there's also a problem

They were the first company to sell premium wireless online only  You can order from home  You save a ton because they don't have to pay the overhead of stores plan started just 15  a month all plans all plans include unlimited  Nationwide talk and text and high speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5g network  T-mobile and now their best offer of the year for a limited time by any three-month plan  Even the 15 dollar a month plan and get three more months free  That's incredible savings and I I can tell you as a longtime mint mobile user. They're great  You choose the amount of monthly data that's right for you  Don't pay for data. You don't use they do have an unlimited plan  But I would suggest you look at the site and pick a plan that makes sense look at your existing  Cell phone bill and after you burst into tears when you see the bottom line  Switch to mint mobile. I'm paying a third less than a third of what I was paying for t-mobile service  You could bring your own phone mint mobile will send you a sim for free another way  They don't guide you all those other companies charge you just to send you a sim  You can keep your phone number if you want port it over to mint mobile if you keep your phone  You know nothing changes. They also sell phones. It's up to you  Mint mobile.com slash twit switch to mint mobile get premium wireless service starting at 15  A month that's for unlimited talk and text  Why are you paying 80 90 100 a month when you get get the same for 15?  It doesn't make any sense and now three months free when you buy any three-month plan mint mobile.com  Slash twit is just a no-brainer mint mobile  Dot com slash twit cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month at mint mobile.com  slash  twit  Uh, I just think it's an amazing thing.

So I got the 15 gig plan  25 bucks a month  Come on  For 15 gigs, you're never going to use that much  That's why you should go to the site and look and pick a plan that makes sense based on your usage because it's great  mint mobile  Dot com slash twit.

Transcript:  Uh, first of all, if you're in the chat or you're in the discord, you are the backbone of this show  You guys are smart and creative. I'd also suggest that you say the name of this show should be  Uh fake filtration imaginary filtration something with filtration think of runs yourselves talk about it  No, we we really need to emphasize this filtration, uh chat room and discord just focus on that for me  You come up with something quippy and having to do with filtration. Okay. All right  Secondly, uh, it is the most wonderful time of the year, which also means that for some people it is the worst time of the year  So if you have family members that have don't have kids or are alone or maybe their spouse passed away  Make sure you check on your aunts your uncles your nieces your nephews your cousins  Call them stop by pick them up  Go watch spider-man together spend some time because you got a couple days off  But don't forget about the people that are usually alone at this time of year that are in your circle  I know omnicron's out there  But if you could even just give them a call to check on them, i'm sure they would appreciate you  I will tell you that the one show that I don't do enough  But i'll start doing next year is raising a ninja because people love talking to leah and about leah  And i'll tell you the other night I came home  and um  You know, we bought all these candles if you look on the internet you can see it  And the candle was fresh in her room and i'm like man, it was just fresh her lights were out. Everything was dark  And I was like, there's no way she went to bed that quick. And so the next day i'm like yo  What what happened last night? She was like, oh, it's actually crying and when I heard you come in I didn't want to  Bother you so I just blew the candle out and I jumped in bed and went someone's like well  Why were you upset and she's like it's not a big deal, you know the holidays, you know  Just pressure school and all that and I was like no like literally let's talk about why and she said  She's wrestling, you know, it's two hours after school is beating her body up, you know schoolwork tests and you know  Just the general things of life and you know, she's making soap and doing stuff. So long story short  Christmas evening, this would be the last uh  Ordered for taking for soap. We're going to shut it down for next year  So she can focus on her sports and the other things that she wants to do and it's totally fine  But my point is that my kid is one of the happiest kids on earth, you know  But her mom's a great mom. I do the best I can but even she was just super sad and down for a day  And if you don't think to take the time to check on your kids or your parents or your loved ones your significant other  Sometimes that moment can cascade into something else. So make sure you're paying attention. Make sure you're looking out and again  Merry christmas. Happy new year. Happy hanukkah happy kwanzaa happy whatever you celebrate  But make sure you check on the people that are alone in the world because I love you. They love you  We love you. Merry christmas. And you know what else they say another twits in the can
