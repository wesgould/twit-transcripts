You're doing a secret project. I'm an angel investor  in it. Clipisodes. How do you get to that? Clipisodes.com? Clipisode. Clipisode.co.  Nobody knows what it is yet? Or is there a little information on the website? There's actually a  video from a little launch conference. So you guys can check that out. A little plug there. And  Brian, of course, was the co-founder of Engadget. It's been a huge week in the news and we're going  to get right to it. Apple, of course, has been leading things off. And the iPhone 7, I got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  talk first about the car project. Obviously people were reading about Project Titan for the past  couple of years. Actually, they hit somewhere around a thousand employees. It was reported.  And then this week, Apple, I'm luxury car maker McLaren. If you don't know McLaren,  it's a couple of thousand people. I think they make about 500 million pounds a year. And they  make of course, $300,000 and $1.5 million sports cars. But they also do carbon fiber and a bunch  of other materials. Apple obviously has said nothing. McLaren has denied it, which is  obviously proof that it's obviously well underway. And they want a higher price. What does this mean

Start time: 325.74
End time: 383.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  in terms of the Apple car? My best friend is one of the 12 guys who built the iPhone and his brother  still works at Apple. And this is when you get Apple people together, this is what we argue about  in Cecily. Are they building a car? Are they doing something else? But think about what a car,  let's go 10 years, 15 years in the future. First of all, we're not going to buy a car 15 years out.  No car ownership. You'll be just time sharing. Not unless you just want an antique or a  race car or something like that. A car to just be, you know, if you're a rich person, sure.  Normal people are going to get their car delivered off of Uber. Because if you have a self-driving  car, it's going to be way cheaper than owning your own car and better. And it's always going  to be up to date, blah, blah, blah. But think about, I like to think about Elon Musk.  And I gave him $1,000 of my money to buy the Tesla 3, right? So I did 400,000 other people.

End time: 426.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  you're talking about close to $20 billion. Now, what do we really want in a car? I've seen that  35 fighter jet and it costs a billion dollars. And I've talked to the pilots about it. And they  said, we'll never lose to an F-16, partly because I can see you and you can't see me. Right. They  are wearing augmented reality glasses as a pilot. And I want the same thing in my car. I don't want  to see the sides of the car. And BMW and OGG already demonstrated this. Put cameras along the  ridge of the car and let me see through the car. So if you put, and I've seen this video, it's on

Start time: 426.16
End time: 445.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the internet 10 years ago, somebody had done it in China as a proof of concept. They put cameras  in the front of a car, sort of like underneath the engine to see the road. Then they put screens  where the floorboards were. And so when you look down, you have this incredible vertigo that, oh  my God, my feet are about to hit the ground and rip off. But you could see through it. So you're

Start time: 445.40
End time: 478.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  saying the ability to see with goggles, everything around you. Not only to think about what Elon is  doing, he's putting sensors in the car that help it self drive, that enables self driving, right?  Front facing radar, for instance, dual cameras that do depth maps and all sorts of stuff.  Why can't I see that data visualized in my glasses so that I can see through fog,  I can see threats to me and the car coming, right? Even if I'm manually driving.

Start time: 478.38
End time: 481.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brian, this all becomes moot when you have self driving, though. You're just...

Start time: 481.86
End time: 500.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I think what he's describing is like Daredevil for race cars.  You can see through, because if you think of the sensors that they're putting on these things,  even the, was it Pittsburgh, they had those tests? And half of the stuff isn't really visual.  It's this radar stuff to see what's coming and to sense all these threats. So it doesn't matter  what the weather is, it doesn't matter if it's nighttime. It's just pretty amazing.

Start time: 501.02
End time: 531.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to bring that back to the part of where we're talking about Apple and why they're even  thinking about this. It feels like Apple's been rebooting the car project in multiple different  ways. So this is part of the Apple process, but never usually so publicly. The idea that  acquisitions would leak would not have happened five years ago.  Or mass firings.  Mass firings. And now it happens. And the style of acquisitions has certainly changed.  Like when I was editor of Mashable, I think I wrote about two acquisitions. None of them were  more than 30 million. And now you're talking about multiple multi-billion dollar acquisitions.

Start time: 531.58
End time: 563.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The McLaren acquisition would be a couple of billion, two, three, four million it looks like,  would be the biggest. The first one obviously being Beats. But this, I think, shows if they do  buy this, that they might be willing to be a house of brands as opposed to the branded house.  In that Apple would never let somebody else make something that has to be made here. But with Steve  Gahn, maybe Tim Cook's like, we could do what Facebook did, which is have Instagram, WhatsApp,  and Facebook. Or Google has YouTube.

Start time: 563.74
End time: 642.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Here's where I think Tim is going. He knows mixed reality glasses are coming. There's nine  companies working on them, including Magic Leap, which got $1.3 billion without having a customer  or a product. Microsoft has HoloLens cooking and it's an amazing product, even though it's too big  and too expensive for normal people. But we know this is coming sometime in our future.  Mixed reality, augmented reality. Not virtual.  You're going to see stuff on the table walking around with these glasses, right?  Apple hired many, many people in this industry, including buying the company that invented it,  called PrimeSense. They make a 3D sensor. Google's bringing out a competitor to this in a month or in  a few days on October 4th, the Tango sensor. That's going to enable all sorts of new things  on our face to sense the world and put interface objects on top of the world. It's a really deep  shift in terms of user interface. Every time there is a deep shift in user interface,  we call them paradigm shifts or something like that. My book calls them transformations.  Big companies go away. When we went from DOS to Windows, Borland and WordPerfect went away.  When we went from Windows to Touch on the phone, Blackberry and Nokia went away.

Start time: 645.26
End time: 652.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who loses big when these glasses come out? Who's going to win augmented mixed reality?  If you had to pick one company, two companies?

Start time: 653.96
End time: 666.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is the big question. Tim Cook knows what's coming. He's bought 13 or 15 companies to make  these. If he messes up, in other words, he has the recipe on the table to make a great product.

Start time: 667.70
End time: 671.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if he messes up augmented reality, it could be Apple that goes away?

Start time: 671.66
End time: 815.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, not Apple. Because I think they have so much money, they're not going away.  It would take a long time.  It would take a couple of misses. Tim Cook's gone.  Oh, Tim Cook's gone if he messes up.  And here's how I think Tim is going to announce the iPhone 8 next year, September 2017.  We're going to be sitting there, all three of us are all in forms. And the lights are going to go  down. The music's going to go down. And there's going to be three quotes in white up on the  projection screens. Somebody like Walt Mossberg saying, Apple's innovation is dead.  And New York Times says, Apple's boring again. And USA Today says something else.  There's lots of quotes. I've said some of these quotes. Fred Wilson, who's the co-founder of  Wired, not Fred Wilson, Fred Davis, says that he's tired of Apple. There's plenty of people  who are saying this. So imagine those three quotes go up. And then Tim Cook walks out and says,  There are many in this community who think I haven't been doing my job for the last five years.  Right.  There's many in this community who think I lost Steve Jobs' playbook, even though he personally  handed it to me. And in his mind, he's going to say, or to you, he's going to say, in the next  60 minutes, you're going to see more innovation from Apple than it has ever delivered in the  past 40 years, which is coming.  You think so?  I'm not sure if it's next year or the next year after that. There is so much new stuff coming  that he could say. And the iPhone 8 already has an edge-to-edge screen, which has 30% more pixels.  He'll say, why do you need that virtual reality? Then he'll turn the phone over and he goes,  You know this company, Microsoft, they have this product called HoloLens? That came from  the Xbox team, the Kinect sensor. Where did the Kinect sensor come from?  Where did the Kinect sensor come from? PrimeSense. I bought the company that invented this new thing.  Boom. And here it is.  It's in the phone, right? A 3D sensor. Tango is shipping this in October.  So over and over and over, he's going to bring out new things. Artificial intelligence,  augmented reality, blah, blah, blah. And it's going to be these glasses.  So what is Elon Musk going to do with glasses? That's what I'm wondering.  Yeah. So what do you-  Because they're going to ship about the same time as I get my Model 3.

Start time: 816.12
End time: 837.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ben, what do you think? Is Apple so far behind now that they won't be able to catch up in augmented  reality, virtual reality? Right now, just so people can recap, you have Oculus, Magic Leap,  Sony, HTC, Google, Microsoft, all with major products in market.  They're not-

Start time: 837.80
End time: 840.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Magic Leap's not in market.  That same happened with tablet toy back then.

Start time: 840.55
End time: 868.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess so.  Apple is not behind for how Apple does it. And I make this very strong argument of how  Apple's process is, is never to be first. They will wait a couple of years. That's fine.  Let the market develop. Honestly, the VR market is still not that big yet.  It's still not super accessible. You're only starting to see-  Too expensive.  Too expensive.  Too nerdy.  Especially the high-end stuff. You have to buy a computer and you have to do all the setup.

Start time: 869.00
End time: 879.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You want wind scale. You want six degrees of freedom. There's four problems with mobile-based  VR. Six degrees of freedom is one. When you get a vibe, an HTC vibe, like I have- You have one in  your house yet?

Start time: 881.62
End time: 909.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You have one in your-  You have the HTC vibe.  We can play Frisbee with each other, right? Over the internet. We can throw  basketballs together. We can shoot each other. We can do archery together. Infinite things we  can do. Ski jumping's coming in December. Blah, blah, blah. That's what you want. You want the  ability to play with other people over the internet. Using your hands, using your face,  using your body. You can't do that with mobile.  No.  And it's coming. And when it does come, it's going to be cheap because you already have a  supercomputer in your-

Start time: 909.28
End time: 921.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, and Apple realizes this and they understand that and they're building for that,  that they don't need to be first to market. They just need to be best at market. It didn't  matter that people put out 15 different kinds of tablets before-

Start time: 921.62
End time: 1003.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The counterpoint would be the Apple Watch has been completely underwhelming.  Has anybody here wearing one?  Nope.  Has anyone here bought one?  Yeah.  You bought one?  It's never bought one.  Two out of four of us bought it. We don't wear it. The new one, marginally better,  but still not as good as my Fitbit or equal. That's a lackluster product launch. And the iPhone 7,  I've been playing with it for a couple of days. The camera seems noticeably better,  but not incredibly. The screen seems maybe perhaps noticeably better, but not incredible.  And I have to say, taking the phone jack out, I didn't think that this would be a big deal.  I've now had like two or three instances in a weekend that make it absolutely infuriating.  Number one, I was driving and I was going to make a phone call. I like to use my headset  because it's better fidelity. And I was charging, had low battery charge. I had to choose between  power and this. Then somebody had a stereo system at the house I was staying at this weekend and  they wanted me to plug in to the jack I didn't have and then I have to go find the dongle.  What a horrible idea. And really the horrible idea about this, removing the phone jack is,  they could have made the dongle have a pass-through power. Why does the dongle not have pass-through  power? Just like when you get your MacBook, they have this new USB-C, you lose the Mag connector.  Again, it's like how many different concurrent plugs is Apple going to support?

Transcript:  Steve Jobs has done this several times to us in his history.  I know, it's so courageous.  He took away the floppy drive and people had the same arguments, the same exact arguments.  What am I going to do without a floppy drive? I can't even load software on it.  So you don't buy it?  There's a revolution in audio coming. Doppler Labs is one of the companies that's bringing this.  They handed me headphones at Coachella. They're $200 headphones. They have a microphone processing  and a speaker and they block the real audio from coming to your... And keep in mind, you're at  Coachella. $2 million worth of audio gear aimed at your head.

Start time: 1056.22
End time: 1071.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's not that you turn that down, but you can pick which kind of audio you turn up or down.  You can turn up just voice, you can turn up just treble. There's all sorts of things that  can do and I understand that. I still think it's not quite the right decision the way they did it.  In five words, you're not going to care.

Transcript:  They're coming with all sorts of magical things. Once you cut that cord, and I think this is where  Apple's going, once you cut the cord, you can have a translator. If you're speaking Chinese,  sure, that makes total sense for me.  You can do this kind of audio processing, get rid of noise. The noise canceling on Doppler Labs is  way better than a Bose headphone. There's a revolution coming in audio and nobody has seen  it because you have to have one of these in your ears.

Transcript:  Let's go back to... Should we cut to a break? You think we should do a quick commercial here?  All right, hold on a second. Hold that thought. When we get back, Apple is looking at a company  called Lit Motors. It's up on my iPad screen here. Lit Motors makes essentially a motorcycle  in a metal cage that has a gyroscope in it. We had this at the launch festival a couple times.  It does not fall over. You can't make it fall over. If you skid or you flip it, you're going  to be wearing a three-point harness. Will Apple buy this company? Snapchat has come out with their  own glasses finally. Google has their big announcement. The person running Oculus,  the co-founder, is a secret troll on Reddit maybe and Robert wants him fired when we get back on

Transcript:  this Week in Tech. All right, we're going to have more with Twit and the gang. I'm going to give the  big brains a time to cool and rest. Smoke them if you got them kids. Well, I talk a little bit about  Automatic, our great sponsor. They've been a really good sponsor of all of our shows, but also I think  a really great product. I've loved it. It's for the OBD2 port. That's the on-board diagnostics port  on every vehicle made since 1996. You've got one. You do. It's right. Look, you may never have seen  it. It's under your steering wheel, down there by where your knees are. If you did see it, by any  chance, you probably just assumed, well, it's a port for the technician at the dealership to check  the car. That's true. That's its intent, but it's an open port and it's an open standard. Automatic  makes a really cool dongle. Just plugs right into the port, gets its power from the port without  draining your battery, has Bluetooth, so it pairs with your phone, Android or iOS, and then you get  all this information from your car. It makes your car smart, like what that light on the dashboard  means. In fact, it's a great thing if you've got teens to put in there because there's all sorts of  features like geo-fencing and you can even on Android phones turn off texting automatically  with the automatic. There's a lot of really nice stuff. Once you get that automatic on your OBD port  and your automatic software. Now, the nice thing is there's no subscription. There's no monthly fee  and the new automatic has added 3G. This is the automatic pro. It has 3G. I don't know. That's kind  of amazing. In the automatic and still no subscription fee. Free. 3G. So, for instance,  you don't have to have your phone with you. This is why it's great for teenagers. You can see where  the car is. You can see where it's parked even if you're not in the car. And it's really, really  cool. They integrate with everything like Concur and Expensify if you track business versus pleasure.  Mileage. It works with your Nest thermostat. So like you're coming home and your house, you know,  the heater comes on or the AC comes on. You can ask your Amazon Echo where you parked your car.  There's a skill for the automatic. Where did I park my car? Or how much gas is in the tank? That's  a really good one. I use that one a lot. And this is great. Automatic pro detects severe accidents  and will get you human help. Will actually call for help even if you can't. Trained responders will  call for help. That is real peace of mind if you're a parent or for anybody. Automatic works on nearly  every car made after 96. It just takes minutes to connect minutes, seconds. You just push it in.  The hardest thing is figuring out where is my port. And then, oh yeah. And then you pair it with your  phone and boom. By the way, it also works with the Apple Watch and the Pebble. So you can,  I mean, this thing is so slick. It basically makes it a smart car. No matter what kind of car it is.  Automatic pro. Now normally it's 129.95. Remember there's no monthly fee, no subscription. The 3G  is free, but we have an offer code that'll save you 20 bucks. Use the offer code TWIT. Go to  automatic.com slash TWIT. Automatic spelled the way it is in the dictionary. Automatic.com slash  TWIT.

Transcript:  Okay. Thank you, Leo and Automatic for supporting independent media like This Week in Tech.  Leo's voice is pretty great. He's a great radio guy. Thanks for letting us  host and trash the studio. Oh, we forgot about that part. We're not going to trash the studio.  Oops. Hey, taking a quick detour. A person named Palmer Freeman-Lucky is the co-founder of Oculus.  Oculus makes VR, speaking of VR. And we don't want to drift too much into politics, but  he is the co-founder of Oculus, as I said, which is obviously a Facebook company. Facebook paid  $2 billion for the company. And he has apologized for giving money to a company called Nimble America.  Give 10 dimes to it. $10,000. And he is claiming that it wasn't him on Reddit trolling about Trump  and doing a bunch of other stuff. He says, I am a libertarian who has publicly supported Ron Paul  and Gary Johnson. In the past, I've planned to run Gary. I'm committed to the principles of fair  play and equal treatment. I did not write the Nimble Rich Man post, nor did I delete the account  reports that I'm the founder of employees of Nimble America are false. I don't have plans to  donate beyond what I've already given to Nimble America. Still, my actions are my own. I do not  risk Oculus. I'm sorry for the impact my actions are having on the community. This has created  some kind of massive brouhaha. Brian, what's going on here? That's a great question. So the

Start time: 1455.12
End time: 1516.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  funny thing is people are like, I own a Vive. Like, it's not, it's not, I'm not in this. Yes.  And, you know, because like, like buying an Oculus Rift somehow makes you a Trump supporter.  So he's kind of in trouble for having a political opinion in one sense, but he's also in trouble for  helping people go nuts on people. Right. That's the bad part, the bullying, right. So sponsoring  the bullying and his apology isn't a, it's not apology. So, so don't, don't say it's an apology.  It's more like a, it's, it's, it's his explanation. And he doesn't specifically, he apologizes for the  fact that the company is now having problems with the community. I'm very sorry that this is  happening and he's not really sorry he did anything. And then what he also said was that wasn't me,  but the journalist who uncovered it all said, well, what he's doing is he's kind of parsing  this in a crazy, crazy way, which is somebody else set up the account. I stepped in and wrote  the stuff, sent the money, and then I got out again. So it's not really my account, but I'm  the only person who ever posted under that name. Right. See, so it's not, it's not, I didn't do it.  It's, it's not my account. Oh, whose account is it? Somebody, somebody set it up for me to go in  and type all the stuff. Got it. And then you type the stuff in the chat. Now I know how to deflect

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this stuff in the future. If I want to create trolling accounts. Right. It's pretty amazing  because what this Nimble group did was basically post like a lot of the abhorrent Hillary Clinton  misogynistic crazy memes. It's a kind of like a Reddit trolling kind of thing. Not that Reddit  is only one thing. Just to be clear, I think Reddit gets an unfair kind of reputation that it's all  trolls. Reddit is like 99% probably not trolls, but the 1% of trolls are so vocal and so insane.  It does kind of paint them. They're free reign. But trolling seems to be  this high art form that it's being lampooned in. I don't know if anybody's watching the South Park  season 20, but it's essentially literally, if you haven't watched season 19 or 20, it's literally  about Twitter and trolling. Robert, you wrote that Palmer lucky that Zuck should fire him. Zuck  follows you. Zuck likes your posts. Now and again, not this one. You know Zuck personally.  You've known him since the beginning. It's inevitable that he will read your post.  Why do you feel that Palmer should be fired? Palmer lucky. And I got to split up my ego into

Start time: 1588.16
End time: 1661.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  two places. One is the politics, which I find important, but let's put those aside.  I've gone around the world many times this year and I've met with many, many VR developers.  And most of the coolest VR developers are developing only for the vibe because it has  room scale and because it's out with controllers today. I don't have Oculus controllers and I'm  in the middle of the VR industry, so they haven't shipped yet. So this guy hasn't done his job.  He's losing to a competitor that should not be losing to. And he's not positioned well for  augmented reality. He's not positioned well for this coming fight, which is a multi-billion dollar  fight. I mean, Nvidia and Qualcomm and Intel alone are spending billions of dollars in the GPU  at the base level. That gives you a sense of how much importance this industry is putting on this  stuff. And this other thing was the fire that lit the fuel for me. That this guy's not doing  his job and Facebook is not positioned well in VR and that they're not taking their jobs.

Transcript:  and now you're out. Tony Fidel was fired, right? So one, Palmer has not really been the person  running. No, but he's the visual face and he made promises over and over to the community.  Look, I agree with you. I agree with you for doing, like you're taking aside even the politics of the  whole thing, which alone should probably be fired for the like performance. You're saying like it  needs new leadership. I can't disagree with that either. Like so much more press, so much more hype,  so much more interest in the Veev. And it's just a stronger product at the moment. Like the entire  the entire lucky thing is just as well as important, like regardless of which side,  spending your money to troll and to harass people is just not okay in general.  Certainly not. I mean, we have to be able to separate also here that it's one thing to have

Yes, half the country would be fired.  We have to fire half the country tomorrow. It makes no sense. Even if you, and it's a very  divisive time right now.

Transcript:  Very divisive. We can get into that on This Week in Politics another time.  But there is something qualitatively different about a political opinion  and active trolling. I think we all realize active trolling is, I know it's funny for 12-year-old  boys or 50-year-old men who want to be like 12-year-old boys, but it's actually hurtful.  It's kind of childish and it's not something a senior executive at a company should be doing,  unless they're putting their name on it and like, I'm going to troll you by telling you your product  sucks, like the guy from T-Mobile does of AT&T or whatever, Verizon says you charge too much.  There's something about this, you know, and then it came up with Peter Till as well. If you do  anonymous bad behavior or anonymous borderline behavior, it becomes 10 times worse. It's almost

Start time: 1803.54
End time: 1810.46

Transcript:  It's just weird. We're seeing a lot of weird things happen because of this election and with  the companies because Facebook has gone out of their way. What's particularly, maybe not problematic  about this actually, now that I think about it, maybe this actually helps. It actually balances  it out, but Facebook had their thumb on the scale when it came to liberal stuff. The people who were  doing the trending topics were very clearly trending liberal and Zuck went out of his way to have  Glenn back in a bunch of conservatives. So actually maybe this helps Facebook. Maybe this  whole thing was done intentionally. There is the other thing, what's the actual long-term damage?

Start time: 1850.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  number one? Yeah, but he was the public face of this team. He was on stage at conferences,  upload has featured him many times, interviewed him many times, right? We're probably going to  interview him for our new show that we're going to do on VR that Jason and I are starting a podcast  next month. But he can't be anymore because he's so divisive in terms of the politics. Half of the  people are going to go against him. That's not good for a company. It is really a big-  Second, he's losing. He's losing and somebody needs to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's not just politics either. Keep in mind the reason the community is against him  and flipped so violently, including Noni Di Lampena, who was in the room with him when  he was inventing it. She came out very strongly that he really went over the line with her with  this. Again, there was a precondition that was happening already. He made promises to the VR  community that Oculus was going to be an open system. He had to take those words back.  He did several things like this in the public eye that set the-

Start time: 1927.54
End time: 1953.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now his character is being just sort of dismantled and it's very hard when you're the evangelist  to have these things. That's why you don't see Zuck or other people. If you look, Jack at Twitter,  to segue, and obviously this week we saw that Twitter is obviously for sale. They're trying to  sell it because they can't fix it so they think it could be a part of something else. Jack has  been known for being on the other side, being Black Lives Matter, very liberal.

Start time: 1954.42
End time: 1978.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Now A7 just said, so you have to be a Democrat to sell VR. That's not true. That's not what we're  saying. You do have to have credibility with the community you serve if you're going to be a leader  in a company. If you lose that credibility for any reason, a scandal or something, you're going  to get removed, right? CEOs get fired all the time for some things. Yeah, I mean, amongst the CEO crowd,

Start time: 1979.80
End time: 2025.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there are a ton of people who I've spoken to and said, hey, what's your position? And they say,  my position is X. Don't ever tell people my position. My position is, you know, I hope that  you vote this year. The intelligent people are just taking the position, as one intelligent person  told me. Just tell people to vote because 75% of people who are not voters, if they vote, vote for  Hillary Clinton. So that's why you're seeing the Democrats really pushing hard for more people to  vote, Republicans pushing very hard for less people to vote and making it harder to vote because it  just happens to be in this election. The people who are not registered will lean that way. Brian,  when we look at all of this and Google, you have Twitter now is sort of too far to left.  What do you think happens with Twitter? Is it Google who will buy it?

Transcript:  Could anybody conceivably fix it? That's the other sort of situation because Jack's been half time.  Jack's a pretty bright guy, obviously, but he's half time. The product has not gotten  demonstrably better. No, no, no. They haven't fixed it.  And he's made a lot of weird decisions like banning Milo and getting very involved in policing  speech seems like a really weird decision. Like you don't see Zuck coming down to that level ever  and like picking what's in trending topics or taking stuff out like Jack's getting a little  too emotionally involved in the words. It hasn't helped, right? It does not help.

Start time: 2061.12
End time: 2095.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Of course. So he shows up with a hashtag t-shirt on at a riot. Yeah. And that's wonderful. That's  fantastic. Go. You don't have an opinion, but it hasn't helped the product and the company at all.  I don't know who buys it. So I've looked around at media companies and other tech companies and  where does it fit in? And, you know, it's a phenomenon. It's a necessity to have this  place for the free speech and the ability to reach out to a celebrity and get something back.  It's not growing, but it won't go, it won't. But what is it good for? What does it add? Like what?  People say, oh, Apple will buy it. No, they're not. You know, like what does it add to Apple  to buy Twitter? Look at any other Salesforce. I think they're about the same size.

End time: 2132.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, we understand why it's interesting to Microsoft and Google because they both have  search engines being in Google search because that data isn't been indexed, right? It's being put out  for the first time. Why is it important to Salesforce? That I don't get. Why is Salesforce  so interesting? I know Benioff loves Twitter. He's on Twitter all day long. Does anybody  heard why it would be important to Salesforce? The sales leads? I think that they're thinking

Start time: 2132.60
End time: 2171.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about expanding their business as part of his thinking. And this opens up-  Into what? Consumer. Salesforce as consumer.  And they also, and also the social feeds feed a lot into their data engine, into Einstein,  into the Einstein project and into AI and into a lot of the things they're doing. So I get it.  Like the purchase doesn't make sense in the sense that they don't have the money to buy it.  Right. Like, like, I mean, then again, they try to  get LinkedIn. So, you know, that's not a lack of money is not going to stop Benioff, but it,  like, it makes sense that they partner with the right company. It's like, I love-

He gave it half. And it, it has not even  gotten marginally better. The product is not even marginally better. Let's, let's call it what it is.

If you had to place a bet, if I had to say all your  gadgets on the table, we each have to bet all of our gadgets on us and that we've bought in  the last two years, what company do you bet buys it?

An exec at Google R&D told me that we're not going to use the phone company in five years.  We're going to use wireless coming from Google, from a plane, from a hot air balloon,  and from a satellite network. You believe that? I do. Okay. Do you notice what blew up on that

Transcript:  internet in Africa. Built by an Israeli company. First of all, I don't believe when some executive  like Mark Zuckerberg says, I'm just building this for poor people in Africa. It's for everybody.  Yeah, that's a fair point. I mean, I don't think you can trust anything Zuckerberg says to be  actually. No, he's signaling to his employees that I have a new mission, which is bring  internet to everybody, right? To the world that it doesn't have it yet. Great mission. But it's  not just for the poor people in Africa. So you think he wants to do a low earth orbit satellite  system? Google is building it too. They have a fiber network that is unparalleled. Google has  more fiber. They can get a packet from here to India faster than the phone company can because  they have more fiber from here to India. They're building, and it's not just Apple and Google,  there's startups that we know that are building satellites. SpaceX is doing it. They've been

Start time: 2345.40
End time: 2349.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  public about it. They're going to do a low earth orbit satellite system. And so if people don't

Start time: 2349.12
End time: 2358.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  know what that is. And that's a backhaul so that the satellites can share packets with each other  and put packets around the earth and then distribute those packets down to something on the ground or

Start time: 2358.60
End time: 2382.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  something close to the ground. It's a pizza-sized box. For people who haven't seen this, I guess  somebody can Google it right now and they could tell us some of the names of the companies that  do it. But the difference, as I understand it, as was explained to me by people involved,  low earth orbit satellites have a narrower field of coverage, right? And they burn up,  I don't know what you call that, aperture. But anyway, because they're lower, they don't cover

Start time: 2382.56
End time: 2394.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  as much land. It's opportunity. So if you're a geosynchronous one, you're too far away to  get a good picture. But if you're low enough to get a good picture, you have 12 minutes of  going across your house. And those are only 12 minutes because of shoot. I explained it to my

Start time: 2394.34
End time: 2411.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  kids a couple days ago. And so this low earth will require, I was told, 850 satellites to cover  humanity, major populations. And they will burn out of the atmosphere every number of years. They  don't know exactly what that is, but call it three, four, five years. So you're constantly going to be

Start time: 2411.82
End time: 2415.80

Start time: 2415.88
End time: 2430.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  better, right? Exactly. But the latency has changed. So somebody, a twisted mystery, is saying,  oh, the latency is the issue. That's with the huge satellite system and all this other garbage that's  up there already that take a second to bounce things back and forth because it's so far up.  And they want to have such a wide aperture because they want to cover everything.

And I have to say, no matter what I used,  I had Airport Extremes, I had that Asus, there was just never any Wi-Fi throughout the house  or it would drop out and my wife would complain and say, oh, I'm not getting Wi-Fi in the bedroom.  And it was just a constant battle. I think you probably know what I'm talking about. Wi-Fi  was easy when you were the only person that had it. But now it's congested, the bands are congested,  there's people everywhere, the distances. It seems like it works worse than it ever did  until I got an arrow, E-E-R-O. It is something very, very different. First of all,  it's a whole home system. It blankets your entire house. And you could start with one  arrow, but you probably should get the, if you have Wi-Fi issues, get the kit of three  and you put the one, you connect that one to your cable modem. If you want, all of them can be  connected. You don't have to, but you can have one base station and then satellite units. It's mesh.  So it's very flexible. And then there's an app, Android or iOS, that helps you pair the additional  units, helps you place them and pair them. And now once they're paired, oh, and by the way,  that is the easiest thing in the world. You're going to just, I can get Wi-Fi now in places I  never got it before, including as I walk up the drive and down the street. It's great. WPA2  encryption. Don't worry. The best encryption and the Wi-Fi app connects you to the Eero folks.  So they are constantly updating. I get firmware updates. In fact, the first time you install it,  it will examine your system and will add software depending on what kind of devices. If you have a  Roku or an Apple TV, it goes, okay, okay, we're going to do QoS. It's so smart. You also can do  the things if you want to do port forwarding, no problem. It even has reservations. It's a  sophisticated system. It'll give you an idea of your bandwidth. It's doing bandwidth checks  and it looks great. It's sleek. No antennas everywhere. Oh, and by the way, a 30-day money  back guarantee. You're not getting my Eero back. My wife at least had killed me. It really works  and I really want you to try it. We've got free overnight shipping. So if you're in a Wi-Fi  emergency, you can have it tomorrow. Go to Eero.com and select overnight shipping at checkout. And  then the code for that is TWIT, of course, T-W-I-T. I have to admit I was skeptical at first. I have  even tried things like Ubiquiti, some really complicated solutions. This has all the power  of those more complicated enterprise systems, but the ease of use, it's the easiest Wi-Fi system I've  ever set up. Anybody can do it and it solves a massive problem.

Brace yourselves.  If there's kids in the room, you want to get them out. But here is Robert Scoble wearing the new  Snapchat spectacles. If you don't know about Snapchat, you can take it off the screen.  There's multiples of this photo. I love the fact that the producers here are just so quick to get  something off the screen that's just absolutely abhorrent. Okay. Here we go. I think we just had  to put the explicit on the iTunes for this show. So let's watch the video here and I think we can  talk over it. But as people know, I don't know, four or five years ago, Snapchat rather, bought  a promising company that was making video sunglasses. And it was an Indiegogo and a Kickstarter.  It was one of these like kludgy hardware projects that you figured, ah, they're never going to  deliver it. I believe they did deliver their product. It was never shipped it. They never  shipped it because I went to one of the pages and they said they got it. I have pictures of it.

The way these products, the product works is  if you press a button on the corner, it lights up an LED circle for 10 seconds records, whatever you  see and post it automatically to your Snapchat. You never have to take your phone out of your pocket.  You never have to authenticate or whatever it is. And critically, and I think that this is the big  difference, Google Glass resulted in many people getting punched in the face, beat up or many  arguments and fights started because there was three or four. Okay, whatever. There's three or  four that were well documented, one by a woman who I think was trying to, Sarah Slocum, the,  the sense I got was she was trying to provoke people with them. She was, I mean, let's be honest.  She was provoking people. That's how we are, right? No, that's the deranged, that was deranged. She  was literally walking up to people in a bar. We're disruptors. We're wearing weird things on our face.

And then she would do it in a bar in San Francisco, which by  the way, I don't think you want to go into a bar in San Francisco or anywhere. And then especially  a dive bar, then go up to somebody who's that drunk and say, can I record you? We're not even asked to

Transcript:  normal sunglasses. Times have changed. We have Snapchat now. And Snapchat is a daily video show  about your life. It's split up into little segments. We might call them in TV land shots, right?  Where right now somebody is choosing who to focus the cameras on. It's a shot. And probably we're on  air for five seconds or 10 seconds while we're talking. And in Snapchat, that's what you're  doing. You're capturing videos in a small segment. And it builds a narrative about your day. And you  can actually grab the day and store it to your phone or share it out on other places like Facebook

There was the person that was older, a little heavier,  standing over a tub, I think. And she's like, I can't unsee this. Then you have to see it.  She meant to send it to a friend and she sent it to her followers instead.

They don't have to make a noise, but they make a noise to alert people when you're in the  gym club shower. So I think they're doing this the right way. These are crazy. You can't miss them.  They're not a Google Glass. It's also used to open web browsers that only you can see and all this  other junk that that was supposed to do. Right. These are single function.  Single function. I'm here to do this crazy thing. And you really can't hide them in a  shower somewhere. Right?

Transcript:  Most people don't understand why Google Glass caused these fights. It really doesn't have  anything to do about the camera. Because I was in the Sahara tent at Coachella and everybody's  recording on their phones. But there was two guys in front of me. One talked to the other and said,  I need to get away from the Google Glass people. I wasn't wearing it because I didn't wear it then.  There was two people behind me who had Google Glass on. So I grabbed these two guys and said,  what makes you nervous about this? You're in a place where everybody's recording.  You're on camera. For sure.  And they said, it just makes me feel bad. Two reasons I pulled out of them. One, there's a  screen between them that they can't see and they can't renegotiate the social contract that we  have with each other. If you start playing with Facebook right now in the middle of the show,  I'd slap your hand. Why are you doing that when there's something more important to pay for?  And the second thing is they felt that the person who had them on had information about them that  they didn't have about the people that had them on. So they had an advantage, an information

Start time: 3092.74

I actually like this angle where if I was thinking about getting a GoPro,  which could cost hundreds of dollars or more, right?  Yeah.  I'm going to get these instead.

Transcript:  So here's the feature that's missing from this that I thought...  I had just written about it last week because I heard this was coming.  The piece that's missing is it's not a DVR.  And what this really should be is it should always be recording.  I know this will get people punched in the face, but really where this is going...  And I think this will probably happen by 2020.  And I would fund a startup to do this because it's inevitable anyway,  so I'm not going to make a judgment call on it.  But if it's a DVR and at any point in time I can press it and go back on the last hour,  find that clip, right? And boom. So I don't have to press it.  I say, wow, that was a funny moment. Now I'm pressing it.

I think you're going to see a big load on 2017,  and it's going to be less, a little bit less than 2018 because it's a two,  every other year kind of product.

Start time: 3442.92
End time: 3471.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The thing we're all missing is there's some real technology in this product.  There's two lenses. There's a reason for that.  Because with two lenses, you can do a computer on the diff and you can build a point cloud,  a volumetric point cloud.  So I can capture you in three dimensions for VR and AR.  The algorithms that they're developing for AR, putting things on your face,  are getting really advanced for 2D.  Wait until they do it in 3D.

Start time: 3472.12
End time: 3520.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fairly clear that this is a step, a very pragmatic step towards augmented reality.  Correct?  Yeah.  I think we all agree on that.  Screens are just too expensive.  The screens are very expensive.  So if people get addicted to this, then I believe the second feature that's missing,  that would be pretty neat after the life DVR, I'll call it, the life DVR,  is over people's head, putting their last snap, if you're friends, who your friends in common are.  In other words, when you walk through the world and you go to a party,  you don't know who you know.  And you don't know who you've met before and you may not remember who their wife or their husband  is or their kids' names are or who they dated in your social circle.  You're going to actually have all that information floating on top of people's heads.  And that would really, really, really benefit Snapchat.  They can do a lot more than Bokeh.

Start time: 3520.80

Transcript:  People in the chat room are asking, what does this mean that you can do?  If you have depth information, you can turn this entire world into Minecraft, for instance.  And all of a sudden, Ben is a Minecraft character over there.  And the whole world is bricks, right?  And that helps me make better content.  Most people suck at content.

You know, this ostensibly audio-only conference calls.  But I do it with GoToMeeting.  And then that way, first of all, they've got a great  conference bridge system.  So it really, really works well.  And you don't have to use a phone system if you want.  You could do it on an iPad with the built-in data, with Wi-Fi.  You could do, I mean, it's very flexible.  But here's the other thing.  You're going to GoToMeeting and you say, well, I really need to show you this.  You can pop up your screen.  See?  Or, hey, I want to see you.  You could see each other through high-def video.  Many participants.  I'm always hesitant to use something with a new client, right?  I imagine you are too because you're pitching them and you don't want to make them jump  through hoops.  With GoToMeeting, it's really easy.  They get a link in their email.  It says, all right, Leo's going to have this meeting at 2 o'clock on Friday.  Click the link when it's time.  And if they don't have the software, it downloads it.  30 seconds later, it's up and running.  No problem.  It's very easy.  And you're having the conference call.  You're seeing each other.  And they're seeing your presentation.  They didn't have to jump through hoops.  Usually, they're very impressed.  They say, what is this?  I want to try it.  Well, you could try it right now, free, for 30 days.  GoToMeeting.com for a sales demo, presentation, for collaboration, for an ad hoc meeting.  Every meeting counts.  I love this.  I didn't know this.  9 out of 10 GoToMeeting customers say they close deals more than 20 times a week.  Say they close deals more than 20% faster.  It is a very powerful tool.  You will love it.  Your clients and colleagues will love it, too.  GoToMeeting.com.  Click the Try It Free button.  And we thank GoToMeeting.  They've been with us forever.  For a since like before the podcasts.

When we left, we were talking a bit about the bizarre case of a Verge employee.  For people who don't know, Verge is like the third iteration of Gizmodo and Engadget.  It's actually the team from Engadget left Engadget AOL to go start the Verge.  And a reporter there, Chris Ziegler.  Have you ever met Chris?  Yeah.  You met him?  Yeah, I press conferences and stuff.  You've met Chris?  Okay.  I don't know him very well.  You got your eyes rolling, Ben.  Well, the whole thing.  I don't know him very well.  He always seemed nice.  He seemed like a nice person.  A former founding editor of the Verge was employed at Apple this summer while,  while he worked for the tech and culture website Verge.  Editor-in-chief Patel announced an open letter on Friday.  My good pal Lockhart Steel, who has the greatest name in all of publishing,  says that there was no editorial decision that he did that had any impact.  And they hadn't heard from him in a month.  You have met him, Robert, you've met him before.  Ben, you seem to know him a little bit better.  Ben, who is this person?  What the hell is going on?  Is this performance art?  Is this like a Mother Jones investigative piece where he's in the commands,  they're like, I went to work there and I did an investigative piece  and I tried to find out about the car.  What's going on?  It makes no sense.  Why would somebody do something like this?

But I'm still trying to piece it together, especially the part where  he hasn't been tweeting or saying a thing for 40-something days,  which is extremely weird.  And John Gruber during Fireball was looking and he could not find his name  in the Apple directory and you know he has access to everything at Apple.  So there's just like 18 minutes of mystery.

It took me a few years to earn their trust to even get to the events.  Like they're going to always go to their defaults or Walt Mossberg  or Gruber or someone like that.  New York Times USA Today.  No, the Zico thing makes no sense at all because the moment like  Apple's not going to let somebody if they knowingly know,  Apple's not going to let somebody work for both a tech publication and Apple.  So they had to fire him if they figured that out.

No, they didn't know he was gone.  So he was part of that second wave of Engadget, right?  Went and founded The Verge.  So he and Josh Tepolsky, they founded, they created The Verge.  So it was not like he's just a hired blogger for it, right?  And so he was there.  And then this thing happens in June, July.  July, he starts working for Apple, right?  But then he disappears.  So he wrote a couple things in July, maybe.  Then in August, they're just writing him, hey, dude, are you alive?  What's going on?  We've had this happen with bloggers.  We have a hundred friends in common with this guy.  Yeah.  So I've seen a lot of these people, Josh Tepolsky's people come out and say,  like, I love the guy.  I don't know what happened here.  Break from reality.  The people on Twitter are savage.  There's a lot of funny things about this.  Working two jobs.  I wish I could work at The Verge.

Right?  Like we're all sitting here laughing about it because it is bizarre and it's unique.  But maybe the person is suffering and maybe there's something going on like that.  And in that case, it's great fodder for a roundtable discussion.  But I sincerely hope he's OK, which basically means I'm a 45-year-old kid now  that I'm not just making fun of him relentlessly.

Transcript:  Well, sure.  I mean, listen, some...  The idea that tech journalism is honest and upfront.  We know that train...  We all are in the business.  We know that train left the station a long time ago.  The number of people who are doing it right  is greatly outnumbered by the people who are doing it wrong.  We all agree on that.  I mean, people who do actual fact checking.  Well, no, I'm talking about fact checking.  You have TechCrunch releasing a story that like, you know,  Google bought a company for 600 million because they took it off the press wire  and they don't even call.  I mean, journalists don't have the time to make  phone calls to check or call sources anymore.  They just write posts without talking to anybody.  It's madness.

Transcript:  Speed matters.  Speed matters a lot in this business.  You know, I was the first person to tell Twitter that Steve Jobs had died.  Why?  Because Apple called Reuters and ABC Radio, ABC first.  And I was listening to ABC Radio and they came on  and they said, we just got a note from Apple that Steve Jobs has died.  I pulled over.  It took me two minutes.

Right?  And we know speed matters in some things like this.  It builds brands.  It builds audiences.  Right?  And so there's a lot of pressure to be first versus be right.

Start time: 4250.24
End time: 4270.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me ask a serious question because, you know, we talk about Steve and,  you know, obviously he's a big figure and casts a big shadow.  How much different would Apple's fate be right now in terms of like what we saw in the last launch or  just it's prominent in the industry?  How different would it be?  10% different?  100% different?  What do you think?

Transcript:  A huge number of innovations coming in the next 18 months to both Android and iPhone.  VR.  You're getting 3D sensors that map the world in 3D and you're going to get augmented reality  because the GPU in this phone is 10 times faster than the GPU in the Huawei phone,  which also has dual camera.  And that's the number three manufacturer in the world.  That GPU is going to matter to virtual reality.  They're coming out with eye sensors that are going to watch where your eyes look and it's  going to enable a new kind of rendering, a new kind of compression called foveated rendering  where it only needs to compress all the polygons and all the bitmaps where you're looking.  Everything else can remain a little bit blurry.  And so the GPU...

Start time: 4374.82
End time: 4376.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it sharpens where your eyes are focused.

Start time: 4377.00
End time: 4402.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The problem with VR right now is if you play Samsung's Gear VR,  mine only can play for 40 minutes.  It overheats.  It overheats and the phone goes off and the battery dies because it's sucking as much  battery as possible because the GPU is underpowered, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So this phone, I can see Apple coming out with a bunch of innovations for the phone.  And so is Google.  Google on October 4th this year is going to come out with some of these innovations, right?

Start time: 4402.40

Start time: 4422.78
End time: 4458.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's less like...  Google already has its messaging platform that's like Hangouts.  They already have messaging.  Allo is more like the M of...  Facebook's M or your Siri or...  Explain what that is to the audience that doesn't know Facebook.  I mean, it's a kind of chatbot in the sense that what Allo is doing is  helping you with different tasks, is understanding you.  It's less about WhatsApp communication from one person to another.  At least from what I've known.  I've only played with it just in brief bits and pieces.  Because I don't have an Android...  Are we going to play the video?

Start time: 4458.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So there's definitely messaging in it.  It's fun messaging, like all the iMessage additions, right?  The problem, the thing that's biting them is they kind of came out and said,  we're going to encrypt it all.  You're going to be fine.  It's going to be like a Snapchat, right?  Nobody can see your stuff.  They said, oh, wait a minute for us to help you with all the stuff you're saying.  We have to listen to everything and then store it.  Yeah, of course.  So they backpedaled all that.

Start time: 4485.74
End time: 4525.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But also because they have a secret deal with the White House in order to not have  the antitrust come down too hard on them that they're going to give back doors to  everything in the White House.  According, allegedly, from people I know who are smart.  There's some sort of relationship between Google and this White House where it's a  very cozy relationship.  Google went to visit the White House a lot in the Obama administration.  And they believe that the reason a lot of the, you know, FTC investigations got canned  on Google for antitrust were because of the back doors and a lot of the helping them.  This is a conspiracy theory, but it's pretty, pretty, there's a lot of smoke around this  conspiracy theory.

Start time: 4526.25

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they have to think of aloes like a combination.  You're seeing this more in a lot of messaging products.  Yes, there's the messaging and there's the fun stuff, but it has smart assistant, it  has the Google Assistant in there to add context into like part of the conversation.  Shopping, yes.  Or locations or suggestions.  And I don't, like, in the end, the only thing you really care about in messaging is scale.  Why do you use Facebook Messenger?  All your friends are on it.  Why do you use WeChat?  Your friends in China are on it.  But the smart assistant thing is happening more.  The chat bot, whatever you want to call that.  LinkedIn on Friday, what?  Yeah, a couple days ago had the launch of their bot, Inbot, in the LinkedIn messaging.

Start time: 4568.48

I mean, it's literally the signal to noise ratio on LinkedIn is literally 0% signal.

It's not that it's bad, it's that it's horrible.  It's literally like, I guess because they let people pay to email people who are not  connected to them.  100% of people who email me are literally trying to waste my time with something and  it's just like, really?  Are you not able to guess first name at whatever company name I work at?  Or any of the 10.  Or any of the 10 emails I podge at.

They should let you have your name at LinkedIn, mail.com or something like that.  Have it be a proper mail client, but have it just sort in tabs.  These are people you don't know.  These are people you're friends with.  And just make it super clear.  And it's two different groups of people.  I know that there's business models predicated on people being able to get to you,  but it's gotten so overwrought-  They do that on Facebook already.

When you plug in your Samsung phone, if it's one of the ones that were-  And Samsung 7S was the best phone reviewed ever in the history of all smartphones.

The largest hack by a magnitude. And it had people's security questions,  date of birth, passwords. I mean, it had everything.  And they knew about it, supposedly in 2014, and did not inform their users.  Is that even possible that Marissa would do something so incredibly irresponsible and dumb?  I'm not saying Marissa's dumb. I'm saying this is a dumb decision.  I have to be careful. I don't want to ruin all my relationships, but  kind of that ship has sailed at this point. But I mean, it's one thing for Marissa to not have done  a great job as CEO there and not been focused and gotten, but to hide a hack, if that's in fact what  happened. And it seems like that's where the evidence is suggesting that they actively hid a  hack. What is the liability on actively hiding a hack where people could have changed their passwords?

Even if it's not a lie, you're supposed to know,  you're supposed to have a security policy. So if you didn't have a security policy,  that major hacks went to the board level. The board is supposed to know.  So if the board knew and didn't do this, that would be fraud, which means massive shareholder  lawsuits. I mean, it would be actor fraud. It could be criminal fraud if they subverted this.  I don't want to say... I don't want to... I don't want to  destroy my relationship with anybody. We need more details.

We're hearing about this just happen more and  more. The standard for internet security is just horrendous in general.  It won't affect... Verizon will still acquire that.

I don't know if that's actually correct or not.  I'm probably one of the one anyway. But it's pretty dark. The extent of  hacking impacting the world is getting very severe.  Is it changing behavior?

I'm sorry.  You want a surface area that's really shut down. It shuts off the sensors on the phone.  Did you see Mark Zuckerberg puts a piece of tape over his...  And over there.

And Uber self-driving vehicles have been spotted on the streets of San Francisco,  not just on the test on the East Coast. And we're going to ask our panelists to tell us  when will the majority of rides in San Francisco be driven with level four autonomy?  In other words, no steering wheel.

We got a new iPhone. Maybe you're ready for a new phone. Problem is, you know, I find,  and I bet a lot of people do, the old phone works fine.  You want the new stuff, you want the new features, but the old phone works fine.  And it's hard to justify the expense. That's why I love Gazelle. Gazelle is a place you can go and  sell your old stuff to finance the new stuff. And that makes it so easy. You don't have time.  You don't have time to, you know, put a listing up and sell it and deal with the buyers and  the phone calls. I mean, maybe you do. But with Gazelle, it's very straightforward. Go right now.  Gazelle.com. So you got an old iPhone six, find out what it's worth.  That that by the way, is guaranteed for 30 days that price. So now's the time to do it.  Even if you don't have your iPhone yet, or you don't know if you're going to get a new  Pixel phone, because you have 30 days. So this will take you to the end of the month.  And then you can decide you get the by then you'll have the phone if you want it. If not,  no harm, no foul. You're no commitment. The only commitment is on their part to pay you that amount  of money. And you've got 30 days. Once you do get your new phone, you've transferred the data over,  you like it, it's all working. Then you pull the trigger Gazelle send you a box, they do all the  shipping for free. You pile that gadget in impact pile all your gadgets in get rid of them all clean  out your doors. There's money in those drawers. Send it to Gazelle. They'll wipe the data if you  forget to they even buy broken iPads and iPhones, they buy tablets, they buy computers, they buy  screens, a large variety of stuff at GAZ, E LLE, by the way, they also sell. So if you lose a phone  or you got got want to get a less expensive phone for your kids, because there's a great place to  get a gently used certified pre on when I say certified, I mean, they run it through a very  rigorous check. 30 point check even things like scratches to make sure that phone is fully  functional, works in all the major carriers. There's no carrier contract though, see, so it's  a good deal. And you can get a financing on checkout from a firm you can get a warranty from  assurance covers even things like cracked screens and water damage. Gazelle is really now full  service for buying and for selling everything you need. Check it out. The new gadgets are here,  which means you can get a great deal on a pre owned gadget, right? A lot.

On Monday, September 26th, a number of sites including YouTube, Facebook and Twitter will  be streaming the first of three presidential debates. There will even be a virtual reality  feed courtesy of NBC starting at 8 30 PM Eastern time. On Tuesday, September 27th, Elon Musk will  explain to everyone how he hopes to use SpaceX to colonize Mars someday during the Making Humans a  Multi-Planetary Species keynote at the annual International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara,  Mexico. On Wednesday, September 28th, Samsung will resume sales of its Galaxy Note 7 after a  tumultuous month of recalls thanks to its fiery battery debacle. Sales will begin in South Korea  and will resume in other markets as conditions allow. And on Friday, September 30th, Readability,  pretty popular read it later bookmarking service, will be shutting down after five years in the  business.

Transcript:  I'm obviously conflicted. I'm a shareholder in Uber and their self-driving vehicles have been  spotted on the streets of San Francisco, not just Pittsburgh. Everybody knows they built a huge team  of people, or may or may not know, from Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Center and they  deployed a fleet of 14 Ford Fusions with radar cameras and all that kind of stuff. Obviously,  they have a driver in the car. This is part of their beta. But these cars have now been seen in  San Francisco. So, Robert, obviously, self-driving cars, we're seeing massive progress. Google seems  to have taken, I would think, the wrong route in waiting to deploy this and going with extremely  expensive lidar systems. It seems like Uber and Tesla now are getting out there and getting much  more real-world experience. Why is Google so far behind why are Uber and Tesla seem to be so far

It doesn't matter because you know with technology,  it gets really cheap really fast when the numbers come up. Google, I had dinner with Peter Norvick,  who runs Google's R&D about two weeks ago, and he told me, he asked me, why do you think Google  made the little self-driving cars, those little bubble cars, that can only go 25 miles an hour?  I said, I have no idea why. He said, because when we started handing the full-size Lexuses out with  all the lidars to the employees, to the employees, we had them sign a form that said that you will be  fired if you take your attention away from the road and from this machine driving. And what do they do?  Keep in mind, they had to sign a form, you will be fired if you do this. And there's a camera  right here watching you and sensors on the steering wheel that know you.

We'll have to take a  time stamp at 131 in 48 seconds. It gets so, you change your behavior because of technology.

End time: 5883.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  is three years ahead of Elon. It's three years ahead of Mercedes. It's three years ahead of everybody.  And it is already so amazing that when you are threatened with being fired, you get bored  watching the machine work. It is so good. And your phone rings or something goes bing and all of a  sudden you're looking at the phone and that's much more interesting than watching the car drive around.  And today the little cars drive around. They don't have steering wheels. And the ones I saw in  Mountain View just a couple of days ago, they don't have, you just ride in them and they take you  places, but they go 25 miles an hour. Why 25 miles an hour? Because the lawyers were willing to take  risk that a machine would do a mistake and hit somebody and hurt somebody. But not kill them.  Not kill them. 25 miles an hour isn't fast enough to kill a human being, particularly if you have  airbags and other things to slow you down. And by the way, it's not going to ever, it's going to kill  people at very low rates. Humans kill each other at 900,000 miles approximately, right? Once every  900,000 miles a human dies. Tesla killed somebody at 1.3 million miles on the first one.  It's going to be 4 million on the second one and 8 million on the third one. Yeah, obviously. And by

I mean, they have a  patent library now that they can license to all the other people. Right. And second of all, it's  training on us. They're parking it next to a school yard, for instance, to teach what a child  looks like and what the behavior of a child looks like so that when it sees a child, it'll stop,  right? In the future. Maybe like this toddler is going to change the ball. And it's learning a lot about us,  a scary amount about us. It's going to, and keep in mind, maybe it's for the glasses,  because the glasses have the same eyes that the self-driving car has on it. It has those two

When will  the majority, and it's very important when you're gambling, everybody knows this to be have very  clear lines set. So we don't have after the fact, people crying about losing a lot of money. When  will the majority of rides, not cars, but rides, rides in San Francisco and the Bay area,  the San Francisco Bay area, when will the majority of the rides, 51%? What year will 51% of the rides

You know, technically speaking,  2020 is 2020. But 2025. Okay. 2025. And I think it's going to actually happen through  weird sort of like land grabs where like all the buses convert and all of something else convert

Start time: 6050.84
End time: 6064.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and all the buses will really push a lot of people to drive. Sure. So if all those corporate buses,  it was 50% more than 50%. 51% of the rides will be. So you could do it by bodies,

I think that's really interesting because I think what will happen is they'll,  they'll just pick one parallel highway. So in San Francisco, that'd be like 280 is autonomous.  101 is not. And then everyone's going to go, Oh my God, on the 280, no idiots are fender  bendering. Nobody is, you know, everybody can go 15 miles faster. Things are in trains.

Because part of what happens with a lot  of traffic is, is the chain reaction. You can avoid the entire chain reaction. Of course.  And it explains it like humans will never be able to avoid the chain reaction. Our reaction  times just are not as good as a machine's. But also these people changing lanes constantly.

In other words,  you're about to hit something and you still haven't applied full brake. Because you are  scared of the impact of the fully braking, right? That and you just don't have the reaction times.  You're still texting.  To start, yeah, you're still texting or whatever. And in fact, this is where it's going to cause  some accidents, the self-driving car technology, because it can stop and it will stop. In fact,  modern cars, even cars that don't have self-driving technologies are already  helping you brake. If you're on a freeway and you have your foot on the gas pedal all the way to 80  miles an hour and you take it off and you push hard on the brake, it knows you're in a panic stop.  The only reason you do that is in a panic stop. It prefires the brakes and helps you brake.  You have an analog on a modern brake. You can steer and control a car even though it's fully  braking. And if you didn't want fully braking, take your foot off the brake. If you're in a  panic stop, you would appreciate the car saving your life and helping you scrub energy even if

Transcript:  you're going to hit something. Interestingly, the 8.0 software is coming out for Tesla.  And my understanding is that you are now going to be able to not just  go on one highway fully autonomous, but you're going to be able to switch, or very soon,  I don't know if it's going to happen in 8.0, you're going to be able to switch from one highway to  another and it will take you on the overpass across the highway. It doesn't do that currently.  In other words, if you put it on, and even if your GPS says you're going to take the 280 to the 380  to the 101, like Robert and I do all the time, it's not going to actually do that. You have to,  it'll be self-driving on each of those roads, but you have to take the exit ramps. It's going to do  the exit ramps supposedly where that's coming. But Elon says his favorite new feature is the always-on  max temperature control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating. Tesla keeps temperature  below 105 degrees by automatically venting the cabin and turning on the AC when needed.  Can do this for up to a year on a full charge. It's really a brilliant feature when you think  about it because in some places like we live here in California, you know, my car today was  at 110 inside. There's no reason not to vent the windows. I mean, who cares? Nobody's going to  rob the car. It's easier to break the window. That would reduce it by five or 10 degrees.  And turning on the AC just at a very low amount doesn't, every once in a while,  the idea that somebody would die, a dog or a kid tragically, or both are tragic obviously,  would be horrible. It could be totally avoided by the software.

Transcript:  We did hit something. We hit a tumbleweed that was about a six-foot high tumbleweed. It was a  sizable tumbleweed. And I said, why didn't the car stop? And then he said, first of all,  the machine learning is trained to recognize a Coke can versus a camera. You train it. You  put 70,000 images of Coke cans, 70,000 images of camera, and then all of a sudden the system learns.  It can be taught how to recognize those too. And so the optical sensors, he said, didn't recognize  that that was anything that was going to hurt the car. And two, the radar sensor knows it didn't have  any mass to it. So it knew it wasn't a child or a dog or a car. It was just a stupid thing that you  could go through and it had no mass to it. And this was German engineers in the back seat telling  me this. So I'm pretty convinced we're going to figure out how to train these systems to recognize  a whole lot of things and not get into accidents. People in the chat room are having fun about,  oh, what if a car decided to go off road and kill 20 kids instead of killing one in the crosswalk?

In other words, the fact that you're even considering such a question-  That those are the only two options.  Our systems have failed.

I'm like I kind of have my hand on the steering wheel but okay I'll you know make sure I'm moving  it a little bit. It's almost like I think what they should have done with this thing is you  should have to sign like three times on the dashboard like a docusign that or like just  the only people allowed to turn it on are part of a beta group or something because  the people who are using it without actually keeping their eyes on the road, I mean please  people if you happen to be lucky enough to be able to afford a Tesla and you have self-driving,  use it properly. The manual is it tells you a thousand times a ride.  Keep your hands and your wits about you. It's not level four.  It's level two.  These people are insane. It's infuriating to me because we all need to see this technology  advance and I actually think that in China or some other countries you're going to have this  backlash of another person.

After Cafe X which I'm an investor in. This is  my favorite. This Starship robot which you can see on my screen is a little R2D2. It's about knee  high and you can put a couple of boxes maybe two or three bags of groceries in it looks like to me.  It looks like a little Tonka truck if anybody knows that reference. And it'll drive at a couple  miles per hour to your house and deliver something to you. And I think that this,  these little robots are going to be huge. I think that this will this is so much better than drones  because this can't fall out of the sky. This is going to use much less batteries. It's not going  to cause noise pollution and if somebody wants to steal this like I guess that's the one thing that  you could like somebody could pick it up or flip it over. It's going to have a camera on it and you  could potentially get arrested for some felonious activity. Like I don't know if people know this  but like most mailboxes are not bolted to the ground. You just lift them up off and put them  into the back of a truck but you can also go to jail for it. I love this idea of little R2D2's  running around delivering your sunglasses as opposed to your your spectacles from Snapchat.  This will be the delivery mechanism obviously. Rather than huge UPS trucks rather than all that  gas these things could be out there just zipping along streets in the in the burbs. This could work  in cities. This thing could run could walk 10 miles in the burbs to drop something off. It doesn't  matter. It's such low energy consumption and if they're sidewalks it just works. Brian,

I read this to deliver bombs and payload. You could  conceivably do a lot of damage by just dropping a drone into the middle of any sports activity or  whatever. Sure. Any like with a vehicle or with that. Yeah but it wouldn't be as terrorizing. When  you put new technology on a bomb it just makes it all the more terrorizing. No but it's true. Yeah I  agree. People are like oh my god. It's an issue but I mean hopefully. Also accessibility like think  about this if the mayor I don't mean to put anything in people's heads here but if the mayor  of some city is giving a talk and he's got a bunch of security around them a drone can just drop out  of the sky at a very quick pace with a bomb on it and assassinate anybody it wants.

All of the video you see of the  president in the White House has been taped delayed by five or ten minutes for exactly that  reason. They don't want exact time. They don't want somebody watching a live broadcast somewhere  else and being able to target the president by flying a drone. This was the Bush presidency when  I was there and they have all sorts of jamming equipment around the president. That's what  when you see the motorcade going you see a camera a car with dozens of antennas that's to jam  all of the electronics that would possibly throw off a bomb or signal to a bomb near the president.  And I visited the bomb unit at Nellis Air Force Base and they said we already can block cell phones.  We know how to do that really well and that forced the terrorists to go to lower technology. They  have now click plates when you roll over them that count how many wheels have gone over the plate and  blow up something inside the train of the convoy going because you don't want to hit the first  truck because that's a bomb truck that was designed to take a blast. It actually has a curved bottom  shell so a bomb blast doesn't kill them and it's amazing. It's interesting to talk to these people  about terrorism and bombs and I don't want to tell everything on air but RF 2022 says they got a lot  of ways to block your drone.
