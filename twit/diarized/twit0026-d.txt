Transcript:  This is TWIT This Week in Tech, episode 26 for October 9th, 2005.  Coming to you once again from the beautiful Gallery Cafe in San Francisco in Nob Hill,  where Nob Hill meets the Chinatown District across the street from the cable car barn and museum.  We're being buzzed by the Blue Angels, and let me introduce the TWIT crew before the jets fly over.  Roger Chang, who is all excited about the jets, from GameSpot.com.  David Prager from System.org. You all have an association, I have to mention your plug each time, right?  Robert Heron from PC Magazine and DigitalLifeTV.com.  Hello, Leo.  And Patrick Norton, also from DigitalLifeTV.com.  And of course, John C. Dvorak. He gets...  No spam!  ...from Dvorak.org slash blog.  Is it hard to say you're from there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, right. That's my spot. That's where I make all the big dough.  That's where the big money is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The stoop.  So, was that cool, the Blue Angels? I didn't see them.  I was driving over the bridge and I knew somebody was going to rear end me because I was trying to pay attention to the driving.  And they're going...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they've got the same choreographed show for the past ten years at least.  It never changes.  I mean, it's cool.  It's exactly the same show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. It's Fleet Week in San Francisco. That means you're all supposed to take home a sailor tonight.  They do have that program.  Yeah, they do.  Take a sailor home.  Adopt a sailor.  Adopt a sailor. That's what it's called.  Who do you think does that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  People on the Castro for one thing.  Hey, sailor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a busy time.  It's a party. It's a party.  And of course, the Blue Angels are the demonstration flying team from the Navy.  They're pretty amazing.  Pat Norton flew with them once. But you knew that.  That's right. Yeah. We did a video of you passing out.  Did they make you throw up?  They tried.  They tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, they didn't?  They did a really good job.  He didn't eat before, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They tell you not to eat.  That's testament to it.  No, actually, they want some food in your stomach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, really?  Just not a whole lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just a little, have a little bun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They also tell you that if you puke inside the cockpit, because the guy who's giving

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you the whole spiel on what to do when you feel yourself start to black out or explaining  the physiology of it is also the guy who has to clean up the cockpit if you hurl.  So he doesn't want you to?  No, not at all.  But the pilots do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Skipper and Mikey or whatever.  They think it's funny.  They all have names, right?  They think it's funny.  So I was listening on the way over on local channel 910, they were actually playing the

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  feed on the Blue Angels.  Yeah.  That's cool, isn't it?  With the crazy, yeah, they have a big announcer there.  I used to do that for KNBR when KNBR used to broadcast here in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Whoever this is, the Navy guy.  Yeah, they have the Navy guy and me.  And we would do this play-by-play.  The guy's the worst.  I mean, he sounds like a ham actor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  See, I would do the play-by-play and he would do the color.  But anyway, what was interesting I didn't know is that they don't wear those pressurized  suits when they do this one.  And you know what that means?  They have to work out.  They clench.  Hemorrhoids.  Seriously.  They're serious clenches.  I knew a fighter pilot and he says it's the number one, all fighter pilots have this problem  because one of these moves and boom, you just blow yourself out.  And these guys are wearing that.  I don't know, it's not that this is a good...  Did they put you in a flight suit?  No, nobody gets a pressurized suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's no room in the plane.  No, you get to experience what they experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But see, they can clench their muscles in such a way to keep the blood...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The problem is the blood goes to your head, right?  That's what you do.  That's what gives you the hemorrhoids.  You basically clench all the way up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and what you do is when you tighten your muscles, you're forcing the blood to  not pull...  You want the blood to be in your head.  Oh, you don't want it to go out of your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you want to keep it in your head.  And when like...  It has to be in your head.  He lost consciousness at the very end, but they pulled seven and a half Gs on him as  well.  And we got a nice videotape of it.  And another peculiar thing I thought was interesting is the videotape in the thing,  and it's a PR arm for the Navy, but all the cockpit video is on a VHS tape.  Including the metrics?  Yeah, and the only...  I think it's just because they haven't put forth the effort to...  They had to outfit the recorder so that the heads would keep touching when they're pulling  seven and a half Gs, and they haven't gone to something digitalized.  And they're not using another kind of tape.  Do you know...  Did you get flight time for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You think it's funny, but you get flight time for being in the simulators over at NASA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, he wasn't actually doing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All 45 minutes of sitting in the back.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Counts.  Navy planes don't have sticks under that.  So Web 2.0 is just...  You know, it's where you shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Only with the trainers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't like...  Only the Air Force keep them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, the normal F-18s are...  They probably doesn't count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This guy reads Janes when he goes to bed.  You don't ever...  He's like...  He's in the morning, not in bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In the morning, he reads Janes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So what about tech news?  What about that?  Web 2.0, did you go?  No.  Patrick went.  It's a group thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's going to go to that thing except him?  You know what?  Let's go back to Web 2.0.  DARPA Grand Challenge.  Five finishers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Five finishers?  Five.  The first one was, of course, the Stanford racing team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, they weren't the first across the...  Were they the first across the line, or were they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They were the first on time.  I know that one.  They're saying they won.  Yes.  They had the shortest time to traverse the distance.  But then other...  That means they were the first, right?  Well, no.  They do staggered starts.  Oh, I see.  I see.  I see.  Five.  None ever finished before.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the first time.  There was a couple.  I think I said this before.  It's like last year's results were very deceptive because they let a lot of vehicles run that  shouldn't have been allowed to run because they didn't pass the initial challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So $1 million prize last year, they doubled it to try to get some winners this year.  $2 million.  Volkswagen Touareg.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  The key of this is it's not remote control.  No.  You push the button, you say, bye-bye car, and it drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically, it does the whole thing.  Yeah.  But they give them a huge number of GPS points to navigate.  But on top of that, it's also dealing with...  It's basically they're using...  The terrain.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Laser sensors are doing it.  Yeah.  The terrain's a little mellower.  Because that was a problem.  They couldn't get over...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot of people got caught up in rocks and stuff.  132 miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that was the course distance, 132 miles?  Yeah.  And who did it fastest and how fast did they do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stanford did it in six hours and 53 minutes, which is pretty good.  Not bad.  But you have 10 minutes, 10 hours total.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So five of them did it in 10 hours or less.  That's pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, no, one of them did it in 12 hours and 51 minutes.  But still 5...  That was Team TerraMax, the one with the 42 million ton industrial vehicle.  They figured that's a better way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they just didn't want them to be run over by them afterwards.  I like autonomous vehicles.  Autonomous?  The thing that we should point out is that this is done by the Army Defense Research  Project.  These are the people who brought you the internet.  The idea of DARPA's idea is they want to have robotic vehicles in the field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, actually they want them so they can come into the cities and kill the citizenry.  That's right.  You can just barrel in here when there's a riot or something.  Just flash the guys with hot water or whatever you want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You cut the headphone levels a little bit.  Everybody's dying in here.  We're dying in here.  There you go.  Now I can't hear anything.  Now Web 2.0.  Because Patrick did go to that.  Yes, I got to attend a bunch of the sessions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wasn't that just a bunch of guys who were like leftovers from the web blowout in the  year 2000?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or big shots like Terry Semel who don't get it at all.  One of the two was in the industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean there was a mixture.  A lot of what you hear is...  There's a lot of interesting stuff there.  Name one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Name one?  He's put you on the spot.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Watching some of the demonstrations of interactive applications where the user controls the interface.  That's the new thing, right?  He's interactive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You hate Jackson Ruby on Rails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You must have just been blown away by that.  Actually, the best thing I heard was Sergey Brin from Google showed up kind of as a surprise.  They did one of the discussions with him.  He was really funny where he pointed out that if the executives controlled what projects  were pushed forward at Google, most of the projects that have made Google successful  never would have...  There you go.  ...never would have been passed.  There you go.  It would exist.  It was interesting to hear him say that.  As an executive.  As an executive.  As what they can do with the research and encouraging people to create new systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's reiterate this.  Okay.  What you said was what the executives suggested...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If the executives decided we want that project and that project, these are going to be the  focus of Google moving into 2007.  Like Google would be a smoking empty space instead of a stock market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's saying that they had no clue.  The executives have no clue.  That's the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Clueless executives.  Big story.  Yeah.  It's interesting.  Yeah.  Stop the presses.  What about this guy, the weblogs guy who sold his company?  He was there, I know.  What was his name?  Jason was very happy.  Jason McCollin.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like Jason, but we had words at Gnome Dex a couple years ago.  Really?  Well, he was like...  Zef Davis and CNET and IDG are all in the pockets of the advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was like, is somebody who writes for all three of them?  Yeah.  It's like if that was that coordinated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  He did okay, though.  He sold Weblogs Inc. to AOL for...  Like $25 million.  $25 million.  He's a happy boy.  There goes a cable car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Rice-A-Roni.  That's a cable car.  You can hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here it comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is Rice-A-Roni the San Francisco treat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no.  Never heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  According to their marketing campaign.  Anyone?  I've had Rice-A-Roni.  Patrick and the two guys from the mid-webs.  I haven't had that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There you go.  They're sloppy jokes.  So what else was that Web 2.0?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's basically on one hand, from what you're saying in the group, think it's like,  yeah, the users are wanting to control the medium.  The idea that end users...  It was...  You're just going to give me that stare and I'm going to lose all momentum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He lost it already.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of me...  I got to sit on two sessions and a couple of them were staying in the obvious.  It's like, hey, blogs are popular.  You were a panelist?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, you were in the room.  He was watching.  The best part is that Michael Powell, former FCC chairman, says he'll be on Twitter any  time we want him to.  Yeah, right.  Oh, I think he would.  He gave Patrick a hug.  I got a hug.  A man hug.  Really?  Was it a tent hug?  It was the...  It was a bear hug.  Not quite the full bear hug, but the half bear hug.  I like Michael.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you get a photo?  He's a good guy.  It was interesting to hear him talk.  It was interesting to hear people talk about the fact that they're still fighting distribution.  The major problems are still, if you want video on the web, well, the studio's still  controlled.  Even the studio-controlled distribution mediums like MovieLink don't have most of the content.  We still need faster connections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Am I crazy?  I like audio on the web.  Sure.  I think audio...  This is what you're doing.  This is what this is.  We're doing video, but I think that I wonder if...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Maybe you have a conflict of interest here with that.  Should I disclaim that?  Yeah.  I mean, you like audio because that's what you do.  You're audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  I don't think it's fair.  The problem with the web is that whatever medium you came from, that's the medium you  think the web is.  So print guys think the web's print, magazine guys think it's the magazine, TV guys think  it's TV.  I think it's whatever people are downloading the most on BitTorrent at this point.  Well, that may be...  I think, though, it may well be that we just don't...  The real innovators on the net are just now coming of age, and those are the people who  don't have the preconceived notions.  It might come up with something completely different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the best panels is they have a guy that...  One of the guys that runs one of the investment houses brings up a group of teenagers and  talks about what they do, how much they spend on it, and where they get it.  And the one universal thing across this fairly diverse group of teenagers is none of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  pay for music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  None of them.  In fact, the Canadian research says something like 75% of all music downloads are stolen  and they're by 18 to 24-year-olds.  That's who's doing it.  They don't have the culture of buying music.  No, it's what they're running.  But he's afraid of it.  Or the money.  Afraid of it.  It's too late now.  Do you think that they don't have the money or if they come of age?  No, they have the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just think that their desire for music outstrips their resources.  I remember being in college, it was poor.  You're buying UCDs, you're buying...  You're not spending 18 bucks a pop for a new disc.  I mean, if you're making 30 grand a year and you could get something for free.  You're going to have beer money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the key.  What was ironic is a couple of these kids are spending like $600 a month on...  Or not $600, like $200 a month on ringtones and games.  Yeah, that's what they buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, come on.  Kids aren't buying ringtones.  So who's buying ringtones?  Somebody's buying ringtones.  It's a huge business.  I think they bat the financial district.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, you think it is?  It's like people with more money than cents.  Yeah, cab drivers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's some people with no money and no cents.  I mean, does anybody...  Has anyone here ever bought a ringtone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't want to...  I would consider buying a song.  I'm not going to buy a ringtone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I bought one.  I have ringtones.  You bought one?  Anyone out here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyone buy a ringtone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay, you guys all work in this financial district, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anybody ever hack a ringtone onto their phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See, she does.  That's the better thing to do.  Here's my ringtone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, brother.  But there's so much money to be made on ringtones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is why guns should be legalized.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Guns are legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Good news.  Go ahead, shoot me.  I got the laugh anyways.  What's his name?  I'm sorry, I made a mistake.  Facts, facts.  M&M is suing a bunch of different companies because he doesn't want them selling his music

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  as ringtones.  Good for him.  That makes sense.  How much money these companies are making selling ringtones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's like $18 billion last year or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's unbelievable.  The number is unbelievable.  Worldwide, it's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, got another invitation from Apple.  Did you get your invitation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  October 12th.  No.  Is it Tuesday, right?  Oh, you knew Wednesday?  Wednesday to 12th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you got an invitation?  Out of all the Twits, how many got invitations in the email?  I actually had to ask for one.  I got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm the only one who got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's because you're a lackey for Apple, obviously.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, are you going to go down and see what...  I'm going to be in Canada.  I can't go.  Do you want to go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  One more thing?  Yeah, I'll go.  That's the name of And One More Thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because that's what Steve Jobs...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Do we know what it is?  Is it the video iPod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of people are saying it's not the video iPod.  I hear two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hear either video iPod, but also they don't want to trump the whole nano, which is selling  like last.  And then the other thing is they haven't done any significant upgrades to the Power Books.  Maybe they're going to get a Penny M&M.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to go out on a limb.  I'm going to say it's an Intel Power Book.  I have no evidence of that at all, by the way.  People are saying it's a fifth generation iPod.  You know, ThinkSecret says it's not anything with an iPod.  They say it's going to be updates to Power Books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It makes more sense that it wouldn't be anything with an iPod.  Why undercut a nano?  Yeah, nano's doing too well.  They're back-ordered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Will there ever be an iPod video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Yeah, absolutely.  When?  Everybody knows this.  They got one.  They made it.  Well, they got to wait until the sales...  They got these sales curves.  They look at these models and they say, well, now's the time to do it.  Where's the content for it coming from?  Us.  Look at this.  Right here.  We'd be number one.  We would be.  For a moment.  People just want to see us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then they'd see us and then we'd be...  And that would be it.  We wouldn't be beyond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Didn't the previous announcements for the iPod, like the nano, didn't it give a hint  in terms of like, okay, we're going to...  It said $1,000 or something like that.  So you knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And this is...  And now one more thing.  Just one more thing.  It could be anything.  The last time they had an event down there that had you two and Bono was the introduction  of the iPod photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And one more thing.  It's a pun or something is related.  Steve Jobs always does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's always in one more thing.  The nano with the FM radio.  Why would that be in one more thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  One more thing to the nano.  Oh, we forgot.  That's what I want.  You should change the name to another fine mess.  Another fine mess you've got us into there, Steve.  What could it be?  I think it's going to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what's going to be the boring thing?  It's going to be upgrades to the power people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to be upgrades to the power people.  It's going to be upgrades to the power people.  It's going to be upgrades to the power people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe it's that breakout box that was a big scandal.  A lot of people were saying, when are they going to do...  This is typical speculation.  When are they going to do a media...  Meaningless.  Yeah, meaningless.  Media Center Edition.  OS X Media Center Edition.  Is it selling well for Windows?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it?  It's one of the most popular PVR software, if you're going to do your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In terms of numbers, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh.  I mean, compared to the rest of it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Pop to the geeks like you, but not to anybody else.  Or it's going to be a tablet Mac.  Another big product category.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The tablet thing is so dead in the water right now that I can't imagine...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm hoping for...  Newton's Bank.  Wouldn't that be funny?  I'm hoping for a Pentium M PowerBook.  That would be a very compelling product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What's to hold them back from doing?  I think they're going to do a desktop before they do a PowerBook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They said they were going to do the low-ends first, which would be the mini.  And then a year later they're the high-ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they would do all the notebooks because the Mac mini is essentially just a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Where they're desperate is in the notebook.  They cannot put anything more in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How about a Mac mini with an x86 in it?  That's an interesting idea.  The reason that would be interesting is because I know...  I was talking to somebody the other day who has an un-good authority that Apple or Microsoft  actually has a reference design for a mini killer.  It's a 60-buck deal.  It's 60 bucks a parts and it's a little mini.  They're sitting on it.  Why?  Maybe this is what Apple is going to roll out.  No, $60 in parts.  They charge $300.  It would be well...  What's the markup?  Normally the markup...  The normal markups on bag of parts versus retail price traditionally has always been  4x.  4x.  Wow, that's cheap.  Recently it's changed to 3x because they've cut a bunch of margins out.  So the bag of parts means you have a $200 computer, supposedly.  And it would run Windows and it would run OS X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You come with OS X and you put Windows on it.  That's a killer.  Would that not be a killer product?  The panting in the audience would indicate so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Are you panting?  I think it's hot.  I think you're just warming it in.  I think most of the people in the audience have already got hotter machines than that.  That's one of the problems.  Right now I think there's something...  One thing overlooked in the news is that Dell has decided to bring out a high-end machine.  I was talking to some vendors about this recently because I'm starting to build machines  with SLIs and these machines cost about $4,000 to put together.  And I started thinking about it because about two years ago I started doing all these little  boxes, these little cubes and all these cheapies that you could build for two, three, four  hundred bucks and you have a cute little computer.  And I kept writing about it and nobody was interested.  They're saying who cares?  Nobody cares about cheap junk.  They want power.  They want hot rods.  And so I think it's going the other way.  That's also where the margins are for somebody like Dell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's more money to be made with the highest end systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Especially if you go with the case mods.  Slap in $500 video cards.  I think case mods with a loaded system, dual core...  Isn't that a niche audience?  Four gigabytes of...  No, there's not one person sitting at these chairs that doesn't think this would be good  to have.  Four gigabytes of main memory.  A terabyte of...  Take three 400 gig drives and throw them on the Sat array.  Now what's the price?  Now we're in three years.  Three grand max.  Who would buy that for three grand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See?  Everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You have to build it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want an AMD processor and that's something Dell will like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can say that because there's no cameras pointing that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hey, this is the beauty of radio.  Almost everybody.  Well, there was three guys back there.  But they were very enthusiastic and they're waving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's a niche product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't think that that's what the mass market is.  I think everybody wants that.  I've come to that conclusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dell also announced the launch of that one system that has no OS load on it.  It's designed for your own build of Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It comes with free DOS, but I guess they have to put something on it.  So at least you hit the power button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Anyway, with the new SATA serial ATA, they got the RAID built into the chipset.  So you can throw three of those 400 gigabyte drives on there and have a 1.2 terabyte RAID lash up.  We're zooming right along.  Who here makes less money than John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a terabyte of storage, but I don't RAID the damn thing.  That's kind of cool.  It's too dangerous.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What exactly would you be doing with this amazing machine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  WordStar.  WordStar.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Pac-Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Solitaire.  In SLI mode.  I think that's the real issue, John, is that the only applications that need anywhere near  that power are games.  Everything else is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Photoshop with dual processor.  You don't need graphics.  I don't spend a lot of time waiting for Photoshop.  No, to be honest about it, the SLI thing is just a whim.  I don't think you need that kind of, you know, I don't think you need that much.  It reminds me of when people would put two,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Voodoo graphics cards in a machine.  It was the same idea, right?  Same amount of money too.  It was hugely expensive.  Three, four hundred bucks and four hundred and those.  And then the Voodoo's came out with one card that had both.  And then of course a better chip completely made it obsolete and it was worthless.  Well, that don't happen with this too, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right now the SLI cards are $449 a piece and you need two of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can get a lower end card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the one benchmark I want to see done is the lowest end part and what that compares  with in terms of the high end.  SLI stands for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Scalable link interface.  And the idea is two video cards sharing in parallel or are they kind of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they split the workload up and they have different algorithms for,  they can either do it line by line like the traditional scan line interleave that 3DFX did  or they can trade off one frames rendered by one card,  another frames rendered by another card or they can physically or dynamically split the screen  depending on the workload that's happening.  You do the Z-buffer, you do the anti-aliasing.  They have several methods because some games and some graphics APIs work better in certain circumstances  with different ways of doing it.  But does a game have to be SLI aware to take advantage of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not at all.  That's the beauty of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's DirectX, all DirectX 9.  DirectX 9 and OpenGL as well.  What's going to happen to OpenGL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Microsoft's saying they probably aren't going to put OpenGL in Vista, right?  Probably not.  They want to push OpenGL out because they own DirectX and they can say,  any game, look, develop for DirectX, don't develop for that OpenGL,  and then they don't have to worry.  Nobody else, the kid won't run on any other platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the advanced feature sets that are available in the new cards  are supported sooner in DirectX than you would find in OpenGL.  And the standard took so darn long, especially for 2.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OpenGL is an open standard and it's a good standard, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a shame to lose it.  Doom 3.  It might not be your favorite game, but the engine does a really good job with that API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm, of course, biased because I want stuff to run on the Mac,  and it's not going to run on the Mac if it's DirectX 9.  It's never going to run on the Mac.  Is World of Warcraft, since that's on both,  it's not that demanding of a thing.  Okay.  Is it an OpenGL game, though?  It must be, right?  Or they ported, or they wrote two versions,  a DirectX 9 version and an OpenGL version.  I don't know.  But that's a problem.  If Vista doesn't have OpenGL,  can somebody come along and support it after the fact?  Or...  Be interesting issue.  I think that's a non-competitive area that Microsoft could get into  that could really be a problem.  Apple could come up with an API, there are similar...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Something easy to do with a DirectX,  where you could just move port programs over easier.  DirectX port, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe that's what they'll announce.  One more thing.  Well, on the subject of graphics,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  did you guys talk about the movie Serenity last week?  Did anybody go see it?  I saw it.  Actually, I still haven't seen it.  I haven't seen it.  Did you like it?  Go see it at the Metreon,  because they were showing it on the big IMAX.  Oh, IMAX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every time they do that,  you never get to see it in the middle,  and then you're looking at the lower...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You've got to sit in the back in the middle.  Yeah, yeah, you've got to sit higher than the middle.  I have yet to see an IMAX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have yet to see an IMAX flick there.  That's just optical.  They don't shoot it down.  They just blow it up.  It's just big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But it's a 70mm print, though, right?  I don't think so.  I think 70mm prints, they haven't done it for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been in Metreon's DLP cinema with the new 2K chip.  That's nice.  That is gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty.  Sony has a new tech coming up.  Was Serenity done digital, or is it film?  It's film.  Hopefully film.  Why? You don't like the digital?  Down the road, right now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's cheaper, I think, to shoot your stuff on film  and then transfer it to digital.  Because you can still make a tremendously high resolution  call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think you might get an argument there.  Hey, did you see this story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I didn't see this anywhere in the mainstream media.  It was just a small note that the European Union  is trying to take away the Internet from ICANN.  They want to get the US...  Well, it's been going on for a while.  It's not so much they want to take away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just want to remove a big portion of US influence.  Because ICANN is, in theory, an international body,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but really it's dominated by the US.  Actually, I had curiously wondered

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  and went down and visited ICANN about this particular topic.  They've been freaked out about it for almost a year now.  Well, it's moving ahead.  It's actually, yeah, I know.  What it really is, is the United Nations, above all.  They're the ones who are pushing it.  It seems to be at the behest of, according to them,  and I believe their story,  it seems to be at the behest of about six or seven countries  that are...  China?  I believe China might be one of them.  I know Saudi Arabia is for sure.  Some African countries.  Tunisia?  For some unknown reason, Brazil.  And a few others.  And they're trying to do all kinds of stuff  that apparently architecturally can't be done.  And the ICANN people are freaked out about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the real fear is that you get these governmental agencies  starting to rule on engineering topics.  They don't have any reason to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This internet is going to fall apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you have to understand...  Wait a minute, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We may have an attack line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This internet is going to fall apart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  I've felt this way for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think the problem is a lot of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is there another internet to take over?  No, I think maybe the academic one  they're building internet to.  Back to BBS.  Who knows?  I just think that there's a potential...  When I got my blog banned by these filtering guys,  and every major corporation in the country  was like banned my blog from...  Because it was all of a sudden a sex blog.  And there's no recourse.  I got no sex on this blog, folks.  I'm sorry about that.  I think I saw some sexy pictures.  Yeah, one of the recourse was contacting  the public relations agency and bitching and moaning.  Oh, they fixed it?  Yeah, they fixed it right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it would still be worth suing them.  You still have some power.  It's the same thing with this email black hole thing.  There's no recourse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  These are just shady fellas.  In this split we had this last week...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's talk about level three and...  Level seven or level three.  Level three and Kojit.  Kojit is a web hosting company.  They do a lot of porn sites.  But they do sites like Simlib,  which is the big podcast site.  And they had a peering arrangement  with level three, but no one else.  So essentially...  Which is like...  That's not how you're supposed to do it.  Essentially level three was freely giving them  all their bandwidth.  Level three has been complaining about this for a while.  In fact, six months ago they sent them a note saying  you've got to stop doing this, guys.  It's an equal partnership.  You give as much as you get.  And these guys were just using all of level three's bandwidth  and not giving any back.  Because they weren't connected to anything else.  So level three pulled the plug on  Thursday or Wednesday.  A few people were affected. Our friend Steve Gibson  was off the air.  Analog X.  So there were people that were affected by this.  They brokered a deal on Friday late.  And got it back on.  But it just shows you the fragility.  Exactly. Of the internet.  You could just pull the plug on these guys and you cut off  10,000 websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The thing is, years ago when Boardwatch Magazine was still in existence  they did a study on peering.  And they showed all the different...  They mapped all the peers.  Back then you'd have big companies like MCI  and Sprint and these big backbone companies.  And they had...  Sprint had some unbelievable number of  peers. They had like 1200 companies  that they were sharing with.  So that's very redundant.  And it was like this really nice web that was  designed. And very slowly  as we get more and more consolidation there's less and less  of these players. And when it gets down to a few  hundred and then maybe gets down to like  two guys. Hey!  Where do you go from there? It's fragile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's fragile in a lot of ways people don't really address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well there was one point I think it was either Nebraska or Montana.  There was essentially one connection  to the rest of the internet.  Everything else inside the state was essentially running

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  through that connection. A lot of third world nations  it's like that. They have one T1  for the entire country.  It's all going through there.  No I'm not kidding. I'm joking.  It's one... You know that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Have you ever seen that Simpsons episode  where they have the internet thing that goes through the  Cisco router? Have you ever seen that?  It's a classic. I have it somewhere.  I'm going to have to put it on.  But anyway they show that  Marge Simpson says  can you say stuff like that on the  internet? You know about porn.  And so they hit the button  and then you see the data go flying down  like a mile through the city.  And then it goes to a box that says  Cisco router with two flies  buzzing around and some guys  sleeping and then the data  just gets stuck in there for about a minute and then  takes off again.  What did they do? What did Cisco do  to irk these guys  at the Simpsons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what I love about them though is that these guys  at the Simpsons there's a lot of in jokes like that  where they're just really pretty smart guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they come from Harvard.  I think that's a pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  funny comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh the writers for Family Guy are just incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I won't let my kids watch that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Family Guy is pretty rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But Stewie, you've got to love Stewie.  It's rude but you laugh pretty damn hard.  It's funny.  So what did the ICANN folks say  about this United Nations attempt to  take over the internet? They're worried. They don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They think that the public is unaware of it  and it's going to screw everything up.  It's all going to come to a head in a couple of weeks.  The ICANN guys have always  got a bad rap. If you go down and visit them  they're down in the San Diego area  or some Newport Beach area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's where John Postle used to be with the IANA.  That's very much like the Simpsons.  It was one guy in San Diego  who's responsible for all the names and numbers  on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was working.  But anyway you go down there and they have this  really a self-effacing place. They don't have big offices.  There's not a lot of money being spent.  Everybody's pretty sincere.  There's a lot of engineers there. It's actually pretty cool.  I was impressed by the fact that it was so  down to earth. It wasn't like a  fancy government operation by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you go to ICANNwatch.org, which is one of the sites  that's kind of anti-ICANN, you can read about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was kind of on there.  I would have been more that way until I actually visited with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the worst case scenario for this whole situation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The internet falls apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or am I just split in two with  one US centric,  one in one...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All kinds of weird things can happen that aren't going to be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If I'm somebody not in the United States,  I think that's not such a bad thing.  Why should the US be running the internet?  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All of it's dictated by politics.  Because we've done such a good job of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, sure, all the US, you know,  we're big bullies. But we haven't  screwed it up. I mean, as far as I'm concerned,  the US should be running this thing.  We're the ones who basically invented it.  We're the ones who maintained it. We're the ones who make it work.  Until such time as we screw it up.  Who's going to screw it up? Who's going to screw it up?  Are these boneheads from Saudi Arabia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it had been designed properly,  security would be built in and blah blah blah.  And basically for all these scenarios,  nobody could have division 20 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you guys aren't just  jingoistic, chauvinistic  United States flag waving patriots?  Well he is, but not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I firmly believe a lot of it  is just politics and it's just one way  to kind of...  Life is politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That thing, I can tell you that for a fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All I can say is just clench.  Just clench.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to go buy a G-suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Go buy a G-suit is easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The internet, as we know,  it may be doomed.  But now, the world relies  in such a great degree on the internet. Wouldn't that cause economic chaos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't matter.  Because as long as the US gets screwed in it,  it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's some element of truth in what he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm serious. You think it's funny, but that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I said there's an element of truth in what you say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I don't think it's funny. I think you're probably right.  So what do we do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Turn them off.  All that one guy, he flips the switch.  There goes Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So meanwhile, the upshot of...  There's a reason.  I never want Roger in a high elected office.  This is why  we need more arch villains.  I am going to shut off  all of France!  For one million dollars!  So Rick Boucher  is getting in on this, of course.  Why not?  He is the member of Congress, so he always seems to have something to say about this.  Boucher or Boucher?  Boucher? I always say Boucher.  Jerk. I can't remember.  I'm sorry to say that loud.  He's suggesting a modification  to the Telecommunications Act.  He's a Democrat from Virginia, sits on the House committee  that handles telecommunications law.  To prevent the kinds of outages  we just saw with Cogent and Lowell.  There's going to have to be something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So do we need a government-owned backbone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's what it used to be.  Until ten years ago, and the National Science Foundation said  it's the free internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, there has to be a system for these shutdowns.  So when the shutdown takes place,  everybody's protected in the interim.  That's what, you know, I don't know,  you see this thing that CNET is doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  where all the news is, you know,  kind of, it shows how all the news is connected.  That's just terrible.  I just saw this, I'm sorry.  It's liveplasma.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's like that, you know, the, what's that,  the thesaurus, the virtual thesaurus  that goes around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The brain, you're thinking about the brain.  The problem with the brain is you have to manually  configure thesaurus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's a search engine called  CAR2, K-A-R-T-O-O  that does that.  It's actually kind of fun to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We should explain, I'll put a link in the show now,  so we should explain that what we're talking about is  how these sites that show how everything is  integrated and then they draw these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it's totally meaningless crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is meaningless. It doesn't give you any more information.  There's some really good stuff.  There's a bunch of stuff that came out of  the Web 2.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, actually out of the  my mom loves the visual thesaurus.  I like it too, except not to pay a service.  Let Patrick finish with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But signals intelligence processing  for the NSA and stuff where they actually  throw some really heavy intelligence at it  and it does amazing stuff to information processing.  It makes it very  you can basically parse through huge amounts of information.  That's always really cool.  I'm not expecting that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You see what you're describing on C-Net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's Dvorak.org, here's John,  here's PCMag, here's DvorakKeyboard.com  I don't know how it got over there.  Maybe because it was mentioned in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  magazine. This is new.  I haven't seen the new layout.  It looks like a cancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It looks like a tumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Organizing the internet.  Anyway, this is Cartoon.com.  You can check it out in your spare time.  It's fun.  I don't know what you do with it.  The problem with doing a lot of these  obscure, using obscure engines is that  generally speaking they don't really bring  anything to the party that Google hasn't already brought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Cartoon's default is UK pages.  If you do a search on Cartoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was trying to find it.  I don't know if it's some animated porn.  Oh really? What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Animated porn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's called a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Animated porn.  It's called a film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's a cartoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're moving.  The pictures move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it can make money off that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like Mickey Mouse in a compromised position.  He's not talking about video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I can't use this  anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Arnold Schwarzenegger,  the gubernator, signed a law on Friday  that said you may not sell  adult games to teenagers  in California. If you're under 18  you can't get an MA game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a 1500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What does this mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It means Leland Yee finally got what he wanted.  Grab your parents credit card, go online and do your shopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It means everybody  just buy it out of the state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so hard to control  kids drinking alcohol.  Like having somebody, dude can I give you 50 bucks  will you buy me a copy of InCertainty of Game Here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How's it happening to you?  They'll be standing out  in the parking lots of electronics  boutiques trying to get adults to buy  them copies of Grand Theft Auto.  My parents are just going to buy it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What they're going to do is bootleg it.  Have your parents

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  start a Gamefly account and you  just put it in the queue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can do it from Gamefly, just rent it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What game, even if it has a mature rating right now,  I can't think of one popular title anyway,  I wouldn't let a teenager play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Who's playing them?  The time about M for Mature

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you have to have an ID since you're 17 and over  because that works so well in movies, keeping kids out of R rated movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got carded once going into a movie theater.  My daughter went on her first date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She went on her first date last night.  My wife  calls the theater and says  now you don't let children into  R rated movies without ID, right?  The woman says, oh no, of course not.  And then she says,  and if you see them necking in the back of the theater  you stop them, right?  And she says, we certainly try.  And my wife hangs up happy.  So sometimes disinformation  is telling people what they want to hear.  No kissing, no kissing.  No kissing!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well they're already in there with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  night vision cameras looking for people recording  the films anyways. They're more worried about that  frankly than people necking in the back row.  I think they're doing both.  It's like that study that was done

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  by Penn Teller and that  CBS show that they do called Bullshit  where they  set somebody up to like monitor  something like this. But meanwhile they had somebody  making out next door. So they took the cameras  and they very slowly gravitated over there.  Meanwhile some terrorist activity  is taking place.  Somebody's changing their clothes right behind you.  Somebody's watching for the guy making a bootleg. Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How long  before they check you for a camera phone?  I mean as the quality of these things goes up  how long before they say, oh sorry you can't bring  your camera phone in?  When it went to that Star Wars premiere at the Metreon

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they searched every single person and they confiscated  anything.  They confiscated everything. You get it back after

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but what do they have like special lockers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was such a pan of a butt.  There was like a thousand seat movie theater  or I don't know, 800 seat movie theater.  Everybody was checked. And any cameras or cell phones  or anything. But that was before it was released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And boy you know you get one of those  camera phone films, put it on  the net. And you know  Star Wars. You know what I hate about that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a climactic moment. The phone rings.  I just hate that when that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  When you're shooting a movie with the camera  phone with half a pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  whatever is shooting at. You know if those phones  didn't light up so bright I'm sure more people

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  could get away with it. I was at a U2 concert  in Canada and you know people don't have lighters  anymore. So Bono said everybody open up  your phone and it actually was quite beautiful.  It was quite beautiful. Isn't that a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  commercial? More interesting to me is

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  why you'd be at the concert in the first place.  I love you too. In the name of love.  You love me too with thank you. I love you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what my wife said. She said I love you too. And I said thank you.  She said no I mean the group. I don't love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  She doesn't  listen either I take it. I didn't cry.  No she wants to do her own podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  though you know.  By the way I got a thing from M-Audio

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  a new podcast in a box set up. Looks pretty good.  I was going to bring it. M-Audio does good stuff.  M-Audio does great stuff. They have a lot of nice gear.  Is it like a firewire box?  It's a firewire box, a mixer  a microphone and all that.  And software that apparently allows you  to edit audio.  Maybe.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No. Shutting me down all day.  It's my turn.  I'm going to have to whip out the soccer ball first.  So anyway it makes the  RSS linkage just right.  That's what you need. If it actually works  it's great. If it works. I haven't used it yet  but M-Audio has good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Check it out M-Audio you can feed it.  We're using a ProSonus FirePod now.  We got rid of the mixer and  the FirePod just takes a mic input and turns it into a firewire  sends it to the laptop for recording

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  on a laptop. So we now have somebody who knows what he's doing.  I take it you as opposed to...  Me? Well I didn't say that.  But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay. Here have a twit pen.  So in honor of your...  Can we do better than this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a pretty cheap pen. That's the same kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  of pen my dentist gives me. We've got to get like some  German guys to make these pens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  German engineered pens.  So is Chris Hoare from Text America?  Yeah. Nice aptly named.  Whoa!  Time out!  What was that?  I'm mo-blogging this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Look at this.  Hey he's got all the sizes. He's got medium, large

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  extra large and programmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They don't make it that big.  This is  who would... No geek would fit

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  in that right? Yeah. That's my daughter's getting that one.  Oh there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anyway thank you Chris and Text America.  And thank you for delivering this, Michael O'Donnell.  He's our Radio Shack contact.  If you ever need batteries  I can get you in the club.  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did they still do a battery club? Battery club.  That took me that long to get that joke.  Seriously. I forgot all about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  battery club. That's back in the days when you'd get SNH  Green stamps for shopping at the gas station.  Right and they'd compete. They'd compete about

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  blue stamps. You'd get seven batteries

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but they only come in six battery packs  so they'd take a new one and they'd tear it off.  That's the good thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  about the battery club.  The first rule of battery club.  Don't talk about the battery club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's all  call backs today ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Chargers.  Microsoft shipping its patches  on Tuesday. Only one  critical patch.  Windows. Windows.  The whole thing is a critical patch.  But there's  a new version of the Microsoft  malicious software removal tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah it keeps coming out over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is that an antivirus or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's anti-spyware.  It's actually I think it's just a part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the removal tool. They have a separate beta  for the spyware prevention tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The one they bought from Giant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is that it? No I thought that was this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it the same thing?  Well if you go to Microsoft.com slash spyware you can download this program.  The anti-spyware is the giant one.  I don't know what this malicious...  I thought that was the giant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's probably a placebo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's been removed.  It's been removed.  There haven't been that many  patches. They did one last month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well ever since the scam  the great idea, the guy who  reverse engineered the patch. In other words  Microsoft brings out the patch and you say  somebody looks at the patch and says you know I bet you  have only half the people who use this thing so I'll just use  reverse engineered the patch to create the bad thing.  That's a great idea.  Genius. They've been doing that for a while.  So now they're freaked about releasing the patches.  EI says

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  there's like three major critical  flaws in Internet Explorer and Microsoft  just ignores it basically.  That's pretty common.  They also are going to start  their subscription  protection software thing.  You subscribe, you pay them  and they protect you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It sounds like a  racket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're the ones

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  who make the software. Why are we paying for  them to protect us from their software  errors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Gosh I don't know.  Seems like a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Definitely  a disincentive for them to fix  the code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a good point. It is kind of a conflict of  interest. I'm writing about it.  I'm going to read it to you.  Mod chips are legal in Australia.  Let's all go. Awesome.  But everything else is illegal in Australia.  It's hard  to understand their laws there because you're  right. They just don't seem to have a  consistent attitude towards copyright.  So in this case  the highest court in Australia  said players can legally hack  PlayStation consoles and  PSP I presume as well.  So that you can play  games and international copies and other games and so forth.  It's legal.  Was there a specific case that took place?  Yeah. A four year battle.  This guy fought Sony for four years.  And the Australian high court  says there's no appeal. That's it. Says it's okay.  I never needed a  mod chip for my PS2 though.  I just used the software stuff that you can just  add a hard drive to it and dump your titles  right to it. I love my modded Xbox.  I'm not sure what additional benefits you get by

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can see the Xbox mod of course  and the hard drive and everything built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  First PlayStation Portable Trojan.  Uh oh. Turns your  PlayStation Portable into a brick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not viral though.  They're just trying to trick people  hey if you get this and install it you can play  custom titles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's back up on that story.  What kind of product is this  that you can do that to?  You run some code and the next thing you know  it smokes up and blows up.  Any product.  Yeah but you should be able to reboot it or something.  I mean there's gotta be something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If I could trick you into downloading a BIOS upgrade  for your PC. Well that's pretty extreme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I mean there's a lot of people  hacking for their PC. BIOS upgrade? Come on.  That's not like

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  this is like some guy thinks he's downloading  a game and the next thing you know is machine  stops working forever. Well what's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is that somebody pointed out  online that basically Symantec made a big  deal out of this just like they made a big deal out of the first  Palm OS virus. Right. But nobody really  has it. Well but they released a Palm OS tool  like virus removal protection  software kit. So they're gonna do that for PSP?  There's been three viruses on the Palm  since then you know but they're making money

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  off of it. You think it's a scam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that what you're saying? I'm saying that they're taking advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's an untapped market. To this day people  come to me and say well everyone knows that the  virus companies make the viruses.  Yeah that's BS. That's BS though. You don't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  to. Right. There's plenty of willing.  Why buy a cow when the milk is free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A lot of bored teenagers out there. There are.  They busted, they busted three teenagers  the kids who did, what was the name  of that worm? It's some TK  worm or something.  Oh is this for trying to make a secure chat room

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and then like. No no. Well yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  it was a worm that would take over,  log your, you know use a machine to be zombie,  log into a chat room and then they could issue commands.  Two of them in Britain,  one of them in Indiana. And  they're going to jail. Good.  It wasn't that  big a virus you know. Usually  you know they really blow these  estimates of how much these viruses cost  at a proportion. They say this one costs  5.5 million pounds which means  it was like nobody got it.  It's like nothing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm pretty much

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have you heard of this very obscure

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  story but I don't know. I was  thinking about it when you talk about how many terabytes  you're going to need on your computer to do photoshopping  and like this company called Matrix V says they're coming  out with a lossless compression codec  that's supposedly 15 times better than JPEG  or up to 15 times better. You know I hear these

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  stories every year. I agree with you.  I have heard these stories for 20 years.  Remember fractal compression?  Yeah. Being down to the size of  a pen. Yeah.  The ASCII code for  three. It's the entire picture  of Washington DC. Everything's  there. Unbelievable. This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  from some website business 2.0.  So you're probably vaporware of some sort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What website? Business what? 2.0?  Business 2.0.  Yeah I think that's the giveaway right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What was wrong with business 1.0? That's my question.  Until they get to business 3.0  we know it's not going to be a good product.  This is 2.15B.  Google releases a news reader. Do we care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well a lot of people are  scared. I think it's a little late to the game.  And who cares? Well because

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's Google you wouldn't have brought it up if it wasn't Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely would not have. That was actually one of the things people  talked about at Web 2.0 is if there was  any interesting Google moving into your area  if there was no point in starting a company.  And a couple of the people at Google  were like, hey you know what? A lot of people  made a lot of money off of being purchased by our  competitors whenever we move into a new

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  area. But Sergi said  that they're not going to do an office suite.  Like why would they

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  do an office suite? I know I never got that story either.  The whole thing and this deal with  McNeely which is just a bunch of BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What is that Sun Google deal? Tell me about that.  You should read my column in Market Watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  last week. It talks all about it.  It's a scam. It's nothing.  It's a toolbar. It's a toolbar.  They already have the toolbar. Now they  basically what it is is Eric Schmidt  used to work for Sun as the CTO  and him and McNeely  are old drinking buddies  and they needed an excuse to ride off a binge.  So they got together  and sat there. Did you say that in Market Watch?  Is that the gist of the story? Well I didn't quite say  that but it's something like that.  So the two of them got together and they thought  they'd jack up Microsoft a little bit with  a non-announcement and then go out  and have a beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow. I was looking for that story.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Little known fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Little known secret. Beware the binge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'll get a call from Sun PR now  I should just call you. I don't know why  you say stuff like that. It's not very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not very nice.  You're not very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it because Sun Microsystems kind of was like  involved with the open office thing so they're thinking  oh they're going to get involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And release something that you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  use online because everyone, you know,  Web 2.0, everything's going to be online so you don't need your office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah you definitely want to use this  online spreadsheet.  I think I'll just recalculate these  5,000 cells and go  maybe to dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Alright let's get some questions  from our vast audience here  at the beautiful Gallery Cafe  in Nob Hill. There's a little microphone  there if you step right up. I like the guy with the  nerd t-shirt. That's a nice  t-shirt. He says nerd. He is a nerd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well you don't know that.  He's making the claim we can't be absolutely  sure. Maybe a bluff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ski San Francisco. Come on up. You asked if you've  gotten those when the Extreme Games were  here. Did you ski?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No I helped work it though. Did you? That must have been cool.  I live in Pack Heights and I was one of the neighbors that tried to make the thing happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Big local controversy because they  built a ski slope in San Francisco.  It was beautiful.  It was unbelievable. Did you go see it? It was awesome.  Some great pictures.  I got lucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I watched the Blue Angels, jumped in my car,  came down here. I got one hour  sleep last night. I got a  TI PowerBook first generation.  The screen went dead  maybe a year and a half ago. But I pretty  much use it as a desktop so I've got an  external monitor.  Now I've got the blue screen to death and I've  done everything to try to fix it. Any clue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I feel so sorry for  Windows users.  I never get blue screen. I never saw

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  blue screen on a Mac either so I don't know what's going on.  I haven't seen a blue screen at death

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  for two or three years.  I see them all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know the monitor is good because I plugged it into  my mini and it works fine.  I don't see the blue screen at death? What is that thing I see on my

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's probably flash backs  and LSD chips in the 60s.  Believe me there's no blue screens at death  anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bill Gates has announced  Governor Schwarzenegger has decided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the same man who gets no spam.  I'm not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You've got the blue screen. I mean really.  Yes.  I'm talking to him.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What are you

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  running? You running Windows 95?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a nice XP machine.  And periodically for no reason at all.  I have a setup.  I have a KVM switch.  I have a couple of PCs. I have dual monitors.  When the Mac is switched up I have two monitors.  Or I could have a Mac and a PC monitor.  Alright, alright. Get to the point.  Just every once in a while.  At least every couple of days.  Did you build the machine?  Yes. When I'm built on the screen saver sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh there you go.  Somebody slipped in the blue screen of death  code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's probably some software I'm running.  But the point is yes they still happen.  He's got it.  So what do you think I should do?  Can you reinstall the OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Reinstall the OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think so.  On XP the only time you have blue screens of death is if...  A blue screen of death means that something got hit  ring zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've got disc warrior in it.  I've done a PRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Get a new version of it.  The last version, the new SP6  or whatever the hell it is.  Load that maybe.  I'm telling you this is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm all the way down here and you guys aren't helping me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is not a help show.  This is like Bob O'Donnell's show.  No. This is what Leo used to do.  They're terrible.  You do these radio shows and people ask you  the craziest questions about...  It's all Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's all Windows viruses and spyware now.  It's a TI power book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh it's a power book.  Then you don't get a blue screen of death.  That's what I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it locking up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe it's blue. There's no text on it?  There's nothing.  Throw it out.  Throw it out.  Is it happening while it's running or is it only when you first start it up?  It means it's not booting up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No it's booting up. I can hear it and disc warrior.  Throw it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Really. That's what these things are for.  You should get all my content to throw away.  Dump the Mac and get Windows.  Thanks guys.  The other thing is you should have had the machine backed up anyway.  You didn't right?  Of course not.  It's your fault.  I used to do a radio show,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  a help show with the Borac  and that's exactly what it was like.  Next question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Forget it. Dump it.  Really? What do you want to keep this garbage for?  It's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The TI power books were pretty bad.  Give it to your worst enemy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I thought he meant Texas Instruments.  The last TI machine that I ever had was the...  It was like the 99.  That would have a blue screen.  It was on purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we didn't help him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What did you tell him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Target disc mode.  There you go. We knew that.  Hold down the T and you can copy all the data off.  It must be Alan's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We have more expertise in the audience  than you're ever going to see up at this panel.  That's exactly true.  But we're more entertaining.  We're not going to help you.  Just as a spirit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody's ever going to ask us another question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know I drove them away.  That's it. Go ahead, guys.  Step up to the microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm currently broadcasting the Swiftcast on my website right now.  But the problem is I can only broadcast video.  I don't know how to do audio.  How do I go about doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's live right now.  It's live here right now?  Where is it?  It's right there on the corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're using a PC?  Yes, I'm using a PC.  What software are you using?  I'm using Webcam XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think Webcam may not do audio.  I don't know.  You need a program that does audio.  It's harder because it's more data you have to send.  But the bigger data is the video data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Currently, my server allows me to run unlimited bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That won't last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Can you give us  some IP addresses and passwords?  I can do some unlimited bandwidth.  I'm using 3x.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a dollar hosting service.  Wow.  It's $33 a year.  But they say...  Unlimited bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's something wrong with this picture.  No, until you use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  As soon as you start using it, they go, oh, sorry.  You're greenhouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've hosted the last one and it was able to hold up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you're broadcasting the video on Twitter.  But there's no audio.  You know what? Have fun with subtitling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just have people subtitle it.  It's like a caption contest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It would be cool.  What's Dvorak saying now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stenographer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a software you're using.  You need to use a different program.  You probably want to use something like  the Microsoft Windows streaming media producer.  That actually is...  People ask you for  an XFIT.  What do you use for streaming your video?  The only affordable way to do it is the Windows producer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a free version of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Windows Media and Kodi is free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it will send a Windows Media stream out.  And it works fine.  And then you have to have a micro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There won't be any sync with the voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a hard thing to do.  It's really tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's actually not that bad these days.  It's a lot of work.  I have to have lunch with these guys.  I start to use code stuff.  It's like an hour later.  The mouth moves.  It's unbelievable.  It's on your new SLI rig?  Maybe that's what I need to use.  There's no time code in consumer video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's no way for them to sync it up.  It's like a crapshoot.  Yes sir.  Taxidermy.  Stuffing...  God damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The guy comes up there with  no more lewd t-shirts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't read every t-shirt that comes up I guess.  I'll come up for you guys.  I had a question.  You know the whole thing with Palm and  Microsoft and Verizon.  They're all teaming up.  The Palm OS might be gone away.  What do you think that will do to all the applications?  Because Palm has 70% of the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Come here. Show us your shirt so that DeVorek can blog it.  Get close enough so he can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Make Willy's Dexidermy.  Ironically I just bought a Palm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Am I crazy?  I just bought a LifeDrive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When did the Trio 700 come out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You bought it just so it could hold all year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's 4 gigs.  The only problem is the battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Trio 700 is coming out and it's supposed to  support both the Palm and Windows.  Not in one machine with both.  You choose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can they make an emulation mode under Windows?  People are going to reuse the hardware forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was the problem.  Nobody ever bought a second Palm.  Steve was saying he's got this stack of...  Tungsten T2s.  It's what he likes to use for an eBook.  They don't make it anymore.  In the fridge.  I think neither platform is doing that well.  Neither Palm nor Pocket PC is doing very well at all.  I don't know what the long term future is.  It's going to be a phone.  Everybody says it's going to be a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've just got a VX9800 which is amazing for SMS.  But there's no PDA features.  It's a bloody fortune to buy a phone with an integrated PDA OS.  I think with 3G networks coming along,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  like EVDO, Edge,  T-Mobile,  you know,  Fastr, PCS,  you're going to want something that's more computer like on your cell phone.  Because you're going to have that high bandwidth.  I think it's inevitable.  Having seen what they send out over that high bandwidth,  it's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Like what?  I'll show it to you afterwards.  It's a little tiny picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the future though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It may be the future.  You know if they built it into a monocle,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  it would be awesome.  This is the LG8100.  It's one of those EVDO phones from Verizon.  I've got the 9800 over there.  It's cool.  Is that the one with the keyboard that you open up?  You flip open?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got it right there.  It's pretty clunky. It's pretty big.  It's what you have to do to have a big enough keyboard to be usable.  You know what it reminds me of?  It reminds me of a Cyan.  Except the Cyan keyboard is much more usable.  It's kind of cool.  The biggest problem is the browsing is still not adapted.  It actually looks like a small laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's pretty good.  That's why OQO is not going anywhere.  The LQO is not going anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's $2,000.  It's got stereo speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's another one for the videos.  This has stereo speakers too, which is really silly.  This is a regular cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's part of what they're trying to push for EVDO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All this content is going to be from all those videos.  Come on.  It's your 2 Meg ringtone sound effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Throw it.  We're actually looking at a deal to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  a video on cell phones.  Oh yeah, good.  Your head will be this big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm going to ball in that  W800 from Sony Ericsson right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm this close to picking one up.  It has built in all the things I really love.  It has memory card reader.  It has a memory card reader.  It has a memory card reader.  What does a memory stick do?  This has an SD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have that.  I can put up to 2 gigs of storage in it.  It has FM radio, MP3 support.  MP4 video support.  Really good MP3 support and a really good interface.  I like the FM radio.  That's what really got me hooked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And a 2 Megapixel camera, which actually took pretty darn good pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the right size.  It has all the features.  But the MP4 video is what really matters.  Not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no good input-output for getting information into it.  I have a nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm syncing all this stuff together.  Is that the Verizon...  It's Sprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But that's Pocket PC.  Everybody hold up your cell phones.  That's the only thing they're good for.  It's like a show off.  That's newer than mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then they can all go to the Bono concert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  Who needs lighters?  Let's decide who has the coolest phone here.  He's got the one that goes zzip.  I take the Razer.  I think that's the coolest phone.  The Razer is very beautiful.  Sandra on camera one has the Razer.  It's got ATI graphics in there.  There's that flip phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is the funniest picture I've ever seen.  Hold on a second.  Let me blog this.  You've got to put that shirt on too.  I'm going to miss this.  Wow, that's terrible.  If I were some big tech company

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and I were looking for people  to get the early adopters  to get the bus.  I'd come here and start giving out free stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We should charge money.  Let them in.  This is the people they want to meet.  Why would these people even come here?  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nobody's ever figured that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's kind of an amazing thing.  You pound the drum a lot.  Is it me?  I don't think I pound the drum.  You're great at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't think I do it that way.  I think I have a bad rep.  People used to say I buy my book a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Are you kidding us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's true.  My books are way off this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You wonder why.  I'm not on TV saying I buy my book.  It was basically one giant infomercial.  My publisher called me.  Leo Laporte screensavers and infomercial  for Leo's book show.  I didn't want to do it.  He made me do it.  It was Peter Hammersley's brother.  Then Paul could kiss his ass.  It was one of those things.  It may have been Paul who got you started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But how many of you here have a full life-size cutout of themselves?  I rest my case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You lost half the authors.  All the staff who write articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You put that thing at the dinner table and nobody knows.  We call them Elijah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  My publisher calls me and says what are you going to do?  Because the book is not selling.  You have to flog the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He said would you please do Regis and Kelly?  I said I don't want to do Regis.  They forced me to do Regis and Kelly.  I thought you liked doing Regis and Kelly.  I like doing Regis and Kelly.  It's a lot of work for four minutes.  I don't think I get much value out of it.  Welcome to the realm of a segment producer.  Did you hold up your book?  They hold up the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm not going to do it.  How about this?  Maybe you got normal royalties instead of the screw job.  That's the problem.  I get 2% royalties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I told them that.  I said why should I do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this the same company that printed on your book that Leo's technology a laminac?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's time for us to think about putting this group together and doing a twit book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Selling it as a package deal.  And for the twit customers.  The people who listen to twit would buy a book aimed specifically at them.  What's a best seller?  The best seller is the one who's going to be the best seller.  What's a best seller in the computer book world?  Nowadays probably what depends.  Actually some people hit a couple hundred thousand.  But typically 50, 60, 75 thousand.  50 would be a best seller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We got 200 thousand listeners.  If one in four bought a copy.  We may have 400 thousand I think.  You wrote a very nice column by the way.  I have to thank you.  You finally read it.  I kept telling you for weeks and weeks about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Thank you for the plug.  I'm plugging myself there too but not quite to the extreme you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I learned from the best John.  I learned from the master.  He wrote an article about podcasting.  And he talks about us.  He hopes we are the first to reach a million.  I think I mentioned everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I had to put a list of everybody.  Somebody out there is never going to speak to me again.  X the CD and Taktiviers.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw a story on dig the other day.  About a new controller interface.  Two handed controller interface.  Called the Taktipad.  It's a nice thing.  I've seen it before.  It's like an overhead projection.  It shows your hands on the screen.  It's like Taktiva.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's kind of weird.  You are typing on the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It projects the keyboard on the table.  It's a prototype thing.  They are building right now.  It's actually control.  It's like multiple mouse points on the screen.  There it is.  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It looks like an overhead projector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it just watching your finger movements?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a combination of a whole bunch of things.  It's like the touch pad on a laptop.  Is this something you want to get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What's the point of the question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just wondering if you guys have any thoughts about it.  I think these are bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Every year there's another stupid mouse.  Crackpot concepts.  Remember the ones with the pedals?  Remember the one hand actually?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The people who use them are people who have severe carpal tunnel.  But it's that build a better mouse trap thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Where everybody is out there saying,  gosh, if we could just build the next mouse.  We're skeptical with the answer.  The mouse works very well.  Doug Engelbart's design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The Wacom tablet works really well too.  If you need to really find...  Do you use a tablet?  Sometimes. My son steals them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My daughter does the same thing.  The kids love tablets because it's a very natural way to grow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The coolest thing with the newest version of Illustrator,  you can do some amazing things because when you do crappy lines,  it fixes them all.  It's like, wow.  Artist in a box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have pressure sensitivity built into Photoshop now.  Yeah, where as the Illustrator too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you turn it upside down and you can erase.  Which is what I use more than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like Wacoms or Wacoms or however you pronounce them.  They have the Cintiq model.  It's an actual LCD with a textured surface that feels like paper.  Those are nice.  And it is one of the...  You put that in front of...  I put it in front of pretty much a computer illiterate person,  but they were an artist.  And within five minutes they were just going to town on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just loving it.  So we're not impressed by that model.  But who knows, it could be the next big thing.  I want the one with the pedals.  Next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Speaking of weird controllers,  are any of you guys gamers and what do you think of the Revolution controller?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We talked about Revolution a couple of weeks ago.  I like it.  You would use it?  If it has the precision of something like Gyrations

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's a wireless mice that you can use.  Or you hold in the air and rotate it.  If that's as accurate as that, it should be really awesome.  Then you have the separate analog controller  and you can always turn it sideways for the old school games.  The one hand held part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A bunch of the people from OneUp actually got to play with the demos on it.  Because we had them on the show talking about it  and they were incredibly enthusiastic about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The demos with the different methods you could use it to do it.  Playing tennis with it or the fishing games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they said it was much, much more accurate than they expected.  And it was much more functional.  I'm sure the show is digital life TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How many cameras do you have?  We've got four.  There you go.  Are they the Logitech ones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The little balls?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It feels that way sometimes.  One of the new Sony prosumer HD cams.  Which is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  These are not our new cameras yet, are they?  No, alright. These are the old cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nintendo made a trailer of a different way.  It seems to me that the trailer  was made more to almost get game developers  to all the different ways that you could use it.  That's who they're trying to convince.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're deciding to push it way out  and just redefine the interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was like with the dual screen for the  Nintendo DS.  You have to come up with new applications  to take advantage of a touch screen and a stylus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The dual screen in the DS  didn't really take off.  It's spanking the PSP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're selling 50,000 PSPs a week  right now in the US.  The PS thing is way over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What games take advantage of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What are you doing with a game that dual screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The Nintendo dog is the coolest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more of a Tomagotchi.  You pet it.  But you pet it and you can  scold it.  My daughter would be on the thing for hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  on end with the little dogs.  Apparently if you have two people with the dog game  and the dog will jump to the other machine  and they'll play around with each other.  You can see where that's going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you neglect your dog,  it'll get mangy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is a concept that's never died.  This Tomagotchi thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If you think about taking this DS thing  and making it a little more adult oriented,  I think you've got some interesting possibilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could do the same thing with the Revolution Control.  I thought of five games off the top  that were totally X-rated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll talk about that off the air.  The Revolution would be the one,  that control setup would be one way  I would probably enjoy playing a first person shooter game  on a console.  Right now I've just never gotten it down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  as far as using a console controller.  With that controller,  how long would it be for someone  who gets really sore arms from just holding it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're saying it's very  easy to use.  The interfaces are getting so complex,  like an Xbox controller, the games are getting so  complex and the sets of the controls are getting so  simplex, they just want to simplify it.  People are saying it's not that hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You hear that music?  That means we have to wrap this up.  Yes, I hear the music.  You can't really get into hearing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We are almost out of time.  I want to thank Mark Blasco for our opening theme  and of course Ashley Twitt for the closing theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Dorothy Yamamoto for the little twit man.  Thanks to Chris Horat,  Text America for the  I'm mo-blogging this t-shirt,  textamerica.com.  I can't give a plug to everybody who gives  these t-shirts.  Yeah, you can.  Send t-shirts too this week in 10.  EO Box  1018, Petaluma, California  Make sure there are at least a box of them before you start  getting them.  Programmer size though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I like extra large, I don't think programmers necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you see my new Scott E. Vest by the way?  Don't lose your Edimodic headphones.  Yeah, it's got the Edimods are wired into the personal  area network.  That's about as nerdy as you're ever going to get.  31 pockets, look at this, there's a pocket here,  and these have pockets.  So many pockets on this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You can sell watches and stuff.  Is it machine washable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it's leather, dude.  It looks like pleather to me.  It could be pleather.  No, this is real leather.  It's nice leather, yeah.  They also have an expensive jacket.  That's why I'm giving it back as soon as I'm done with it  on Regis and Kelly.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Giving it back is a bad policy.  Is it?  It costs more to ship it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It does.  It costs more to ship it.  It depends on what your time's worth.  They probably really don't want it back.  Not after you wear it.  That's what he said about the last one.  I said I'm sending it back, he said, you know, we really can't sell it now.  But next time try to stay away from the tequila.  So I want to thank  of course the folks at America Online's  podcasting channel, AOL Radio.  It's AOLMusic.com.  It's AOL Podcasting Channel on AOL Radio.  So do we even count that?  Because that could be a million people a month.  We don't know.  They run it over and over again.  Not merely downloading it, but they have, you know, the AOL Radio.  There needs to be a Nielsen or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's no way we can measure it.  I think at this point already, because podcasting  is still subtly in the underground,  I don't think anyone has a clue as to how many people  are listening, but I run into people all the time  and they say they're listening in their car.  I think it's impinging on radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I agree with you 100%.  In fact, I love your  he describes the boardroom at the big media  company when finally some podcast  gets a million people and the people of the executives go crazy.  What's going on? Has anybody heard about this?  And the three geeks in the back  raise their hands.  We're actually everybody in the room except the executives.  That was Patrick's point about  the executives at Google.  They get it.  They get it. Thanks too to the folks at Pixelcore  who are our incredible crew here.  Shooting it and mixing it.  Doing the audio as well as the video.  P-I-X-E-L-C-O-R-P-S.com  Hey, we got our new servers  running. I'm proud of myself.  I was able to tweak Apache and get that thing  synced. The twit server? The new twit server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Awesome. It's running into a bunch of issues  where pages weren't coming up and things like that.  I think it's better. Try it now. Yeah, that was like a week or so ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know, part of it was when I  was moving, but also there were sequel errors and there was  all sorts of trouble, but everything seems to be much  more smooth. I've tweaked it now. What do you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  with the old twit mixer? The old twit mixer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know. You want it? Hey.  Sell it on eBay. I could use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You need a mixer? No, I want your invite. I want to go to  the Apple thing next week. Give it back to him later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You want to go to the Apple thing? Yeah. Okay.  You go to the Apple thing and cover it. Bring back sound.  Prager will be at the Apple event.  We'll talk about it. Oh, you're going to be here next week?  Buddy, you aren't going to be here. I think it's just going to be me, right?  Dvorak's not going to be here. Patrick's not going to be here.  Robert's not going to be here. I'll be in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're all going to New York for what? Digital Life.  Yeah, baby. Digital Life show at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Friday Saturday. Are you going, David?  We should do a meetup, actually.  You know what you really should do is  twit in New York. And if you do,  let me know and I won't come.  We're three hours ahead, too.  We could do it. I'm going to be in  Toronto.  Figure out what time we'll be here.  I think it's too much work. We have some other guests  who are already here. One o'clock East Coast time.  We're going to next week, it will be  Wilhurst, Larry Lessig, and the former chairman of  the FCC, Michael Powell, joining us on  This Week in Tech. So you guys just take your time kind of backwards.  Oh, I see how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I can't guarantee Lessig's next week,  but he'd probably be glad to come.  I'm just making it up. If he's around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You all in the audience, you will be our  guests. Thank you very much for coming once again.  I don't know where we're going to be next week. Watch the  twit website, thisweekintech.com, for  directions to our...  I think we should do it at a secret locale every week

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  somewhere different all the time. Actually, the audience  would grow bigger and bigger. Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You used to do that for your condex parties.  They got out of control. The whole idea of the  condex party is no one knew where it was.  You would hide it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Pretty much, yeah. And then it became  the thing. Right.  The next thing you know, it would be 30,000  people jamming into places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And Johnny, on this show, he'd come  in with groups of people  on his arms, his bodyguards, and the whole  thing was really... Yeah, this is a myth.  It was a trip.  It's a myth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You never did that? No, but I  hear a lot of stories. There are myths about you.  My favorite one is the one when I came in on a  helicopter.  Where'd you get that story, I ask the guy?  Helicopter. We saw it. I saw it  with my own eyes. No, I don't know.
