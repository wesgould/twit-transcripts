This is Twix, episode 140, on the line with me right now, johncdivorak.org slash blog.  From the blogosphere. You're tired today because you already did no agenda, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I did, and you should mention I'm also now a Twitter nutball like the rest of you jerk-offs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really, that's... Those are the two words that go together in my opinion, jerk-off and Twitter.  I mean, I think those are... That's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I like it, that's the weird thing about it, so I guess I'm another jerk-off.  So, no, it's a valuable tool in my arsenal.  In your arsenal?  Yeah, the real Dvorak, by the way, is the name. Plug it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's another fella who's actually coming on strong on Twitter.  He hardly used it at all for a while, and now he's number five, with almost 20,000 users, weighing in at 112 pounds, in the red shorts, Mr. Kevin Rose.  Hello, hello.  I haven't seen you in so long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's been forever. I'm no longer 120 pounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You used to be.  That's true.  He's the dig man. No, you climb in rocks a lot. I see you're always at Mission Cliffs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Mission Cliffs. It's probably the best climbing gym in San Francisco. Another one opens up soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My daughter, who follows you on Twitter, is also a rock climber, really loves it.  Awesome.  Yeah, and she says, where does he go, where does he go?  I think it's Mission Cliffs, because that's where you were going when it's right near Tech TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like a couple of blocks away, right there on the intermission.  It's where you used to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  So what happened, because, okay, look, this is not going to be the Twitter show. I know everybody hates it when we talk about Twitter, so we're going to get it out of the way right now.  There are a couple of Twitter stories, but I think a big story, because Kevin, you're a principal at Pounce, which is a Twitter competitor, but all of a sudden you started posting on Twitter, and as soon as people notice that you're coming on strong, you will be number one on Twitter at this rate in just a month or so.  I mean, you're really moving up the charts.  Actually, so is John for that matter. John, you got like five or six thousand, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I've got ten thousand four hundred, and I've only been doing it for twenty days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Kevin's got almost twenty thousand.  It's insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I got, he's got me up, but he's been on it longer than twenty days, hasn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but he didn't post at all, and you posted like once a month for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, he's got a bunch of, but he's a young, good-looking guy who's worth millions.  I'm just a schmuck old man that's trying to make, eke out a living.  Why did you start posting all of a sudden, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I use it for different reasons than how I use Pounce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With Twitter, it's more like, you know, if I'm on the go, if I'm out and about around the city,  it's a great way to send out a blast message to a bunch of people.  I was out with the wine guy, Gary Vaynerchuk, here a couple weeks ago.  Gary really uses it like crazy.  Have you had him on the show yet?  No, I haven't.  Oh, you totally have to have him on the show.  He's a tech hit as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. No, he's really proven the power of podcasting, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's been nuts. He's been blown up.  But yeah, we were out and about, and we sent out a couple messages on Twitter saying,  hey, we're going to do a little wine tasting thing, meet up here.  And then all of a sudden, you know, we had a couple hundred people meet up in just an hour or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's amazing. The power of it is really mind-boggling.  You're buying wine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have some wine, yes.  You're 21?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, John's an enophile as well. He really loves his wine.  I'm a collector.  You're a collector? Really? Do you have a cellar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course. I've had a cellar for decades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What are you most excited about in your cellar right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I collect Bordeaux mostly. I have some burgundies, but I'm not a burgundy guy. I can't afford it.  I'm just trying to eke out a living.  But I have a lot of Bordeaux, and I have some, you know, I got some 28s and 45s and things like that.  Yeah, I got some 1928 Gerard LaRose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow. Did your mom lay that down when you were born, and then, you know, you're going to drink it like when you're dead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think my mom ever drank in her life.  Really?  No, actually, I got it from the, it's a long story.  I got it from an old cellar in San Francisco that was established in the,  actually, probably pre-prohibition and maintained itself.  Really?  Yeah, it's a long story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It survived prohibition because it was 1928. That's interesting.  Yeah.  Kevin, what's your favorite? You must have a cellar by now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have a cellar. I have a little tiny wine fridge that I keep a bunch of stuff in, just, you know, in the apartment.  Well, that's a cellar. That's a cellar.  Yeah, I mean, it keeps the wine cold.  Cold? No, it keeps it, the wine is cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it keeps it the proper temperature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, 55 degrees. It's chilly.  Cool.  But yeah, I've been into pinos lately. The fact that we live, like, you know, two hours away from Napa is just awesome.  And Leo, you're even closer than I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I live in Sonoma County, and we have great wine here.  So that's going to be my come-on to both of you guys to get you up here to live once we start doing that is we're going to have wine and food, and it'll be very, it'll be.  Oh, that would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we're going to, you know, I realized.  But yeah, we had to drive home.  No, no, I realized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cars, cars.  Cars.  I'm going to get you cars.  I have to get you cars.  I can't send you home drunk.  So we're going to, we're going to pick you up.  We might. Is it okay if we get one stretch that picks you all up, like comes and gets you all?  Or do we have to get an individual car for each of you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Man, party, man, in the stretch.  I'm down for whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys just tell me when and where to show up.  We'll send a car down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll send a car down.  You'll come up. It's a beautiful wine country.  We'll have wonderful food.  I'll have, we'll pour different.  We'll have the vintners come in.  We'll do tastings.  We'll do tastings.  Pour different wines every time.  Cause I know a lot of vendors.  Cheese.  Cheese.  Got great cheese.  In fact, we just hired the office manager.  Frederique is Belgian and is a cheese expert.  So we're going to have very interesting cheeses.  Oh yeah.  This is going to be great.  We're going to smuggle in unpasteurized cheese.  So if you get sick, it ain't my fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the best cheese is unpasteurized.  It's actually more likely to get sick from pasteurized cheese.  Let's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what?  This show has gotten down such a rat hole.  First Twitter and then as if that weren't bad enough, now wine and now unpasteurized cheese.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And actually, you know, I'm up in Washington.  I do it here a little bit too, but we have a dairy nearby that has raw milk.  Really?  The difference between raw milk and the pasteurized milk.  And the only reason, of course, pasteurized milk ever became in vogue and why they have all this propaganda against raw milk is because, you know, the stuff is contaminated.  So they had to pasteurize it.  In fact, it's one of the reasons I don't like the idea of having gamma radiation, which is perfectly safe and using it to sterilize meat.  Because if you do that, once you do that, they're just going to sell us essentially cow manure mixed in with the meat.  But it's clean.  But it'll be clean.  Clean cow manure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It always gets me when they say, oh, you got to cook the burgers thoroughly so that it kills the E. coli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's it doing in there?  Why is it in there?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There is there actually is tech news.  I don't even want to talk about tech, though.  I'm so excited about just having you guys on.  Patrick Norton is supposed to join us.  It was supposed to be.  The theory was this is the first tweet of the third of the fourth year, I should say.  We celebrated our third anniversary last week.  So the idea was to have bring the old gang back.  And as you know, I mean, this traditional Patrick's not here, but he'll come eventually.  He's probably under his.  It's right par for the course.  He's doing great, though, with Texilla.  And you just hired Veronica Belmont over at Vision 3, Kevin.  And that's a great combo.  That's a fun show.  I love it.  People are already saying it's better than Kate and Leo was.  I mean, it's like it was it's like the new the new tech duo.  They do not say that actually breaks my heart to hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nothing was better than Kate and Leo because your mind it's like good wine as it ages.  It sounds better and better and better.  All the tannins have fallen out and they're in sediment at the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So maybe we should get to tech news before we before everyone thinks we're a bunch of dilettante jerks.  You know, I thought what was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This was the week that a number of companies, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, announced their quarterly results.  And here we are in the midst of a recession and the tech industry seems like it's doing very, very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know that we're technically in the midst of a recession.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, OK, it says a little our recession.  We're about to head into it's not things aren't going well.  You're saying that the economy is good.  I only go by what I can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I'm sure in some parts of the country, if I was in Macon, Georgia, I would probably look at things differently.  Well, you'd be bitter and be clinging to your guns and your religion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do that anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But anyway, so the I'm looking out the freeway here.  The thing is crowded from all, you know, starting at seven thirty in the morning.  It's jam packed until 1030 or 10.  And on the weekends, everyone's driving around, even though the cost of gas is really high.  There's trains going back and forth that are loaded with goods and products, mostly from China.  And everybody seems to have a job.  And I'm not seeing it being.  I mean, I don't think that it could be better.  But if it's better than it is, I never want to be able to drive.  I have to get a helicopter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you think that the that this is bogus when people are saying we're in a recession, that the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's no real recession.  There's a specific formula to determine that we're in recession.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two consecutive declines in in in the quarters, right, of the gross.  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually called something else now.  But the GDP, what do they call it?  GDP, the Deutsche Democratic Republic of GDP.  Exactly. The German.  So the German national product.  Anyway, the yeah, I don't think we've had.  Have we had to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no, it's not officially a recession, although they're starting to use that word in Washington, D.C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they try to get so it's so they don't vote for McCain in November.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That could be. Well, it's been good for Apple.  Apple had 36 percent increase in profits.  They've got 20 billion dollars in the bank.  Apple sales up 43 percent.  I mean, the iPod was flat, but it's so it only sold 10 million in three months.  But that's probably because they've saturated the market.  Two point two nine million Macintosh computers, a 51 percent jump over a year ago.  One point seven million iPhones.  Microsoft's quarter, not as red hot, but but not bad.  A little bit below expectations.  Yahoo struggled a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they did better than planned, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, because they had to take a charge and and so forth.  So, I mean, it really looks like the tech sector is doing is pretty healthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's the story that's kind of being under reported,  which is wasn't it that last week when Microsoft says that they have to buy Yahoo by the end of the week or the deals off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it was it was yesterday.  It was midnight Saturday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The deadline is that isn't if I'm not mistaken, let me hold.  Let me take a look at the calendar here on my atomic clock.  We're we were past the deadline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We are past the deadline.  So there's two there's two possibilities.  And Microsoft has sent kind of weird different signals.  Bomber, I think, said we're about to we're going to walk away.  He said, if you know, if Yahoo doesn't accept, we're going to walk away.  But they but also the strong signals that they might launch a proxy fight, they might make it go hostile.  Maybe both maybe both are intended at the same audience.  You know, it's interesting article, which I didn't I was kind of surprised to see the general sense I'd had is that the Yahoo's themselves.  Certainly, Jerry didn't didn't want to be bought by Microsoft.  But I just I saw a an article by somebody who claims the Silicon Valley insider quoting Kara Schwisher saying senior employees want it over with.  They want Microsoft to acquire Yahoo.  Well, that's the same one that said they're having an emergency meeting this Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Right. Today.  Things out as we record this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then Microsoft says emergency meeting about what they already said, no, they must be thinking about saying yes.  Right. Well, let me back up a second here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't they say that the deadline was Saturday night at midnight?  Yeah, it's over. Any meetings at all?  Well, you know, those deadlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So now Microsoft says we're going to play tough or we're going to walk away.  OK, OK. It's like teenagers.  OK, we'll we'll tell you.  The funny thing is that that's what I kind of put that I wrote a column on Market Watch on Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I did.  We actually threw that in there.  They're acting like 12 year olds.  Yeah, here's Patrick Norton.  Let me add him to the mix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Patrick, you're here.  Yay.  Did you say about that, man?  Did you have a diaper to change?  Well, there was some diaper issues and then I was logged into the wrong Skype account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know, oh, we're using Veronica Velmaats account again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no.  No, I was using my special John Z Dvorak spoof account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The unreal Dvorak allows me to collect absolutely all of my accounts.  It allows me to collect absolutely no spam.  No unauthorized phone calls.  Plus, it allows me to charge exorbitant consulting fees to help companies advance their strategy.  We really should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been a godsend.  I wonder where all my money was going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We really should get Prager and Robert Heron on here.  This is the beginning of the fourth year of Twitter.  I wanted to bring the old gang together.  Technically, John wasn't part of Twitter till episode six or seven.  But since nobody listened to Twitter until episode 10, it didn't really matter.  You remember the episode?  Do you remember the episode, Patrick, where you were sitting on the floor?  You had that little tiny room.  I had one little office and you were sitting on the floor and John's we hadn't really figured out how to use Skype yet.  We I hadn't figured out how to do this.  And John's Skype fell off.  So he was text.  He was chatting me his comments and I was reading them.  It was like channeling Dvorak school was real old school.  Remember that?  That she's we've come a long way now.  I rent the downstairs.  We got streaming video.  I'm buying a TriCaster.  Thanks to you, Patrick.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Say that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You and you and Rose are like, you know, taking over the you guys are going to start your own bank.  There's a difference.  Kevin's spending somebody else's money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm spending my money.  Hey, we'll be a profitable company eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So no, I was going well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I actually am proud to say that because I've been moving so slowly, Twitter's never lost money.  You know, it's never really been, you know, it's never really lost money.  But we just you've moved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've moved so slowly to what?  Like 32 weekly podcasts.  Plus your bandwidth is subsidized by a fortune like 500 companies.  So yeah, that's a good point.  That's been a little helpful.  That's a good time to shout out to AOL for making.  Thank you.  Thank you, AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Between AOL and Matt Levine at Cashfly.  And thank you both of you.  That's about 30 or 40 thousand dollars of the bandwidth a month that I don't have to.  In fact, there would be no twit if it weren't for them.  And then we're going to start streaming video and it's either we haven't decided yet.  Stick them or you stream.  It's going to be one or the other.  They're both very interested and they'll subsidize the video bandwidth.  So it's true.  I have never paid for bandwidth.  So that's a thank God for that.  Otherwise, I would not be profitable.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember that one moment that you the guy told you about the you did something weird and your bandwidth was going to cost you like ten thousand dollars.  Yeah.  What was that?  Sonic Net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I accidentally put my the feeds, not the not the not the not the content, just the RSS feeds.  I put them on my personal Sonic Net account and I got a he said we forgave you.  You had a ten thousand dollar bill this month and a ten thousand dollar bill last month.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you're right.  Glad you weren't working with AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  They wouldn't have forgiven you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm only here thanks to the kindness of strangers.  I thank them profusely and profoundly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it sounds so wrong.  It's nice to it's nice to have you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Patrick, we were talking about the Yahoo Microsoft deal and the fact that of all the pundits out there, I was the only one I believe amongst maybe 100.  I guess there's probably two or three others that said this deal was never going to happen.  And if it did happen, it was going to get killed by the EU.  And now it looks like it's not happening.  Isn't that interesting?  I have to say I'd point this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jason Calacanis was on this show said like two months ago said it'll happen this week.  It'll happen this week.  It's over.  I really hope it doesn't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want it to happen either.  What would become of both companies?  I mean, has Microsoft ever really created a good web property?  Trying to think.  Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually think Microsoft.  Yeah, I think the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Expedia Expedia was a good web property.  That was Microsoft.  And then they sold it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tons of people use Hotmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they didn't create Hotmail.  They didn't create Hotmail.  They were in fact, they had to move it off of Linux was running on Apache and they had a struggle to move it to IIS.  Never was the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maps is pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think live.  I have to say in Microsoft's defense, I think live is actually pretty good.  A lot of those live features, photosynth, a lot of that stuff's really good.  Not as good as Digg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you use any of that stuff?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I use Windows and I don't use any of that stuff.  I don't use any of that stuff.  I think some of the flash stuff you've done on Digg is far better than anything they've done in Microsoft Labs, which just shows you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we haven't messed with that stuff in a while.  I love that stuff.  Here's the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the overlooked aspect of the deal.  By the way, in CaliKanis' defense, he's a, essentially, a spokesperson for.  I mean, he is a representative of how they think in Silicon Valley.  He's part of Group Think.  So he's just expressing what everybody else thought, which was the deal was going to go through because they don't really give it any real thought.  But the one thing that's overlooked in this whole deal, and I was noticing this the other day when I went onto the Yahoo mail account and it was fooling around and I saw some link to somebody's 360 account.  And within about three clicks, because you look at 360, which is a.  That's their kind of group thing.  It's a flaky social network that's kind of like between Orkut and God knows what.  Anyway, you click on something and then you click on something else and then you click on something.  And then the next thing you know, you're in hell.  There's kind of porn, bestiality, the thing that's transsexual in the world is in there.  There's just it's the amount of porn in Yahoo 360.  It's it's absolutely unbelievable.  Do you have that link? Can I send you that link?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you go in and groups is that is a Yahoo 360 now involve Yahoo groups or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think they keep trying.  They don't want to talk about this, but Yahoo has two problems.  They have an extreme amount of extreme porn and not the kind of stuff that you want to look at and think.  Cool porn. It's we're talking bestiality on Yahoo 360.  Oh, please. And then there's you get some size of the porn on Yahoo 360.  There's the amount of spam that Yahoo has got both in just about in their personal ads and they're selling this as anything that they do.  That's like a Craigslist thing is is loaded with spam and and hookers.  And I don't think Microsoft.  I mean, I think anyone who really explores Yahoo realizes that the site's completely out of control in this regard.  And that's why they have to keep trying to dump one thing and bring up another because they try to.  I'm sure some of the companies notice this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think Yahoo has a larger, though, even corporate problem, which is they have all these properties.  And Patrick just illustrated it is groups 360.  Is it the same as and now Yahoo said we're going to redesign everything and we're going to be a social network.  That's the latest. This is their big problem that they don't have anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think internally they can tie all these properties together and the successful properties that they do have have all been acquisitions.  So if you take a look at delicious Flickr, like all the really cool innovation that has happened has all been through acquiring other companies.  No, I don't know. I mean, the Yahoo home page, the Yahoo home page, I think is their fundamental property and Yahoo mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How is that doing against Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who uses that? Nobody uses that.  Even my mother doesn't use that.  Well, I mean, maybe back in like ninety five.  I used it. Yeah. My Yahoo was great.  Yeah, exactly. For one year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I got some problems.  And the fact is, is that they do have they've got some serious issues that I don't even know if Microsoft's aware of some of the problems that that's internal to me.  I didn't know about this pornish and talking about what you just mentioned, Patrick, about.  Oh, I didn't know about this. I didn't know about that.  There was something they canceled something recently with some blogging initiative or something.  I talked about on my my little five minute podcast, Tech Five.  But I mean, it was like Yahoo decides to close down this and that.  And the other thing I'm looking at, I never even heard of these things that are closing down.  I mean, if I didn't know about it, maybe I'd have checked them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, this is an interesting thing. I think what you said, Kevin, is very interesting because, look, they acquired to great then, you know, Joshua, they acquired delicious.  They acquired Flickr.  Has there been any innovation since then?  Has there been any attempt to link any of these properties since then?  It's they they just continue on.  There's no synergy at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, there's there's not really there hasn't been there's too many cooks in the kitchen, I think, when you look at Yahoo, because they have products that compete against each other.  Like there was a photo sharing service that was competing with Flickr.  They finally killed it.  They finally killed it.  But it took them years to kill it.  Yeah, you know, it's like they had a bookmarking service that was competing against delicious and they finally killed that.  I mean, it's like there's too many people trying to launch new products within Yahoo.  They need to focus on their core and focus on their hit properties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But even when they do something like add video to Flickr, they mismanage it completely.  It's too small.  It's too short.  This doesn't compete.  Yeah, there's no community around it.  It's not it's a photo site.  It's not it's not the video doesn't add anything at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's the irony.  I'm sorry.  Here's the irony to me about the whole Yahoo fiasco.  They began their life as a directory that essentially was built around communities.  They were the first.  They own the community concept because all their their whole system relied on groups of people to know the best the best knitting sites or the best sites about spelunking or the best sites about wine collecting or whatever.  There were groups.  There were communities that could have evolved into really pretty much a world takeover, but they got sidetracked somewhere along the lines when they started making too much money.  I don't know what happened, to be honest about it.  But they now they're scrambling to try to do what they used to do when they began.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that begs the issue.  Why is Microsoft trying to buy them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's all about the ads.  It's not about anything in the ad game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just the ads.  Yeah.  The problem from from friends that work there internally that have been acquired by Yahoo.  What I hear is that GMs will come in and take over the product and basically kind of tie the hands of the innovators.  And there's really not much they can do.  They spend all their time porting code over to PHP or whatever it may be and not enough time on the product.  And it's just sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Doesn't the same thing happen to Google though when Google acquires a product?  Look what happened to Dodgeball.  I mean, they eventually just left.  It was like, what are we doing here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think the cool thing about Google is they allow their employees to experiment internally.  They give them a certain amount of time that they can work on their own projects.  The 20 percent thing.  Yeah, they have 20 percent.  I was going to say you get to see really cool products like Gmail come out of someone's just like little side project.  Yeah, Yahoo hasn't done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It hasn't done much like that.  But there's live.yahoo.com.  That was cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It didn't have the engineering background though and it fell over on day one.  Well, you killed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's face it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You killed it too.  Didn't you do it?  I tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I did a couple.  But we can kill anything.  I mean, it's not probably not designed for some big guy to come along and try to do 2000 streams at once.  What about I got to ask you about this, Kevin.  What about Buzz?  Because this is directly aimed at Digg.  Yeah, I mean, Buzz is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Buzz is essentially it has to be like Yahoo content properties that use their ads.  They don't allow everyone in.  They don't allow submissions from little blog sites.  It can only be these very large established commercial sites.  That's a mistake.  There's no community around it.  There's no comments.  There's no like, you know, if you go to the site itself, it's kind of dead.  But yeah, absolutely.  When they can put a link on the front page of Yahoo that drives, you know, it's going to drive hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people to these sites.  Yeah, look what happened to TechCrunch.  It's a huge carrot.  Yeah.  It's a huge carrot for people to put these badges on their pages.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Buzz isn't a complete failure.  I mean, Buzz is not innovative.  It's saying, let's see what Kevin did.  Okay, let's copy that.  I think it's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I think it validates our space a little bit, which makes me happy.  Yeah, it does.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although I don't think you need to validate the space anymore.  Yeah.  It's pretty apparent that the space is validated.  I think you're going to see us going in a few different directions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then here we go.  Well, we don't have to talk about this stuff.  I'm not going to make it a plug.  You're not going to talk about it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every time you come on, you always tease the audience.  I mean, I can talk about it.  I mean, if you take a look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So take a look at what we did an announcement with Facebook.  We did an announcement with Facebook last week where for the first time ever,  now when you dig something,  it'll automatically post that story into your mini feed  and then syndicate out to all of your friends in the main news feed.  So what we're doing is essentially leveraging the Facebook social graph  to syndicate and spread our news stories and videos and images or whatever  to the people that you care about.  And that's kind of where you'll see us going in the future.  It's not all about the dig front page.  It's about getting the content that you care about  in front of the people that you care about.  And we'll leverage all different types of social networks all over the web  to make that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, actually, that's kind of the Facebook platform has been real.  I mean, Twitter is the same way when you put the Twitter application in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but for the longest time, you had to do it with an application.  And with Facebook, like this is our first time,  you don't need an application with Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it's just so it's kind of more, it's a little higher level than an application.  What are you telling me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if I see something that's cool,  Let me try this.  and I, what would I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If I dig, so if I dig something,  do I have to tell Facebook to follow my dig feed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, you do it under the import feature under your mini feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it'll just add it to the mini feed.  Are there other partners they have that will do that too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have Delicious and Flickr, I believe, and like one other Yelp, I think so.  Oh, interesting.  But I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how many uniques do you have a month, Kevin?  26 million.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's stunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't it?  Just to bring it back to what Yahoo does do right,  but doesn't Yahoo have like the second highest amount of traffic online after?  They do, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why Buzz is such a success.  You get on that Yahoo front page.  We just poo-pooed it, but obviously,  that's just us as the lead-  I mean, I'm just saying there, it's bigger than MySpace,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's bigger than YouTube, it's bigger than Facebook,  it's bigger than Windows Live, it's bigger than-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The only thing it's not bigger than is Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, without a doubt, they are a huge, huge-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, they're number, as far as I know,  they're number one in total.  Are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bigger than MSN even?  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem, the only thing I'm arguing about with Yahoo  is the fact that they're having a really hard time pulling it all together.  Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no sign of like strong leadership.  There's no sign of a big strong focus or an overarching.  I mean, Google's really,  they've managed to take a lot of stuff that was going in eight different directions  and at least bind it under, you know,  your sort of Google login in a way that it kind of makes sense.  It's still a little weird sometimes, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And now they're doing that deal with CNET for the next three years  to bring content over from CNET.  It just sounds like one more lump,  one more load of content onto their aggregate.  One more lump under the blanket.  Exactly.  That's a really good way to describe it.  Forget the peanut butter analogy.  It's one big blanket.  So their financial results, let me go back and look at them  because didn't they indicate they were profitable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean-  The company makes money.  The point is, and I've said this before,  even though I complain about the fact that I think they're disorganized  the same way Kevin does and nobody can find, you know,  it looks like a rudder of the ship.  They have plenty of numbers.  And I think that the porn is an issue,  which I think is one of the reasons they don't really want to sell the company  because if this gets uncovered, it could be a disaster.  You know, you could be one of those situations where you buy a company  and then you kick it back at the guys and sue them.  I mean, that's used to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You just kick all those people off though, John.  You just, that's just, you know-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's millions of people from the looks of it.  Well, so you kick them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It works for MySpace on and off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can't you just kick them off?  MySpace doesn't-  Well, actually, they're probably, me talking about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is going to jack their numbers up big time.  They'll be going into profitability really fast.  But the thing is, is that I think that it's a good company anyway.  And I think Microsoft's just trying to steal them.  I think, I've always thought it was a bad idea.  And I think Microsoft should just go do their own damn thing.  I mean, they make a big stink about everything.  They're big shots.  We're going to have the best search engines coming out next week.  Let's do it again.  We have version six of the search engines going to kill everyone.  They're big braggers.  They never get anywhere with it.  I mean, why don't they just go off and actually concentrate on their core competencies,  specifically the operating system, Vista, which they can't seem to get together,  instead of doing all these other things and trying to get to the ad business?  Why are they in the ad business?  They're not in the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, first of all, they're bigger than the New York Times.  And I think they probably sell more advertising than the New York Times.  That would be really fun to look up.  But yeah, I mean, Vista's service pack one is pretty much what Vista should have been as it shipped.  But I mean, you've got to wonder with the size of Microsoft and the money they have,  you know, they probably feel like they have to move in 19 different directions.  I mean, are you going to look at GE and be like,  you need to maintain your core competencies and get rid of all the diversification and sell NBC?  I mean, they're basically...  They should sell NBC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good point, Patrick.  They should sell NBC.  Yahoo's revenue is $2 billion, net income nearly $500 million for a quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, it's not shabby.  9% increase over Q1 2007.  It's not an oil company.  Well, nothing's an oil company.  Now, and Microsoft announced Mesh this week,  or this is something they've been clearly working on.  This is Ray Ozzie's coming out party.  This is Ray Ozzie's new chief software architect,  took over from Bill Gates.  Mesh is...  It's on steroids is what it is.  Is what on steroids?  Lotus Notes.  Let me read from mesh.com.  When you go there, here's what Microsoft says.  Live Mesh.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's even better than that.  Still we don't know.  Still we don't know.  Live Mesh, and it's still a good thing.  It's still a good thing.  It's still a good thing.  It's still a good thing.  It's still a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's still a good thing.  It's still a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  Available wherever you happen to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are the words robust and innovation?  Might as well.  It's completely, it's nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It means nothing.  No, it doesn't mean anything.  And as far as I can tell on this page, what it's done is just they've taken three or four  things that they already had and put them together.  But ultimately...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can active sync for devices.  Yeah.  Their live desktop is the old remote desktop.  Right.  Folders, it says add or share folders.  That's just the old right click and share feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then stay informed with your news.  I mean, I guess that's their MSN.com property.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'm not sure what they've got here, but I think the plan is, at least as articulated  by people who seem to understand it better than I do, they really want to be...  It's cloud computing.  It's their cloud computing initiative.  They want to get off the desktop.  In a way, it's saying we're going to refocus the company away from operating systems and  desktop apps and towards what Google is doing, which is cloud computing.  You log in anywhere.  And by the way, Macintosh and Linux, complete peers.  You don't have to use Windows to use this.  So really, it's actually shocking in a way.  It's Microsoft saying, yeah, I guess Windows isn't the be all and end all for this company.  It's smart.  Yeah, right.  Our profit center.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Do you think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, that would also makes then the Yahoo acquisition is even more because, I mean,  Yahoo is a cloud computing company ultimately, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think everybody has to, at some point, get into this game, especially if you're Microsoft.  I mean, Amazon has launched their web services platform quite a while ago.  Google just announced theirs.  They have going on Google announcers with Google App Engine, which I hear is just pretty amazing.  It looks cool.  It's limited to like 15,000 people right now.  Yeah.  You couldn't put dig on it.  Because it's like scale.  No, you actually, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You think it could actually see if when you when you conceived a dig with it before five years ago,  if this had existed, that's the that's where you go.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And in fact, when you look at things like like pounds, it's completely hosted.  All the images, all the files and everything.  Amazon Web Web Services and the S3.  So some of the stuff, I mean, this is the platform to build applications, web applications on top of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Where's Microsoft's response to that?  That's what Microsoft needs to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what MeSH is.  It's maybe it's that's where they're getting started.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't.  Where's the go to developers first.  Learn more.  Yeah, learn more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you learn more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I haven't learned more yet.  It's oh, wait a minute.  Oh, here it is.  It's your new digital life in detail.  All your devices working together.  See, it seems like that should be like just a given.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But OK, I was just about to learn more.  Now it says click to install Silverlight.  Yeah, that's that's a better experience.  You have to install Silverlight.  This is the problem.  I mean, come on.  Just use Flash.  Just use Flash.  I hear it's better for certain things, but I don't know.  All right.  Predictions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not air?  The barn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like air.  There's some there's some analogy.  I lost it.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pounce was the first air app I used was the Pounce desktop client and it kind of opened  my eyes.  And now the variety of very interesting Twitter desktop clients like Twirl, the new one for  FriendFeed alert thingy really show you what you can do with there.  I mean, I really like air.  I'm much more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's coming along.  It was it was really rough early going.  We had a harder some hard times with with the early betas, but it's a lot better now.  It's nice because you build an app once you write it in action script.  I mean, it's language you're already familiar with if you do flash development and then  you can compile it and basically it'll run on Linux, you know, Mac and PC, kind of the  promise that of Java without the heavy kind of overhead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to talk about Java in a second because Sun says they they a they want to get it on  the iPhone B. They just kind of want to give it away now.  They really want to get it out there as an open source product.  But before we mentioned that, I also want to get your predictions.  This is the week, the decision week for Microsoft Yahoo, as it has been for the last six months.  This could be the week predictions.  Will Microsoft walk away?  Will they go for the hostile takeover?  Kevin, what do you think Microsoft's going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're going to go.  They're probably going to walk away and we're going to see Yahoo's stock drop in half.  You agree, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I mean, I agree that they're going to walk away, but I think they're going to give  it one at least give it one since they promise to do to try a hostile takeover.  I think they're going to do a half hearted attempt.  And I don't think the Yahoo stock is going to drop in half because it's already proven  that it's really probably should be up there.  Well, wait a second, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It jumped up 50 percent on the announcement of the Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, but meanwhile, they've had a new earnings report, which looks pretty good.  And now there's a lot more that people know and a lot of its perception.  The reason it's not going to take a hit at all, it's going to tank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually already taken a hit in after hours trading this weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's got it'll go down, but will it go back up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's dropped a buck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it's going to go.  You're what Kevin's saying is this is going to pound 15.  You know, I don't see it going down much more than it's not going to pound 15.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seventy three percent of Yahoo is owned by institutions.  Yeah, they're going to get a pissing match to stomp on something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Many of whom own Microsoft, many of them also on Microsoft and probably Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, like 60 percent of Google is held by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, if you had a stock strategy, I'd buy all three, wouldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, if it takes a dump, I'm buying some Yahoo stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you have it. You're propping it up single handedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Patrick, you have a prediction.  Well, how what's going to what's the end game on this Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yahoo thing? The end game on the Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What we're we're we're we're coming close, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What what's going to happen?  He wants to know what you think is going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I understand what he's asking.  I'm just trying to decide if I have an intelligent answer to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that never stops me.  That's never stopped me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, actually, it should be funny.  Like it's I just look at Yahoo as being like this big sloppy mess.  It's probably undervalued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know if it's undervalued.  I don't know. Can they turn it? Can they turn it is the question.  I mean, I guess you can make money just kind of with inertia.  But it's not I mean, it's not like they have a strategy.  And it's interesting because I don't I don't think Terry Semel,  who was the CEO, he was forced out.  Jerry Yang comes in.  I don't think Terry Semel leaving and Jerry's taken his position  has changed anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's because Semel sent him in the wrong direction  and they haven't been able that they can't change.  It's a giant giant.  This is the Queen Mary, you know, it's not that easy to turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a big one to turn. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, what do you think, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you're right.  I think I think you're going to see a little hostile attempt to take over.  But it's going to be halfhearted because does.  It doesn't really look like something Microsoft wants.  It's if you do you want to buy somebody who doesn't want to be bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I mean, you have too much sabotage within the company.  It's a mess.  Oh, and I think that they would buy them and start selling off  some of the properties that they really don't need.  And I think that's why I was suspicious that that Murdoch would get in  on the deal to help, you know, maybe offer a little more money.  And Murdoch would get some of the properties because it was a whole bunch  of things that that Yahoo has that Murdoch could use that Microsoft doesn't need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and then Yahoo goes to Google.  They do this advertising deal.  And now the Justice Department is investigating it, which when they should,  can't really help the acquisition effort.  The government is worried that it actually was this phone call.  Eric Schmidt talking to Jerry Yang.  Apparently, it's on record somewhere that he offers to help  thwart Microsoft's bid, which, of course, is collusion.  I don't know if that's illegal.  I don't know.  What I want to know is this is what Reuters is saying.  What I want to know is, is it recorded?  How do they know about this phone call?  Somebody take notes.  The Justice Department is investigating.  Possible antitrust implications of Google's two week test with Yahoo  to combine some of their web search and advertising.  It's a minor part.  It's like one or two percent of Yahoo's overall advertising.  The test ended this week.  I mean, I don't know why they could.  I don't understand why they're concerned over it.  But some of the according to the Reuters source,  some of the government's concern focused on that telephone call.  I don't know how they know about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Joe, I get it.  It was just a typical telephone call intercepted by Homeland Security.  Oh, that's it.  It happens to everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They probably said echelon and that was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure Yang brought the phone call to the board's attention.  This was going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It does. You hit the nail on the head.  Yahoo spokeswoman Terry Schmaller says Yahoo proactively kept the DOJ  informed of its intentions to conduct this limited test  and have provided information to the DOJ on the nature of the test.  They probably also mentioned the phone call.  Boy, you know, Kevin, you're really fitting this corporate world well.  I'm impressed.  I know about that.  You have to deal with that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think Dick is very corporate.  But yeah, you do have to deal with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're thinking about this stuff now.  It's in your, you know, in your DNA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So talking about corporate world and Kevin, let's  let's mention the big party that they had this huge.  This is like the bubble 2.0.  The mighty party had this huge party in the somewhere  in some place in San Francisco is unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you notice, though, that we didn't have an open bar?  So everyone had to buy their own drinks.  See, it isn't web 2.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Money saved. And it wasn't your money was epic's money, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was we did.  It was our money.  We we we paid I think it was five grand for the place or less.  And then just everyone showed up and had a good time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's how much the tech TV reunion was going to cost me.  And we never I never got it together to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, May 11th, Amy, Leo for five grand.  What's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know. Have a big party.  I haven't had any parties. We're going to have a party.  Yeah, won't be a mighty.  I can't really afford mighty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, you should do mighty. Mighty is a good space.  And then you could you could essentially charge $10 a head to get in  and recoup the costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that what you do? So it's like a oh, it's it's a profit deal.  Sounds like a high school party.  Find a sponsor. Did you have a prom theme?  It's an extra $60 for $60 extra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can get a dance with Patrick Norton in a kilt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Only if he was killed in a kilt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For $100, you can pitch your business idea to Kevin Rose.  For $200, John C.  Dvorak will tell you how to get no spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We could get some money out of this.  We could make this is a good idea. We should do this.  This is a business plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Then we can we do an IPO.  I'll get us funded. Parties, Incorporated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, you want to stay you want to stay privately held, Leo.  As soon as you have an IPO, you're publicly held.  And Wall Street owns your ass.  I know Wall Street's not really about logic or intelligent long term planning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they don't like parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't like media companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So May 11th, you know, guys, two weeks from now is the 10th.  Get this, if you want to feel old, the 10th anniversary  of Tech TV's launch, ZDTV at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the this is the longest like I've lived in San Francisco longer  and for longer consecutively than I've lived anywhere else in my entire life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You get itchy, you get the urge to get in your truck and drive to, you know, Muncie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not Muncie. No, it's a lovely town.  Not really where I think they got steak and shake.  Well, there's there is a that is a plus for Muncie, but it's very cold in the winter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was reading on Twitter, somebody was at Steak and Shake and said,  this is the best chili I ever had.  I thought memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mocked the chili Mac until you had one.  I did mock it. I did mock it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now I know I miss those days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what chili Mac. It's a fast food.  How can it be any good?  You lick your freaking plate clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was kind of a disgusting display, I must admit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we have a bunch of people.  I want to mention something here since my looking at my Twitter feed, like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you know, of course, you can't go more than five minutes without checking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just because it has Twitter is stupid, but I have it now.  Dvorak, when the hell the real Dvorak is Twitter, the real Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just kidding about that other stuff, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You still lie better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the that sounds good to me.  Somebody says that they're going to do something about my myself  and Leo having some opinions about mental illness.  That's not correct.  Do we even talk about mental illness ever?  I don't know what they're referencing.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I've found that there, you know, you get to a point.  And I'm sure, Kevin, you've experienced this.  You and Valleywag, you get to a point where even the most  inane utterances suddenly taken seriously.  Did you ever get any flack for your comments last week about Asians, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, never. No, I got a lot of mentions.  In fact, they're positive comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They weren't negative comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, somebody thought I was mean.  But the thing is, I got a really I have a really good post on the Dvorak  dot org slash blog site today.  If you look up China and Congo in the search and you just type in China  space, Congo and read this article because it tells exactly  it's got the whole thing outlined exactly the way I described it.  And there's I'm going to read this paragraph to you because I'm assuming dig it up.  This one is an article in the BBC.  It ran on BBC two is a special.  And it says apparently the Chinese have done a deal with the Congo.  It says in a copy of the original D.R.  Congolese Chinese memorandum of understanding obtained by Newsnight  appears to exonerate the Chinese side from all taxes and customs duties  till the promised building work is completed.  And of course, the scam is they never complete the building work  and they just bring all this stuff into the country and swamp them.  So it's a very interesting piece to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, that's what happened in Cairo.  We're driving around Cairo  and there are a lot of half finished buildings.  And I asked the guide about it.  I mean, a lot, a lot, a lot, almost all of them.  And she said, yeah, you don't have to pay property taxes  until the building is complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's Mexico has that problem, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they never complete it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. You leave a, you know, just something off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. They never paint it.  And they have, you know, just like girders going up above the roof.  Oh, we're still building.  We're still still building. You never pay taxes.  That's just a bad. It seems like a bad tax code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  Or a brilliant tax code if you don't mind having, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, if you want to pay taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  AT&T is at it again.  Remember, this AT&T was the company that started the whole net neutrality  debate by saying, you know, Google owes us for all the bandwidth  they use on our network.  Now, AT&T is saying the Internet's current.  That's it. The Internet's current network architecture  will reach the limit of its capacity by 2010.  Tell it goodbye. He was talking at Web 2.0.  The Internet will not be able to cope with the increasing amounts of video  and user generated content, you know, because it's just a series of tubes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's the funny thing about that article.  If you read carefully, it keeps it goes on.  It says it's going to be full at 2010.  Then it goes on and says it's going to even be worse.  It's going to have tripled by 2015 from 2010.  And I'm thinking, wait a minute, how can it go up if it's full?  So what are they talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He does have some good stats here.  He says eight hours of video is loaded onto YouTube every minute.  Every minute.  That doesn't mean anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know what?  If I load eight pounds of I can't say that word on this podcast,  if I load eight pounds of tomatoes, squano,  yes, into a warehouse every eight minutes,  that doesn't mean any of it's ever going to leave the warehouse. Good point.  You know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One oh one oh one oh comes from an animal that flies.  What kind of horses you got around there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a good point, John.  Bats and birds go on.  Do you want me to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, OK, I'm marking that.  It's got a block.  It all made him do a perk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you're not going to be happy.  Are you happy, John?  I am. I'm happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love this story.  MSNBC, NBC has this really great blog called Field Notes,  where they talk about stuff that they keep the good stuff they can't put on TV.  Apparently,  the leaders of Mexico and Canada were in New Orleans earlier this week.  President Bush was there also for the North American Leaders Summit,  all the North Americans after a high level meeting between the Mexican  and U.S. delegations, White House staffers noticed their blackberries were missing.  Yeah, that's a good story.  They had left the devices on a table outside the meeting room.  Secret service goes to members of the Mexican delegation and says, excuse me,  rawhide says his blackberries missing.  Apparently, one of the members of the Mexican delegation,  a low level official in the communications office in Los Pinos,  Rafael Quintero, took him.  He took him.  And apparently, he was asked to resign when he arrived back in Mexico City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think because he got caught.  Hey, by the way, now I can see, you know, this Twitter thing is a little addictive.  So Mario Santamaria just wrote me and says that the Mexican thing about the  taxes on it says that hasn't been true for six years.  Oh, they fixed it in Mexico, but not in Cairo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not in Cairo. It's still the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm turning off Twitter now.  Please, would you?  Geez.  But at least we got it straightened out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Department of Homeland Security site hacked due to a SQL injection attack.  In fact, many, many sites hacked, according to the register,  a Google search of 520 Google search for the infection string,  the JavaScript that gets stuck into your page if you if you get hacked,  shows more than half a million pages containing the infection,  including the Department of Homeland Security.  DHS reports that, yep,  they hacked us, we fixed it.  And we're going to try to make sure that doesn't happen again.  It's encouraging. It's encouraging.  Yeah, that's great.  Well, and by the way, somebody stole their BlackBerry's.  So. Terrible, terrible thing.  The White House emails been following this.  They're trying to get the emails.  Well, here's an interesting thing.  They're trying to get the emails from the period right before we invaded Iraq,  try to find out what who knew what when. Right.  And there's a lawsuit that was filed in federal court by the Citizens  for Responsibility and Ethics.  The White House says, oh, no, we deleted those.  Oops, there might be some backups.  Seems they've actually got a White House CIO  who's been making backup tapes.  As he should.  Teresa Payton, she  said, may we may or may not.  I'm not saying.  So I guess they forgot to erase the backup tapes.  Yeah, they're also recommending White House employees be ordered to turn over  any flash drives or other portable media that may contain emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can be sure that they've backed up the backup a couple of times.  They have now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not as easy as having Rosemary Woods stretch and put her foot on the recorder  and then stretch over to this side.  That's an old reference.  Only old folks are going to get that one.  The missing what was it?  Twenty twenty four minutes from the John Dean White House tapes  during the Nixon era.  Eighteen minutes. It was 18 minutes.  Wow. You guys are good.  I saw that on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was that movie that came out?  It was called Dick or whatever it was.  Yes. Comedy. Yes.  It was very funny.  Explain the whole thing in some real logical way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some teenage girls came.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Teenage girls came in and did it.  Girls girls.  There was a terrible accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was very recording machine.  That was actually a very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was. But nobody thought it was like you had if you weren't going  if you didn't go through that era, nobody would get any of the jokes.  Yeah. But it was hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, Kevin, what do you know about you probably following what's going on  with Twitter and the two big shots have left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. I'm a friend of Blaine.  Fired? No, I said I'm friends with him and he recently left.  But then there's this news about another Lee McDowley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, he was vice president of engineering.  Sounds like he was fired because he he was hired in January.  To help them scale. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I guess it has really hasn't been scaling too well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From what I understand,  I don't know how much of this I should say, but there's a lot of code  that is sitting there ready to be pushed.  That's really going to help them scale.  That just hasn't been rolled out yet. OK.  So hopefully in the next month,  we'll see a big update that's really going to fix a lot of problems  because you only had one.  They only had Blaine for the longest time.  I think he was the only developer for like the first year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, he left because he was tired of it or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know the exact reasons why he left.  Was it his idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was he the guy at ODO who thought of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, who was it?  I can't remember his first name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But so but Blaine was the  the single he was the lead architect.  He was the designer of the software. Right. Exactly.  It's a tough challenge.  And I know you know this from Pounce using the Django over at Pounce.  Ruby on Rails at Twitter.  It's not it's not really the framework, though.  The challenge is all these database queries you got to make in real time.  And John, you raised a really interesting point.  What's going to happen when a Paris Hilton or a Britney Spears comes on here?  And all of a sudden, instead of just being a bunch of geeks,  you've got millions and millions of people following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aha. So you are following me.  I follow you. So, yeah, no, that is I think that is a concern  because right now the Twitter thing is, you know, I promise people  not to be discussing it because it's kind of boring.  It's in the news.  But the point is, is that there's sure there's a lot of people,  you know, there's 20,000 people following you and Kevin and,  you know, 10 following me and whatever.  But that's like it's like it's ridiculously.  Those are small numbers.  If you have a Paris Hilton who somehow popularizes this and she say  she came out and began to just talk it up  and got a bunch of people to put it on their, you know,  put it on their cell phones and so they could be doing this constantly.  Say it became the age. You'd be out of business.  The range, it would kill it instantly because you talk about, you know,  you'd have a hundred thousand followers overnight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a precedent for this.  One word, Friendster.  Friendster was hugely popular, couldn't scale,  couldn't get the code pushed. They had the code, I think,  couldn't get the code pushed.  I mean, they're still around now.  In fact, I think they're very popular in Brazil or somewhere.  But that's orca is popular.  Friendster is popular in South Korea, somewhere.  Friendster Philippines, Philippines, that's right.  Yeah. But but I mean, it put them out of business in the U.S.  Remember when we all signed up for Friendster, Kevin?  That was like the thing. Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't we have we had one of the we had Jonathan Abrams on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. And I fell for him.  And I think Twitter could be at that. Juncture as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, how does MySpace scale pretty well?  I mean, they have 60, 70 million people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  MySpace would fall over.  They basically wrote everything into just different modules  so that like sometimes your inbox wouldn't be working.  And so like so the entire site wouldn't fall over.  You'd get it. You'd have like, you know, 70 to 80 percent functionality.  And there would just be certain sections of the site that would go down. Right.  You know, sites like like Twitter are extremely hard to scale  because they're so write intensive. Right.  Like you're always doing all these little writes to the database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a database nightmare. I don't know. Yeah.  I don't know how you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're using MySQL. Yeah. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  And I think that that's it's it's a serious mojo or voodoo  to get something like this working.  And I know you know very well because I'm sure Pounce has the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Pounce. I mean, Leo's got how many people you have  following you on Pounce, like 10,000, something like that.  10,000 something like that.  So every time you do a new note, so let's say you want to post a video on Pounce.  Essentially, what happens is that goes out to a job  and then the job picks that up and then hand delivers it  to each one of the buckets, each one of the individual user buckets.  And I mean, we only have 200, right around 200,000 registered,  230,000 registered users on Pounce.  And, you know, we have several like multiple database servers now.  We're looking at breaking into even more.  I can just imagine.  Now, it's just it's I can just imagine.  There's only two full time coders at Pounce and it's just the nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have I should correct myself. I have 8400.  You have like 15,000 on Pounce, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think like 1300 or something like that.  15,000. Yeah.  15,000. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, it's a it's a database nightmare.  And I was talking to a friend who's a developer.  You last night is doing his own startup.  And the problem is that when you create these things, Twitter, especially  Twitter was an afterthought. You just kind of create it.  You don't really think about it. I'm sure dig the same thing.  When Owen started coding, dig, you weren't thinking about scaling.  Right. It was, you know, and the problem is you get cursed by success.  You get a dig.  You must have torn down all the code and started over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the code has been completely rewritten.  I there's very little code that was that was there originally. Yeah.  It's all been rewritten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's not that it was bad code originally,  but it just wasn't with a thought towards how we're going to scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it was written for a single server.  You know, we weren't thinking about sharding.  We weren't thinking about these kind of crazy techniques  that people use to scale sites. We weren't using any web caching.  You know, we didn't have memcache back then.  It was just very simple.  We were editing. You know, we didn't have version control.  We were all doing it, editing live code on the servers.  Oh, my God. Is it it's PHP?  Yeah, it's all it's all lamp lamp stack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you glad that you chose that instead of, say, a framework?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Rails was really major frameworks back when we started the site.  You know, there was nothing out there that I mean, there was like the Zen stuff  from the from on the PHP side, but it was, you know, it's great  because it's it's very it makes it very easy for us to hire good  Yahoo engineers right now because they're all PHP developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cheap. They're easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's lots of lots of resumes coming in from Yahoo, which I'm.  Are there really? How interesting.  Oh, absolutely.  There's people looking to jump ship all the time right now.  So really senior people, too, which is great.  Uh huh.  It's been really hard.  It's hard for for startups to get quality engineers.  I think there's a lot of developers out there right now that that, you know,  are looking for work.  But when you when you sit down with an engineer and you say, OK, you know,  how many sites have you worked on that have, you know, have at least  even a million unique visitors per month?  Ninety five percent of them are going to say, you know,  I've only worked on small projects that, you know, are in corporate  internets or they've never had really any real world experience  scaling very large sites. Right.  And when you get people coming in from Yahoo that have done that,  it's just like gold for us.  We're very excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're not tempted to wait until because Yahoo kind of has a poison pill for the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's we've had people send us resumes saying I'm looking.  I'd love to interview, but I have to wait a few more weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just till till a Microsoft deal happens.  If it happens, they get a nice severance package. Exactly.  And if it doesn't happen, then they go, please, Kevin, please get me out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think about that nightmare, though.  Imagine having to rewrite all of Yahoo into IIS,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  C sharp and dot net.  That's what they went through with Hotmail.  And this is like Hotmail times 12.  So who what line are you going to wait in, Kevin, for Grand Theft Auto for?  Where should we look for you on Tuesday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I've I'm not a huge fan of the game, actually. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're the youngest person here.  I thought you might be Patrick.  Are you a big GTA fan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never really took coffee.  My so now, man, it's just there's one.  There's a lot.  You know, 15 seconds on Google and I can beat the coffee.  My with the stick.  But the it's just the game of the year.  Any you know, if I just don't play that many video games anymore.  We're all rock band here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You guys play a lot of rock band, Kevin.  I see you all the time on rock band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a fun game.  It's fun and it's social, you know, and it's in a.  I can't play rock band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It gives me because after my my epic fail on the stage,  the Great American Music Hall in front of thousands of people, I just can't.  You know, the memory comes back and and, you know, I kind of start spinning  in the horror of the horror and it's all fingers lock up when you're playing a guitar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I get the I get stage fright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You get the Eeps. I can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so sad. Isn't that sad?  Isn't that sad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John, I know who's playing GTA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait a minute. What am I thinking?  John C.  Dvorak, you're a Grand Theft Auto fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's an outstanding product.  And I'm actually more impressed with the fact that the that it does more business  when it rolls out than a than a Hollywood movie without the same amount of money  that goes into making it, although some getting close, getting close.  But you know, a good big tentpole movie nowadays is up to three  hundred million dollars to produce and they, you know, they bring it  maybe close to a billion, but they don't bring four hundred million in in a weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazing. Although, you know, it's interesting because Mario Smash Brothers,  which was sold one point four million units in the first weekend.  And that was it. Wow.  But that was it. It was it dropped off 90 percent the next weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, typical tentpole movies do all their business  and that you within, you know, a month.  How much ever hear from them again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How much does it cost to make a game like GTA these days?  Are we talking 10, 20 million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I've been asking about this and no one's given me a firm number.  They don't want you to know.  So no, it's because it's like it's it's so networked.  You know, you get some one group doing this, one group doing that,  one group doing rendering over here, and there's all these companies involved.  But some people have claimed I brought this up on a Cranky Geeks recently  and they claim it could be as much as 100 and it could possibly be 200 million.  Wow. Don't see it. I don't see it.  It's possible. But they'll make it back.  100 million, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the thing that's different about the economy of games  versus the business model for movies, business,  movie sequels usually suck.  Game sequels are almost always better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not at the Spider-Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Spider-Man has done all right, but you can't care.  It's not guaranteed.  Whereas a game sequel, you've got the built in audience.  You're going to have better technology unless you really fumble it.  And nobody's done that in years.  The sequel is almost always better. Look at Halo three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to take like, you know, seven years to release the next version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true, too.  Crisis is amazing.  Like crisis. That we're playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You and Brantana were really good at Halo.  You used to kick my butt.  Yeah, way back when.  Yeah. In the day.  Back in the day, as the kids would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Back in the TSS day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you play Halo three when it came out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little bit. Not much, though.  I like the PC experience, actually, for those types of games.  You're not alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like the PC experience, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the old mouse and keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  China says we've got more internet users than you.  Neener, neener, neener.  China says two hundred twenty one million internet users in February.  US. Well, it depends on who you listen to.  Comscore says no, no.  We're US users.  One hundred eighty eight million versus one hundred seventy three for China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, like Comscore is.  They're so accurate.  Got anything right. So accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's put it this way.  I mean, in terms of, you know, percent use in population,  we're talking to China at something like, you know, 16 percent of its population.  In the US, I think if you're talking about 200 million users, you're talking about,  what, 66 percent, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it doesn't matter because we're actually allowed to search for whatever  we want to, and they're not. Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good point. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to mention before we get back to the Twitter conversation,  I'm going to mention real quickly, audible audible dot com.  The good folks at audible dot com want to tell you about a new product from audible.  I think it's pretty cool.  And it's for the parents out there.  It's audible kids dot com.  Yeah, isn't that neat?  It's audible kids. I want you to go to audible kids dot com.  You can take a look at it.  It is a site where it features audio books for kids, not just little kids,  kids of all ages.  And if you go to audible kids dot com slash twit, there are a bunch of free books  you can download. You don't even have to join it.  It's good for even existing members. I mean, they want you to try it out.  This is a kind of a new product for them and they want everybody to know about  it. Audible kids dot com.  We still have the same twit offer we've always had.  If you want to join audible and you're not a member yet.  And there's about three of you who have not yet joined audible dot com slash  twit is the place to go.  And you can sign up and get a coupon for a free book.  But I just I want to tell you about both of them.  There are thirty five hundred kids titles now on audible kids dot com.  Forty five thousand plus titles for all ages on audible dot com.  There's so much great stuff you can listen to.  I just I'm really happy to have them as a as a sponsor.  They've really been a great sponsor for the program.  And we're going to continue with just telling you about them, even though I know  a lot of you have signed up, they have a new a new thing.  They've really expanded the the sci fi and fantasy section.  I'm really pleased to say.  And then they have something called Audible Frontiers, which is  special stuff produced by audible, special sci fi and fantasy produced by audible.  And that's really expanded because a lot of this stuff, I guess, is not recorded.  So there are a lot of fronts, for instance, they just did Snow Crash,  which which was I don't think was ever an audio book.  Neil Stephenson's epic story, one of the great science fiction books of all time.  If you haven't read Snow Crash, you've got to read it.  Eighteen hours.  It's a long listen.  But even the very first chapter, it's probably the best first chapter  ever of any book I've ever read.  The guy's a skateboarder.  His name is hero protagonist, which I love.  We had a great name.  He delivers pizza for Uncle Enzo's Cosa Nostra Pizza, Incorporated.  But he lives in the metaverse.  It was the metaverse was the first kind of use of that idea of a,  you know, alternate reality, a second life, if you will.  Neil's amazing. It's a great book.  That'd be my recommendation for the week from the new Audible Frontier Series  Snow Crash by Neil Stephenson.  Go to audible dot com slash get a credit toward a free book.  I would recommend starting with this if you've not read it, even if you have.  Listening to it makes it really it's very powerful, very powerful.  And audible's doing this themselves, which is, I think, great.  Turning these these classics into unabridged audio books, audible dot com slash.  We thank him so much for their support.  Isn't that a great name? Hero protagonist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's just it's so it's so self mocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did we ever interview him, Neil Stephenson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He does not really talk to people with cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's too bad, because he's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know what? I'm OK with that, because I just want him to get on  to the next set of books. Keep writing.  Yeah, I'm I'm I'm.  Yeah, he's just the whole the the whole Baroque cycle is.  Did you read all three of those?  Yeah, actually, and pretty much within 15 days after each one came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I remember we were you and I were traveling when Quicksilver came out.  Yeah. And you had it.  And it's that thing was heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a big, big old book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they divided it for the paperback versions.  They've got like three paperbacks for each of the hardbacks.  It's just it's it's the most insane, amazing out of  because it takes the predecessors of all the heroes of of Kryptonomicon  and then basically knits in.  I don't even get me started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's it's it's got Isaac Newton.  I mean, it's it's kind of an amazing science history.  Yeah, that's the history of science.  It's really, really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really, science and banking and the development in governments  and the beginning of it's just an incredible, incredible.  It's just, yeah, it's a tour de force, a magnificent.  It's just fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I have it on my Kindle.  Really? Because, well, it's so big and I don't want to carry the big books around.  And I had never finished it.  So I just I put it on the Kindle.  So read it. I know I never finished it.  As soon as it's on audiobooks, I'll just listen to the whole thing.  I mean, it makes it make it so much easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So can the audiobook people give us a comp account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You want a comp account?  Can make a note, Colleen, would you make a note or Dane?  Mr. Dvorak would like free audiobooks.  There you go. Anybody else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick, you know, I'll support.  I'll support the company. Yeah, I pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, sure you do. I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you pay from their check.  Well, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It comes in, it goes out. It's a big deal.  No, it's not that expensive.  No, I've been a member for eight years.  It's just for an eval.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to see how simple the process works.  It's not like you know, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, tell him how he can get a free trial.  Apparently, John has been listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the thing I have about free trials is that they're not the same as an account.  They're a free trial.  And so they analyze free trials is like just like review copies that, you know,  everyone's going to look at a piece of software, not because I want it,  but because I want to look at check it out.  And they say, well, we you can have a view.  There's a free, you know, I want the real deal.  Fires in a month thinking, well, that's not the same code base.  It expires in a month.  Well, because it expires in a month.  That's why. How could it be the same code base if it expires in a month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just get off something that locks down access to the audible doesn't do that.  It's not a guy who's entirely different code base for the cloud.  It's not to say, OK, it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know what you mean, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a different it's the point.  It's psychologically different.  It's not. It's not even psychologically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is actually fundamentally different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, if that's your experience, one more quarterly result,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just got to mention the motor Motorola.  OK, Motorola.  I don't know how you do this.  They report seven point five billion dollars in sales.  They report.  Let's see.  One hundred ninety four million dollar loss.  So I don't.  So they they sell seven and a half billion dollars worth of phones  and they lose one hundred ninety four million dollars.  Would somebody explain how that happens?  Twenty seven million management.  They sold twenty seven million phones and they lost money  and they lost almost two hundred million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that means you're shipping ten bucks with every phone.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Get cash with your phone.  Is it that I don't know?  I mean, it's just a cursor getting out of this business.  And I guess if you can't figure out, isn't it?  If you can't figure out how to make money on seven billion dollars  worth of sales.  Yeah, you probably should get out of that business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's probably going to happen when Motorola gets out of the phone business.  What's going to be left?  Apple and Nokia and Samsung has gotten like 90 percent market share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, Nokia is dominant, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should. But there's Ericsson, Sony, all these guys.  I mean, can't they make a decent phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't remember what their market share is, but it's it's a 90.  But it's pretty hard. It's a stunning.  I mean, I've I've used LG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've actually always had better luck with LG and Samsung.  No, I agree. Ever had with Motorola phones.  I've had Motorola phones fall apart on me a couple of times,  and I just gave up on them.  Let me let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nokia is 40 percent market share.  Yeah, no, that's different than 90.  Extended share of global cell phone market.  Well, 40 percent, though, in a market.  But they I read somewhere that Nokia just rules certain countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like they have like 90 plus percent in Africa.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that won't last once the Chinese get in there.  What do you what do you guys use?  It's a joke, folks. I'm just kidding.  What do you use, Kevin? What's your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're an iPhone guy, aren't you?  I'm an iPhone guy.  Patrick, you're not an iPhone guy.  I actually I am an iPhone guy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and it's the happiest I've ever been.  Wow. Whoa.  I have to sit down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I even like it after two years of using a Windows mobile phone,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which I actually was very happy with because I integrated it with all the  the enterprise stuff at at Ziff Davis.  I'm actually really happy with the iPhone.  I love my

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Blackberry because it's got a real keyboard.  You guys got to get Twinkle.  Do you have Twinkle on my iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's Twinkle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the Twitter client for for the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of Twitter clients, but Twinkle, you think, is the best?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it's pretty cool.  It shows it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has built in the location service.  So when you send out a Twitter, you can be like, oh, I'm at the bar down the street.  You can click near me and see where your friends are based on where they last  Twitter from.  Well, that's funny because that's what Jaiku is all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I guess doing it with Twitter is kind of cool.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Throw in. It's a native client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cool.  Yeah, no, actually, you know, I use it a lot.  I use the map search and the email integrations.  Great. Actually, I originally bought it for the web browsing and I've just been so stoked  with it.  I don't know. It's shocking.  Stoked.  Stoked.  Stoked.  Pat, is yours hacked?  No, although it was originally hacked and bricked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because Randolph hacked mine in like five minutes.  You should just give it to him.  He'll take care of it.  Hey, where did Randolph, where did Dave go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  David Randolph has gone to a company whose name we cannot mention, who does who basically  so for anybody who doesn't know what David Randolph is, he's the original host on System  who just left Revision 3.  He also is the studio engineer that built our studio Revision 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why can't we mention where he's going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's a condition of his employment that he not talk about who the clients are.  Are you saying he actually got a better job?  He got a different job.  How could you get a better job?  He got a job at a place where I think the average employee has been there 11 years.  Wait a minute, let me stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on a second, Patrick.  If he's got a condition of employment that he can't mention it, how do you know?  He didn't mention it.  He didn't mention it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, they told him they didn't want him making the clients he's going to work  with famous.  So, you know, I'm honoring that request.  It's an interesting gig.  He didn't want you to say it on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This will take like five minutes to find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, you want to work for the YMCA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Prager just IMed me and said, do you want Randolph on the show?  I can get Randolph on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want Prager on.  What do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Prager is listening and he's not on?  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said that he fired up Skype, but he's like, I don't know why he's not getting this.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  I don't understand that.  This is our third anniversary episode.  I told him that.  If we don't have Prager on, we don't have the third anniversary episode.  I don't understand that at all.  Prager!  Get in here!  You still do that, don't you?  Prager!  Hello?  He answered.  It worked.  It still works.  Nice.  David, you go running with Kevin Rose.  You and Kevin Rose go out and jog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?  I need to get some more cardio.  And I hadn't been jogging.  And Kevin said he wanted to go.  He wanted to play racquetball.  I said, I'm going to go running.  He's like, I'll go with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Racquetball?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has the 60s and 70s.  When did that game die?  It never died.  I haven't learned squash yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to learn squash.  That looks fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys are so changed from when I knew you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And really all you wanted to do was go out and smoke doobies out back.  Now you're like exercising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Next time we have Kevin Rose on, he's going to be talking about being on the polo team.  Yeah.  Guys, it's time for Bloody Marys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, polo never got big with the whole 80s Wall Street green-o.  Every sport you guys are listing is a very kind of like...  Tennis and volleyball.  Tennis anyone?  Let's play some tennis.  You guys can start popping colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We would like to.  David, I'm so glad we get you on because you're one of the original Twits.  You were on Twit Zero and probably the first 20 or 30 Twits.  I was glad to be back.  It's been a long time.  It has.  This is the third.  And you can turn your Blackberry off.  Oh no, that's Kevin's.  Kevin's iPhone is making noise.  It's Twittering.  That's all right.  iPhone is one of the noisiest...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the FCC should have them all recalled.  I think so right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about that 3G?  Randolph says he's logging onto Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can we get Randolph on?  What's his...  You're going to have to tell me his...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He says he's looking up his password or something like that.  He said it hasn't been on in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I need...  And I'll need his handle to call him.  Yeah, yeah.  Just IM me his handle.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You guys were talking about Twitter earlier and how you think it's going to blow up when  you get a mainstream person.  I think what was interesting is what Scott Beal, his laughing squid, did over at Web2O  last week via Twitter.  He's trying to take pictures in the Yahoo...  I mean, I'm sorry, in the Google photo booth and they wouldn't let him do it.  Oh yeah.  Wasn't that great?  He starts Twittering and says, why won't someone at Google PR call me and tell me why I can't  take pictures?  And then within an hour...  They did.  ...on the phone with Google PR and they're saying, we're sorry, we're sorry, you can  take pictures.  The power of the tweet, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The power of the tweet took an hour?  I got other things to do with my time.  Look at the kid who got out of the jail.  Well, that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, and also Leo, if you want to do parties, if you want to do a party at a place like  Mighty, most of those parties like that, if you get at least, you know, get it on our  friends and family plan, they'll let you do a bar guarantee.  So as long as you bring enough Twitter fans, which there's plenty of them, they'll buy  enough drinks, it'll pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was the deal for the mail.  We were going to do last year, we talked about doing a tech TV reunion on May 11th.  We should really...  It's a little late, but we should really do it this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And another thing that's really big at a lot of the parties that makes financial sense  is that it's usually getting easier to get other companies to be drink sponsors so you  can get in there.  That's how epic, you got epic in there.  It gets a lot easier to get in there and they'll buy drinks for everyone for so much money.  And see, look what it was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We want to thank Red Bull and the insert name of obscure branded vodka.  Balls.  No, actually, who makes...  There's a vodka manufacturer that's on one of the piers just north of us on Third Street,  which I think is really bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, they're probably one of those microbreweries now.  Micro distilleries are very big right now.  Very popular.  Oh, so is Dave on yet?  I'm waiting to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's telling me one second.  Let me see.  He can reveal his new employer.  Too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's get back to the news.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I have one more Twitter question.  This is a good one for Kevin.  Well, what's their business model going to be?  They're making money in Japan because they put ads on in Japan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They make money in Japan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, okay.  They said they never put ads on in the States.  It's hard to go back, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Once you don't do ads, it's hard to start doing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Maybe they have some of these...  How did you handle that with Twitter, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just put them on and I said, what are you talking about?  Now, you know what I thought?  Here's the deal with Twitter.  I did say I'll never have ads on Twitter because I thought what we would do is a donation model.  And the donations are good.  I mean, they certainly pay for...they paid for everything up to now.  Now you can do both.  Well, because they weren't enough to pay anybody.  They were only enough to kind of support the fundamental operation.  If more people went to the twit.tv page and they clicked that $2 a month thing, then all it would take...  I'm not kidding.  If we have a reach of half a million people a month, half a million uniques a month, if 10% of them paid that two bucks, then we wouldn't have ads.  We wouldn't need to have ads.  I'm paying it.  But that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but your ads aren't...they're not really that bad.  They're short and they're, you know, the products that you believe in.  So far, I went to the beer ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually told...  If you get Skype chat, I just say...  Yeah, I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I told...because we're talking now about streaming video and we'll probably have to do video ads to kind of support that.  And I told...is he the Los Angeles David Randolph or the San Rafael David Randolph?  There's a lot of David Randolphs.  Good.  I think he's the Los Angeles one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, give it a shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway, I told one of the companies, if you want to put beer on here, that's fine.  You've had booze ads on Dignation, right?  Yeah, we've had a couple.  Doesn't hurt you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's thematic there.  That's logical.  They have to break in every edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting though is a lot of the alcohol companies are very...  They want to know the average age of your audience.  We have a lot of kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we have a lot of kids.  Actually, I probably wouldn't want to have a beer ad on here.  No, you haven't got a lot of kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a bunch of old geezers that listen to this stuff.  Oh, you'd be surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We looked at the demographic.  We looked at the demographic.  In fact, when we started doing surveys on the demographic, our income bracket, the income  of our listeners, was actually depressed.  It was low because so many kids and students listened.  People with no income listened.  So, even though we do have a nice older demographic, we also have a nice younger demographic.  I think it's mostly because of Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just tell them the next time they do a survey, if you're not making any money, just mark  the $100,000 plus box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Please, would you mind?  Yeah, just say you make money.  Lie to the advertisers.  Certainly, stuff has been weird, especially with Comscore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At one point, they were trying to give us the average age of the users of the website,  and we were trying to do polling based on the average age of the viewers and listeners.  I guess it's a little bit different on average.  So, we want to do liquor sponsors, and you have to average 70% over 21.  They wouldn't let us do it for a while.  Then, all of a sudden, they changed some stuff around, and now we're averaging enough to  be able to get the 70% plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, they asked in the chat room, we have a chat room going right now, and we're streaming  live how old people are.  20, 19, 22, 30, 26, 25, 14, 31, 24, 38, mostly 20, 17 years old, 24, here's a 41-year-old,  here's a 61-year-old.  What's your male versus female ratio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's 99.9% male.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got to be at least 95.  95 is typical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ask the chat room, put in an F, and just say female if you're a female.  Say how many respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That doesn't help unless you know how many people are in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Colleen, you can't type female more than once.  Colleen's hitting F, F, F, F, F. No, no, once, please.  She's cheating.  She's cheating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a couple of women in there.  That's 2,000 in the chat room right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, the chat room's only 500 people.  We've got 2,000 watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, 2 out of 500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That 2 out of 500 sounds about right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When we did our survey, I was stunned.  I was really stunned.  It was literally like 98% male.  I was really kind of depressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just listen to the show, you can figure out why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got into this business for the chicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What percentage did you say, Leo?  Wow, we're like 96 or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dignation is or revision three overall?  Revision three.  Yeah, well, that's what it is.  I mean, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's funny is whenever they do the Dignations and Kevin and Alex  and they complain about no female fans, they all of a sudden come out of the woodwork.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's because their boyfriends are pulling them to the shows.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  Kicking and screaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, have you actually autographed a woman's bosom?  So, I wouldn't complain if I were you.  That happened one time, Leo.  I can autograph some guy's chest.  You want me to autograph their chest, their man boobs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As long as you don't have to autograph Ticonderoga, New York.  What's that?  There's somebody out there that will get that joke.  Niagara Falls.  It's a punchline to an old joke.  Never mind.  The Aristocats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apple might be adding tactile feedback to the phone.  It couldn't hurt.  Apparently, according to an anonymous Apple employee, this is from the CNET News blog,  company executives are in talk with Immersion.  They're the folks who do the haptic feedback, which is really cool.  We showed that on the screensavers many years ago.  I think it's on Alpine stereos, the car stereos.  As you move your finger on the touchscreen, you can feel the bumps.  You can feel where a new region begins.  It would be really a valuable thing on the iPhone to have haptic feedback.  I'd love to see that.  Okay, you guys, I can tell are all excited.  That was a thud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think we'd all love to see that.  We'd all love to see a 3G iPhone, too, but we've got to wait a few months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Any day now.  Okay, what do you know? Any day now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  April 8th, something like that.  April 8th? I think it's too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  April 8th? What, 2010?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's an old rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, let me see if we can get...  When did they say it was?  What's the next Worldwide Developers Conference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it's in June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  June 8th. No, June 6th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  WWDC, you think?  Yeah, WWDC.  So Dave McFarland has signed off.  He didn't want to talk about his new thing, I guess.  I would have grilled him.  Oh, but it wasn't Dave McFarland, was it?  It was Dave Randolph.  Dave Randolph.  He said he had a blue screen of death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's a big Windows guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's he running? Windows ME?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, I don't know. Actually, he's pretty good.  I mean, what's funny is he gets a lot of Apple hardware,  and he just native boots Windows on all of it.  So he's got the MacBook Air, and it's just running great with Vista on it right now.  That's too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right. Air, I think it's Parallels have a special Air version for...  I mean, oh, it's VMware did a special version to get Vista on the Air,  because I guess with two gigs of RAM, it's kind of hard.  Not an easy thing to do.  All right, let me see if there's any other news.  I don't want to stop now that we've got Prager on here.  Let's see.  I ran out. We did every story.  We ran out of stories. It wasn't very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was a bad week for news.  There wasn't a lot of good news or interesting news.  Microsoft, the Yahoo thing dominated a lot of it.  I'll tell you what. I'll talk about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know. Did you guys go to Web 2.0?  Did you see Clay Shirkey talk?  I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Clay gave a great speech.  Is it online somewhere?  It's on the line, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can go to the Internet, and I think it's on Vimeo or BlipTV.  Look for the title of it is GIN Television and Social Surplus.  All synopsized for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I don't know why they even have these conferences when I could just listen to these things on the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My new plan is to actually never leave the studio because we're setting up a studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's your old plan too, Leo.  It's called GIN Surplus what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  GIN Television and Social Surplus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're building a studio. You're going to do video?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll fill you in, David, because you'd appreciate this, building your own studio.  We rented the downstairs.  I started in that little office.  Patrick's been here.  Kevin, I think, was here too.  I think we jammed you all in at one point.  This little tiny office.  Then I got the office across the way.  Now I'm renting the whole downstairs, which is this beautiful Victorian wood paneled.  It looks like a barrister's office.  It's got cut glass cabinets.  Just gorgeous.  I bought this massive desk.  I have those three XL2s that we got for the aborted attempt to do Twitter Live, the video.  The video versions of Twitter.  I still have those cameras.  You've used them a few times, I think, David.  I'm getting a TriCaster.  I'm going to get the TriCaster studio.  The guy from LightPanels, actually I'm excited about this.  His name is Pat Grosswad.  LightPanels are these new LED lights.  We don't have the power, and I don't want the heat, of regular studio lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks like Randolph is back on.  He might even enjoy talking to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He would know about it.  He's interested in this stuff.  I'll call him right now.  Pat is coming down.  I'm very excited about this.  Pat is coming down.  I don't see him.  He has to say okay to me.  He hasn't said okay to me yet.  Pat's coming down day after tomorrow, or up, I guess.  He's a real gaffer.  Last movie he did was Gosford Park, so he knows how to light this crap.  He's going to come in.  He's going to set us up with the light panels.  It's going to be nicely lit.  It's not a huge space, but it's a beautiful space.  I hope you guys will come up.  We'll have parties up here.  I'm going to start streaming 25 hours a week.  I thought I'd launch big.  How many hours a week does Revision 3 do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A week.  Or a month.  Probably maybe 15.  I'm going to do 25.  Not even that.  That's like we've got 13 weekly-ish.  Some of them aren't quite weekly.  I'm going to turn on the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm just going to sit here eight hours at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to give us a code word, Leo, that you could Twitter when the people from the  Nuthouse come by and grab you.  You need to send a message out to some of us that are following you so we can at least  make sure we know where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like that guy in prison.  What did he do?  Where was he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He got picked up?  You said arrested.  You need a code word that if you send it out, we'll know that you've flipped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, if I say Funny Farm on Twitter, please call the...  Who should you call?  Who are you going to call?  Come bail me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  David Randolph, how are you, sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Doing good.  How are you doing?  We have never met, David, but it's good to talk to you.  Of course, I'm a fan of yours and your work on System, and now you're leaving.  Yeah, now I'm taking off.  To a place where people, the average employee stays 11 years.  We've decided that you're taking work with the CIA or the NSA.  Or General Electric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or General Electric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, they do have some government people they work with, but I think they're going to be  working with, but nothing on that level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Lockheed Martin.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Raytheon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You almost hit it, Leo, you can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's going to work for a military industrial complex.  So when was your...  Have you had your last day, David?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Friday was my last day, actually.  Oh, that's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everybody's very sad about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And Monday will be the new day, actually, so it's very quick turnaround.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Ken, look, this doesn't come out until Monday.  You could tell us now.  Oh, wait a minute, it is streaming live.  Right.  So it does come out.  I mean, I guess a few thousand people would know, but they wouldn't tell anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He wants to get you on the show anyways to ask you about what gear to have for his big studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's too late. I already bought all the gear.  I asked Patrick, I called Patrick this week and I said, Patrick, you hated the TriCaster, right?  I shouldn't buy it.  I don't know.  I've had a lot of experience with those TriCasters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Really? Should I get something else?  There's another company out there that no one ever talks about called Broadcast Picks.  Don't know that.  The IX.  Don't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Write that down.  I got their rig.  Just also, have you looked at the Sony rig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really expensive though.  It's like 30 grand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like 30 grand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a great system, but you have to buy all this extra stuff just to make it work.  What about GlobeCaster?  GlobeCaster's another one people like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's 20,000.  It's more expensive than the TriCaster.  It's 20,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's right in there.  It's problem is it's missing a lot of the features that let you use fewer people.  GlobeCaster kind of requires that you still buy additional computers, have them sitting  next to it.  No, I don't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See, the new TriCaster studio has FME, Flash Media Encoder, built into it.  So I can send out a flash stream.  I can record to a hard drive in an MPEG-2 format.  So I've got my recorded version that I can send out as a podcast.  I've got my stream going out to stick them in the stream.  Well, that was the problem with the old TriCaster, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't it only do Windows Media initially?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And a fake Windows Media.  Yeah, that was horrible.  So that's different, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's considerably different.  The original TriCaster only had component and composite input, three devices, and only  did a Windows Media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'm using Excel too, so I don't need the SDI input.  I'm going to be going.  It's going to be a yes video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, perfect.  So you'd be good with a pro or even a broadcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to get the studio because it has the FME.  I need the Flash Media Encoder on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it do green screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't want to do virtual set.  I have a real set.  And by the way, we're going to steampunk the hell out of this thing.  It's going to be so awesome.  Colleen is like a steam.  She's already welding crap.  And we're going to take the monitors and we're going to put big gilt frames around them.  It's going to look kind of odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was the code word again?  I forgot it already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I forgot too.  Funny Farm.  Funny Farm.  But that's not it.  That was not it.  I'm not crazy yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, we got to write it down though.  OK, got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dave, they're saying you should be now that you've left Revision 3, would you like to  be on Twitter more often?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll stop by.  I'm always watching anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Even if you're working for Raytheon, it's OK.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Halliburton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it Halliburton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Raytheon.  Who else is around here?  Could be Bechtel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bechtel.  That wouldn't be a bad job.  That's just down the street.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you know, the only reason they want me to be secretive about it is because we're  dealing with all these high end studios and competitors and they don't want to know that  this competitor works with this company and buys this product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you're going to stay in the broadcast field.  Staying in the broadcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going more over into the effects, special effects type of side of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we should talk.  We should talk.  Maybe you could make me a special effect.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Of course, I have no creativity, but I can make sure it's technically perfect.  I have a special purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think so.  You're saying I shouldn't buy the Tricaster.  Is that kind of nutty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think the Tricaster is a great solution for people that want to be in conference rooms  and businesses and stuff like that.  And then when you kind of bump up a notch and you want to have higher quality production  value, you have to kind of go into a higher category.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I know we're going to junk it as soon as we go HD, but remember this is streaming  for the web.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're just streaming for the web, but you know, heck the broadcast picks.  You can upgrade that to HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm writing it down.  Would you write down broadcast picks?  You got it?  Okay.  So maybe we should spend the extra $30,000.  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where is the, who makes broadcast picks?  Where are they located?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They are broadcast picks.  Oh gosh.  I don't even know where they are located.  They are American though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's important to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But they're PIX, broadcastpix.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're in Burlington.  Vermont?  From Massachusetts.  Burlington, Massachusetts?  Yeah.  So is it just a hardware switcher or is it like more like a Tricaster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's like a Tricaster.  It actually has a full windows box over there on the side.  But unlike the Tricaster, the CG, the switcher is all separated out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, see, that's the reason I wanted the Tricaster instead of a hardware switcher.  Folks forgive this for a moment, but I don't get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is pretty, but yeah, it's pretty esoteric.  It's very esoteric.  You know, actually we're already so far onto the show.  We might want to just end the show and then we can all chat offline and still go over  the stick cam and the rest of it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll just take that one.  I ended the show a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  I didn't hear you say another twits in the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll just take that and I'll put it back a few hours and it'll be done.  A few hours.  It'll be done.  And then we still have, you know, like thousands of people watching the stream.  I think Kevin's already passed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so hot in my apartment right now.  Are you naked?  I have no air conditioning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you take off your clothes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm naked right now.  That's how I always do my twits though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, we just got another thousand people.  See, I wish I had asked you guys to stream it.  Nobody wanted to do it.  It's too complicated because you had to, but you know, down the road.  So we're going to look at broadcast picks that day.  Thank you very much.  I think that's a good input.  Now all the guys at NewTek are going, oh, God damn, I hope you're not going to work for NewTek  because they're not going to be happy with you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Back in the day, I used to do freelance work for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I got an email from the SVP saying, we're so happy to have you and part of the,  you know, the NewTek family.  And of course they didn't give me a discount, so I guess I could go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We use that TriCaster at the Granky Geek show and it does well for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a great solid box.  It's a good simple box.  It's when you really want to start adding a lot of value.  At some point I do want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I mean, for instance, now you can get these new Sony CineAlta, the, what is it,  the EX is six grand for 1080p HD.  Not that anybody's going to watch 1080p HD on the internet, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't afford to distribute 1080p HD on the internet without doing a peer-to-peer distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, breaking the bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, Dave, what's it cost to get a broadcast PICS unit put together and up and running?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It depends on all the bells and whistles you put on it, but it starts at about 12,000 and then goes up from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's about that's what we're paying for the.  You know, I want to be like that guy on SCTV, Jerry Todd.  You know, Jerry Todd, we're playing another video at you.  Wait a minute. The chroma is just a little bit off.  So I'm going to have a switcher on the desk in front of me with a little joystick that goes.  Oh, brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you got to use that voice then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I will. I'll be talking like this.  Welcome back to TweetLive.  Let's try. Wait a minute. That little chroma is a little bit off there.  OK, we're going to dissolve it in another video.  He called it Vodio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always thought it was funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't it funny? Well, that's basically what I'm turning into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep, you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but that mixed with remember Gene Scott, the guy who the preacher who used to be on UHF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's still on even though he's dead.  Yeah, he's going to say he's still on.  They still run us up.  Yeah, he's still here and there.  He's actually in his later years.  He, you know, near the end there, he was getting even weirder.  Funny Farm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He would sit in this big armchair and he'd wear a cowboy hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For people who haven't seen it, you guys might want to explain the obscure Southern California originating reference you're making.  He's a preacher. He was a television preacher, but he was not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He often wear two pairs of glasses at the same time.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a little loopy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's basically me. I'm setting this up for my retirement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I figure I can go another 20, 30 years with this TriCaster, a couple of cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was doing like 25 hours a week or 25 hours a day.  He was at sometimes he was on all day and night.  Mark my words.  Yelling at the audience for not sending him enough money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly. He'd say, I'm not going to talk for another half hour unless I get, I'm not going to talk until we get $5,000.  And he just stopped talking.  See, I think that's a good business model.  It worked for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Works.  Well, the trick is you got to have people convinced that they're going to go to hell if he doesn't stop talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can do that. I'm pretty good at that. I'm pretty persuasive.  I think Leo could go that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we should turn him into a preacher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter will go down unless you give me $5,000.  The Twitter will disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He came to me. He said, Leo, there will be no more Twitter unless you come forward with $5,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're about to overtake Obama. I noticed that Leo. You're getting up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're about to overtake me. I'm looking at the curves, Kevin.  No. I'm not yet 20,000.  Yeah, but your growth rate, I'm talking about growth rate.  I'm at 25,000.  I am catching up with Obama. About 300 a day closer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, are you guys only into the number of followers? That's sick.  And you know what I have to say?  I only want quality followers and that's what I've got. The people that follow me are like the geniuses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have no control over who follows you.  Are we back on Twitter again?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry about that. I'm not going to mention it again ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are several complaints. I'm getting twittered about too much Twitter.  Even the Twitter people don't want us to talk about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. One last thing. Twitter.com slash KevinRose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, this is good. We're going to have a race.  Twitter.com slash KevinRose. Twitter.com slash TheRealDevorak.  Patrick's on there. He posted one post.  Forget about it. He doesn't even care.  Have you got another one now? The only post I've seen is, now what do I do, Veronica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that was a while ago.  That wasn't about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to say, we have tried to get Patrick online in some form, any form, for at least eight years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, go to Twitter.com slash PatrickNorton. Just go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you posted?  Probably cussed you out right there is what he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Prager, you're on there too. D.Prager, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  D.L.Prager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  David, are you on there as well?  Oh, look it. Patrick, you've been posting like a crazy man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm having fun with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Holy camole. I wasn't following you, I guess. That's terrible.  It's not about the people. It's about the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, you're not my friend in pounds.  Oh, no, no. I friended you. Didn't I friend you?  You may have finally done it after you complained.  Hey, hey, hey. You guys are off topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it's about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if you go to Twitterholic.com, you can get see a graph.  You can watch this horse race now for the most followers.  But see, here's what I'm a little worried about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now that you've mentioned that it's a horse race,  I really don't want anybody else joining, following me at the real Dvorak.  Yeah, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  For psychology.  Don't follow me at slash the real Dvorak.  He's clever.  Please do not follow me there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I get no spam.  He's clever, this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The trend lines, I think, favor Kevin.  I'm not sure, but just looking at the graph, I think your growth rate,  I know it is because you've gone up like 19,000 in two weeks or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think about 10,000 in two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But 10,000 in two weeks. I think the trend is your friend.  But how much of this is spam is my question.  Are these real people?  Who are these people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they can't spam you, really.  I mean, they can out-reply you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But there apparently are some spammers on there adding people.  I don't understand how it works.  Scoble is a spammer.  Well, that's no, but I mean like—

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Scoble has over 21,000 friends that he's added.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, he does the weird thing.  And Obama does this too, where you add everybody.  You follow all your followers.  We're doing that too on the Twitter live, twitter.com slash twitlive.  That's the feed.  If you want to follow the production studio and on twitlive,  we will put up where our next broadcasts are or when.  And we'll also put—we'll take questions from there for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll post it on the website.  I demand that we stop talking about Twitter.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That means we have—oh, I started talking about Clay Shirky,  but you know, I guess we'll just save that for the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I found his website. He's got a little thing.  I'll summarize at the end of his speech.  He says the following.  He's got a little thing written up and makes no sense to me.  But he says, we must ask ourselves if we carve out a little bit of the cognitive surplus  and deploy it here, could it make a good thing happen?  And I'm betting the answer is yes.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're spoiling the whole—because he builds up to that.  What's that all about?  He builds up to it. It starts with—  Cognitive surplus.  Well, he explains what he means.  He goes back to a British—

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't care. I don't want to know. I gave you the ending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just listen to the beginning though, and then you could fill in the middle.  He reminds—he talks about a book that he read in college about a British historian.  I don't know who it was, who says that gin was the critical technology for the earlier—for the Industrial Revolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From my way of thinking, gin is not a technology.  Here's the deal.  It's a drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He says that the transformation from rural to urban life was so sudden, so wrenching,  that the only thing society could do was to drink itself into a stupor for an entire generation,  which is why you would find push carts selling gin in the streets in London.  Everybody was drunk for 25 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were drunk anyway. They're still drunk. How does he explain that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, he says they sobered up a little bit, and then they started using the industrial tools to create leisure.  And then that leisure led to things like libraries, museums, education.  They started absorbing the—reaping the benefits of the Industrial Revolution.  He says the information revolution—get this—the information revolution has pushed us  to a new form of stupor, sitcoms.  He says that we've been dealing with the media revolution over the last couple of generations by watching Gilligan's Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's like, maybe I should give him the code word, Funny Farm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's—read the—I think it's a good speech. I think it's very insightful.  I'm looking at it. It's interesting. It's entertaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem is the origin of the libraries and the schooling and all of that was—at least in the United States.  I'm not familiar with England. All of that was done as noblesse obligés of the robber barons  and basically, basically, borrower barons' wives trying to improve the position of the poor people in society.  Yeah, we've got a Carnegie Library right next door.  Yes. I mean, the Carnegie Library, so many schooling efforts to push for public schooling.  I mean, I just don't buy into that, that all of a sudden people evolved out of the need to drink themselves into a stupor.  Of course, I'm also the resident alcoholic and 19 years sober.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, maybe that explains the popularity of the dig party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come to the dig party to avoid that terrible feeling, that chronic condition known as life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm looking at the pictures from the dig party and it looked like it was a lot of fun.  It was just noisy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you go?  I stopped by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I feel bad. I haven't been to one dig party.  I went to it for one reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got a live Dignation on Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wednesday? What time Wednesday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Same place, Mighty.  At Mighty, what time?  It's seven o'clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We actually know that we're doing two. We're doing Marty's show, Internet Superstar at seven and then Dignation at eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I can't. There's a restraining order. I can't go where Marty is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I said. I still don't have that figured out quite why.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Explain it to you off-line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who's Marty?  Martin Sargent. It was an incident at the ramp. I'm deeply sorry for it.  But he won't forgive me.  Did you punch him?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the big deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It involved my special purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you mean I didn't know you...  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right. We're going to wrap this up because frankly, we literally there are no more stories in the bucket.  I've gone...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I got one question for you.  Yeah.  I'm Darrell Issa, our local representative working with the FBI to do the whole non-warrantless surveillance on the Internet.  Anybody other than me find that really creepy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They want to start widespread monitoring of, quote, illegal Internet activity.  Robert Mueller is just a nut bag. This is the FBI director. He's wanted to do this for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Issa's not much better. Issa suggested... I like what Deglen McCullough wrote.  He quoted Issa suggesting that, quote, Internet providers could get consent from every single person who signed up to operate under their auspices for federal police to monitor network traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So in other words, for me to go online, I'd have to sign a pledge allowing the federal... even the phrase federal police is scary.  Doesn't that... that sounds like the Gestapo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This isn't happening. The whole thing is exaggerated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
