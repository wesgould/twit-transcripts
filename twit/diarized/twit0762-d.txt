Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, stay well stay healthy. We're glad to know and you've been using you Robert built this streaming studio in the Vatican  You I guess your initial intent was to podcast from there, but apparently your timing was good

Start time: 391.06
End time: 418.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The timing was good because we are now getting a lot of news agencies who would like to speak to people and unfortunately because of  The lockdown it's difficult for people to get from you know here to even them the media studios across the street  So this has been sort of the primary broadcast area  We've done what 14 different broadcasts from this room in the last three days  So, yeah, it came up just at the right time just like you I get the pains of building something and then realizing it's not

Start time: 418.74
End time: 472.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gonna do what I thought it was gonna do the timing is couldn't be better. Actually, we're doing something on Thursday. They're Chabad, which is  Orthodox Jewish  synagogue in the  Petaluma area had invited a Holocaust survivor 93 year old  Holocaust survivor step-sister van Frank to speak on Thursday, but of course all  You know of these meetings are shut down and they called us and said could she stream it from your studio?  And we said absolutely so Thursday  She and her interviewer coming in the rabbis coming in and they're gonna do a private event  I'd invite you but it's gonna do an event for the ticket holders because there's a lot of people who wanted to see this  And it would be a shame if they didn't get a chance to so I think everybody who has streaming skills at this point is  Is is a kind of a hot commodity? Are you helping the Pope to streaming masses, right?  He's doing masses online

Start time: 473.36
End time: 499.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Correct. Yes, so we've sort of pooled resources in the Vatican for all of these different events  Because people are starting to realize that when you're doing a webinar or when you're doing an actual professional video conference  Not just something on your phone or your tablet  It takes a certain setup and it takes a certain set of skills  We're we're actually winnowing down the number of people who should  Get in front of the camera and you know this a lot of people think oh you just turn on the camera and you go

Start time: 499.54
End time: 508.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 510.24
End time: 524.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I've been teaching I've been giving people tips on how to work without that feedback  You know if you're a professor and you're used to getting up in front of a class of 120 students  And now you have to do it in front of a camera and the only feedback you get is a chat room weirdly sign

Start time: 524.56
End time: 550.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Yeah, I know I don't I don't know why I know that like Kelly and Ryan  They're not doing it with an audience and it's a weird thing to be in a theater and not have anybody there  Marques if people come to you, they know you have a streaming studio there. Are they asking your help?

Start time: 551.54
End time: 576.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not really. It's it's a little less  Intense here at the moment I guess for better or worse your New York  I'm right across the river. So I'm in New Jersey where there are some weird things some some  Hided heightened states of awareness, I guess because there are nearby towns that have a bunch of cases  But other than that, it's been a sort of business as usual  I mean everyone's got the hand sanitizer and everything that you see

End time: 705.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. Well, I mean you can see there's a lot of cues here from the twitch studios  So everything from the avatars to the the lighting set up to our switching board  It's it's what I took from you show us a little more. Do you have cameras set up anywhere else? Oh, yeah  So, I mean, you know, of course I'm running everything off this laptop right now, but we do actually have a streaming  Setup over there and I'm using the black magic switchers on this particular studio  I'm just using this mini but they all use the same console so I can set up lower thirds. I can set up transitions  I've got an ingest machine. I've got you know, high-definition recorders and then I've got cameras all around the studio  I've only got these two piped in at the moment because I've been doing some work  But I'll have a camera outside  I have a camera looking down at the street and then I'll have a matrix switcher  So at any point I can tie into any of the screens and cameras are really you know, again  Yeah, it's set up just like what my low-priced version of it would be well that a 10 mini is fantastic  It's it's an incredible device. Yeah, seriously  Anyone who has not who has not bought hardware yet  If you're looking to start a podcasting studio this a to mini is there's nothing like it because it connects  Directly into your computer so it becomes your digitizing interface then you get four inputs for HDMI inputs

Start time: 705.86
End time: 721.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you get also left right audio. They have din plugs and they have USB  It's pretty impressed. I bought one. I don't have any I don't know what I'm gonna do with it, but I'm ready for I'm ready to  Honestly, I'm ready to broadcast from home  We've already thought about well we could set that up and I could do the whole thing at home if I had to

Start time: 722.10
End time: 741.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean Leo it's perfect for when you're on the go because you're always carrying your camera  My interface yeah, you've got one output from your computer  So you've got something that you can switch to and you can carry a really small  HDMI camera that can be sort of your over-the-shoulder shot and you can carry that everywhere in under four pounds nice

Start time: 741.94
End time: 769.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Robert, thank you. Stay well. Stay healthy sanitize  And and we'll I hope see you real soon  Have a great episode Padre SJ on Twitter and he is tweeting actively. So that's what that's how we knew you were okay  Take care father Robert  Again the in the crisis center. I feel like when we talk about this stuff Marquez is probably just going yeah, right you guys  You're shooting with black magic. What is it? Are they 8k or reds? What are you using? Oh

Start time: 770.56
End time: 773.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Our video stuff is mostly red red 8k

Start time: 774.24
End time: 778.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Monstrous sensors. Well, how do you amazing? How do you edit and what's your workflow with 8k?

Start time: 780.26
End time: 800.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's got we got it kind of down to a science. We have the new Mac pros  Wait a minute you say oh that in plural  I have a couple well, so behind me  You can see there's a couple iMac pros, which the guys who work with me have set up  But when we move to the new studio, we will set up the Mac pros that they will also be upgrading to

Start time: 802.70
End time: 804.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many Mac pros you're gonna have

Start time: 805.90
End time: 806.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For

Start time: 807.74
End time: 807.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay

Start time: 810.72
End time: 816.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's I hope I hope our editors are not listening guys you're not getting back pros don't even

Start time: 817.20
End time: 824.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think about it. Holy cow, but we wouldn't need Mac pros if we didn't shoot this crazy  format stuff

Start time: 825.68
End time: 831.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's working with a K video and a Mac pro about comparable to you know, normal, you know two or four K video

Start time: 833.30
End time: 855.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's still pretty heavy  I've shot whenever we shoot 4k anything any machine I want to use just cuts right through it. No problem  It's just because it's red code raw that specific codec. It's not it's not just h264 just 8k video  It's more than just the resolution  So when we get into that codec stuff and all that raw information then it starts to really tax it

Start time: 855.76
End time: 856.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So give me but why?

Start time: 858.40
End time: 901.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh  It's a it's definitely overkill  But it is a lot more about the fun of what we're able to make with that information than just like having more  If all I did was like point the camera at myself and talk to it. I wouldn't need you know  Much more than just like a typical  DSLR but because we do so much with motion graphics that requires a lot more data points for tracking because we do a lot more  Color correction and you get a lot into tweaking the red code and not just the color temperature  But like when you throw let's on there all the sort of stuff sorts of it adds up over time  So the more cinema focused of a camera you have the easier it becomes but also the more taxing it becomes on the computer

Start time: 901.46
End time: 909.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a little bit of a trade-off a lot more work and a lot more skill involved  What are you doing motion tracking because you have virtual sets? What are you doing the motion tracking for?

Start time: 910.98
End time: 930.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just for smaller graphics and stuff. Sometimes I'll just point out  Hey this camera on the back of this phone has you know this aperture and has OAS and I'll just have a little  Little animation pop out to show you which ones which little stuff like that  You could do that with a lesser quality camera  But it the better quality the information going in the better quality the tracking the better quality the final product

Start time: 930.70
End time: 949.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So and you do it cuz you know you can I mean, do you think it helps you your you I mean, this is all for YouTube  You know, you're not showing in major theaters around the country or anything this is no this is all for YouTube  But you think that it's it there's a benefit to it that one of the reasons you have ten and a half million subscribers  Is because of the quality?

Start time: 950.98
End time: 1000.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's not so you can you can use the word quality, but I think it's more about it's I think I'd call it  a depth like it's harder to replicate and it's harder to  Tie it in with all the rest  So there's a million people making tech videos now back when I started when I just had one camera and one laptop and a desk  There were seven of us and we all could do totally different things with our camera to talk about this new tech  But now a new Samsung phone comes out and there's what 70 videos right at once right?  So which one are you gonna watch you're gonna watch?  Hopefully the best three before you've pretty much learned everything so we try to do the best we can and  A lot of that comes to from pushing it to the limits and having those cool motion graphic effects and trying to be as precise  As possible with our edits, so I think that's what it's turned into do you find it also drives your content?

Start time: 1001.08
End time: 1010.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll give it as an example. You just did a piece which got a lot of attention on the Escobar phone  right  Normally you wouldn't cover the Escobar phone or would you?

Start time: 1012.78
End time: 1032.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That one was a weird one I feel like  The way it happened no, I would not have normally covered it  but then  it just sort of  Actually, the way I decided to make a video about it was just like, you know what screw it people got to know  So I ended up making that video but yeah, there's there's some ideas that just sort of come out of the blue

Start time: 1033.34
End time: 1045.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's just folks to put this in perspective. He put that video out five days ago. It has four and a half million views  So and and and it is the case that the number of views directly impacts your revenue, right?

Start time: 1047.76
End time: 1051.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  More or less. Yeah, it's the number of views on on monetized

Start time: 1052.98
End time: 1069.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  clicks, but everything you do is monetize  You know what they've recently demonetized anything that talks about kofi 19, which has put us in a hope  Fortunately, we don't make the bulk of our funds don't come from YouTube  But I thought you see that's kind of a problem if you're a youtuber you can't mention it

Start time: 1070.46
End time: 1085.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's some creators that whose main source of income is the YouTube ad revenue  So those creators are sort of steered by what they're allowed to talk about and what won't get demonetized luckily  We're not sort of steered that way, but I have seen those stories. Yeah, that's bad news

Start time: 1086.44
End time: 1095.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So by your bottom line don't buy the Escobar folding phone. Yeah, don't don't even yeah  Don't try the thumbnail says it all he's scraped the back of the

Start time: 1097.34
End time: 1106.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  Here's my Escobar phone if you must see it in person, but I would say if you bought one don't expect to get anything

Start time: 1108.56
End time: 1152.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go  Amy actually wanted to ask you we'll get to the news in a second  But it's so great to have both of you on I love both of you and I love talking to both of you  and I have so many questions I've been thinking about you a lot Amy because  In a way what and I know this is not where I should warn people at a time  We're not gonna do a lot of stories about the virus  This isn't a virus show you get plenty of that everywhere else and God knows it's important to pay attention to it  But I feel like we can talk about other things here because we're just you know  We're the toy store, but I have been thinking about you Amy because this is it. This is an inflection point  This is a a paradigm shift not completely unexpected  But it's the kind of left turn that must make it hard to predict the future  Yeah, well

Start time: 1153.44
End time: 1156.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I can talk about that. But can I go back to that ridiculous phone for a moment?

Start time: 1157.10
End time: 1160.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course see everybody wants to know about the freaking Escobar phones

Start time: 1162.80
End time: 1346.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because so we built this model so so a  Futurist especially one who works in quantitative with quantitative data like I do quantitative and qualitative  But but I'm a data driven futurist and we don't make predictions the math doesn't work out. There's there's too many variables  So our job is not to predict  But rather to reduce uncertainty so that we're prepared  And so a lot of what we do is trying to figure out if X happens then what and we gather signal from lots signal data  From all different places and sort of start triangulating and figuring things out  anyhow, I bring this up because several years ago, I  kept building models that pointed to  what I saw as the beginning of the end of smartphones and  I remember telling a bunch of like industry folks and tech journalists maybe four years ago  And that was still when a lot of the smartphones new penetration rate was still climbing and people were still excited  They were still chasing cameras and I kept saying, you know sometime around late 2019  If not earlier, we're gonna start to see a decline and  Here we are  the most exciting phone  Is this Escobar ridiculous thing  And and then there's the one that came out in China, which is the trifold  I forget it's like a THC or T is it show me or X ZTE maybe the TCL  Yeah, yeah, so  You know what's happening is?  There's just not a lot more compute  There's not a lot more features and compute can pack into that single device  So, you know if like if you ever go back in time like getting a time machine and go back to the year like 1999  You know, I know that I was at that point living in Japan and I had a Docomo  And I'm it was called an I mode  Which was connected to the internet took photos was a smartphone for that point in a world in which the Nokia  Analog phones are pretty popular. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so but but I was carrying that, you know  I had a Toshiba satellite Pro that was 15 pounds and doubled as a self-defense weapon, you know, I had a  mini disc player I had a  digital camera that still used to floppy so we're carrying around all this stuff and  You know if you were to go back at that point and say guess what in about two decades  We're gonna have this convergence. We're gonna have all that compute all that functionality everything else in a single Star Trek device  Most people would have been like there's no way  Now when you know as I'm saying listen, we've we've seen peak  We're heading down in the other direction on the other side of this is another divergence where we have connected glasses and rings  You know all these other things where more of the compute is starting to be done at the edge  Some of its at the cloud, but that phone is gonna start retreating back  I get a lot of pushback on that but you know, we're starting to see we're starting to see some of that  Anyhow, and I think that's why we this is why I think we have folding phones

Start time: 1346.32
End time: 1352.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're not doing predictions, but I remember when you consulted the first was it first man the

Start time: 1354.32
End time: 1359.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, so that's a little different so the first me the show yeah, they do a lot of different Hollywood shows

Start time: 1359.84
End time: 1376.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and so this is a show that's the near future  They're going to Mars and they and they had the glasses you described in fact, they would they would share  Content let me show you something and they throw it over to the other person's glasses. So that's that's different  That is a prediction in a sense

Start time: 1377.38
End time: 1463.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, actually that one's not either  because  Because one of the models that we built shows that and I again like I know  everybody loves to loves to say no on this one, but  We're looking at connected glasses as the thing that comes next. There's a bunch of reasons for that and I wouldn't look at Google glass to  Which was really never intended as a as a consumer device at scale  I wouldn't look at that as precedent for what comes next. But there's a couple of factors one  There's a bunch of new eye tracking technology. I had the HoloLens to on a couple weeks ago a couple months ago, actually  And there's some significant developments in machine reading comprehension and sort of being able to track your eyes as they move so that there's  this automated scrolling  System that they built which is pretty amazing  So stuff happening there. There's an accelerating factor because most people in America now need glasses  We're all nearsighted and it's in part because we're looking near and far constantly people may not be willing to  Admit it, but most people need glasses now. So we've got all these accelerating factors that point to a future in which  glasses start to take more precedence over phones and I think it's telling that Amazon's glasses  Don't actually have interactive lenses. So  What are they called echo or I forget Amazon's?  Echo or I forget Amazon's

Transcript:  right, so those glasses are meant to allow you to talk to  Alexa using an earpiece if you remember when glass came out, you know  that everybody was talking calling the people who were them glass holes and  Yeah, everybody's pretty upset about the idea of constantly being potentially videoed or photographed  Amazon has very much gone the opposite direction by saying these are actually glasses to help you hear not see  And I think that's that's interesting because I think it will start to help pave the way for a very near future in which  We're more comfortable with potentially being continuously surveilled by everybody else

End time: 1546.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so there's a lot in there  I I made a video less than a month ago called are we at peak smartphone and it sort of goes through that idea where  Like you mentioned like we had three or four or five separate  devices to take pictures and to listen to the radio and to have all these different things and then they all converged and  Suddenly you have one device that can do all these things and then they improve year over year over year and

Start time: 1547.50

Start time: 1550.18
End time: 1612.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's minor and slower and slower  So you at first the difference between the first camera and a smartphone and the second and third camera in a smartphone was big  And now you know, you're going from the iPhone 10 to the 11 and that difference is very very small  It's still impressive that it's getting better at all. But now like you mentioned it's incremental  For maybe it's because I'm younger or just not very future looking  I because I hear your perspective on on the data, but I've always seen smartphones as like as  as I guess a an end product like I  I guess I don't really see a world where they start to recede yet  They just continue to get better and more prevalent and more available and more commoditized  Prices are going both up and down at the same time  So they're sort of stratifying a bit so people can get in at a lower entry point  But now there's more leverage in between to get to the better smartphones and the tech of the bleeding edge gets better  You know the whole thing keeps evolving year over year and I keep seeing that and the more I see that  The less I think about smartphones going away

Start time: 1626.93
End time: 1671.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  so again, this is where it's good to  Confront cherished beliefs  So the saturation rate has you know reached a particular point people are still spending money  But they're spending money on different parts of the ecosystem. So  You know the whole entire thing is starting to shift and change  And and quite frankly when Apple announced whenever it was that they're gonna stop releasing their quarterly sales, you know company doesn't so again  Like I'm I work with big huge companies for a living  When a company announces that it's no longer going to release its quarterly  sales figures  Usually it's not because they're hiding the fact that they're they're beating, you know analyst expectations

They're looking for somebody to get them out of this as quickly as possible  Augmented realities this is from Bloomberg argument and reality startup magic leap to explore a sale.

Were they one of the investors? I don't know if they were one of the original investors, but somehow they got  I've been down there. I visited them and I know you were a bullish you have been always consistently bullish

End time: 1789.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and when we're talking about the technology itself, I stand by that the problem is of course you've got technology  And then you have the business of running a company there what they're working on is very you know  It means a very long runway  I mean they have a consumer the product that they have is is nowhere near being ready for  widescale use when I compare, you know leap to the HoloLens 2  Which is very much ready for the enterprise and not intended as a consumer device  You know those things are different and the problem is when you're working on a groundbreaking  technology  That really truly functions differently than then is something new  you know it needs time and the markets doesn't allow time and  The tech press doesn't allow time. So this is a company that has had some financial and personnel issues as a result

Transcript:  One that like many research projects, you know, I would consider what they're doing basic research and in this country  We do not have a federal government really interested right now in funding basic research  So the kinds of stuff they're working on spatial computing  extended reality  Using data at scale in ways we've we've really not seen before  You know, it's tough to fund that if you've got investors who expect a quick return. Yeah, you agree Marques

Start time: 1823.78
End time: 1839.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's every time you you know, bring up investors. They always want the quickest return and a lot of times  I compromise as the product. I'm always interested in the product  That's like my big focus is make the product as good as possible and hopefully the rest will follow but businesses don't always work  That way so you end up compromising the product in order to please

Start time: 1840.54
End time: 1873.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Investors and things like that. Furthermore, there's a risk and I think we saw that with Google Glass  We saw it with the segue  I think we're seeing with folding phones that if the first products in a category don't live up to their hype  Then people might write off the whole category and I think yeah, you know, it's interesting you're defending  Wearable glasses by saying it's not Google Glass and I guess now want to say and it's not magically  But that can in the mind of consumers that can kill a product  I think that's that's the risk the segues that was you look so stupid on that. It was it it was over

Transcript:  No, and and so, you know that starts to change our understanding of things and certainly consumer expectations, you know magic leap is  Is is not a VR device it doesn't it doesn't do a lot right now  All of the compute is done on your body  HoloLens is something very very different, but these are all different types of devices  It just so happens that we put them on over our faces  You know, but that that again like we have to start  Meshing our expectations with with the reality of what's being built

Karsten made me this  My producer is insane  It is a lovely pleather mask  I don't I chose not to wear it for the show today  Marquez with the folding phones everyone we've seen so far has been kind of a disappointment not merely the Esco bar  Did you like the Z flip was there anything is this a category?  That's being made up by companies trying to find something different or consumers demanding it

Start time: 1970.66
End time: 2009.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's definitely closer to the first thing so I I've tried maybe a hand six or seven folding phones now  I think the Z flip is the closest to one that you could conceive a regular person to  Finding a good idea  But I think it is still coming from companies grasping at maybe there's maybe there's something here  Maybe there's something to a bigger screen folding down into a smaller form factor  But then there's so many different ways to maybe do that  You know folding in with an outside screen folding out around a hinge folding with a with a weird like  Hinge in the center like there's a bunch of different  Like hinge in the center like there's a bunch of different

Transcript:  Experiments duo and the neo these these microsoft dual screens with a dual screen  Yeah, might be a way to do I think part of the problem with everything i've seen so far is that  Bendable screens just really aren't very good

Start time: 2022.44
End time: 2051.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, those are super early. That's why yeah, go ahead mark. Yeah, i'm  I'm i'm really interested in seeing those when they come out. They say holiday 2020  We'll see if that actually happens  But those since they don't rely on a flexible  Single display they can do a lot more with a hinge in the middle a battery on each side and then software that sort of runs  Like dual screen software, right which seems a lot easier to get right right off the bat  Right and actually offer an advantage than something totally new like a screen folding in half

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google already has support for that in android microsoft's doing a new windows 10x  That actually is really much more than just for a duo  Or a neo device. It's really about reinventing windows, but they don't want to scare people  So it's my opinion and we've been talking on windows weekly about this too with paul and mary joe that  They're going to put it on the neo. They say this windows 10x this it's basically a containerized version of windows  Is only you know, we're making it for this new device, but ultimately this is the future of windows  Which I think is is kind of interesting. I think I like the idea of a

Transcript:  Of a book device, I don't know what about what about one that's retractable? So where would it retract?  so  Where's it going?  so there's the that the uh, i've seen over the years i've seen different prototypes and people playing  With with different types of phones. So, you know one is is sort of  Unfolding. Um, the other one is having something embedded where you can extend that screen out

Start time: 2116.88

Start time: 2119.72
End time: 2151.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, um again  My my question is always what is this additional real estate providing us?  What is this solving for is it?  Are we anticipating that people are going to somehow multitask and have like a video?  Like a youtube video on one screen and and you're doing something on social or you're being productive on another screen  Or is it that people really desire?  You know much more real estate I I don't again, I just don't see that  I don't know that that that the answer to those questions

Start time: 2151.94
End time: 2160.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are yes, that happens in this business though. The things are sometimes driven by the market  But much more often driven by a company that has to find the next big thing

Start time: 2161.78
End time: 2200.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, sometimes you sometimes you're sort of searching for it and find it without anyone asking for it  um for me, it's always been  fundamentally people  Generally like having a bigger screen to do more things whether it's watching a video or typing email, whatever it is  but the bigger screen you have  The bigger of a device you have and the more difficult it is to hold and to putting your pocket and to  Put a case on and all that stuff  So fundamentally shrinking the size of it down when you're not using the big screen  And then expanding it out when you need it seems like a good idea  But again how you do it exactly is sort of up for grabs

That's for your uh, you know  Your golden years save that  You could still run around pretty good  Our show today brought to you by worldwide tech. We were in st. Louis. We tried to get amy to come out. She was booked  Uh, but this was such a fun event. We did in st. Louis. I wanted to be there. Oh, it was so great  Well, you'll next time we'd love to have you sure  Worldwide tech blew me away  So I had I was not it was really dimly in my awareness  But then we went we saw the advanced technology center. This is I thought oh, that's nice  They probably have a a room somewhere with no  This is like three buildings more buildings all the time rack after rack of the state-of-the-art technology  From the biggest tech companies and the littlest tech companies  It is amazing half a billion dollars in equipment  Hundreds of oem's key partners ranging from high tech heavyweights like intel  Dell emc hp enterprise cisco little guys too like equinix equinix getting to be a big guy too  But all you know titanium all sorts of stuff  Wwt is a trusted partner. They stay with you over the years if you are in enterprise and you had to buy enterprise gear  You know about wwt, but they're not just some distributor. They help you from day one  In fact, that's why they built the atc their engineers use the atc  To build pilots to test a new gear to see if the gear integrates with the old gear  What's so cool about the advanced technology center is you can use it to go to their website and take a look  There's so much material there articles case studies  things that will help you plan your future in every aspect of  enterprise technology  They even have on-demand labs you can schedule them. You don't have to be in st. Louis 24 7 from anywhere in the world  Representing the newest advances in multi-cloud architecture and artificial intelligence  Iot solutions built on intel's platform like the world's only intel  fpga acceleration lab  intel select solution labs for technologies like vmware vsan  Cutting-edge solutions based on intel second generation xeon scalable processors  And i've always as when they announced, uh, I guess they called it crossfire at first right?  But when they announced optane, I was so excited the new tier of optane data center persistent memories out and you can try it  You could test it at the lab  It is amazing  Wwt's engineers work in these labs every day. In fact when we went in it was so cool  An engineer's going in and he said leo leo i'm in this lab because of you  I started watching the screensavers and tech tv. It made me a geek and now i'm here working in the lab  Met a lot of people in the labs  They're in their date. I said you have the best job in the world. They said yeah  Beta testing edge to cloud solutions based on the latest and greatest intel technologies  Building reference architectures. This is the new  Atc ecosystem a multiplier effect of knowledge speed and agility anytime anywhere for you  The wwt customer you're not a customer. You gotta go right now to wwt.com  Slash twit become a member of their growing community learn about the atc get to use the labs  It's just brilliant  Go to wwt.com slash twit find out. It's amazing  Wwt worldwide technology delivering business and technology outcomes around the world. I'm a believer now, man  Once we went out there. I was I was it was mind-blowing  Wwt.com slash twit  2020 tech trends report actually you didn't answer my question. So i'll put it to you again amy web  What when you talk about viruses like this? I mean, I guess it's been predictable  That we'd have a pathogen that would this this would sort of happen, but it changes everything first i'm thinking  People are learning how to work at home. They're learning how to teach  Online they're they're getting new skills. They're they're learning  You know some of this is of course, you know, we're all hunkering down  But I don't think the world's going to be the same when we come out of this  How can you talk about that?

Start time: 2601.72
End time: 2690.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The world's never the same anyways. I mean we talk about the future in this amorphous way  But really the future is always  Happening right? It's the future is simultaneously five seconds five minutes five years  No, that's good years from now very zen, but it's true. Yeah  well  And and the difference here is how we deal with the accelerated  Rate of change but change is always happening. I mean, you know in some ways my job really hasn't changed at all  From what I would normally be doing i'm just considering extra factors  And I think that would be super useful right now because I know everybody is feeling a crushing sense of anxiety  and uncertainty  Um, everybody is and even the people who seem like they're holding up and they're super strong somewhere deep inside  People are wondering, you know, what's really going to happen. There's a lot of anxiety. Absolutely. Yeah, right  Um, I would love to share something that I I don't really talk about publicly if you're if you're up for it  Having to do with anxiety. Absolutely. So um, I my first night of college  My first class I I was a super huge star trek  Star trek fan and I didn't realize once you got to college you could enroll in these things called electives  I was like, oh I get to take whatever I want. That's amazing  So I like ran into the first cosmology class that I could find I did the same thing. I did a college seminar

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So like amazing first night my professor is like showing us these unbelievable photos of the cosmos and he's helping us  He's trying to get us to think about the universe expanding  And he's going through all of the math, which I didn't have a problem with  um, the part that I started to have a problem with was the implications of that math and basically  He had lost like half the class. Yeah, he starts talking about like you know, everybody's  Everybody's seen those like jelly bean jars where you do the estimation. Yeah, and he's like explaining  how you know  Cosmologists understand that the universe is expanding and how they do some of these estimations and  It's going on and on and on and i'm just picturing like literally billions of estimation jelly bean jars to the point at which  i'm like well if there's  You know like 10 to the hundred or so potentially billion galaxies  I I started um  As i'm thinking about all of the stars and all the planets and all of the stuff and potentially all the other life forms  Uh, and all of all of that information it was as though  Within seconds everything was changing  And I I couldn't breathe I started my tongue like started to go numb in the back of my throat and my pulse was racing  And I thought I was having a heart attack and I was like i'm 18 years old  I'm gonna die on my first day of college  And uh, and then I blacked out. Oh my god  Totally and uh, and when I came to I was told that I had had a panic attack, which I had never  Wow  For anybody who's ever had a panic attack and there are probably more people having them now than in the past  Um as as much as it feels like you were gonna die when it happens  That's actually not the worst part. The worst part is the aftermath because your brain  Sort of rewires itself and it starts looking for those patterns again and you start  Doing everything you can to avoid uncertainty and  Cognitive behavioral science would tell us that that is not the right approach when you are faced with deep uncertainty about the future  Um the better or just deep anxiety, you know, whatever it is  The better thing to do although it feels wrong like every cell in your body wants you not to do this  The better thing to do is to lean into that uncertainty  Um and to observe it while it's happening  And to look for patterns and to try to make sense of it

Transcript:  I think that what I went through is analogous to my assumption like to what I think a lot of people are going through  Um, you know, I felt overwhelmed  Yeah, and I felt overwhelmed because I couldn't make sense of all of those data points, right?  And honestly if we weren't talking about the virus right now, you know, we could be talking about um  Saudi Arabia and russia going head to head and like putting their uh  Parts out if you you know what I thought about when I thought about

Oh, you're the one yeah, yeah, oh she has it in her hand  You were the one who told me it was one of your favorite novels of all time  And that's why I bought it and read it and rim. I don't have I don't think it's a spoiler at this point  It's to say this  But uh, the world is at war it's in the 80s and we're about to go to nuclear war the sov  The tensions are heating up between the soviet union the united states. Everybody's afraid that the we're going to have a nuclear war  and uh  Dementius one of the superheroes in the watchman decides to save the world by simulating an alien attack on new york city  it kills half the population, but  Everybody it focuses the mind amazingly and everybody stopped thinking about nuclear bombs  And started thinking about the aliens and united and it ended it ended the war

Transcript:  Threat, okay. So but why?  The reason is because in that scene in that part of the book  Time is effectively slowed down  The reason I love that book is because I love dr. Manhattan and I don't want to get totally off the rails here, but  dr. Manhattan  experiences time because of a catastrophic chemical failure like in a different way and  It all happens at once simultaneously  Right, he can sort of see the past present and future simultaneously and then chooses not to act  I i'm not that cynical. I believe we have some agency in what's coming but but  What you do in the process when you are having a panic attack or you're concerned about having a panic attack again  Or you're feeling anxious  You know the thing that you do is you observe what's happening and you you sort of  You know use a framework or a template or whatever to gather signals to make sense of things and it doesn't mean that  You can predict the future and that if you do these things, you won't have another panic attack  It just means that you are slowing things down. That's what happened in the watchman  That's what i'm describing interest and anybody who is feeling anxious right now  Because there's lots of different things to be concerned about  um, you know the thing to do is to stop observe what's happening and try to think about um,  You know next-order implications in a rational way and it's totally possible  You just have to make a decision that you're willing to lean into uncertainty  if you allow yourself to lean into uncertainty and to ask  You know to approach sort of complexity by asking deep questions  That's not only what gets you through but it's what turns risk into opportunity

I don't know if google's gonna  Suddenly have we're going to have different privacy in the united states because of the virus or not or whatever it might be  You come up with all these different things  You express them as opposites and then you plot them against each other on an x and y axis and that results in four different  Quadrants each one of those quadrants it sort of describes. Well if these two things happen, then what?  And that then what is a headline that tells you something about the future  You know, even if it seems like it's existential risk  Great. Now you've seen it. So what's our opportunity to to mitigate that or to turn that risk into an opportunity somehow?  um, I actually see a ton of  As bad as all of this is I think that there's going to be a lot of good that comes on the other side of it  That has to do with synthetic biology and faster  Uh getting to certain types of medications much faster  This could be this this all could clear the way for um, the faa to start allowing drone deliveries  Because we're probably going to need them, you know  I mean there's a there's it's it's not all horrifically bad if you allow yourself  To confront your cherished beliefs and think through other plausible scenarios.

What do you think?

End time: 3995.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they there's also the rumor of that march event  Uh that is also now rumored to have been delayed or cancelled  Um, so yeah, I think at this point  It's the question is how important is this product is this 14 inch or 13 inch macbook pro upgrade?  Uh as a product by itself enough to  To just push it out now or should we if your apple delay it so that we can properly launch it in stores  Uh, but there was also rumors of a bunch of other apple products potentially launching at the same time, too  There's a new iphone rumored that se2 or whatever. We're going to call it  Um, there's some other accessories rumored. So those are all sort of  Looming over this as well  but I think if we're just talking about the laptop, I think they could quietly launch it and kill the 13 inch and  Not have to wait for stores to reopen and then people would see it when the stores reopen

Start time: 3996.40
End time: 4003.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Although then I just got it. I just bought a dell xps 13, which is similarly thin and light  It had and it has a similarly short travel keyboard, but it's it's infinitely better and it kind of made me  Realize that even with the 16 inch i'm sacrificing a little bit

He says apple plans to announce a new macbook air models this week  We've also heard rumors from some less  Perhaps reliable sources like ming qi quo say that there will be new ipads  um  and  Maybe new maybe  Uh new air pods  um  I don't know.

You know?  uh  Yeah, they're I I guess I think about that when i'm making I make videos that are just on youtube  But there's a separate youtube for kids section  Uh that you can upload specifically videos for kids to be on it  And then there's a whole ecosystem there and there's that's always making headlines and weird stuff happens with that  But yeah, it's a lot of decisions. Have you ever thought about doing something for that?  No, it's a it's a different world. Uh, I see it a lot in just like people handing their kid  Uh an ipad just watch just just go rogue  You can watch whatever's on this app and it'll be fine and that's I get yeah, sure  Uh, but eventually you do have to make decisions about like when to give them  An account or when is instagram appropriate or is tiktok even okay?

I would rather that we are all more active consumers when we can be which means, you know, like  you know if you're watching a youtube video of any kind, you know, just  Sometimes it's fine to be passive, but it's not fine to be passive all the time and my concern is  um  this sort of growing  Passive viewing and passive consumption.

I would go on youtube and go find that same lesson by another professor in some college somewhere and just watch it myself at  My own speed and then suddenly that's more useful than anything I was getting anywhere else. So  That was great. But there's also people who just like go to sleep with videos streaming in the background and people who just like have  Content cost constantly passively being like basically fed into their brain, which isn't great.

So I think the key here is just don't don't just do a thing, you know  Um, make sure there's a diverse for everybody and and again like we're all going to be sitting in our homes  a lot going forward so  You know, um find yourself a new podcast find yourself a new book like get like five different media sources of media that you don't normally  engage with and and flip between them so that you  Are getting a nice diverse outlook on life

I just so impressive what you've done  And i'm going to ask you about esports when we come back and what your game is. Okay. What's your game brownlee?  What's your game man? And i'm also thrilled to have amy web. We love having you on  I just wish you'd move out here forget baltimore forget new york just come to northern california  And uh, and and just be on every show all the time  Honestly, you're fantastic. We still have to get to your futures  Uh stuff and we will in a bit, but I have to mention our sponsor is zip recruit  Tour I was just going down the list with lisa of the people we've hired using zip recruiter  honestly some of our best employees  zip recruiter is the  modern state of the art  Way to hire who the people you hire are the people that make or break your company  In fact, that's all a company is it's the people  And and and getting the right people could take your company to the moon getting the wrong people  Maybe that rocket won't lift off the pad. That's why you got a higher right, but of course hiring is challenging  zip recruiter makes hiring simple and  smart according to zip recruiter research  75 percent of employers have difficulty filling open positions  Which is why employers are taking bold steps to hire for instance raising wages  68 percent of employers have raised the wages because it's so tough  23 percent of increased benefits  But there's another way you can still do that and I encourage you to do so  But there's another way if you have a difficult role to fill no matter what industry hire with zip recruiter  I'll tell you why zip recruiter works. First of all  It casts the widest net  Zip recruiter as soon as you post there posts to 100 plus job sites  so assuming that the right person's out there you're going to be in more places more chances to to  Get a bite get the right person  But then they go beyond that which and this is the thing that's made a big difference for us  They use powerful matching technology to scan the resumes. They have on file. I can't tell you how well that works  Four out of five employers who post on zip recruiter get a quality candidate within the first day  We do typically within an hour or two and i'm always I love it because lisa say oh this one's good  Oh, this was really good. The best part is it doesn't go in your mailbox your inbox doesn't go in your phone system  No, they don't leave voicemails all the resumes all the applicants are filtered into the zip recruiter interface  And they reformat the resumes you can have screening questions and they highlight the best candidates  So it's very easy to look at that interface and say oh, here's the person  Zip recruiter if you're not using it, you got to try it go to zip recruiter.com slash twit try it for free right now  zip recruiter.com  Slash twi t it's the smartest way  To hire and I can't tell you we've had such great results zip recruiter.com  slash  twit  Do we have kevin a promo for the week?

Transcript:  No, I mean it uploaded super fast. Yeah, say that yeah file size is much smaller. We actually changed we were offering  And I apologize this is going to break some people's hearts  But we were offering I think three different quality levels, right john. What was the lowest quality we offered 480?  sd 480p  For bandwidth, you know people with low bandwidth and then we did a middle a middle and a high and honestly  And by the way, email me if this isn't the best thing. I know you're listening home grinding your gears  But uh, we figured what why are we doing that? No one else does that 720p for everything  But there are some people on limited bandwidth who might say oh, yeah, I really like that 480  So let us know but I think we're just going to go forward  We had a really ridiculous transcoding  workflow marquez where  It was running an ffmpeg and 15 different things and  It was crazy. So we're going to make this a little simpler just to have one video format and one audio  No, we still do just one audio format. Yeah, we have one show steve gibson  our security show  Still makes he does it himself. We don't a 16 kilobit audio version. It sounds like  Rudy valley, let's talk about security  But uh, there are people who just you know, I want the smallest possible file  so  But if you're watching on youtube, you can do anything you want because youtube it's actually  This must blow your mind when you think about it marquez. They take your video  And they transcode it into I don't know 15 different forms huge number of formats. Yeah

Start time: 5545.66
End time: 5594.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I I talked about this  I think last year was a video about just youtube processing and just how it works because if you upload an  8k video which I did for this  It's not just going to spit out that 8k video for all million people that want to play it back  Obviously that would suck so  They they make a they make a 144p version a 240p version a 360p version a 480p version  And not only do they choose based on your net connection which one to play back for you  But they'll dynamically switch between them based on if they get a buffer big enough of the next highest resolution  So if you're at 480p and they realize they're fast enough to bump up to 720p hd  Midway through the stream. You'll notice it gets a little clearer a little sharper. Yeah, because youtube just realized so all this stuff is  Is uh, it's beautiful that they do all of this at a rate unspeakable amounts of data every day

Start time: 5595.24

Transcript:  No, yeah, that's the beauty of the platform. This is  Yeah, if I i've said I would pay for like a youtube  Premium uploader account where you can like get priority processing or I was trying to give them ideas for making more money from creators  But this would honestly be something I'd pay for is if you could accelerate processing sure and and choose  You know some certain options that aren't available on the free tier. I would absolutely do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, so it takes me I I get the finished file. It's maybe five to eight gigs usually  Uh 4k is what we upload in and i'll upload it  It'll take you know, two three minutes and then i'll watch it process and youtube always does the same thing  It'll start at zero percent  And it'll stay at zero percent processed for like 10 minutes, right and then it'll snap to 95  96 97 98 99 100  And when it says 100 it's processed to 1080p  And I know I have to keep waiting another 15 minutes or so for the 1440p and 4k versions to process  Which it doesn't notify me about but i'll refresh and eventually i'll see it and then it'll go live

Start time: 5672.90

Start time: 5679.96
End time: 5702.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, I would pay for it to be faster just because of how often I do it, you know if i've uploaded  You know  What is it 100 videos last year? That would have been nice to save those 100 times 25 minutes. That's right  How many videos a day do you do or a week do you do?  We are about twice a week. So last year ended up being about I think almost exactly 100 videos

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh 100 and we've i've thought about it if I uploaded every single day the channel would  Absolutely. No questions asked be doing better by all metrics  Even if the content wasn't always great every time that that's the trade-off is I I am fully aware that the content would get  Significant not significant, but it would get worse you run out of ideas  You start to rush things the content gets worse and part of what I think separates the channel in the first place and what I enjoy  Is really taking my time on videos and making them that extra step spending an extra day on  Just the animations and the color and things like that. So  We've made the quality over quantity choice at the expense of  What the algorithm would probably favor, but I don't think it's you know ruining the channel or anything. Oh, I wouldn't say that

It ends up being like the only place  An advertiser can go to reach this audience  Which is kind of a bummer if that makes youtube a monopoly in that way, but that's  What it is chasing now to get the customer.

There are a lot of them  then that kind of spawned the  food box movement  And uh that you know, hello fresh and there have been so many of those we did we did blue apron for years

You pay for it. Basically, it is it is placements

Start time: 6303.84
End time: 6320.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact most of the revenue I was talking to somebody most of the revenue in a grocery store  It doesn't come from the consumers. It comes from the brands. Yeah. Yeah, so it's a replacement  Yeah marquez. Do you is most of your revenue from youtube ads that they sell or is it from ads that you sell or you?  Do a little bit of both

Start time: 6322.10
End time: 6358.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do both. I think the  the over 50 would still be  ads that youtube sells  And but yeah, we can do our own ad placement  At like any rate we want on demand we can choose not to have a placement for a video or we can in any video  So that have a sales team. Are you people selling for you?  That would be me. You're the sales team  Me in the inbox. Yeah, that's the sales team. So it's it's very very picky and  We don't have to I mean because we only do two a week. So, you know if a video is sponsored  It's it's a whole it's a whole ordeal  So, yeah, the sales team is just me

Start time: 6360.96
End time: 6401.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it's a whole ordeal  It's a lot  Trust me. I know we have a cut  We don't not only do have a sales department  We have a continuity department because they have to check the ads they have to make sure the copy is accurate  They have to make sure the right ad ran at the right time. It becomes a very elaborate process  Uh, it's yeah, but it's a little different for what we're doing. We're more like traditional broadcast is more like a radio  Show the uh, youtube  Video i'm just i'm always curious because I see I don't I pay for youtube red so or premium now  So I don't see any of the ads  um  and then do you do interstitials in the video or I mean I see the ads in the

Start time: 6401.78
End time: 6424.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Below the video in the comments or whatever the oh you uh, you're talking about the like the mid rolls that are  That play and yeah you can do so you can choose to add mid rolls to videos that are greater than 10 minutes long  So if we have a video that's long enough that we feel has a spot for a mid roll we can add one  Uh, but not every video is over 10 minutes long. So not every video and you don't do what we do the interstitial

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I have never done that that's i've done post-roll ads, right?  And that's sort of like we finished the the video that everyone came to watch and then we go right into  The sponsor of the video if we've done sort of more integrated stuff  It usually doesn't like stop and start the ad and then resume. It's not really as  uh structured as that but

Start time: 6448.74
End time: 6452.58

End time: 6493.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know about rebel  I've i've sort of kept eyes on a lot of other channels in similar spaces that do start to do things like that  And I can see the way the audience reacts and everyone does it differently too. Some do it really well some do it  Uh, just like willy-nilly they'll do it for any, you know, whatever sponsor  Um, we have a channel sponsor as well where it's like they brand right? Yeah, exactly  D brand is a channel sponsor  So they'll sponsor essentially a couple of videos during the year based on what makes sense for their brand  And so those are the closest we might get to like a an interruption, but it's all seamless in the flow of the video  So it usually isn't it doesn't feel like any reason to rebel, right?

What's the purpose of this?

Start time: 6539.66
End time: 6565.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we track longitudinal trends, uh for the purpose of trying to understand  where there's going to be disruption in tech where there's going to be disruption and  you know every possible area that you could think of and the point of this is um  For us to do better research for us to help our clients, you know, etc  um, so so we're already doing the research and years ago 13 years ago, we started putting it into an annual report and so

It's good. It's bad. It's uh  potentially problematic um  There is a lot happening with a lot of the big technology firms getting into farming  It's like big big tech companies like amazon and microsoft are getting into food farming  Yeah. Yeah, microsoft, uh  Basically has fairly huge stakes now in two different farms what  Yeah, what?

Start time: 6657.80
End time: 6723.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's it's um, you know, how can we use precision data mining and some robotics and 5g?  Um to try to get a better handle on  There's some crazy interesting experiments around  Mixing the food for cows in real time per each cow to help  Their overall nutrition level, you know sort of get better custom vitamins you were talking about. Yeah, totally  Not just for humans anymore, there you go  Um, so there's that we're tracking some really interesting  Movement in like ai in the cloud  amazon's aws robomaker is probably going to go live sometime soon  And that's going to basically allow any business that wants to to have access to um robots  um, you know  Within reason but that that will start to shift all kinds of things. It's super interesting  Um, this is a huge year for off-planet exploration. And even though today's uh, space x launch was thwarted  I don't think that necessarily means that you know, we're in we're in for a rough year

Start time: 6724.82
End time: 6728.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's this is a huge year for off-planet exploration

Start time: 6729.28
End time: 6760.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because over the next 18 months, um, so we're always tracking space anyways  But over the next 18 months, there's a couple of launch windows to make it easier for us to get to mars  So this is a huge important year for space related initiatives. Um,  Some of the initiatives involve humans some of them are robots  Um, there's some agriculture projects like space agriculture  Um space, you know all kinds of microsat launches. So starlink was supposed to go up today and uh, i'm excited about starlink. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Screw the amateur astronomers  No, it's gonna be a problem. Yeah. Well, I mean look i'm i'm not i'm being facetious here. Yeah. Yeah, but uh,  The idea elon has launched now what 120 and another 60  At a time there's thousands that are planned they're playing 12  Thousand yeah, very low earth orbit satellites  The idea is to give gigabit internet access to every corner of the globe  But they've been saying that this year they'll have it'll start going people start being able to use it

Start time: 6794.76
End time: 6850.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So again, you know, it'll be interesting to see what happens because there are worldwide 5g  Um, so 5g is obviously something else we're tracking  There's some component there's problems with 5g because of component accessibility and some from huawei  right and and and uh  Regulations that prohibit certain components from being used the cable and uh, the cable industry is in the process of launching its 10 gigabit  Network, so you know 10 gigabit speeds very little lag and we've got now space-based internet  So so there's gonna be a lot of development there over the next, you know year to eight 18 months  Um, we've moved our quantum like quantum and edge computing have been on our weak signals list for a long time  And they finally jumped to the main trend list  Because of some you know developments that we've been seeing  And while I don't think quantum supremacy is, you know knocking on our door next week  I do think that there's going to be some interesting

Start time: 6874.38
End time: 6881.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6882.42
End time: 6924.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, here's what I would say. I think we are in a  Transition that's going to last a decade or so or more and as we move through this  transition  um, you know, I I don't think we will look back at this moment in time and say oh this 5g network was  True 5g or oh this quantum computer was really what we meant when we said quantum  I think we're there's a ton of technologies from artificial intelligence to synthetic biology and synthetic media  ambient computing  You know these new network infrastructures that are all in the process of evolving and we're living through it in you know  Right now i'm still back at microsoft's doing food

Start time: 6925.10
End time: 6948.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is it. This is uh from microsoft's food farm beats page ai edge and iot for agriculture  But this this is from 2015. So they're they're they're doing this more as a research project to  Be a product they can sell right? They're not they're not like  Buying farms because they want to be in the farm business. No. Well, I so

Start time: 6949.68
End time: 6969.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know that the answer to that is  necessarily no  um, I can tell you that we're seeing  um a lot of research and a lot of investments in uh,  indoor plant factories so think of a farm that's  We saw some of those at ces, right marquez. We yeah there were uh, you could have like it in your house

Start time: 6969.38
End time: 6988.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could have a plant factory  Yeah, so there's a lot. Yeah. Yeah, well a terraria, but I mean, yeah, I think that the idea is uh,  It doesn't have to be a spread out farm. There's aquaponics. There's vertical farms  Aren't they aren't they growing stuff in salt mines abandoned salt mines and things like that?

Start time: 6988.74
End time: 6999.95

End time: 7040.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  uh  Between those i'm really interested in starlink. I know it's got a long way to go but  generally  fast internet  Nothing bad with that is  Someone in my position exactly  Um, and just generally like every corner of the globe having you know 5g is interesting just because it's it's super early  And we're trying to see if we can build up the infrastructure in the smartest and fastest way possible, but without chinese technology

Transcript:  So yeah being compromised I and you will get to this point. You're still young  But at some point you'll be wondering how can I do these shows somewhere besides hoboken?  And having starlink to me  Having the capability to do a mobile studio anywhere in the world is very intriguing  I wonder if that's going to that  You know for for one thing we're going to put the second half of the world's population online. So that by itself is huge  But the idea that they can all not just consume but create

Start time: 7076.40

Ooh, I mean really brought to you by zappier  We use zappier like crazy  I have zappier scripts to do all sorts of stuff. For instance when I bookmark a story  Uh in my news reader  It automatically zappier goes. Yes, i'll take that it sends it because they have multi-level zaps. It's so cool  It sends it immediately to pinboard. It sends it immediately to twitter. I have special links for twitter feed  It sends it immediately to my blog. It sends it to me. It does all of this  Immediately to a spreadsheet on google sheets which carston can use to make our show  Rundowns it does all of this completely automatically. In fact, I I get emails every month from zappier saying we just saved you 40 hours  I love that four and a half million people use zappier on average 40 hours a month. They save with these automated  Technologies, it's the easiest way to automate your work zappier has over 2 000 apps now that it works with  So what you do is you connect up?

Transcript:  Right, so I think probably a lot of the listeners to this show are  aware of the data that are being mined and refined and  You know, this is one of the tricky things about the future of technology  The data on their own aren't really worth anything  It's what we do with those data and a lot of our automated systems and all of the cool ai that  excites us  Requires quantification in some way. So the issue is a lot of our systems don't work without scoring us. However  We are constantly being scored and there is very little transparency  And so that will start leading us down different pathways  Some you know, some people will start getting charged things  You know charged differently for things. They may get denied  Um the ability to use things it probably also means we're looking at regulation in the future  You know, but it's a good reminder that tech on its own isn't good or bad necessarily  But we have to start really thinking through how we're using it all

Start time: 7443.12
End time: 7507.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, we're actually calling 2020 the synthetic decade because there's a lot of emerging  Trends in synthetic media content, but also synthetic biology and synthetic data sets and synthetic food and beverage  So when we're talking about content and media that is um content that's been generated using, uh  corpus of  Data whether that's vocal  Recordings or your faces or you know, whatever it might be so on the sort of  maybe the easiest way to understand this is a deep fake so a deep fake would be sort of the  the the negative bad side as we've seen it so far of synthetic media, but the real future that i'm kind of excited about is  You know all kinds of synthetic character development and there's plenty of problems which I think everybody's like heard a lot about  all the cool stuff is  um, you know modulating voices modulating faces having  Um all the youtube content that you're interested in but generated for you more specifically  um

Transcript:  There's a whole there's a youtube channel called ryan's toy reviews, which is this little kid who's i'm i'm sure you've heard of him  But he's he's very young so it's like borderline like strange that he's a youtuber  But his parents have enabled him to have this whole empire where he takes toys out of the box  He's made like eight millions eight million dollars last year  Yeah, an incredible success story  But the parents are very careful to not like force this job on this kid and make him have to participate and make the videos  So they've hired a team to make an animated version of him and a story time channel and these other things to make sure he doesn't  Constantly feel pressured to work. I'm curious if  Synthetic videos are not so far away where I don't have to make videos either. I just sit down  Have an idea  Type it in and it becomes a video. You said a decade away, but that sounds incredible

End time: 7634.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  um, I mean so it depends on  Uh fidelity like what your requirements are for fidelity, but we are there's already systems in place  You know you guys are in the recording business. So  Um, you've probably recorded a show or a podcast and you wish that your guest or somebody had said something a little differently  You can't really go back and edit them cleanly  the idea here is using a  Generate adversarial network and some other technologies and tools  To sort of go back and reprogram what that person  Said i'll give you a better example so at south by this year  I was going to uh  Show everybody this brand new project from reuters, which is a algorithmic  Synthesized journalist so it's like a guy  Who can use the structured data from premier league football games and then like give a sports report which I find  Super boring on so many levels. Oh, but the reason they do it with sports is such a structured

Transcript:  Right. So this is like a video version of a person in a convincing way who looks like a news anchor  Talking about that which they've been doing in china for a little while so it's not using the synesthesia technology

Start time: 7653.76
End time: 7665.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  Now I went over by the way to the synesthesia booth at cbs  And I asked the salient question. Is there a human that looks like this and they said, oh, yeah  This is just a captured human

Start time: 7666.28
End time: 7736.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but it doesn't have so that's just what they're doing my point is it doesn't have to be so it could be totally generated  Wow, and but now here's where it's interesting. So like what could you do to make me care about soccer?  Which I care basically nothing at all about um, well if that if that guy you care less about soccer  I would suddenly care a lot more really let's say let's say that he looked like chris evans or let's say that he was chris evans  Um, and let's say that chris evans was speaking with a slightly lower voice  um, and and talking directly to me about  Whatever blah blah blah sports  Um, I would totally pay attention to that right and now if we take that out to the next level  What if that exacts and this is what I was going to I actually built this and was going to show this at at south by  um, what happens if  synthetic chris evans talking to me about soccer wasn't actually talking to me about soccer but rather about how to  Socially isolate and wash my hands and be a better citizen in the era of of the virus and better yet  And that's where things start to get interesting. He would know your name. He would call you amy. He would know he wouldn't I would listen

Start time: 7736.76

End time: 7771.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was disembodied but it's it's you know, this is not far off and it it doesn't have to be dystopian  I mean, that's kind of the interesting thing. I believe we still have some agency in deciding what comes next  But it's on us to track what's happening  So that we make those incremental decisions as we go rather than getting to the future and deciding  Holy hell. I wish it didn't look like this. I wish we could go back now the other direction

Transcript:  Well good news west world's on in about an hour and uh, cannot wait synthetic chris evans  awaits  The truth is and it's not widely known but they've been doing this in motion pictures for a long time  Yeah, uh very  Frequently the stars you see on screen are digitally altered  Maybe their voice is a little lower or maybe their skin's a little clearer or they have a little less fat on their bodies  That's commonly done now. In fact, it's often written in the movie contracts

Start time: 7803.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and and again like and before that it was photoshopped in magazine covers and before that it was some super talented artist  With an eraser and a pencil and some paint, you know  We've always been trying to alter reality in a way that reflects our values our hopes our dreams and whatever they may be better  um, we're just getting closer to doing that in an automated way and fairly soon in a way that is um,  Where some of the cognitive functions are being done for us?

Start time: 7830.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean the trick was always uh, it's easy to do in a movie because it's post-production and so you have all the time  In the world to work on it  The trick is to do it in real time  Excuse me real time  karsten and I  Go way back because he used to make my hair spin when I was a virtual character on uh, msnbc and that was  Almost 20 years ago now  And that was in real time and that was what you was unique about that because reboot had already been on which was  You know a cgi cartoon  But it took weeks and days and weeks and months to make those  Whereas I would sit across from soledad o'brien and talk to her as a virtual character

End time: 7911.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here's so one of the things that we've done in this year's trend  Well, we always do this in our trend reports is we get real granular  Um, so it's not enough to talk about deep fakes and sort of ambiguity  there's a lot of like we explain what are what the different elements are because  Not every part of the synthetic media ecosystem is moving at the same rate  um, and there's a ton of trends in there and a ton of things to think about and it's super interesting to think about the  future of synthetic media  alongside other trends like artificial intelligence and home automation and  Censorship, which unfortunately is a new topic this year  um, you know in all kinds of other areas too, so

Transcript:  This is  Um policy uncertainty, so I know that doesn't sound like a tech trying to kind of is but I I think we're gonna not have any  collaboration  um, which is weird because like if you ask any futurist  Or sci-fi nerd like what's the one thing everybody wishes for when things are bad and it's always an alien invasion  Because like that's the one thing that brings everybody together. Yeah, and I would argue we totally have an alien invasion right now  Yes now like this virus is malware for the source code humanity biological malware. Yeah. Yeah, and uh  I thought that this was going to be a thing that somehow brought us all together and  I don't see that happening. I see a lot more policy uncertainty and a lot more confusion when I and I really wish that wasn't the case  Right now is it a political issue?  Um, I think it's a lot of things, you know, we live in a very complicated age. The the economy is complicated  We've got a lot of opposing viewpoints and  Unfortunately, we have people all around the world who are in power. Um  Who you know some of them are great and some of them?  Should have other jobs  Uh, and you know, we're gonna have to deal with with what comes next. But again  I always I always come back to hope I really do think we have an opportunity to make it make things better going forward. So  honestly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. Um, the challenge is that our technology is moving faster than our ability to  Uh create policy for it and the way that we create policy is not really intended to shift and change as quickly as tech  So we're probably gonna have to come up with different structures going forward  but that's gonna take a lot of political will and  Long-term thinking and by design our democratic structures are short-term. Yeah, but worse than that the the incumbents
