End time: 293.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's bigger than a VMworld. Bigger than Lotus. That's amazing. Yeah. It was like forty six thousand last year. Is it seriously a hundred thousand this year? That's what they tell us inside.

Start time: 293.78
End time: 309.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So people who live in San Francisco not associated with it say it's the traffic's terrible. It's crazy downtown right now because of that. And half the audience more than half almost all the audience in our studio today is here for a Dreamforce. So that's nice. Bunch of CRM folks.

Start time: 311.06
End time: 320.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The hell is CRM? Customer Relationship Management but Salesforce is bigger than that. It's a platform. It's a whole cloud platform out there. It's a platform. All right.

Start time: 322.90
End time: 357.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So speaking of platforms, Sony PlayStation. Hey, who took my PlayStation 4? I had one right here. That's all right. That's all right. It's okay. They took it back. We took one down. Took one apart just a few minutes ago. Our tear down of the Sony PlayStation 4. It's out.  Sony says a million units sold in the first day. Of course, a lot of pre-orders. In fact, to most accounts, more pre-orders for the PS4 than the Xbox One. A million units is a lot. I mean, for a game console, especially given the dearth of launch titles. I know we're not a gaming panel here.

Start time: 358.86
End time: 372.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was a huge line. I was in San Francisco last week and on Market Street. I walked by on Thursday on Market Street and they had their party going on. And it was a massive line. And then they had PlayStation 4. I was like, wait, what? This is for PlayStation 4? People still line up for these things?

Start time: 373.90
End time: 375.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the Best Buy and the Mission had a line around the block.

Start time: 376.86
End time: 379.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was a line in Brooklyn. There was a crowd standing on the street corner.

Start time: 381.30
End time: 412.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The irony, I guess it's because these are like a hundred year plan. It's only every ten years that a new console comes out. So it's a big deal.  I've read some articles of this effect that the console wars are a little ginned up this time. You've got Xbox One and PlayStation 4 coming out roughly the same time Xbox One comes out in five days.  But the launch titles are not particularly compelling. There's no new Halo. There's no new Gears of War.  What is it? What are the Sony? There's no Uncharted yet.

Start time: 413.78
End time: 414.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's Assassin's Creed, I guess for certain.

Start time: 415.78
End time: 420.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. A lot of it is just sequels that are not uninspiring Call of Duty Ghosts, which is already out on other platforms.

Start time: 421.84
End time: 433.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think they may have paid those people to stand in line. I think this is a new marketing strategy. You know, you pay people, you go on Craigslist, you pay people to come stand in line, you know,  ten bucks an hour, whatever. And you can't buy marketing like that.

Start time: 434.92
End time: 445.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I don't. I think these people are genuinely very excited about getting it.  No, they were. They were.  But I don't understand really why.  You can't play any of the old games, so you've got to play new games.

Start time: 446.74
End time: 473.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The hardcore game is still in full force. Plus, there's like some really great features now with being able to control your devices from your smartphones and tablets.  And there's like some good second screen experiences that are completely new to this generation.  Plus, like, yeah, there's no Halo of Gears of War, but the biggest game franchise right now is Call of Duty.  But you could buy that on the PC two weeks ago.  But not in like super crazy HD and like new features and stuff. I don't know, I can understand it.  I haven't picked mine up yet.

Start time: 474.86
End time: 482.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm getting the Xbox One. I decided, Sony, you burned me once, burned me twice. Not going to burn me a third time.  Go ahead, Christina.

Start time: 484.28
End time: 556.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've been playing both of them for the last week or so.  And Sony actually, it was interesting what they did for their press launch in New York.  They rented out the entire Standard Hotel, which is near the High Line.  And if anyone is from New York City or if you've been there, you know that the Standard is a really nice, very expensive hotel.  And they basically rented out almost the entire hotel and had games set up on every floor.  And you could go into different rooms and play different games for all the different launch titles and other stuff.  And it was pretty epic, I have to say.  They did a really good job kind of trying to, I guess, you know, the launch title lineup isn't great,  but they were trying to kind of show the future, some demos of what's to come and that sort of thing and trying to get people pumped.  And like Michael said, there was a big line in Brooklyn and there were lines at other Best Buy's, Union Square,  and other places in New York City.  And I mean, I think that the reason you've got so many people excited, right, is that, as you said,  I mean, it's been, what, seven years since the last PlayStation came out and people are excited about the future.  And then you've got things like the Twitch TV integration, so you can actually record yourself playing Call of Duty  and broadcasting it to Twitch and to YouTube and things like that.  That's actually pretty awesome. I mean, I think that's the sort of thing that the hardcore gamers and the people that are really, really into this stuff  are going to be excited about.

Transcript:  I'm trying to remember what game system actually had a truly great launch lineup.

Start time: 568.87
End time: 578.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I think Xbox.  The Dreamcast.  Wow, it's Sonic Adventure and the Fighter.  Older than a year's.  NFL 2K.

Start time: 580.49
End time: 619.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Crazy taxi. It's insane.  I worked at a video game store, 9999.  Oh, that's right. You knew. You were there.  I was there. And I actually know the crazy taxi didn't come out until January, but there was Soul Calibur, NFL 2K.  There was Soul Calibur was huge.  NBA 2K. There was the Sonic Adventure. There was another one.  I think it launched. They had a gun game. They had it was they had a really strong launch.  The system, you know, sadly didn't really last, but the US launch was huge.  And I would say actually the original PlayStation launch was really solid.  The Saturn launch, if you recall, was terrible.  And that's basically the console that killed Sega as a hardware company, not the Dreamcast.

Start time: 620.48
End time: 626.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like game systems don't really hit their stride until a year or two in.  I mean, launch. That's pretty typical.  It takes a while for developers.

Start time: 655.44
End time: 680.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The game where you could you could fish with the fishing rod controller, which was really cool.  And they had like the game where you have like little virtual pets.  I can't remember the name of it. It was really weird, but it would work on the little VMU.  The little seaman units. Seaman. Yes, which was great.  And there was an Echo game.  And then obviously the bass fishing game was a lot of fun.  God, I loved it. The dreamcast. That was so good.

Start time: 681.38
End time: 684.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me too. I have real nostalgia for it.  Somebody just sent me one.

Start time: 685.36
End time: 696.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was so good.  It's amazing. Are you kidding me?  That was like right when like Max Payne came out.  It was kind of like the beginning of it.  It must have been 16 when this came out.  Yeah. Yeah. I was almost 17 when it came out.

Start time: 697.34
End time: 720.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why it's burned into your brain.  You can actually tell how old people are from what sitcom they love and what it was the sitcoms and what games they play.  If they're really into Mario or Zelda or whatever.  Just this, huh? No dreamcast. It's gone.  But you may remember this.  Yeah. Oh, I love the controller.  It was a good controller.

Start time: 721.42
End time: 728.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was actually a really good controller and the VMU was really cool because you could take it.  It had a little battery in it. It could go from place to place. I loved it.

Start time: 729.58
End time: 766.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The funny thing is it is interesting about the age thing because the people I know who are excited like the first,  the second generation and third generation of consoles, the last couple,  I've sort of asked them, what are you buying?  What are you excited about?  PS4 or Xbox One.  And all of them are kind of sitting it out.  None of them are really excited.  And I don't know if it's just because they're all getting older or if they're just not excited because there is,  as you guys mentioned, there is actually some innovation and some interesting innovation going on with this generation.

Start time: 767.24
End time: 784.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and these are X86. That's the biggest thing that's happened here,  which is that these are essentially Windows-like PCs.  I mean, anybody who's developed for X86 will know how to develop for it.  And that means you don't have to wrap your head around the crazy cell processor,  the PS3 or the PowerPC that was in the Xbox 360.

Start time: 785.22
End time: 876.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, they're both PowerPCs.  And it was a big problem for heat, right?  Because that's always been the problem with the PowerPC is you could theoretically get really fast.  I mean, that's why Apple was never able to put the G5 into a laptop is that they couldn't get the thermal correct.  And you ran into those issues early on, even when they released the PS3 and this 360.  You knew that there was kind of like a limit to how fast they could go.  And so I think that Sony is the one who benefits the most out of this  because the PS3 was such a pain to develop for  that being able to have a much more like X86 system for people to develop for,  And all the indie developers that I've talked to over the last few months,  since their big launch, where they didn't even show off the console,  they've really been pitching them hardcore to say,  hey, you can bring your games, either digital download or whatever,  to our system much more easily than you could with the PS3.  And I think Microsoft's going to be playing that up a lot too,  especially presumably once the Steam box or whatever comes out,  they'll be trying to push more of the hardcore PC titles to get to the Xbox more quickly.  But yeah, I think that the problem, I think it's kind of a shame  that the biggest video game that's happened in a decade, GTA V,  they didn't have an up-res version to go with either of the consoles.  I think that's a real shame because if they had that,  you have a billion dollar plus title that you could have probably pushed  a lot of units just from people wanting to play GTA V and 1080p.

Start time: 881.33
End time: 912.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's a billion dollar title.  It is.  There have been some bugs with it.  it would have been a no-brainer if they had GTA at launch,  But honestly, if I were either Sony or Microsoft,  I would have tried to work with them early on,  to take you early on so you could have an up-res version at launch  just because that could guarantee you probably selling 500,000 consoles  at the holiday season just on that title.

Start time: 923.22
End time: 940.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is that this is just the beginning.  And as we're all saying, these things have cycles.  So even if you don't buy now, that's okay.  And I think that they're looking at all of the...  Both Microsoft and Sony are looking at this from a long-term plan  where they're saying, you know what,  we can have a really strong summer lineup  and we can have a really strong next fall  and we'll get the hardcore gamers now

Start time: 944.12
End time: 944.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a long-term play.

Start time: 946.02
End time: 973.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I mean Sony told me directly  that they're looking at this as like a decade-long cycle.  And so they're not expecting  or I think even planning on having everything right out the gate.  And obviously a million sales,  even though many of them are pre-orders,  And they have, arguably,  Sony's really gone after the hardcore gamer,  but Microsoft has the much stronger brand in the living room.  So it'll be interesting to see.

Transcript:  Well, that's going to be the other,  a little bit of a referendum I think next week  Because it seems to me,  Microsoft has diluted that a little bit  by also focusing on the living room,  on media, on streaming.  It's a media extender as much as it is a game machine.

Transcript:  Right, or you can get it to be 60,  like $129, which is a great device.  The one cool thing I do have to say,  that Microsoft's really been pushing,  how powerful their system is.  You can switch from watching a video to playing a game  to watching live TV nearly instantaneously.  And that's actually, it works just like the demos say that it does.  And that's something that I don't know how many consoles that'll sell,  but the fact that it does work exactly like they say it does  is really cool.  And I think that maybe down the line  they're going to be looking at, okay,  how do you get better deals with cable operators  and that sort of thing.  Your Xbox really could be your cable box

Transcript:  and that's a really interesting concept.  I'm willing to pay $100 more because I want the Kinect.  Maybe I'm wrong, but Kinect was a huge disappointment  even though they said it was the fastest selling consumer gadget  of all time.  It really didn't live up.  You had to stand 10 feet back.  Nobody had the room.  I had to move furniture to use the damn thing.  And then talking to it didn't work well  and they can make Kinect 2 be something a little bit more useful.  If I can really talk to my TV and say,  I don't know where Agents of Shield is,  but play Agents of Shield,  that would be huge, I think.  And we'll see.  By the way, this breaking story from 9to5Mac,  apparently Apple has purchased PrimeSense,  the company that created Kinect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was on the verge earlier.  That was on the verge this morning as well.  And yeah, that is really interesting  to Apple before Microsoft and the Kinect came out.  It came out of the Israeli Air Force,  I think is where the guy came from,  who developed the technology.  to go their own way,  in consumerizing that technology,  And now if Apple's got that in its hip pocket  for perhaps wearable...  Maybe they are doing a TV.  Perhaps the living room.

Well, anyway,  we'll have an Xbox One teardown next week.  We did do a PlayStation 4 teardown minutes ago.  One of the things we're seeing  and I just looked at Amazon.com  of the almost 2,000 reviews on Amazon.com  for the PlayStation 4 launch edition.  There are about 500 one-star reviews  for people who say it was bricked on arrival  or bricked after I installed the update.  Blue screen of death  This sounds a little familiar.  It's unfortunate.

They actually have different things like logic-based setups you can do.  So if you jump on this platform,  then this action will occur and this will happen.  the very first level of the original Super Mario Bros.  and things like that.  You can do all kinds of stuff  Seriously, I would describe it as taking the best parts of Minecraft  with Disney and Pixar characters.  Is it a completely open world?  Yes.  It's a game part where you can play the games,  where you can do whatever you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what my kids love about Minecraft.  They love the creative bit of it.  And because of that, they do that.  I'd say if they spent 10 hours on video games,  nine of it was on Minecraft  and an hour was on Xbox.

Start time: 1497.69
End time: 1534.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think what's really fun about it  is that like you said,  the logic is that you kind of learn programming  without even realizing it  and that to me is really exciting  as a way for kids to kind of see  oh, okay, by linking these two things together  that's how I can create this action  and it's a lot of fun.  And so they've been trying to build out  their community of kids  who are building their own experiences  for the toy box  and then making them downloadable  so that if somebody creates some sort of game  for the toy box mode,  you can go over to your friend's house  log into your account on their Xbox

But Disney Interactive is basically  betting their future on this set  and then in addition to the game,  they've got the physical toy packs you buy too.  The figurines and the collectors  are going crazy for those  and there's some seriously hardcore,  scary Disney collectors out there.  Like, wow, like, wow.

But they had a really big launch event in January, and John Laster was there,  and some other bigwigs from Disney, and they were showing off the potential.  And then it came out in August, and I really loved it, and I gave it a good review.  And it's been doing really, really well for them.  And I have to say, for me, who's just a giant kid,  it combines what I used to do with my toys, but digitally.  And the fact that you can create the Minecraft-like kind of logic stuff  and kind of do whatever you want in the world, it's a ton of fun.

I mean, to me, that's fine, but that's just about grinding through  to get more things for the toy box mode.  They're like, yeah, we really hope that that's what takes off,  I'm like, are you kidding? Do you not see how huge Minecraft is?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we see it, but they were concerned that there wouldn't be  a lot of buy-in on that part, and it's kind of turned out for them  to be the total opposite.  And, you know, because for me, I mean, every kid that I talk to,  not that I talk to kids all that often, but when I talk to kids of my parents,  my friends' kids or whatever.

I don't see a whole lot of them talking about Xbox One and PS4,  so I'm interested to see if others have.  It's tablets, right? That's where you want to go.  It's all mobile.  Everybody's focused on mobile right now that I see.  Even what used to be kind of game houses or parts of game houses and all of that.  And so that's what's going to decide the future of this thing.

Hey, three billion dollars for Snapchat.  No problem. No brainer. Not enough.  Our show today brought to you by go to assist the folks at Citrix do a great platform for anybody working in I.T.  I know that's a lot of you. If you have to do software support, if you have to do I.T., you would love what you get with go to assist.  And if you think it's just remote access, whoa, there's a lot more of new stuff at go to assist dot com.  Take a look. Of course, they start with the best remote access platform, the ability to support PCs and Macs from PCs or Macs or mobile mobile support to now, which is really awesome.  You can have as many as eight unattended sessions to you can. I mean, I can go on and on. This is a very, very nice remote access solution, but it's not the entire thing.  Go to assist is a whole suite now of cloud based tools, including their service desk, which let you track changes, keep track of problems as you solve them.  Great. You can have a branded portal for your customers.  Track incidents, change management, release management, a complete knowledge center that keeps your customers in the know.  I mean, people love this self-service portal. And then you got to try the monitoring, which allows you to be up on what's going on and solve problems before they become major issues.  You look like a support hero. Go to assist. I want you to try this free.  And when you do click the try it free button, make sure you check all three modules.  I want you to try all three modules, the remote support, the service desk and the monitoring.  But I do ask if you would as a favor, click that promo code link and enter in TWIT so they know you heard about it on this week in tech.  In the 30 days free, go to assist.com. All three modules free for 30 days. They're very affordable anyway, but I think it's worth trying.  If you're in this business, you got to know about go to assist. Go to assist.com.

Start time: 2245.56
End time: 2259.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's why kids like it. They know that these pictures don't live. So I can say a silly video or send a picture. My kids use it.  And contrary to what most old folks like me think, the kids aren't using this for sexting.  They really are.

Start time: 2261.79

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it's not all it's for. You do funny things. I mean I use it with some of my friends and we'll send each other ridiculous things. But no, absolutely. Of course it's being used for sexting.  Yeah I'm sure it is but I don't think it's as much as one might assume it's entirely for sexting.

Start time: 2276.26

Start time: 2279.54
End time: 2290.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. What isn't used for sexting? But I think it's just fun. Kids like it. And they like the idea they can send goofy pictures and not have to worry about them living forever.  It shows the kids are more savvy about privacy than we might have imagined.

Start time: 2291.28
End time: 2304.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, the ephemeral nature of it is certainly huge. But personally I mean look I'm not going to lie. I'm totally just like I just said in the chat.  I'm totally waiting for this thing to just go totally group on so I can laugh my ass off because no this is not worth four billion dollars.

Start time: 2305.64
End time: 2307.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is no they don't even have there's no revenue.

Start time: 2309.34
End time: 2332.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No exactly. And the thing is is that you have to wonder how long of it mean. Okay so great this is the platform where everyone is using for this sort of thing.  And clearly you know Facebook tried to create a copycat and it didn't work which makes total sense because part of the reason you used it is because it's not Facebook right.  And you know you don't necessarily trust Facebook not to store copies of it everywhere.  Although you know what I don't necessarily trust Snapchat not to have copies of a lot of the stuff.

Start time: 2333.26
End time: 2368.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No in fact as we know the NSA at least has access.  Totally.  And there are lots of programs that are with Snapchat of course as with anything you could always do a screenshot but Snapchat is designed so if your buddy takes a screenshot it will notify you.  You know Leo took a screenshot of that picture.  But there's ways around that. In fact 10 boys this is actually very sad.  Were just tried or arrested and accused.  These boys are age 13 to 15 of using Snapchat to make child pornography in Canada and Quebec.

Start time: 2370.20
End time: 2400.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And see that right there to me is why it's really not worth four billion dollars because you've got to have checks in place for things like that right.  Like if you were to be actually bought and vetted by a real public company you would have to make sure that there were things or filters or something in place.  So that that sort of thing can be reported because I mean that's the sort of thing where if it happens enough that that will take down no matter what your business is.  You know what I mean.  Like if there's any whiff of it being a haven for child porn and there I mean that will take down your business.

Start time: 2401.72
End time: 2434.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well and this is why it's you know I mean as you said Mark everything can be used for this kind of stuff.  But the reason that this is perhaps more of an issue is according to the police doing the investigation the girls you know boyfriends would say I'll pose for me for a picture in Snapchat.  And the girls according to the police thought it was safe because the picture would not live forever.  But instead the boys were exchanging these pictures saving these pictures and eventually they were making it out to the Internet.  And so that's why it's more of a problem for Snapchat particularly than it is say let's say for Twitter where I'm sure the same thing happens.

Start time: 2436.33
End time: 2456.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The question about Snapchat is is it AOL instant messenger or is it Twitter.  Right. I mean the reason they turned down three billion dollars reportedly from Facebook or four from Google if that's true is because they because Twitter now has a 23 24 million dollar market cap.  Right. They Twitter turned down lots of people that want to buy them.

Start time: 2457.56
End time: 2461.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does Snapchat think that it will go public and get it and be worth 18 billion dollars.

Start time: 2462.66
End time: 2464.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the only reason you turn down three or four.

Start time: 2465.58
End time: 2497.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. I mean that's why Groupon did. I mean Groupon turned down 10 right and Groupon really thought that it could scale and then you know there were people like me who was like there's no way this scales this doesn't work.  And my fear with Snapchat is I think that it's a feature and it's a very cool feature.  But unlike Twitter which had obvious API potential and the potential to be more than just you know using it for what it was originally designed for.  I don't know if Snapchat will ever have anything that's beyond kind of that sort of breakout moment and then you think Christina are you smarter than Mark Zuckerberg.  No I'm not.

Start time: 2498.58
End time: 2500.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well no because Mark thinks it's worth three billion dollars.

Start time: 2500.26
End time: 2510.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. And for him it might be but Mark needs to get the kids on board right.  So I mean that's the difference right.  And that's why I'm saying like if I were Snapchat I understand why you turn that down.

Start time: 2511.50
End time: 2523.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know you got to snap that up so fast because I'll tell you what that three billion dollars isn't going to last 30 seconds.  Take a screenshot kids.  That offers going.  Right. Right.

Start time: 2525.68
End time: 2531.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But Mark Mark needs it for a completely different reason.  It's not about the technology it's about on-boarding the users and that's a completely different thing.

Start time: 2532.30
End time: 2537.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 2538.26
End time: 2549.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well right. But see you keep the snapchat name.  Well that Instagram is exactly you know you let it run kind of as an independent company the way Instagram still does.  I mean it's basically their their ad operations and some of their press.

Start time: 2549.48
End time: 2556.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then you don't get the value because you really haven't on boarded the Instagram users to Facebook.  Their Instagram users not Facebook users.

Start time: 2557.26
End time: 2566.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. But to the market you can go to the market and say we still have all of the users right.  And Facebook doesn't sell the ads and reap the benefits from whatever revenue.

Start time: 2568.26
End time: 2569.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But how do you put ads in Snapchat.

Start time: 2570.26
End time: 2617.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well that's the problem right. How do you do that.  I mean you could obviously I think you know have you could have pop ups right.  But that's really going to annoy your user base.  If you have like every time you send an image you can have like a little pop up come up say oh you've got to watch this pre roll or you could maybe have sponsored like they're trying to do the story stream thing which is not going to work.  You could try to have sponsored things that way or you can maybe have advertisers send you know disappearing ads.  I don't know. I mean that's the problem right.  Like I don't know how you monetize this beyond just what it is.  I think if they had if it had been envisioned as something more than just a neat feature then maybe you could make the argument that there's a better business case to be made.  But I but I but it's like you know I don't know.  I think this is going to go the way of Groupon.

I don't want to say you know an air of you know child pornography or inappropriate content.  But but if you're Procter and Gamble if you're you know how are you going to how are you going to position your brand against the disappearing photographs.  You know where you want to be.

Start time: 2669.40
End time: 2686.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact it's really a problem because in my opinion Snapchat isn't really about sexting.  It's partly sexting but it's really more about and I watch my kids use it.  They do goofy pictures.  That's the problem is that people like me immediately hear about Snapchat and say oh sexting.  It's not maybe even the reality.  It's just that's what the most obvious thing is.

Start time: 2687.26
End time: 2715.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Could be could be.  But I think also on the monetization thing remember nobody had any freaking idea how Google was going to monetize and nobody had any idea how Twitter was going to ever monetize itself.  And while I would you know logically you look at them now and it makes a lot more sense why Procter and Gamble would ever you know advertise on one of those two.  You know Snapchat I mean that thing's only been up for two years.  I believe it was you know fall of 2011.

You know you have that option to spend 99 cents and get your next you know pack of lives and no I won't lie I beat all the levels available for the iPhone.

You have business guys you have you know people who are maybe you know just like regular folks you have like you know people with studs in their ears you have like you know guys that would normally look kind of scary everybody is playing Candy Crush Saga.  It's one of the equalizers the great modern equalizers on the subway like we all are Candy Crush players.  I mean Bram Cohen the guy that created a BitTorrent he plays Candy Crush all the time and I know this because I get friend request I get like live requests from him on Facebook like all the time like the number of people who you would be shocked.

It's just like I'll be in meetings or I'll be you know on on a phone call or something and it's just something to do and I love puzzle games so no I mean it's I've come to terms with my addiction and it's just like I'm addicted to it.

Transcript:  The idea is it is a less than a millimeter thick card that you program.  It has a dynamic magnetic strip so you program in your credit card you carry one card.  And if you can convince a store that it is not some sort of some sort of thievery device.  You can use it because when it swipes it swipes whatever credit card you told it to swipe.  I was amazed at how people jumped on this like it was the second coming of you know Candy Crush Saga.  It's a really cool concept.  Which no one will ever use.

And of course this whole Europe thing.  But I mean this is one of those situations where my new technology focus group of my wife says that she would buy this in a heartbeat.  She would.  She would because she has a wallet that is stuffed full of loyalty cards and gift cards.  And if she doesn't have the Barnes and Noble card then how is she going to spend those $15 of Barnes and Noble credit.  And all of that can be coinified.  Right.

Transcript:  And that's I think the thing is that you've got to have it you know the two interfaces together.  I think the reason that this has more potential than say Google Wallet did and some of the other things is because it still has that physical element.  I think that the problem with NFC that people haven't realized in addition to the very very difficult task of onboarding all of the point of sale systems in the world to using NFC which is one challenge is that people like the physical swiping nature.  They like having that aspect there.  And to them it feels safer than tapping something even if there's no difference.  And even if you can create as this shows you can you know take a copy of all the data that's on a card and put it on another card and you know easily transfer that to something else.  People like that physical experience.  So I think that the genius of this is that it pairs those two worlds of having the management system of something like a Google Wallet or PayPal Wallet.  I mean ironically the guy who was behind both of those things Osama Badir is an investor or an advisor to this company.

So the button loop problem I think they have licked.  But they do have some security challenges with PCI the payment card industry standard which has some fairly strict controls about where you can store this data.  So this is something that I mean if it works it's going to be very cool.  There are many many landmines that could potentially make it not work at all.

So there's a short list for CEO one of whom Stephen Elop who was the guy left Microsoft to go run Nokia and is now being folded back into Microsoft.  It's a Nokia acquisition succeeds.  Apparently he thinks he's going to sell Xbox and Bing.  Don't want those businesses.  Another potential hire an interim CEO.  A number of people say if he can turn or if he's if he's a CEO because one of the rumors is Ken Turner does it for two years and then he goes in and a lot of people said if Ken Turner ever becomes a CEO we're leaving Microsoft forever.  And then Microsoft in some weird timing announces we're not going to use stack ranking anymore.  This was a very controversial employment and HR method that we talked about many times to work thinks is the single source of downfall.  Yeah.  And then Ballmer says this all to all this week.  It's my fault.  And that's why I'm leaving.  Microsoft failed because of me.

Transcript:  But the thing is Steve Ballmer went in and did exactly what he thought he was supposed to do which was he is a sales guy.  He's a marketing guy and he went in and optimized the crap out of every one of their businesses.  Every one of their businesses got more efficient.  They got more profitable and they made a ton of money.  So he's been kind of saying for the past five years like what are people talking about.  You know we're making a ton of money.  We're making more money than anybody.  But what he forgot is they're a technology company.  And the thing about being a technology company is the product that you're making all your money on today is not the product you're going to be making your money on in 10 years.  And so you know their their innovation the innovation engine completely dried up over the past decade.  And that's why they are there.  But I will say on Bing just just to mention you know they talked about they're going to sell Bing.  There is no way on earth they will they will get rid of Bing even though it's not profitable even though it's in big trouble.  It gets them in from a some of a profit standpoint.  It brings them so much data so much valuable data on what users are doing and what users are you know interested in and all of that that that is very much part of the future of their business.  And I'm also who would buy Bing at a price and selling it.  I mean I don't know maybe.  I don't know.  Bloomberg is also talking about.

And I think that part of me has to wonder if they keep his name keeps getting mentioned almost because like Microsoft once would be interested.  Not so much because he's really actually considering it.  You know but they keep kind of dropping the name like oh well maybe if this comes out enough you know we can make something work because he would obviously be I think any company that wants to go in another direction.

Transcript:  With the Ford and Microsoft you know doing sync which has been one of Ford's most successful things.  I mean sync is cited as one of the top reasons that people buy Ford cars.  I mean like when they do their surveys it's something like 60 or 75 percent of one of the main reasons that people are buying a Ford car is because of sync.  And it's been tremendously successful and you know that was Microsoft and I mean I think that's kind of the saddest part about Microsoft is as I think Jason was right you know like Balmer did everything that he thought he was going to do.  He's the sales guy and he worked on sales and selling his two big products office and windows and then just didn't keep his eye out for what was coming next.  But behind the scenes because it is this sprawling huge company there have been a lot of people that have been doing really really smart things and doing really amazing innovative things that just hasn't had the chance to.  Productize themselves and you know that's just the stuff we know about who knows about all the stuff that's been happening that we haven't known anything about.  And I mean it.  Left to that's the sad.  Let all those things all left.  Sadly absolutely but they've still got you know I mean I think as far as research goes there a company that does some of the best research and some of the most in depth stuff out of anybody out there you know they do.  They research into all kinds of really interesting areas and they have a social scientist as like a psychologist guy who works at being his name is Matt and I can't remember what his exact title is but basically he studies like user behavior and all kinds of other things and it but he's a fascinating guy and like they're.  They're doing these really weird interesting things it would just be great to see if they could productize it and I don't know it.  I think that the most important thing that happens whenever Microsoft you know chooses their next CEO is that they get away to a certain degree from the windows brand because that's really holding them back I mean it's the most powerful brand but it's also kind of the news around their neck.  Legacy.  Yeah.  It is.  Yeah it is.  They need to make everything Xbox you know I mean put aside the initial you know excuse me you're gonna have to put that apologies put aside the BS around you know the Xbox one of the drama there it is such a powerful brand I mean I would have called it the Xbox phone you know call it like a  like Xbox eight you know point one or whatever like like name everything Xbox because that is a very powerful brand and then that's the most powerful brand they have Xbox search I mean shoot I would literally like rename the company Xbox maybe not go that far but you know what I mean.

This was at the time a huge story.  Google just decided, we're just going to start scanning books and we'll worry about the rights later.  Of course, the publishing industry sued.  Eight years ago, the Authors Guild sued.  And in the U.S. Circuit Court on Thursday morning, Judge Denny Chin said,  hey, it's fair use because it's transformative.  It doesn't harm the market for the original work.  Google Books provides significant public benefits, an essential research tool.  Wow.

But boy, is this the right answer.  In fact, it was Judge Chin who said, I don't think that he actually was very skeptical about this.  Google had made a deal with the publishers in the Authors Guild.  And he said, no, go back to the drawing board.  But I think this is a really important decision.  Now, a lot of authors don't like it.  Scott Turow called Google scanning an indignity and a money grab.  Who pays for the eight years of high-priced litigation?  The Authors Guild, I guess.  Yeah.

But I mean, when you think about as a way to just have stuff saved and archived for historical purposes, you know, down the line, this is great.  I mean, this is a huge opportunity to have books and magazines that would not be flagged as needing to be preserved for the future.  And you have them preserved.  And that's that's amazing.  Or books that have been out of print for years that the authors aren't getting anything from anyway, you know, that people could be able to drive and see information from those books.

Transcript:  So in the end, you know, on the bottom line, I think with the book scanning thing and where the Authors Guild was misguided a bit in the extent to which they pushed this was I have actually bought more books because of Google Books than I've not bought books.  Right there. The fear was if you can look it up on Google and you find that one passage, then you don't need to buy the book.  You won't buy the book and they'll lose book sales.  In fact, the opposite, I think, is is true more often, which is I look something up on Google.  I discover Google Books points me to the fact that there is a passage about that in this book of which it'll give me a certain amount of that book to to look at.  And in many cases, I'll decide, well, that's amazing.  I knew nothing about this book and I'll, you know, buy then buy that book if it's something that I need for for research or out of interest or whatever.  It is certainly caused me to buy more books than it's caused me to not buy books because that title, you know, that information was available online.

Can't we just acknowledge the world has changed and now there is a better way and author?  You know, I have 13 books all out of print.

Transcript:  But the challenge with comparing them to a physical library is there's implicit scarcity in a physical library.  There's only so many kinds of the shelves.  The shelves are so large.  And so you you can't disrupt the market for those commercially viable books by having a library of infinite size.  What Amazon and Google and the other e-book vendors are able to do is actually make a library that does not have a physical limit.  And that creates that creates disruption, whether it's going to be bad for the authors in the long run because they're losing revenue or good because of that discover ability that Jason was talking about is too soon to tell.  But it's not it's certainly not completely dismissible to say they're not they don't have an issue.  They have an issue.  Yes, true.

I mean, the action, you know, having scarcity versus having sort of infinite availability are completely different economic models.  And being in between them is the is the difficult place to be when your economic the economics, especially your economics and your livelihood is based on the one that you're right.

Transcript:  Excellent.  I don't want to diminish the feelings of.  Well, I do want to.  You know, the world is changing and in the benefits.  And I think this is what Jim was saying.  The benefits to society far outweigh the somewhat minor concerns of authors.  This is not going to cost author sales.  And the benefits to society are so huge here that I think that that was the right thing to say.  Now we'll see what happens on appeal.  The Authors Guild plans to spend many more millions of dollars and continue to fight this all the way up to the top.  Another Google story, but not a victory.  It turns out I was surprised to read this, that despite the Apple Maps debacle, according to the Guardian and com score,  Apple iPhone users did not abandon Apple Maps and go to Google Maps in droves.  And in fact, Google Maps, when it lost the iPhone, lost twenty three million mobile users.  Eighty one mobile users at its peak September last year.  It lost twenty three million of them who just said, you know, Apple Maps is good enough.  I'm not going to doubt and Google course took a while for Google to come out with a Google Maps for iOS.

There's incredible power in having the thing that comes up when you press the button.  I mean, what's interesting is that even now there are some deficiencies in Apple Maps that then reasons that people get driven to Google Maps for transit directions, for example.  And that's part of why Apple bought Embark earlier this year is to start and hop stop and hop stop.

Transcript:  The maps is such a hard thing to do because these businesses are changing constantly.  You know, the even Apple will move their store a couple of blocks and I'm sure they know when to change their maps on their store.  But, you know, you know, businesses go small businesses are are cycling in and out.  It's a huge advantage there, right? Because of Google Places, businesses keep their directories up to date and they've got a sales force that's calling business people out there.

That gets users not only updating the maps, updating the routing, updating the traffic, updating the construction.  The traffic is the huge thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they worse now?  So what Google did was you have to be worse.  I would think they'd be better because they're tied to you.  Right.  So you can no longer comment anonymously on YouTube.  You have to have a Google Plus account and comment with your Google Plus account.

Start time: 5313.46
End time: 5315.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Who wants to channel a YouTuber tonight?  I can.  We want to troll, damn it.  We want to troll.  Chad will do it because Chad, the host of this week in YouTube, probably the best person to comment on this.  Chad Johnson.

Start time: 5354.68
End time: 5446.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what happened is YouTube has finally done the thing that they wanted to do, which was link Google Plus profiles with YouTube accounts.  And they delayed that for a long time.  And even if you delayed, like you could still like say, no, I don't want to do it yet.  But it got super annoying.  Like they would they would message you every single day, every single even if you had said like, no, stop bothering me.  They would they would kept asking you.  And so now that these these two services are linked and you have to comment through Google Plus basically.  So basically on YouTube, you have to go.  You don't have to go to another service, but you're using another service to comment now.  And so this will do a few different things.  One, if you're making a comment and you forget to uncheck the little box that says post this to my Google Plus profile, it will automatically post your comment to your profile.  There are some features that it's added, which it added threaded conversations.  So if you have a comment, people can respond and it you now have a much higher limit.  You could only use like 240 characters before.  Now you can you can go crazy with it.  The things that people are upset about is that the algorithm for ranking the comments higher is completely changed.  And so if you have a popular comment, it will always show up at the top for everyone, which means that if you get any any famous person commenting, they're going to be at the top.  And a lot of people feel like that's a form of censorship that no one not everyone is on the same playing field anymore.

Start time: 5448.20
End time: 5483.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can understand being upset because you can't create an anonymous YouTube posting account as easily.  Right. Right. But you have to create a page and has a name and you can still do it.  Use your profile. Yeah. But but it is associated with you.  And that I can understand. But man, it fixed the comments.  You've got to look. I mean, I'm looking at the comments on Windows Weekly, admittedly far fewer.  But every one of them is like a real comment.  There's no fan boy saying, why is the point so old?  Or, you know, it's just there was so much garbage.  So, I mean, OK, yeah, maybe it's the ranking situation isn't as good.

Start time: 5483.60
End time: 5526.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And to be to be honest, the I think most people are upset because the transition was so weird.  It was very abrupt to completely different systems.  They can't talk to each other. So if you had had a comment, the reply button was just gone.  There is no way to respond to those comments.  Also, if you have like spam comments, they're sort of in this weird limbo where you can't remove them  because they're on the old comment system and you don't have any moderation tools for that comment system anymore.  So I feel like a lot of the hate is coming from the transition.  Any video that's uploaded from now on will will have the new common system from the very beginning.  And I feel like it's a better system. Right.  So it is a better system.

So this last Monday's episode, we had I just, you know, she does has a great video.  It's like an eight minute video or six minute video or something that sums up the whole issue and the good and the bad, too.

Start time: 5563.26
End time: 5577.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just want you all to know, in case you haven't heard the news, Google Plus has merged with YouTube.  So if you're trying to leave a comment right now and you can't, it's probably because you haven't linked up your Google Plus account to your YouTube account, thus causing chaos.

Start time: 5577.62
End time: 5605.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like Google Plus is she also has enabled censorship of certain words.  So she mentioned that and you can do that. Yeah.  So now you can whitelist or blacklist or basic blacklist certain words.  And so you can't. So, you know, she mentions, you know, if I don't want you to say blank on my on my channel.  Yeah, she bleeps herself. Then you're not going to say blank on my channel.  And you're noticing, Leo, that you're seeing stuff that people from your circle are people I follow.  So they get they get higher up. Exactly.

Start time: 5606.29

Start time: 5609.42

End time: 5643.26

Transcript:  See now, admittedly, Google Plus isn't the most viral of social networks and has kind of a limited appeal appeals to people like me, but probably less so to, you know, than say Facebook.

Jeremy Hammond says my days of hacking are done.  He's a little bit bitter about it.  He's the anonymous hacker who hacked Stratt for releasing millions of emails related to this private intelligence firm.  He was sentenced on Friday to 10 years in jail plus three years supervised release.  He did plead guilty to account of computer fraud and abuse.  And he says the lengthy prison sentence was a vengeful, spiteful act designed to put a chill on politically motivated hacking.  He also points out that at the same time as he's hacking Stratt for, he kept getting suggestions from another anonymous hacker named Sabu,  who we later found out was a FBI informant.  And Sabu kept saying, oh, you got to hack this nation state.  You got to hack this nation state.  And he even says, I never heard of Stratt for until Sabu brought in another hacker who told me about it.  Practically, I would have never done the Stratt for hack without Sabu's involvement.  And you got to wonder how much entrapment was involved by the FBI on all of this.  You know, they want to get these guys and make examples of them.  They really do.

The difference this time around is there's a lot more you can do with it.  My big beef the first time around was just, there wasn't a whole lot the thing could do.  Now, software wise, they added a lot and then they've also opened it up to some.  It's kind of like Twitter, the first, or sorry, the iPhone, the first time they had a few  partners that they kind of let in and some developers that could do some things.  But next week, they're having their big, they released the Glass SDK and there's going to  be probably a big explosion in third party apps because they're going to let you do a  lot more with it if you're a developer than they were before.  When I was there, I went, actually went to the, in San Francisco, their fitting area  and it was packed.  I mean, it was completely packed.  And I asked the guy, you know, is this normal?  And they said, no, since they released 2.0 and then they gave all of the original Glass  Explorers two invites to send to everybody a couple of weeks ago, they said it's been  massive since then.  But it's still $1,500, right?  It is still $1,500.  I'm not sure who's paying $1,500.  I guess, you know, rich people in San Francisco that don't know, don't have enough things  to do with their money.

Transcript:  Yeah, and what's interesting is they are the only people who have right access to the Instagram API.  And almost no one realizes that. So they signed a deal before, I think it was even before the Facebook acquisition, in that Hussein, they can even upload from the web.  So if you are a famous person and you have an agent and some sort of social media manager and you're part of Hussein,  you can actually upload your own photos complete with your watermarks from a web browser.  You don't even have to use the Instagram app.  And there is no one else who has right access to the Instagram API.

Transcript:  I mean, the fact that the celebrities are on these networks is a huge reason why a lot of people end up browsing the networks.  And there was the rumor, Bloomberg had heard about it.  It actually matched some rumors that I had heard back in August this week that Facebook is looking at making ways for it to be easier for celebrities to talk to their fans directly,  kind of the way that Twitter works.  And that's something that they've had to look at doing because even though celebrities might have a lot more likes on Facebook,  most of them aren't very active on the platform because it's difficult to use the app and use the platform if you have a profile rather than a page rather than a regular user profile.  And so instead you see a lot of famous people using things like Instagram and Twitter and services like that in large part because they can very easily post from apps like Hussein  or because they feel like they can have a more one on one connection.  But Facebook is really going to want to get celebrities more active on the main Facebook channel because that's what ends up bringing lots of users and lots of eyeballs.  And that means lots of potential eyeballs for advertisers.  So giving celebrities an in-house say things like that, maybe more preferential treatment or at least access to the fact that they can put up a watermarked image and other things on the platform is good  because you look at how many likes and comments that some of those Instagram images get.  I mean, that's great stuff to be able to say, OK, we're getting an engagement here that's off the charts of anything else.  So if we're having ads on our stream, that's going to be a much bigger payoff than if it was just my food because no one cares about my food.  But if they care about Sofia Vergara's whatever photo she's taking and posting up of herself.

Transcript:  All right.  I like to end the show with homework because what would be a show without homework?  Your homework is to call your member of Congress and say I support Jay Rockefeller's Consumer Choice in Online Video Act.  If we could get this passed, life would be wonderful.  Jay Rockefeller, who is on the chairs of Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, is trying to get cable companies to unbundle channels,  force them to sell individual channels instead of packages, bar them, cable satellite broadcast and large media companies,  from engaging in anti-competitive practices against online video distributors,  limit the ability of broadband providers to degrade competitive online video services,  don't screw with my Netflix, empower consumers with truth and billing protections for broadband Internet.  I mean, it goes on and on.  This is so good that it's undoubtedly going to fail in Congress.  But if you like the idea, write your Congress critter.  Just say hello.  Remember me from SOPA?  I'm back.  And I want you to support Jay Rockefeller's Consumer Choice in Online Video Act.  So there, that's your assignment.  Hey, thank you so much for being here.  I really appreciate it.

And then on Tech Republic, we do really in-depth long form articles on really important topics like the one I mentioned,  Israel trying to create at the next Silicon Valley was one.

It was a lot of fun.  That's Wednesday's triangulation if you missed it.  And I'd like to get Mark on the show.  I think he's got a very interesting story to tell.  He's quite the visionary.

If your butt isn't numb yet, you're not sitting on these comfortable chairs we've purchased for all of you.  Thank you for being here.  You can watch it live 3 p.m. Pacific Sunday evening, 6 p.m. Eastern Time, 2200, 2300 UTC on Twitter TV.  If you don't get the live version, it's OK.  I mean, I wish you would.  But if you can't watch live, we will put a version with really loud bleep sounds in it.  Never again.  I have to I totally apologize for the deafening bleep tones.  There was an error on the factory floor.  One of the robots who makes this show went amok and apparently amplified the bleep sounds louder than any human can tolerate.  So I've got a new thing now, John, and all the editors.  Instead of bleeping profanity, remember, Christina said one bad word in this whole show.  Just that's OK.  Do what they do in rap videos.  Take it and flip it, reverse it.  So it's backwards.  It'll be just like they listen to Eminem.  It'll be and it'll be the same level.  It won't bother anybody.  In fact, if you're not really paying attention, you don't know what happened.  It's like what?  So that's I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Please keep listening to Twitter.  Even though we deafened you, do whatever you can get a cochlear implant, whatever.  I'm sorry.  Live on demand also at Twitter TV and wherever finer podcasts are made available to you.  Thank you very much for being here.  We'll see you next time.  Another twist.  It's amazing.
