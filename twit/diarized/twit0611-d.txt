Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, we did not come get together to talk about all of this fall to raw we got here to talk about tech  but frankly sometimes with the tech business is fun to talk about novels and  T-shirts and it is to talk about the tech Jason you were at Facebook's developers conference f8 was this week  We talked yesterday to a cheerleader for AR Robert Scoble  Maybe the best known AR cheerleader in the world  He was very excited about what Facebook's planning with its augmented reality. In fact what Facebook said  Was that they were gonna they're introducing a new platform Facebook loves platforms last year  The platform was the bots this year. It's the camera in the Facebook app  He says it will be the first augmented reality  Platform  What does that mean and what do you think

Start time: 488.42
End time: 501.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, and look Mark Zuckerberg even said look, we know we're a little slow on this but we're all in that was it  That's a paraphrase. That's essentially what he said what he should have said is we know we're stealing this all from snapchat, but we're all in

Start time: 502.41
End time: 502.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah

Start time: 503.26
End time: 730.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly. I mean and well, you know to be in to be honest  I thought and I anticipated I said earlier this year  I did an article in February where I said the two biggest moves Facebook could make for its future are AR and  cloud like Amazon AWS stuff, right where they take all they've learned from building data centers and the cloud and  And offer it to the world because Facebook is  Incredible at that stuff. They're the kings of scale. They are the kings of scale  Yes in the same way Amazon is they are they are they could really give Amazon a run for its money in ways that other  Vendors aren't right long term. Anyway, that's not they're not talking about that yet, but AR they did talk about obviously  We didn't go five minutes into the keynote before Mark Zuckerberg was talking about AR  But I do think that I'm kind of a split  mind on this because one of the their CTO and the people there that talked about what they're doing in AR and  They really understand this stuff deeply right? They they understand all the technical parts that you have to do  To make this right and to make it happen and they understand how hard it is and that they have to make it  So it works on a phone. Whereas this stuff is actually just a few years ago  You really almost needed a supercomputer to kind of run it or at least a lot of cloud power  So they get that but then their answer to AR right now is like putting stickers on photos  And so that does not impress me at all. I can  There's a picture I posted on Twitter where I'm sitting there  Took a went to their like AR designer and it basically has this thing that's put stickers all over your face  And so I put that on and I put like the future is here with AR. It's tweeted something, you know  somewhat snarky but  That stuff was I just was not super impressed with that most of the money that's being  Invested in AR and where people where there are big bets our company. Yeah, there you go. You got it  Our people are are making  Are making investments and making bets on AR is the stuff that can really be useful right training  surgeons sharing stuff through surgery even up to down to the sort of consumer level of  You know, you've seen Pokemon go but Pokemon go also, you know was  Service that was getting people to move around it was getting people to make friends. It was getting  It was a great opportunity for places to get more foot traffic  which if you're a retail organization of any kind is the number one thing that you want and so  It's a huge opportunity for Facebook to take advantage of that because they know more about people they know more about events  They know more about  businesses  Than anybody they have more of a you know a  yellow page and white pages kind of listing than anybody but they didn't talk about any of that kind of stuff and either  Either that part is still embryonic and they don't want to maybe play their hand yet  But but I was not impressed with them just showing like look we're gonna let you put stickers  We're gonna let you take this  Selfie and you can fill the room up with balls behind you within, you know virtual  Balls to fill up the room or fill up the room with water and  Yeah, that's I've didn't impress me much at all  So I kind of think that they're this shows that they're really really early in this  They wanted to do something that was a little bit flashy and looked good in a in a keynote or a demo  But I wonder how ready or serious they are about the things that about with AR that are gonna really make a difference

Start time: 731.18
End time: 758.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that are worth getting excited about serenity, of course Apple is supposedly and I know Tim Cook said this numerous times  Also all in on AR. I mean the only company really doing AR right now  I guess is Microsoft with the HoloLens and then there's smaller companies  We actually had one on yesterday on the new screensavers demoing similar stuff  But but we don't really know what Apple's up to because Apple's so secretive. Do you think this is the year of Apple and AR?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Am still hesitant on whether or not Apple's AR  Project is going to come to fruition this year or if it's more of a long, you know a long game  I I mean, I think it makes sense for pretty much any company who is interested in doing technology to to focus on  augmented reality and  just in general finding a way to make the  layer between  Real real life and what we can do with the internet more seamless, right where it's a  the the watch and wearable technology is one step of this and  AR is the sort of the next step is like how do we allow people to interface with their tech and also still  exist in the real world  and that you know, of course brings up all kinds of ethical questions in terms of you know, like is it okay if I'm  Pretending to look at you, but my contacts are secretly showing me emails  Like there's societal questions to be asked, but we already we already do that. It's just a lot more obvious now  It's you know, if I'm ignoring you to read Twitter, it just it looks like this  Yeah, you can kind of tell in fact you could tell even if you can't see somebody, you know

Start time: 831.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Go ahead. I'm sorry. I mean interrupt. Oh, no. No, I I was just gonna say I just don't see  Anyone have coming up with the the right solution short of Elon Musk talking about his you know plan to put chips and brains  There's really not a good wearable solution right now  For AR and I think that Apple has to conquer that and conquer the technology problem  I mean the HoloLens is a great idea in theory, but that's again the HoloLens is still pretty much a prototype phase, right?  It's not you know, it's it's not something where you're like, yes  This is here. The future is existing and in a compact way that I can take wherever I go  And and until we get that down we have you know, we have failed attempts like Google Glass  So I don't I don't see Apple coming out with AR until they're absolutely ready for to have the right product

Transcript:  Can we just could just stop for a second again with all this junk?  I mean Jason you sat there that I love you man, but that was a long soliloquy of  Potential great escapes to get back to this is still junk and it doesn't matter  I mean you said all the potential great things in the world  But until we can do that until you can show me that functionality, this is basically I'm just trying to be snapchat  I'm trying to have some cookie cutter filters and some Moki on a lot of cha-tay's and a shark coming up on a table and who  Gives a who and or any it's cute fuzzy stuff  The only thing I appreciate about this stuff is that it pushes technology forward so that maybe in 30 years we can actually have  Some futuristic wearables and wait a minute AR that matters  I mean come on like you're you got a cat on your face, and that's the coolest thing we do look watch

Start time: 1006.40
End time: 1116.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alright I have two different takes on this on the one hand it does feel like all I mean Facebook is is like the old  Microsoft you know predatory monopoly when when when they were threatened by  When they were threatened by Instagram they bought them for a billion dollars when they were threatened by whatsapp a messaging app they bought them for  24 billion dollars they tried to buy snapchat  They couldn't buy snapchat and so what are they doing their response just like Microsoft is well  then we'll put all of the features of snapchat in messenger and  and Instagram and  Kill them and eat them alive and so that's the cynical point of view and so this big announcement on AR is you know?  Not really that it's just you know a cover-up icing on the cake of let's clobber snapchat  I also would say if you're as long as I'm gonna be in the negative side, and I'll do the positive  But I would also say if you're a developer at this point  To trust Facebook as a platform. That's a shaky ass platform  I mean how many people built games for Facebook and then got clobbered how many people built bots for Facebook?  Oh, bots aren't the new thing now. It's  Filters I would be very nervous about going all in I mean Facebook's where all the people are so people are gonna do it  But look at all the publishers who have abandoned instant articles  Now that we've learned the Guardian has joined the New York Times and said we're not gonna publish to Facebook's instant articles anymore  Because it's there's no way to monetize it Facebook's not sharing their revenue  I feel like so that's the negative on the positive side. I do feel like  Augmented reality is going to be a lot world-changing technology and a lot of times when technologies are new  They are you know the the game room they are silly they are  Trivial they look a little terrible. Yeah, and they look and they don't work very well because they're brand new

Start time: 1125.50
End time: 1138.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What evs  Yeah  And so Apple I think is probably watching this very closely I would guess and saying alright  Well, let's not let's let's see what the reaction is to what mark announced

Start time: 1139.38
End time: 1172.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think the challenge is like I just would have liked to see some vision from them of like here's our vision of what?  AR is gonna do right if Apple does it that's what we're gonna  See they're gonna hold the big shiny thing up and say like this is the amazing  World-changing thing that our thing is gonna do right and some of it will be based on  Fiction some of it will be based on smoke and mirrors, but they'll  Show us something right I think Facebook was like AR is gonna change the world and here's stickers  You know I just it was part of it is the part of it is the limit the limitation of the hardware right now

Start time: 1172.82
End time: 1185.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean I I suspect if Apple doesn't add something this year Serena it will be  Based on the phone new iPhone and the camera it'll be it'll end up being very much like what snapchat and Facebook are doing

End time: 1300.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have faith that they will tell a better story about it  I'm saying that that we did not tell a better better a very good story about what this thing is yet  Catface does not is not a good story to me and all of the stickers and stuff was not a good story  It was just like we're a ripoff of snapchat and by the way, you know  They kind of already rolled this out on Instagram, you know months ago and Instagram's been doing great fight in snapchat  And so it felt like okay, you know, we know that none of you, you know over 30 people are into either of those apps  So guess what? We're gonna deliver it to you too on Facebook on our big app  So but that did not feel like a real great AR vision now  They're chief scientists to to to on day two where they do their sort of big vision thing  their their chief scientists came out and and  Poured a lot of cold water on this and said look  For there to be affordable glasses that aren't putting a computer on your face where they just look like glasses  Where they you know have storage their high res they you know have great imagery. He's like it's at least five years  We're not gonna see really good hardware AR glasses for at least five years. Well, that's what Microsoft says they say 20

Transcript:  Not next year, but the year after 2019  When we had yesterday on the new screensavers we had meta vision on they have a developer edition  That's a third the cost of HoloLens and they even though that's pretty mature and I like it  It's full. It's 90 degree view instead of 45 degree view. You're not looking through a mail slot  They say it's a couple three maybe more years off so this this but but this is I have to I also let me be  positive  Because sir, we're we're we've been in a let's face a little bit of a doldrum for the last few years technology  You know that the smartphone is is as good as it's really let's be honest gonna get it's fins from now on and chrome bumpers  It's some you know, it's something to get people buying. Yeah, but it's not gonna be a big because it's good  It's peak it's it's good. It's done PC's ditto  Technology we're at a plateau and so I think as a technology buff and  Maybe even as a journalist maybe more as a buff  I'm excited about what what how machine learning and an augmented reality are gonna I think in the next five years change things  They are gonna get us out of this doldrums. Absolutely and you can already see

Start time: 1377.16
End time: 1433.26

Transcript:  Agree you can already see that happening  With the VR sets that have been coming out over the last couple years, you know  The HTC five the PlayStation VR the oculus rift  None of those are at the point where you're gonna get Joe Schmo walking in and buying them off the street and being like  Oh, wow. I love I love my VR heads that they're still wired. They're heavy  But they have the promise and the potential right where it's I think everybody on this call has probably tried one  Or two and like there are just some there's a there's a game called super hot on the HTC Vive  that completely  Mind-bends the idea of like what a what a first-person shooter can look like  It plays with time and movement and it's like that  Those are the kind of games and the kind of simulations that get me excited about like oh  People are actually kind of peering into the window. I'm gonna play that super hot  Super hot. Oh, it's so much fun. Super hot. Yeah super

Transcript:  as I sound negative I I did end as saying as I like the fact that this is going to push technology forward and we're  Going to get things out of this and the same thing with  The PlayStation or VR. Yeah, it's cool to be in that realm. But at the same time  When you're in it for a long period of time, it's just different than just playing a video game and just playing it the regular way  You're playing it. I mean you're already in an immersive world as it were  Not around your face and you're not disconnected I mean we're we're sitting in a chair  You can't really move around and yes, there's some place there's gonna be systems where you can run through a foam obstacle thing  And and that's cool  but again just  progressing the technology for but as far as like looking at like when Facebook's like had the little  Stations where people look like cartoons like oh, so we're gonna do second life on my Facebook now and I'm

Transcript:  The thing that really annoys me about Facebook's  Announcements is that there are things that you could very clearly showcase as  Here's where we think it's going to go and also here's a platform  like one of the things that I really think will change with AR and VR in the next five ten years is learning and  education especially in places where like I mean  Obviously no kid in Africa is gonna be able to get a $1,700 computer and a Oculus VR  But as those things go down in price, I could definitely see, you know  Your community library right having a headset and you can go on it for like a couple hours and like learn these  Specific very hyper specific skills, right? The the concept of going to college or or even med school, right?  learning classes about  Neurology and actually being able to go  virtually inside the brain and like pull it apart and  Converse with other people around that and being able to like physically move these models like these are all  Amazing aspects and it's one of the reasons why Microsoft's HoloLens pitch  It felt a lot more solid is it's like yeah, okay, you can play Minecraft in AR  But also let's talk about how it's actually gonna change people's lives and and like you said Jason like that's what I think  Where where Apple is really strong is not only did they tell a better story?  But I do think that they're genuinely committed, you know, maybe not with the iPhone  Because it's the you know, it's the consumer product  But you look at the you look at the iPad Pro and the stories they're starting to tell there  But specifically like the Apple watch all of the investment that they've put into the health and research team  Like they're not just doing that. That's not the kind of stuff that that makes like everyday money  That's the kind of stuff that genuinely can can hugely affect somebody's life and maybe make a little bit money while you're at it  But but studies like studies are studies how we move, you know the the human race forward  They're not how you you know come out with bundles of cash

Start time: 2394.10
End time: 2406.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay, so from what I understand it's very it's just very similar to what Apple currently has put into messages  Which is if you put a link in it'll expand it so you can actually play it from Oh

Start time: 2408.10
End time: 2414.88

Start time: 2414.90
End time: 2447.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I think I think Apple might have the the monopoly on that with Siri like they might get pretty pretty angry about that  No, I I think that it's just going to be basically widgets  So it's like the like the Spotify widget or the Apple music widget if you're planning say let's I'm like Leo  You know what you've got to hear this amazing song by the who hears this song  You know, it's called the seeker. Have you heard of it?  And then it allows you to or have you actually heard it you can just play it from so I get it

Start time: 2447.48
End time: 2467.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it so and I should have been I should have read this more carefully or watch the conversation more carefully  This isn't a bot. I thought it was gonna be like an Apple music bot or a Spotify bot where you talk to it  It's what they call chat extensions and I think you I think you nailed it  It's just like in the Apple in Apple's messages. Okay, he gives you the bot stuff

Start time: 2467.88
End time: 2557.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They are doing some cool stuff with the bots though to give them credit and I talked to a couple developers  I have a video on this on Tech Republic  With a couple developers who help people develop  shopping bots and they said these two developers talked about the fact that  They they work for on all the big platforms for bots and they said Facebook is really ahead of  The other ones that they work with in terms of the technology they've enabled the API's and all of that and they developed  This bot for example that went that launched the day that they announced this  With with a retailer route 21 and this is a shopping bot where you like have a picture and you say look  I want to get a dress like this. For example, they the demo that these guys showed me was a  Okay, and so um, so yeah, but you can you can show the demo if you want but it does it is one of those things  Where you can essentially text your friends and say look I'm thinking about this dress or this dress or this dress  Vote and so  Then your friends can vote on which one send it back to you, right?  And then the bot can say can go out and find you know with the places that you can buy that and then can also  Suggest accessories that you know might go with it and that kind of thing. So it's it's a fashion advisor or  You know that kind of thing that makes sense that

Start time: 2558.70
End time: 2563.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know that because then it's social and it's not the bot is a part of a larger conversation

Start time: 2564.90
End time: 2577.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, the bots like filling in the gaps for you  The bots not you're not talking to the bot the bots like doing the the hard stuff to where you're not like  Having to jump into URLs and paste them and all of that kind of stuff that makes a lot more sense because I

Start time: 2578.68
End time: 2610.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it's a bot to help you buy something is so much less efficient than just going to website and clicking a link  That I don't understand the value of it  I thought maybe they're trying to get Millennials because Millennials are more comfortable with using chat apps  You know, they live in snapchat or Facebook hopes messenger and so that was a better interface for them  It's not that it's it's still social. It's just chatting with other people  But the bot is at least at this spot and no I would guess any well-designed bot is contributing to the conversation between humans

Start time: 2613.44
End time: 2627.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Bits yeah, sorry good. So so what is Apple doing here? Because I know Spotify has a free service  So when somebody sends me a song I  Music and I can listen to the song on Spotify Apple doesn't have that. So what are they gonna get like a snippet?

Transcript:  Yeah, you're gonna know in 90 seconds. Yeah, you know, it's not I mean sometimes it's just about you just want to hear the song, right?

Transcript:  Okay, what else let's wrap up f8. Oh, you know and this is on a more serious note, of course  About the worst thing that could happen to a brand had just happened to Facebook. It happened actually as we were doing twit last week the  Facebook killer just how Facebook would love you to brand this  very sad story  Wasn't live video on on Facebook, but a guy posted a murder he committed  and then  Posted a live video talking about it. Of course, he was apprehended it occurred in what occurred in Cleveland and he was apprehended  Later but the timeline Facebook's released the timeline of this and they've gotten some heat about I don't see how Facebook's  prevents this right  But they've gotten some heat about the timing. So the video was uploaded at 1109 a.m. And  not reported  Maybe he didn't have a lot of followers a couple of minutes later  He did another video first video was saying I'm gonna kill somebody second video was him killing somebody horrible  Then an 11 minutes after that he did a Facebook live stream for five minutes saying I did it  Still not reported the first report according to Facebook was 1127  so 20 minutes later and  I'm sorry  The live videos reported shortly after the video of the shooting wasn't reported till almost one in the afternoon  so almost two hours later and  Then then 23 minutes later Facebook disables the account and pulls down the videos I  Have to say given the scale of what Facebook's up to that doesn't seem unreasonable. It does it to you. I

Start time: 2947.80
End time: 2981.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Instantly was angry and then I was like stop it because no matter what your knee-jerk reaction is you should do better than that  but then again, I think to myself again the same thing is how many people are following him and  How many people even thought that this wasn't real right? That's the other issue because I have people you know  Somebody sent me a video Taliban thing and I was like that's not real. That's fake  Stop sending that around to people so you don't really know what's going on per se and so I  Fully am understanding and the process in the time period that that went on and also everybody's vulnerable to this Google is

Start time: 2991.18
End time: 3019.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And to be honest the small group of friends or family whoever he had  Might not are you gonna realize to report because most people don't ever report a video ever right sometimes when you ask somebody  To report a video that how do you do that? Where do I got to go to report it?

I tend to use Lyft more  But I always talk to the drivers and I ask them like how long have you been driving?  You know how much money you make is it you know, do you do this full-time you do it part-time?  And just kind of ask them about it  It's sort of I've been fascinated by the whole thing because it's it is interesting the whole  The way it is changed the the economics of this both for for people who are getting rides and you know  Given this new opportunity for some other people  Who you know find that this is one of the options that they have now that they didn't have before and ultimately that can  Be a good thing a lot of them talk very positively  About it  with obviously  Clear exceptions they don't they don't want to badmouth that they don't want to take it back to the company  So they're not they're kind of incented not to air their dirty laundry  But some of them some of them are just more candid people than others and so I wonder

No, that's there's different levels to how you feel and associate with the product, okay  So when you say they have mistakes, no fewer jit.

I believe before they got bought up by by Samsung and Viv's  Viv's  overall idea of basically we are making a  Assistant that actually learns and can basically write rudimentary programs  Itself as it learns how these pathways connects together sounds a little bit, you know Skynet  But also they have a really really interesting over arcing plan in terms of integrating with everything and I can imagine  Samsung being like well we see the potential in this and  We need the time to actually layer it up because as we can see with Bixby, you know  Launching a voice assistant from scratch is not the easiest thing.

Transcript:  There's a lot I like about this. I was at the launch event too  I you know was really impressed for it with it when I saw it there  I just think the thing my biggest complaint with it was what you guys already touched on the the irate the  Fingerprint scanner doesn't work. The iris scanner also is kind of lame  Those were big disappointments. The only thing I was really impressed with was the  Iris scanner also was kind of lame  Those were big disappointments. The only other beef the biggest thing that I problem I had with it is  Samsung is still trying to duplicate all these services that Google already does well and  It's just a no-win solution for them  I'd rather see them take Bixby and do something like there's bits of it that are interesting some augmented reality  Stuff that really Google has not worked on for a while where you take pictures of  Products and images and places and and it's gonna you know give you  Some augmented reality kind of information on it great  Go ahead and work on that find other things that Samsung can do uniquely well make it work with televisions  You know their televisions, maybe even other televisions. I don't know  You know like they've done in the past what they've talked to the CIA about that. I think they figured that out

Transcript:  Would you that be cash or credit? What is big speed saying?  Anyway, I do think it's a great phone  It's interesting that Samsung stumbled with such basic things as Bixby and this fingerprint reader, but it is a gorgeous screen  What I really think is oh and you're not gonna feel bad for too long. This is a forbearer of things to come  Apple's iPhone is gonna have a you know giant  Dream screen and it's gonna be OLED. I think that's pretty clear. They're buying a hundred million screens from Samsung  It's gonna be hard to get that that'll be the top of the line  New Apple iPhone according to all the rumors Mark German had a great row  roll-up of all the rumors in  Bloomberg this week  And so I what my take on this is I feel bad for Google because the pixel is the best Android phone  But it's but ugly next to this.

Where Samsung has finally kind of the punch?  We're now Samsung's releasing the phone and probably every phone after this is gonna look at that even though Apple's already been working on it  Obviously, they're not copying Samsung, but they've been working on something similar  But the fact that Samsung got to the market first with something like this  I don't know that I don't know they're not copying Samsung

Transcript:  Know I what I was gonna say is that you know that like all of these companies have been working on edge-to-edge  Designs for at least three four years because it's come out of no way. Oh, yeah  No, exactly  But the the big thing is and I mean that's this is the big compromise in the SA right where the fingerprint sensor and their  You know pseudo home button. It isn't ideal  It isn't ideal in in the least in you know in any sense  But unfortunately because fingerprint sensors have you know, they use camera based technology and there's only so much room that you can put  Camera sensors in the phone. They're like, oh, we'll kill two birds with one stone  And we'll have like a whole little camera unit then also has the fingerprint sensor  I honestly think that the main reason why Apple didn't do it with the with the 7 is that they basically were like well  If we did this we would have to compromise and put the fingerprint sensor, you know in a in an less than ideal place  I mean, we've seen the potential schematics

I'm worse it into something like artificial sweat. This is the funny part. We use fake human sweat  We want to mimic actually use conditions, but we're not gonna go around collecting sweat from our employees  Our lab was like well we can do this a lot better if we just make our own sweat  And so every day they make up a new batch of sweat and there's one guy in our lab

End time: 4963.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I can actually respect their day videos because they finally did something that I  Harp about all the time when Apple says all the great things they do for the world  They're going to start using recyclables instead of destroying the planet to get a say no more mining no more mining

Start time: 4964.06
End time: 5045.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I love it. I mean that is a long-term goal for them  But I mean they've been they have been working towards it for a very long time like it's this is not just something  We're out of the blue. They're like, you know what guys now we're gonna start being  Responsible like Apple has been on this track for about 20 years  And I mean you can see it in all of the things that they've done pretty much since 1999 onward  But this is a I think a much more  Public stand. I mean Lisa Jackson was on John Gruber staring fireball this weekend  Lisa Jackson who's of course those SVP of the environmental technologies and  I mean the fact that they're willing to talk so publicly about this not only  What their plans are in the future, which is a very un Apple thing  But also let's tell you all of the ways that we're doing this  to me shows that Apple's committed not only to making this for their own products, but kind of being a  Being a guiding post right for the rest of the technology world basically saying hey guys  like we know that you don't like us because  We you know we we make our products so that they're you know, not necessarily user repairable  But we have a reason for that and we're going to try and still use all of those parts and make sure  That those parts don't end up in a landfill somewhere Apple can obviously control

Start time: 5045.76
End time: 5104.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's you know Foxconn the people assembling the phone  But it's been notoriously difficult for them to to control the supply chain  And so there are parts in all smartphones that use  Rare and exotic minerals that are mined by children in the Congo for instance so  And and Apple's to their credit done everything they can I know to go to up that supply chain and make sure that  Everything's done as responsibly as possible, but there's only so much they can control  So I think this is and it's the right thing to do  I mean I have to say I'm it is the trend among not just Apple  But all of these phones these you know Apple's phones aren't  Recyclable by any normal recycler nor is this s8. I mean  They're glued together. Everything's very tightly. You can't just grind it up and burn it  You really need as Apple did it built a robot Liam to disassemble its iPhone  I doubt Liam's in widespread use but that illustrated how difficult it would be to recycle it stuff

Start time: 5104.24
End time: 5138.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So I don't I don't want to do this. I don't want to sound like it's an apple just an apple thing  It is a multi-corporate  thing and I just appreciate them coming out and saying it out loud and more forward because at the same time  There's still a company that does what they do when how they need to do it and get it done  So for 20 years of them being you know recyclable and then they're mr. The things are less  Taking a it's I like the fact that they've actually made this statement and they're moving forward in a more aggressive manner  Than the ho-hum hey, we're trying to save the earth approach today slide on the radar

Start time: 5141.14
End time: 5214.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, as long as they're genuinely gonna do this I agree yeah, yeah if they do it'll put pressure on others right to do this  Exactly that that's what we've that's an insane. We we did an award-winning story in  2014 on  We had people on the ground in Democratic Republic of Congo that looked at you know, what was really happening and  Beyond that was when the story was kind of hot with conflict minerals and looked at the real consequences  human consequences to you know  The ways that these things are not only mined but also recycled because a lot of the stuff gets sent  back there and and burned and chipped and and  You know separated and all of that and the human consequences are  Are real and that story becomes a lot  Closer to home when you understand that and you understand that these things that I buy, you know end up  You know harming up people  With you know in consequences that have consequences that you never intended and so, you know hats off to them  It's overdue not just for them, but for the industry and it is good to see them taking a leadership position  And I think it will affect others

Start time: 5215.06
End time: 5278.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  again like  That's the best part of it is that they're gonna put pressure on other companies again coming out and be more public about it  Because I understand they have to have these materials they have to come from somewhere  But as they progress to making especially Apple leading the way of making their devices  Unswappable unchangeable you can't swap out batteries  You can't swap out and put an SD card in it  Like Apple products are starting to have like a one-and-done shelf life and they do have a lot of place you could drop stuff  Best buy visa V or something like that  But again a lot of things don't end up in the places that they need to be to get recycled  so then making a statement just puts more force on other people and  That is something I'm really excited about because it's something we always look over. Oh solar is the next best thing  Where are they getting all the materials for the solar panels again? Oh  Yeah, yeah, they're blowing up holes in the ground and  Disturbing water and lakes and streams, but it's cool. We need to solar because we're all about clean energy  So I mean it's always a tip for tat as far as the planet's concerned. So any effort is a great effort to me

I'm not sure exactly  Well, they say optical sensors. It apparently shines a light through the skin  and then measures the way that

Transcript:  Yes, the same way that the Apple heart rate sensor sensor works  It's currently this the heart rate sensor uses oximeter technology, which is the same thing as  Fitbit most the others and the glucose monitoring system would be something somewhat similar  I'm not surprised at all by this  especially again going back to the thing where like Apple's main like core passions when it comes to human interest are  the environment  and  Learning like teaching and health and health especially  I mean, no, I don't I don't want to say the catalyst was Steve jobs getting sick or anything like that  But I do think that it's it's something that's a big part of Tim Cook's Apple and something that he cares very deeply about  And that jobs certainly cared very much about  and I would not be surprised if the Holy Grail for treating diabetes was one tier of  What eventually became the Apple watch?

Transcript:  Never make a fingerprint dongle that is ridiculous  Yeah, this is someone who's like alright, let's run with this crazy rumor because it's insane  Let me talk about this for a sec cuz I think it's it's it's absolutely silly  Like of course Apple Apple has probably been testing a fingerprint sensor on the rear casing for again two years  Probably since they started developing an OLED option for their iPhone right and an edge-to-edge  Because you cannot do edge-to-edge screen technology with the current generation finger sensor  It's just it's it's gonna be very very difficult  And there's only so much room in which to put some you know put all of this technology  While improving the camera while improving the screen, you know adding wide color and the p3 color gamut and all of this nonsense  like there's a there's  You got to pick and choose your battles. So I believe that Apple is currently weighing like, okay  do we you know, do we try and  You know  We can't get a hundred percent QA on fingerprints that sir on the front and we may have some problems  Or do we go with do we have to compromise and put the fingerprint sensor on the back for a year?  When we go to this edge-to-edge display, so I'm not surprised that we're seeing these these different  These different models come up I'm sure they've been around in testing for a while  I just said the real question is are they going to actually ship one or the other of these like we're not really gonna know  Until we get much much closer.

I'm sure they tried lots of different ways. I  obviously  Based on the patents and stuff. They filed they would love to keep it on the front not make there be let there be any  Sort of obvious circle or anything  Maybe you have a place similar to where the fingerprint sensor is now  But you know that you put your finger there or maybe you know something lights up and shows you to put your finger there when you  When you put your finger over it or something  I think that that's the ideal for them based on the patents they filed but it may not be technologically  possible yet and so I think I think so on these theories a good one they may have to have a bridge between  Where they'd like to be and you know the fact that they're probably gonna go to this bezel list display similar to the s8  And it may have to go on the back  If they do I hope they put it in the middle like Google has done and not to the side of the camera like the s8

Transcript:  I'm amused by the deck on that that article where it's like Google plans to strip out bad ads  and as as someone whose site uses Google ads from time to time and we have been  Absolutely smothered with these awful Google ads that hijack the browser and try and like send you to app store stuff  Like that that amuses me. I'm like Google fix your own darn ad problem before you try and well destroy  Other ads I would submit in Google's defense that this is exactly what Google's doing

Start time: 6274.26
End time: 6370.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've tried a number of things because you know  The worst-case scenario for Google is that everybody starts using ad blockers and nobody sees ads Google's been doing that  Nobody sees ads Google's or anybody else's and then by the way, that's a bad thing for iMore and for Tech Republic and a lot of sites  That rely on banner ads  That's how you monetize the site and if more and more people and i'm sure the trend is are using ad blockers  Google's got to do something  They started amp the amp initiative for mobile the idea being that amp would  Make pages load much more quickly on mobile. They got a lot of publishers to use it  It still has ads but it has much more limited ads javascript is very much constrained. You can't have audio  I mean, there's a lot of things and that's I think kind of what they're doing here. They say they will block  offensive ads ads that  Have pop-ups or auto playing video or what we call pre-stitial ads, which you have to watch before you can see  The content so we don't know the details yet of what google will or will not block  But I think this makes sense if you're google  Better to do this  then  Then go to a world where every ad is blocked better to at least meet users halfway and what you know, I use a browser  Called brave which is based on google's chrome browser that has a contribute button in it  And what you do is you turn it on you set up an automatic payment into an account and then brave  Blocks all ads but pays out publishers who sign up to so that they make up the difference, right?  I'm in effect paying for an ad free internet. I think that's a really good solution

I think this is really interesting  Uh, I really I really like this idea  This is the kind of thing google should do and incidentally brave is around because google open sources its browser chromium  Open source, so this is just a fork of chromium. So it's using the the chromium blink engine and all of that  So it works well  The only thing I don't like about brave and it works on all platforms is uh, it's a little a little ugly. It's not super elegant  but uh  Hey, you know what built in last pass and built in ad blocking that sounds pretty good to me

Transcript:  I think the google thing is you the thing about google is google owns double click, right? Which is one of the biggest ad brokers, right?  ad platforms  um on  Yeah in the world and so I bought it a number of years ago  It kind of runs in the background. So it's not that google's gonna block like this is not gonna touch ad words at all  um  But it could they could hurt themselves right with ad block. I assume  I assume you have to assume anything that runs on  Their sites is is not going to get blocked that runs on their platform is not going to get blocked  Um, but it is an interesting  Uh, it is an interesting thought experiment because I I I sort of have my doubts about this  I saw this story too and I just kind of can't see them doing it  But google also does some strange things that you wouldn't expect sometimes build hold fiber networks and spend billions of dollars and then realize  This is just too expensive  um, you know, so you just kind of never know with them they they uh,  They go out there and try weird things, but I can't see I just can't  I just have my doubts about this if they even if they do this  Um how effective they'll be at it because they're gonna come across as hypocritical  um, they're gonna have to try to let their own stuff through to keep making money because  This is where so much of their revenue, you know comes from they have not found  They have not found another trick yet, you know to making money other than um than ads and so  I just don't I don't know if they even if they do do this  I don't know how good it's gonna be or how much of a difference it'll make

Start time: 6569.02
End time: 6591.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it just depends on how much pressure they're under in a way  I mean, I think if they I mean they know better than anybody how how many ads are being blocked  I mean the other other alternative do you do this?  Do you guys do this is to have a pop-up that says hey, I see you're using an ad blocker  Can you knock it off or would you like to give us money or?  Sometimes they even prevent you from visiting the site

Start time: 6592.28
End time: 6623.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right you we we don't do that, but we do replace it with our own sort of in-house text ads  We don't make all of our money off of you know, tech republic doesn't you know make um, you have another business  It's money on display ads. We have other lines of business  So we have our own sort of matchmaking service between you know enterprise vendors and enterprise users  And so that's smart if they if they block the ad then we just surface our little in-house kind of texty ads  Or which are more kind of like google ad because they're first party ads so they can't be right, right

Yeah, exactly. But we're also I mean we're we're testing with the idea of you know, people who are  You know already members of our site  You know removing some of the ads or giving them a better experience as an incentive to you know, become part of our community  Uh, so because the site really is the new and especially the new design.

Here comes some ads, but you see this part of it is this load time  These ads are still loading  Uh, it really makes a difference in the over now.

Transcript:  All these big sites, you know like us we've looked at this for years too, right all big sites and small sites and publishers of all  Kinds have looked at this idea. You know you look and you see what is the average cost?  Uh the average that we get the average revenue we get per user, right and if it's whatever you just take your  Thing and round it up, you know by five ten percent and you know you till it comes to an even number  And you say great we can just maybe we'll just offer a pro subscription  that says just pay us that you know a year and uh  Away you go and that number tends not to be especially have sites that have millions of users  that number is not that big and uh, it it'll be an interesting test over the next few years to see how many sites  Actually do that right offer this sort of paid tier where you can say you do this you see no ads  You know you get an ad free experience. It's going to be much faster. Maybe we'll even throw in a few  incentives extra things and um, you know will users  Want to pay  For stuff they could get for free somewhere else  Um and see some ads that's the question told us no I like this right

Transcript:  I like this contributor thing  I'm the kind of guy who feels guilty about running an ad blocker but wants to run an ad blocker  Give me a way to gives the site some money if everybody's happy i'm much happier  But you're right. I don't know if the majority would do that  Yeah, you're right history tells us no  hot take  I think you could skip this ad  Actually, you could you know, I mean one of the problems with podcasts is we can't guarantee that the ad is I shouldn't say this out loud  but  I think advertisers aren't dumb. I mean  Just like a newspaper if you're reading a newspaper, there's no promise that somebody's going to see your ad it's there  But they're going to they may go right by it. They may not even open that page same thing with a podcast or any tv show

This is an ad for a company that we use we like we've known for years  And we think some of you would like and what we try to do with the ads is tell you about a product  That you might think is useful like drobo drobo drobo data. It started with the the founder started it  He had a hard drive crash. He had a raid array, right? Everybody was using raid  And it but it failed and he said well wait, I thought I was I thought I was protected  So he said I want to make a better redundant story storage solution  Drobo stands for data. What was it data robot? I think is what it stood for  They invented a new kind of raid called beyond raid  Which has a lot of benefits including the ability to mix  Drive sizes in one drobo giving so I do that all the time  You know, I put in whatever hard drives I have lying around in my drobo  I have a couple of drobos. I have the drobo mini at home and I have a five in and so  But when when the starts to fill up I take I just it tells you it's got these great lights on the front  Tells you exactly what's going on. One of them goes orange because it's running out of room. No problem  I get I don't even have to turn it off  I just get a bigger drive put it in and i've increased the capacity because you don't have to match the sizes  Plus they've got a variety of different ways to back, you know have redundant data  So you you really are backed up. They've got battery backed cache  So if the power goes out, you don't have to worry it prevents write failure or data corruption  Couldn't be easier to use these panels on the front. They're magnetically attached. No screwdriver needed  You add a drive without a screwdriver you slide it in  It's so easy to do the status lights tell you exactly what's going on rebuilding getting low  drive failed whatever  They've just introduced a new drobo. You see this one the 5n  Two it's the next era of simplified network attached storage for your connected home or small office high performance upgraded processor  They do port bonding which means if you have multiple internet service providers  You can bond their data together to give you higher speed connection and on the back not one gigabit two gigabit  Ethernet ports so you put one in each port two different providers. You've got incredible throughput  SSD compatibility they have an msata accelerator bay. I use the msata accelerator bay  to  To speed up writes. It's really fantastic. Of course secure backup remote data access and sharing  Disaster recovery, I mean true peace of mind and the drobo apps are available for the 5n2  They're really taking advantage of the new processor drobo pixel gives you photo backup plex. Yes  They've got cloud apps for backup and data syncing  Developer tools for programs and websites. You could put a full lamp stack on there node.js.

Transcript:  I like to do that. It's fun. It does remind me though of you just one more thing on the conversation  We we were just finishing on um on advertising  Yes, the thing is, you know the old joke in advertising is that um, I know 50% of my advertising doesn't work  I just don't know which 50 it is right and so that's why they  It's why they have to do what they do and spend so much money. Those days are gonna end soon  We are becoming part of a world where um, you know  We are be able to measure and manage everything like even your show even audio ads is gonna  Yep, mike there's gonna come some service that's gonna use a percentage or something and they're gonna be able to tell every one of your  Advertisers here's the percentage of people who listen to your ad or acted upon it  They'll do some omni channel thing where they'll connect buyers  And their habits and then your advertisers will come to you and they'll say something like oh well now we  We have to be we're gonna advertise with you  But we have to be the first ad in the show because we've we see that that has 27 more likelihood  Of a purchase transaction and so then you're gonna have to start saying oh  We're gonna charge you more if you want to be the first one  In the slot, that's a higher premium or whatever, but it's gonna be all based on data  And so this world is changing considerably and I do think that um some of what we're seeing  With ad blockers and those things that sort of this very it's what's driving this is because there's all this  That's high volume low value inventory  On the web and it's driven by the fact that people just you know  Uh shove out as many impressions of everything as they can because they can't measure well  And they don't know and they don't have sophisticated tools  but I I that is destined to change as the web changes as big data changes as  We become smarter about those things and just pure scale will matter less and less and so  Um, that's a little bit optimistic view  But it there's going to be less value around just blasting out this message to so many people and a lot more value in  I'm interested in people who are you know  Interested in these four things.

Transcript:  So you have yeah, yeah, but let me tell you that  I mean again, it's a little inside baseball, but that's a very imperfect system  We only do that because advertisers want to do that and a lot of times they want to break it up by show  And the problem is that most people just do twit  Because they know it's twit and they don't matter quickly. I don't know and and so a lot of times advertisers  We'll usually talk them out of this but they might have a variety of strange offer codes  Because they're remember draft when draft kings would advertise an nfl football, but that doesn't work every ad had a different offer code  Clearly they were trying to figure out well, you see the 1210 ad or the 1230

Start time: 7388.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Don't be but this is gonna work for you leo because then it's gonna be a less imperfect system, right?  Than the people who um, there are people who listen to your ads because they trust you and they buy it  But they know never put in the code. I think I have bought I I can honestly say probably more than anything i've ever  Any other site I've probably or you know tech  Public publisher i've bought stuff from this show more than anybody else me too. It's very expensive  Because  Because it's targeted though your your your advertisers know based on your content and based on the kinds of people who listen  Um that they are and the way that you deliver it  And so where data will help you is it's going to show up more often and the imperfect code system will become less and less  important because of  Omnichannel data based on people who listen to your show and you know, they'll know facebook already knows facebook is really on top of this  That's what scares me because that's how facebook sells right other vendors  So facebook may actually be able to help you in this way because they are connecting the dots  I'm never giving facebook and others.

Look at that  And now he's waving. He's waving at the lady. You're not helping this argument leo. Stop talking. Isn't this good?  You're making it worse. Oh man, welcome to my cube planet  Look at that anyway  So microsoft's having an event may 2nd  It's an education event at least according to the invitation  But what they are probably going to announce it's been leaked out now is the new windows cloud version  Which is their attempt to get back in schools?  uh  Which they've been losing ground to the chromebooks. So they'll be inexpensive. I hope they're not netbooks but inexpensive computers  and I think that with the creators edition, uh, and with uh that just came out and uh  You know the push towards holographic. They're really interested in getting kids doing 3d design  I think that they have a very I think forward-looking  Point of view about what they're going to do with their hardware  I I um, I wouldn't write rule them out just yet and I think this is an excellent drawing and you guys suck  so they're  Mocking my drawing

Start time: 8330.32
End time: 8531.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, speaking of the cloud, I think microsoft knows the microsoft cloud they're gonna it they're gonna somehow use  Cloud with this laptop to try to get to the chromebook kind of thing. It's a chromebook. I think yeah windows chromebook kind of thing  But but to get back to the cloud though that that is we were talking a little bit about gpu  Sorry, we're talking about cpu and arm versus  Intel, um, but the gpu is part of it as well, right?  this is where intel and gpus and those kinds of things are the reason that uh,  That arm just is not going to compete and isn't yet anyway competing in in the server room  The demand for all that stuff to run all this cloud stuff is huge  And the compute the demand for compute power to run big data to run what's going to be, you know things like this, you know cloud  Computer that that windows is going to do the windows light version  I still don't have a whole lot of confidence that they can make this thing  Um as as lean and uh minimal as a chromebook, but we'll see it's just not a core competency of microsoft to be lean and minimal  um, and so we'll see but I think where microsoft is doing really well and they have a lot of  Mojo is in cloud, you know with azure when I was there last year in february  Um, I spent a few days it with me in meetings at microsoft and not one person  The whole time I was there said the word windows not one person and this this really weirded me out because that's  They're all always all about windows everywhere and that was the cash cow and everything went back to that  But I heard azure more times that I could count on two hands, right?  That was all that they wanted to talk about they've really and smartly hitched their wagon to the cloud to that  I think that's where all the rnd is going  I think that's where all of their internal goals, um are about and they really are putting all of their  You know their chips there and and that's really smart because the windows brand I think is  still a bit tarnished from all of the years of you know security issues and malware and  um, and also the the bugginess of  Of different things as well as the the failure of vista the failure of windows 8 windows 10 is much better  But you know windows still runs the world  The world runs on windows  It does but the world it's one of those  It's one of those things that it lessens. It's it is less and less  relevant or important or maybe not relevant but  central to  Um, you know business computing everyday computing, you know everyday people's computing  That used to be I think microsoft is increasingly okay with that  Um, and they've smartly said we're about sort of the back end. We're about cloud  We're about also apps which is still front end but and we'll run our apps everywhere on our platform as well as others  And they are kind of winning with that strategy  And that's a much smarter much different mark microsoft than the one we we've seen in the past  But that does make me wonder about the the whole this their their chromebook competitor  Can they really deliver something? You know useful and interesting with that? It'll be interesting to see
