I don't know what US News and World Report was libertarian  I don't know what it was either on that was just political news  Yeah, in any event Newsweek decided to go back into print and did it with a bang a cover story in which  They claim  They unearthed the real  Not Satoshi Nakamoto who oddly enough lives in Temple City, California in Southern, California  Under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto  Yeah, it was a stretch apparently all you had to do was look in the phone book and you would have  easier said than done Leah McGrath Goodman wrote the story with a lot of the she claims and says a Newsweek says a lot of  help from forensic  Something or others people who were specializing in this kind of  identity research  On the face of it is a fairly believable story.

Transcript:  But a lot of people say this is crap. Oh la  Gavin and Drayson who we've interviewed is the head of the Bitcoin Foundation  Didn't exactly deny it, but he was very sorry  He gave the interview to lay out the three I would say there three camps on this there is one camp that says  It's just wrong. It's just false. There's no way this is true. There's another camp who says it's true or could be true  But they should never have doxed the man  That's what Gavin said that they in effect having outed him and ruin his life life untenable. Yeah, and it's true

Start time: 374.20
End time: 400.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

This is the disappointment  I mean if you're gonna be hounded like this and you out of the blue  I don't know if everyone saw that Woody Allen movie where he's in Italy and the guy all of a sudden famous for  Hysterical and then he's not famous and he's irked by it you could have a lot of fun with this you could sell product  You could get some publicity you could wear a sign you could be where a Pepsi  Little marketing so

Start time: 401.78
End time: 442.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When okay, and then there's a third camp and I think I might be in this camp of the blaze it  You believe it. Yeah, okay, so  And if you read you should read the story  I think a lot of people talking about the story didn't read it that Leia McGrath Goodman talks about walking up  To the end of the sunbaked driveway and there is Satoshi Nakamoto  Two police officers are with her because he immediately called the cops when she showed up at his doorstep  the police officer  From the sheriff's department at Temple City says what do you want to ask this man about?  He thinks if he talks to you he's gonna get into trouble. She says I don't think he's in any trouble  I'd like to ask him about Bitcoin. This man is Satoshi Nakamoto

Start time: 443.20
End time: 448.20

Transcript:  That was a problem

Start time: 452.48
End time: 477.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a little bit of it  And then he knows he's rich because it says he looks like he's living a pretty humble life if he is the Satoshi Nakamoto  It's believed he has about 400 million dollars in Bitcoin at least the address associated with Satoshi Nakamoto has that much Bitcoin  I  Think it's possible. I mean a large number of real-world people know about  Bitcoin maybe even know the name because I've talked about it a lot on the radio in LA a lot of people have been talking

Start time: 477.10
End time: 482.72

No, it's Asian  He's 64 he's 64 apparently showing no  Value none of his four hundred million dollar value. He's in but there are some so he doesn't want the mom to get hold of the money  It's all it's all circumstantial, but it's good circumstantial like for instance  He did work for the federal government in a field a related field  He stopped working for them right after 9-eleven in 2001. He was somewhat libertarian  He had done a lot of  Government he hated taxes he he is a math whiz according to a lot of people grad graduated from Cal State  Polytechnic Cal Cal Poly in Pomona, California with a degree in physics  He so he's he's got the means he's got the  Motive because he's anti-government  He's one in one point the story they say because he spent a lot of time buying  His trains internationally he was really frustrated with the tariff system

Well, I'm one first connection on LinkedIn if that means anything, but I never met her  She was doing she was one of the people doing the stories about the child abuse on Jersey Island and she was actually  locked up  Probably a year or two before that friend of Glenn Greenwald's was captured at the you know, and kind of his boyfriend  This happened to her only it was like she was in there for hours days or something and  You would think a good investigative but she seems to me and I think the reason they have been it's kind of no agenda ish  But I don't want to get too much into it  But I I get the sense that she is really not about the pedophilia or even this she's got something to do with banks  She is like target. I think and that's why I think she got onto this because this is a banking issue  She's interested covering fine in England because the banking of the Jersey and Guernsey and these other Channel Islands  Which aren't even owned by England.

Transcript:  She confronts this guy who by the way, he's changed his name legally to Dorian s Nakamoto. Yeah, it makes sense  If you are really Satoshi Nakamoto and you took a lot of went to great pains to be anonymous  Does it seem likely that you would still use your name or you would have used your own name when you invented it?  I don't know. He did give an interview. So  He never tells  Goodman I am the guy he says I don't do that anymore. Yeah now he's saying he talks to the AP gives them an interview saying I  Meant I don't do any of that kind of coding anymore. He says he tells the AP I never heard of Bitcoin  Until my son said that a reporter contacted him three weeks ago  He was saying I'm no longer involved in engineering not I'm no longer involved in Bitcoin.

End time: 825.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Originating message right? Yeah, so and what happens Gavin and reason and by the way go back and watch our triangulation interview with him  Because he's talked about he's the only guy who's ever corresponded with Nakamoto by email  He talked about how the reins were kind of handed off to the Bitcoin Foundation

End time: 886.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, I mean his brother apparently implied it in the article, right?  You got they got a quote that said, you know, you'll never he's kind of a I can't say that word  But it says he's kind of a blank. He's a jerk. He's a jerk. That's a good way to put it  He's a jerk and his life was a complete blank for a while. You're not gonna get him to admit it  He'll deny everything. He'll never admit to starting Bitcoin. That's what his brother says about him. So I mean  You know that's for me. I mean if his brother's saying that then obviously his brother knows something, right?  So I think I think absolutely it's him. He just doesn't want to admit it

Start time: 887.96
End time: 899.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  For some reason it's for sure that if there is another Satoshi Yakamoto or it's a group of people  They're not gonna step up and say oh no. No, it's me right now  So there's nobody good. There's nobody gonna confirm or deny this

Start time: 899.38
End time: 930.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think is yeah, I think yeah given the weirdness that is associated with Bitcoin and just all the like that with the recent hacks  I'm sure and the the Singapore murder  Is it murder is it suicide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Take it. Take it as you on secret. People lie. I know. People lie so bad on secret. Anyway, I think certainly the story of the week and fascinating. I don't know if it matters in terms of what factoid is in there that would cause them to recant it. Was she lying?  Well, for them to recant it, she'd have to say, yeah, I made it. I made this part up. I don't think so. And I think you can demonstrate that all this. I mean, you know, she's got her notes. Newsweek very clearly defended her and so we stand behind the story. Fascinating stuff. Now, meanwhile, the CEO of a Bitcoin exchange in Singapore found dead. That was a while ago. It's only surfaced now. February 28th. Police in Singapore say they believe there was no foul play.  Autumn Radke was in fact an American, 28 years old. No foul play, but the death is unnatural, which means an accident, misadventure or suicide. Suicide probably, right? Bullcrap. Last month she linked to an article on entrepreneurs suffering depression.

It's the best damn story we've had in years. It's amazing. But there's no basis in anything that you can trust. It's like a movie. It's like we're watching a movie in real life.

Transcript:  Yeah. Hackers have never. Mount Gox, of course, one of the most well-known Bitcoin exchanges, claimed a massive loss due to hackers went bankrupt, declared bankruptcy and holding a lot of Bitcoins. Other people's Bitcoins.  Somebody else to wash up dead on shore. Bitcoin community. Maybe not so happy about him. On Sunday, hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mount Gox's CEO, Mark Karpoulis, to post an angry screed alleging the exchange he ran had kept some of that money.

You bring out Julian Assange to give one of his public speeches  just behind the door with a microphone,  with a group, because he's got something to say.  And then he goes, I need some water.  He moves out, and the stunt double takes over.  The stunt double is now up there looking.

Broadcasters suing to put Aereo out of business.  Aereo is the Barry Diller company that makes these little dime-sized...  You rent a dime-sized antenna and an array,  and you can get over-the-air broadcasts on your iPad.  It's really cool.  Works very well.  The Department of Justice has filed a brief siding with broadcasters  at the Supreme Court.  Now, this is the Supreme Court case.  This is another case saying that Aereo is clearly infringing  on the copyright of broadcasters.  A lot of copyright experts say that's complete bogosity.  Makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Well, the federal court in Utah caused the shutdown.  In fact, somebody sent me his email from Aereo saying,  we have to shut down the service because the district court in Utah says,  10th Circuit says it's illegal.  At least, you know, they're going to have a court case,  but the preliminary injunction stands.

And then switch to Chicago.  That would be wrong.  Why? I would have that be my antenna.  What's the difference between I live in New York  and I've got my antenna on the array over here down the block  or I have my antenna in New York and I live in California?  It's still my antenna.

What are you, on NyQuil?  No, I'm on aspirin.  It doesn't take much with me.  That's why I don't drink.  Anyway, I do not see the difference.  I think that's the specious part of the argument.  If I'm down the street and I'm renting an antenna from these guys  and they're running it down the internet,  what if I move a block further away?  Then another block further away.  Now I'm right at the border of the city where I could not get a reception  and I move a block away.  So you're telling me that one block away, now it's illegal,  and then a block in, it's legal?  This is bull crap.

What their argument is, it should be racketeering.  It's the networks that don't like this idea because they say the following.  You're in New York.  We're giving you New York ads.  If you're living in Connecticut or let's say California and you're watching New York ads,  that doesn't do us any good, but it also hurts the local affiliates of ABC, NBC, CBS,  because they are losing money because they don't get to sell ads.

Fox has said, we'll just take our stuff off broadcast if that's what happens.  We want the cable revenue.  They want ad revenue and the cable revenue.  But this was the old...  Right? Remember?  You put an antenna up, you get TV, you don't pay for it, you watch the ads.  That's how it works.  It's like me saying, I want to charge...  Hey, this is a good idea.  I charge your ISP for access.

Transcript:  Speaking of bogus stories, I have to apologize because we talked last week...  Write about something.  Huh?  You have to write about something.  You got to write about something.  And Greg Kaiser apparently likes to write about Apple for Computer World,  and I trusted him because it's Computer World, right?  That's trustworthy.  You trusted.  I trusted.  I don't trust him anymore.  He wrote an article in which he asserted that Apple was as bad as Microsoft  because they weren't going to support Snow Leopard anymore.  It's wrong.  It's just wrong.  Apple did not retire Snow Leopard from support.  His article, which we talked about last week, said Apple retires Snow Leopard from support,  leaves one in five Macs vulnerable to attacks.  His evidence was that Apple didn't update Snow Leopard for the Go To Fail bug.  That's because it wasn't in Snow Leopard.  Apple says, no, what are you talking about?  It's a scandal.  It's a scandal.  It's a scandal.  What are you talking about, Willis?  So I'm sure Greg will have something to say about it,  but according to Renee Ritchie at iMore,  Get him on the show.  Greg, if you want to defend yourself, come on the show.  But according to Renee Ritchie at iMore, that's bogus.  Apple's complete continuing to support Snow Leopard.  So fear not.  On the other hand, April 8th, it's the end of XP.  And Steve Gibson, shockingly, on Security Now on Tuesday.  Said, that's not a big deal.  What? You're the security guy.  No, I'm going to continue to run XP.  In fact, Steve said, I never was able to get that Service Pack 3 working,  so I'm running XP Service Pack 2, and I'm safe.  He says, overblown.  He says, the key is to not run as an administrator.  Run as a limited user.  XP is as safe as anything else.  Don't worry about those patches for Microsoft.  I think we'll find out April 9th.

You've got to find parking.  There's all the people in there buying the new stamps, the new postage, right?  Why do that when you can print stamps?  You can print stamps right now at Stamps.com.  All you have to do is go to Stamps.com right now.  We're going to give you a no-risk trial in a second.  Now, your computer, your printer, no special ink, no postage meter necessary, could print  all the postage you need on demand when you need it 24-7.  Never go to the post office again.  You can print right on the envelope.  So if your business does invoices or mailers or whatever, it goes right on there with the  return address, the logo, and it actually even gets the addresses you're sending it  to from your QuickBooks.  If you sell on Etsy or eBay, Amazon, PayPal, whatever site you use, it'll pull the address  from there.  If it's an overseas address, it'll fill out the international forms.  This is the easiest way to become a professional fulfillment house.  That's why the pros use Stamps.com.  That's why we use Stamps.com.  It's more powerful than a postage meter at just a fraction of the cost.  In fact, as much as 80% less than a postage meter.  And you don't have to go to the post office.  There's even a button on Stamps.com.  You press the button in the post office.  It says, quick, send a mail carrier to Leo's place.  They've got mail.  Stamps.com.

Transcript:  I practiced that all night last night.  I was really mad that we set the clocks ahead because I lost an hour of practicing.  Nikos Mavroginopoulos.  Yes.  He is a Red Hat guy.  Discovered.  Remember the go-to fail bug?  We thought, oh, this is crazy.  Although, Bruce Schneier is of the opinion that it might have been a hack.  Really?  Yeah.  This is the bug where a line, a single line go-to fail was duplicated in open source code  on the Macintosh that completely bypassed the SSL security certificate check and just  meant that any certificate would be okay, meaning a man in the middle attack would be  trivial on iOS and on the Macintosh.  Apple has fixed it.  But Nikos, who works for Red Hat, says a bug in Linux could allow a hacker to create a  certificate that would bypass normal authentication checks.  Red Hat has set out an immediate alert, suggests that all those who use Red Hat update, it's  very similar to the go-to-fail problem.  Now, Schneier said if I were going to create, if I wanted to create a security flaw in an  operating system that would allow me, let's say I'm a federal agency that's interested  in what people are up to, to bypass that and do that, I would do it in a couple of ways.  One that preserved deniability, looked like it could be a typo.  One that would be trivial to create.  You don't have to spend an hour at the computer keyboard, just go in there, go to fail.  And Schneier says this looks, I'm not saying there's no smoking gun and there's no way to  prove it ever, who did it or why.  Although, he did point out Apple, if they have any normal, you guys are programmers, if they  had any normal auditing procedures, the kind of procedures that any company has, should know  exactly who committed that code.  Logging and version control.  Should know exactly who wrote that.  Have we heard from Apple?

Start time: 3253.94
End time: 3277.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, it's out there in a repository, in a get repository somewhere, and people are  actually testing it out again and again and again.  They usually find it.  Now, sometimes these things can be put into code as a way to test certain things out.  So you put this in deliberately in the beginning because, oh, I want to see if this works, but  I don't really want to have to go through the authorization part, right?  So we'll just skip that with this little thing, and then you forget about it.  Here's the issue.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

They inflated charges by 58%.  That's more than $21 million in overpayment.  You know, Sprint...  I guess it's reasonable if you're Sprint or any telco to charge for wiretaps, right?

The Nine Public Speaking Secrets of the World's Top Minds.  You can get that.  We're going to have Michio Kaku, the great physicist, the string theory fella on Triangulation  in a couple of weeks.  His new book is out, The Future of Mind.  The Scientific Quest to Understand, Enhance, and Empower the Mind.  Oh, that sounds good.  I'm intrigued by the mind.  Jeff Hawkins wrote a great book that I listened to on audible.com.  He is the founder of Palm.  You may remember him.  He was, before he founded Palm, a neuroscientist.  His book On Intelligence, which came out a couple of years ago, is about how the brain  works.  He's actually started a new company called Numenta.  He attempted to create chips that work massively parallel in massively parallel fashion as  the brain does.  This was a great book.  I can highly recommend it.  The problem is picking two.  You're going to get two books at audible.com.  When you visit audible.com slash twit two, you'll be choosing from 150,000 wonderful  books.  You know, brand new suspense, thriller, murder mysteries, lots of science fiction, but also  classics.  There's The Silence of the Lambs.  Clive Kussler is on there.  These are new books from Randy Wayne, Clive Kussler, Sean Maguire, Benjamin Black.  Classics, history.  I read a lot of nonfiction.  This is interesting.  The Rise of Superman, Decoding the Science of Ultimate Human Performance.  The Man Without a Face, Timely Stuff.  The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin by Masha Gessen.  So pick a couple because you're going to get them for free.  You'll be signing up for the platinum account.  That's two books a month.  This is really good.  I just listened to this.  It enters game alive.  It's a dramatized audio play.  Orson Skarkar did the adaptation of his classic novel, and it really comes alive.  I watched it right before I watched the movie or listened to it.  I often say watch because I feel like these audio books just come alive in my head.  I feel like I'm watching them as they happen.  Go to audible.com slash twit2.  You'll be able to pick two books because your first month's free.  Your first two credits, first two books are free.  You cancel the first 30 days, you'll pay nothing, but those books are yours forever.  You also get the daily edition of the New York Times, the audio edition of the New York Times,  or the Wall Street Journal as part of your deal.  It's always the challenge though is to limit it.  Let me just look at the latest books.  I'm listening right now to a classic sci-fi by Peter F. Hamilton.  Do you like him?  I love him.

That was the first one.  Sci-Fi?  Yeah, it's Sci-Fi.  And it's a team of authors.  They team up.  And I think they write one chapter each.  They go back and forth.

Secondly, the second largest group here is Symbian,  and if you look at the growth of Android versus the growth of Symbian,  Android is booming while Symbian is dying.

But if you downloaded it,  one of them was a belly fat...  Secrets of how to lose belly fat.  I downloaded it. That's why I know.  And it would sign you up kind of surreptitiously  for a paid SMS service,  then send you a bunch of tips via text message,  and $50 later, you know, you've been screwed.

The code was it turned off the sound  of the modem, hung up  and then redialed some  chat line in Romania  for $100 a minute  and you got these $1,000 bills  and you're a phone company.

Every day I walk through the Muni stations  in San Francisco and for months  they were covered in Surface ads.  Now I'm sure we're going to see these honestly ads coming up.  I can't imagine the cost  to wrap the subway cars  and all that sort of stuff that they're doing.  If Microsoft really wanted to get their products  in the hands of people, why wouldn't they take  that advertising dollars and either apply it  to the cost of the Surface device  or give it to schools for free  and don't do any advertising?  Why do they need to do these awareness ad campaigns  that cost millions of dollars?

So they're going to do a lot more measurement  of people like Ron and say,  Ron, what do you think, honestly,  what do you think of Surface?  Stuff like that.

I think Getty was influenced  by some of these Twitter accounts.  What is it?  The History and Pictures account?  It's a great account  where you follow them and they have these great old pictures  which they steal basically from Getty and other sites.  So Getty realizing,  well, obviously people want this stuff.  How could we capitalize  on the hundred years of images,  the thousands, probably millions of images?  So they now allow you to do it for free.  But what you get is an embed link.  So it doesn't work on Twitter.  All you can do is get a link  or you do an iframe on your web page.  It's kind of crappy, frankly.  So meanwhile, History and Pictures  is going to continue  just stealing it.

They bring in about $50,000 Australian dollars a month  creating these kind of Twitter accounts.  History and Pictures is hugely successful.  Almost a million followers.
