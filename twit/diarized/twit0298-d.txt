I'm laughing because we have a full house in the TwiIT studios.  You know, I don't know what happened.  It used to be that a holiday would come and I wouldn't be able to get anybody to do TwiIT  and I'd sit here doing it all by myself.  And lo and behold, we got like eight people in this little teensy weensy room.  Starting with, to my left, my good friend and old radio partner, Gina Smith, who is  now editor in chief of Byte Magazine.  Hi.  Good to have you back.

Start time: 181.74
End time: 183.62

Start time: 184.52
End time: 189.62

Start time: 189.84
End time: 199.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People who are born here, which are like one out of every 400 people you'll meet, hate San  Fran.  For example, I said it once in front of my wife.  That was nine and a half years ago.  I've never said it since.  What do we call it?

Start time: 199.44
End time: 200.29

Start time: 200.66

End time: 210.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My wife's lived here for 30 years and I've never heard her call her that.  She calls it San Francisco.  Very explicit.

Start time: 210.54
End time: 216.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No diminutive, no Frisco, no San Fran.  That, ladies and gentlemen, that guy is Patrick...  Frisco is a terrible name.  Frisco's bad.

Start time: 217.00
End time: 229.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't say that to the Hell's Angels because that's what's printed on a lot of their t-shirts  themselves.  Oh, really?  Well, our offices are down around the corner from the Hell's Angels.  Are you down by Santa Cruz?  No.  Our, the revision three offices are around the corner from the San Francisco Hell's Angels  house.

Start time: 230.80
End time: 243.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Santa Cruz is...  Is that where the Hell's Angels are?  Henry's a criminal attorney and says a lot of the Hell's Angels are down there and he  always says...  That's where I grew up.  The devil lives in Santa Cruz.  Well, that's where the devil's from, Santa Cruz.  The devil lives in Santa Cruz before.  Yeah, the devil comes from Santa Cruz.

Transcript:  Patrick Norton from Tekzilla, my old buddy.  And you were in the desert last week when we did our sixth anniversary twit, so thank  you for the video.  We played it.  It was really, really nice.

Start time: 253.96
End time: 259.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My apologies for thinking it was the fifth anniversary.  Can you believe it's been six years?  No, apparently I couldn't.  Yeah.  It's a shocker, isn't it?

Start time: 260.81
End time: 275.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it was...  We had Kevin and David Prager and Robert Heron back and it was really fun, but we did miss  you.  It wasn't the same without you, so thank you for coming this week.  Did we save any of that champagne?  No, of course not.  So we'll just have to...  There's champagne in the refrigerator.

Start time: 280.60
End time: 319.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a black coffee kind of guy.  Would you like some black coffee?  Always.  Okay, black coffee for Mr. Norton.  The Pope celebrate Easter.  So there was so much news this week.  It's kind of hard to know where to begin.  One of the things we spent a lot of time on MacBreak Weekly talking about is Samsung and  Apple.  Samsung, who released...  Has actually quite a...  I think a very good Android phone, the Galaxy S. Apple sued saying it's a direct copy of  the iPhone.  You've probably been following this story.  Is there any merit in that?

Start time: 320.70
End time: 332.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, Apple seems to be on a frenzy recently with their patent lawsuits.  So I'm guessing they over-staffed in that department and they're just looking for something  to do.

Start time: 333.72
End time: 398.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what happens when you hire lawyers by the yard.  Samsung responds by counter-suing.  Samsung is one of the big suppliers to Apple.  They supply about almost $5 billion a year worth of gear.  They make the A5 chip.  The A5 for the iPad too.  They make a lot of the flash RAM that's used in all Apple devices.  But now we actually...  If you go back and listen to MacBreak Weekly this week, we had Neelay Patel on who is not  only former editor at Engadget, but wrote a very good piece on his website talking about  this.  And he's also an former IP, a reformed IP attorney.  What does he think?  You know, he thought there was some merit to it.  In fact, if you go to his website, which is the Next Big Thing...  Is that right?  Say again?  This is my next big thing.  This is...  I guess next big thing was taken.  This is my...  That's a lot to type.  Next...  Sorry, I have to type now.  This is my next big thing doesn't work either.  This is my next.com.  This is my next.  Oh, it's This is My Next Whatever.

Start time: 399.12
End time: 400.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They say online, this is my next.

Start time: 401.78
End time: 453.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he has a very, I think a very good and lengthy article about the suit and the counter  suit.  But let me show you.  The article is good because it has the points of comparison that Samsung provided in their  law or Apple provided in their lawsuit.  By the way, you can see right in the front page, it is a complaint for patent infringement,  federal false designation of origin, and unfair competition, federal trademark infringement,  state unfair competition, common law trademark infringement, and unjust enrichment.  Apple's contention is that Samsung intended to confuse consumers by releasing a phone that  looks so much like the iPhone that consumers might accidentally buy it.  Yeah, that'll happen.

Start time: 453.84
End time: 454.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now there's one picture from the yeah.

Start time: 454.84
End time: 467.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, this is my point is that I don't think anybody was fooled by this.  But look at this.  This is the Samsung phone on the left, the iPhone on the right.  This is Samsung's Android kind of sugar that they put on top of it.

Start time: 468.42
End time: 474.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just looking at this and I'm like, okay, actually the icons.  Well, look at the icons.  If I were the lawyer, the icon.

Start time: 475.06
End time: 477.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the icon.  So on the left, Apple, on the right, Samsung.

Start time: 478.10
End time: 479.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're all about the drop shadow.

Start time: 480.36
End time: 504.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I got to tell you, look, if you're going to do an icon for a phone app,  you're going to put a handset on it.  Now it's green and it's got a gradient.  If you're going to do a chat, you got a chat bubble, chat bubble with a smile.  Yeah, flower, flower.  The flower is kind of bad.  The gear in the settings.  They've got a notepad for the notepad.  But see, that's kind of just literal minded.  What do you think, Patrick?

Start time: 504.98
End time: 516.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's okay.  One, Apple and Samsung are obviously severely pissed off at each other  because Samsung is countersuing in four countries.  They're going for 10 major patents.

Start time: 517.82
End time: 528.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is what happens when you do a patent or a trademark lawsuit.  It's mutually assured destruction, right?  People acquire patents specifically so that you won't sue them,  so that if you do sue them, they can countersue you.

Start time: 528.84
End time: 545.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and Reuters is saying the Samsung countersuits involve power reduction  during data transmission, 3G technology producing errors during data transmission,  wireless data communications technology.  So Samsung's like, great.  You want to get pissy about a retail product,  we're going to try to undermine how effective your device functions as a phone.

Start time: 545.84
End time: 546.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With our own chips.

Start time: 547.35
End time: 548.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a big stick.

Start time: 548.86
End time: 550.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Samsung will win its suit in Apple.

Start time: 551.26
End time: 580.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me just throw something else in because I showed this to Neelay,  and this is of course, he said yes, we've all seen this.  The phone on the left is a Samsung phone.  It's the F700.  It predates the iPhone.  Samsung could probably pretty reasonably say,  Judge, it went the other way.  The left phone is a Samsung phone and predates the phone on the right, the iPhone.  But icons aren't in color.  You don't have the same icon issue.  I think any smartphone these days is going to have a big glass screen.

Start time: 580.98
End time: 604.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a stick you hold up next to your head.  Nokia was the grand experimenter.  They did the taco phone.  One of the most epic fails in phone history.  The flip phones are effectively dead.  Slide out keyboards are the minority at this point.  Even when you close the keyboard, you still have a stick, a box, a deck of cards,  a pack of cigarettes you hold up next to your head.  There's not much to go to.

Start time: 605.12
End time: 614.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of my point.  What it will come down to in court, I guess, is did Samsung intentionally attempt to deceive consumers?

Start time: 615.19
End time: 631.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did they?  It doesn't matter.  It's about what you try to prove in court.  At this point, it's a much larger playing field.  Apple's got lawyers dancing in three continents, five, six countries, something like that.  This is going to be crazy.  It's going to cost stockholders a fortune.

Start time: 631.98
End time: 632.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not going to cost us.

Start time: 632.84
End time: 641.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know how many Apple's lawyer has in the building?  That's true. They're ready to go internally.  This is like chilling effect.  They have 100 plus lawyers, I think.  I think they have their own building.

Start time: 641.88
End time: 665.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do have their own building down there.  The lawyer building.  I'll tell you, you remember when Apple was suing Microsoft because they thought that Microsoft had ripped off the looking field.  The trash can. The recycle bin.  Right, the recycle bin and everything.  In fact, Microsoft had ripped off the Apple GUI.  But Apple lost that lawsuit.  Apple lost that lawsuit.  And Xerox came up and said, wait a minute, Apple, where do you think you got your whole drag and drop interface?

Start time: 666.00
End time: 679.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple did a legitimate exchange of technology with Xerox for the walkthrough on Park.  That was a deal between Xerox and Apple.  Microsoft saw a good thing and took as much of it as they could without a deal.  We don't need to pay for this.

Start time: 679.86
End time: 682.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just a trash can. We'll just borrow the trash can.  Microsoft took what they could.

Start time: 682.84
End time: 689.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And with Windows 3.0, they did.  That was a look and feel lawsuit. It's different than this.

Start time: 690.52
End time: 698.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Joshua Topolsky does point out that that Samsung phone shipped after the iPhone but was announced before the iPhone.  But I think the announcement showed what it was going to look like.

Start time: 700.34
End time: 712.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I bet you they've got a problem that's beyond this that we're not seeing.  Samsung and Apple are tight partners in the hardware realm.  They've got something going on.  They got in a huge fight and they just decided to unleash the lawyers.

Start time: 712.86
End time: 714.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't you like to get a fly on the wall?

Start time: 715.36
End time: 719.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you stole it. I did not. You stole it.  I'm going to sue you. Go ahead.

Start time: 720.42
End time: 725.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll sue you for what you're doing with my battery management chip.  It also makes me wonder if the different...

Start time: 726.08
End time: 760.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because we've seen at Sony where obviously the music department and the people that made the Walkman follow ups never actually spoke to each other.  So that Sony crippled itself in portable music players, at least outside of mini discs.  Because the people in Sony...  Basically the music department had sway over the control of whether or not Sony made a legitimate MP3 player.  And Sony forced A-Tracks and MP3 players fell incredibly far behind.  You wonder if Samsung, if the people who make the phones inside of Samsung do a lot of talking with the people who sell the components from that area of Samsung.  Engineers talk a lot to each other, but do the managers...

Start time: 761.12
End time: 779.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was Neelai's contention is that Samsung is a big kuretsu and that it's so big that these different divisions...  In fact, he said when the cell phone division wants to buy flash ram, they bid for it for Samsung's flash ram just like any other company.  So it's completely possible to sue the cell phone division and not have that impact the A5 supply.

Start time: 780.18
End time: 791.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even the consumer divisions of Samsung operate very differently.  Like the TV divisions, the home theater versus mobile.  They're in different states, they're in different countries in some instances.

Start time: 791.90
End time: 795.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is probably good for those companies on some level or those business units.

Start time: 797.04
End time: 802.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at how Microsoft's bogged down by being so big and all in the same place and the divisions fight with each other.

Start time: 803.14
End time: 806.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft has never kept a clean wall between its absence and its loss.

Start time: 806.86
End time: 814.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't release a product in Microsoft without some other product manager saying, and killing it.  It's just nasty.

Start time: 814.84
End time: 823.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The downside of that is that when there's not sharing, then people are developing the same things in separate divisions.  Like movie download services.

Start time: 825.00
End time: 827.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Zoom is a great example of that.

Start time: 830.89
End time: 835.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft's now sharing Kinects to the Windows division.

Start time: 835.84
End time: 845.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that. Microsoft has become the open, transparent...  The underdog.  Underdog. I love that.

Start time: 845.92
End time: 853.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true. Google has become the new Microsoft.  And Microsoft has become the new Lotus.  Or IBM.  Or I was going to say IBM.

Start time: 853.84
End time: 854.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft's like IBM.

Start time: 855.96
End time: 859.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Microsoft's IBM.  Google is Microsoft.

Start time: 860.02
End time: 863.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Philippe Kahn.  And who is Apple in that?

Start time: 864.06
End time: 869.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If Microsoft is IBM and Google is Microsoft, Apple's Apple.

Start time: 869.90
End time: 873.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple's Apple but meaner.  Apple's Apple but meaner than it ever was.

Start time: 874.67
End time: 876.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're mean. They're the mean Apple.  They're the mean Apple.

Start time: 877.86
End time: 878.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're the older, wiser Apple.

Start time: 879.92
End time: 881.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're the Darth Vader version. They're the dark side.

Start time: 881.84
End time: 897.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a few more Apple stores we'll get to.  But there's one that's just completely stupid and trivial.  But I think it's surprising that apparently white iPhones are appearing now in Santa Clara.  At stores in Santa Clara.  They're supposed to be available this week.  There are white iPhones. Do you care?  Patrick, are you going to trade yours in?

Start time: 897.84
End time: 904.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know you really like the girly look.  This is the only white portable device I'll probably ever own for the rest of my life.

Start time: 905.92
End time: 907.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that to hide the Apple?

Start time: 907.98
End time: 934.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, partially to hide the Apple because I enjoy hiding the giant white light on the back of the notebook that irritates everyone around me.  But mostly because when I first got this like three or four years ago at Revision 3, like 19 people out of 25 had white iPads.  So yours is obviously different.  Yes, because I actually picked up the wrong notebook after a meeting one day and got back to my desk and I was like, I'm never going to pick up the wrong notebook again.  And in case of earthquake, that's structurally more sound.

Start time: 936.00
End time: 937.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's really why you do it.

Start time: 937.84
End time: 944.47

Transcript:  I want to talk a little bit about GoToMeeting very quickly though from our good friends at Citrix.  Gina and I have some stories to tell about Citrix and Yakubuchi.  He started Citrix. Now he's doing like NetJets or something, right?

Start time: 1018.66
End time: 1049.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What he's doing now is small private jets.  Private little tiny LearJets.  Do you own an outright or do you lease it?  You buy them.  I'd like one of those. Can you put me down for one?  He started Citrix and when we met him, it was to link a bunch of XTs together.  He remembers the 8088 based XT computer to link a bunch of those to a small T user.  He was at IBM and he was in charge of the OS2 project at IBM way back when Microsoft decided to trick IBM and do Windows and stuff.

Start time: 1050.70
End time: 1060.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the funny thing is there was a kind of intellectual property trade and Yakubuchi went to Microsoft to help with NT.  And Microsoft sent some people to help with OS2. And guess who got the better deal on that one?

Start time: 1060.92
End time: 1065.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, NT's operating system is like three quarters OS2 according to Yakubuchi.

Start time: 1066.68
End time: 1163.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And as a result, he knew better than anybody how to do remote access on NT.  And that's where you get this amazing back end that is powering all the Citrix products.  They know remote access.  Now here's a nice application for remote access.  You don't want to make a trip to visit with a client or colleague.  And a conference call seems so stale and well, just non-visual.  What about GoToMeeting?  Now I know you've seen web conferencing solutions.  There's nothing better than GoToMeeting. It's fast. It's easy.  Now you can do a GoToMeeting on a Mac, a PC. You can even attend a GoToMeeting.  I did this the other day on an iPad.  Every GoToMeeting has absolutely as part of the deal, absolutely free.  It has teleconferencing built in.  So it sets up a phone bridge when you set up the meeting.  But you can also use the computer's own microphone and speakers and use VoIP.  It is just the simplest, best way for collaboration, for planning, for sales presentations, weekly status updates.  So whatever you need to do when your team gets together, if they're spread out, use GoToMeeting.  That's what we do. We do GoToMeeting several times a week now.  In fact, actually, I think we had to buy a second account. We were doing so many GoToMeetings.  You could try it free right now.  If you just visit GoToMeeting.com, click the Try It Free button.  And enter TWIT in the offer code box. That'll give you 30 days free.  If you haven't tried it yet, please do. It really is the best.  And we thank them so much for supporting our network and this week in tech.  It was just over to the new studio. We did a little Skype visit to the new studio.  Did everybody see it?  You were watching that. It was a lot of fun.  I can't wait because we're going to put our show right past this point.  It was a lot of fun. Have you been over? You haven't seen it yet, have you, Patrick?

Transcript:  It was an Easter egg. Patrick was an Easter egg in our little office tour.  A human Easter egg in my Jane shirt.  You look like one, actually. You're bright yellow today. I like that.  It's one of my Jane shirts.  Oh, I like it. It's really good. It's got some mysterious Chinese in a gun.  So what did you think?

Start time: 1207.45

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we've come a little ways.  We've come a long way.  But, you know, it's turned, you know, as with any construction project,  it's turned out to be a little more pricey than we thought.

End time: 1245.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty close, actually. We haven't got to the last week part yet.  God, I hope you're wrong on that part.  But it takes twice as long, costs twice as much, basically, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 1250.96
End time: 1258.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, everybody asked me that. Exactly. The answer is when it's done.  Because you once said April, then you said May, then you said June.  Yeah, I think we're talking June 15th.

End time: 1283.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, you probably will be the launch podcast.  Yeah, and I'm hoping that you'll...  But we're sitting, you know, here's the thing.  We're sitting in a room that was designed for me and just me alone on a camera,  and we're jammed in here, and we've got like five people in the audience.  I mean, it's crazy.  But we're going to have a round table. It's going to be a much better setup.

Transcript:  Screaming Leo. Screaming Leo.  Well, what will happen is this room is going to be transplanted.  Really?  Yeah, you know that glass area that I was in, my new office?  That's exactly the same size as this is.  So we're going to take this room. We're going to actually saw it out.  No, we're not going to saw it out.  I'm sitting here like, this is a historical building.  No, we can't do that.  The lawsuit will never end, dude.  We built cabinetry to match that.  And we've got red curtains.  We're basically going to duplicate this.  All the cameras, all the gear that's in here will go there.  So people won't be too discombobulated by the moment.

Start time: 1334.98

Start time: 1344.90
End time: 1354.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't they have an old school newsroom at the LA Times  where the managing editor could see,  and then he had curtains he would close before he called in somebody to fire them?  There were some rooms like that.  Unless he hated them, in which case he'd leave the curtains open.

Start time: 1354.88
End time: 1371.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, here's a better analogy.  Remember the buddy cop movies where the two cops,  and they get in trouble with the lieutenant,  who's always for some reason a black guy.  I don't know why.  And he's in his office, and he's looking out there, says,  Chestnut and Mayor, you get in here!  And he chews them out.  That's me.  See?  Old school.

Start time: 1374.94
End time: 1381.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's important for it not to be soundproof.  No, it's not.  The reason that, I don't know why there's glass around it, actually.  Because it's my office, and I don't want anybody in my office.

Start time: 1382.75
End time: 1385.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because Leo's always on stage.  Do you want to be able to see across the room whether people are in there?

Start time: 1386.99
End time: 1400.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why did we do the glass?  Oh, because then people can see what's going on.  You know, the whole idea is you're shooting in there,  you want to see stuff going on kind of behind the scenes and stuff.  So there's lots of long lines.  You know, Patrick, when you set up a set, you want depth.  The biggest nightmare is a 20 by 20 foot room that has walls,

Start time: 1403.40
End time: 1409.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and then you have these really short angles, no activity in the back,  and you can't possibly succeed.  And look, Leo, you did.

Transcript:  Let us move along. We were talking about Apple,  and there are some other interesting stories.  For instance, Apple testing an iPhone for T-Mobile?  Does that seem possible?  Absolutely.  We haven't heard much about an iPhone 5,  and I think the consensus is there won't be an iPhone 5 in June.  It's going to be late. Yeah, it's going to be.  It's interesting.  We have heard that testing's been going on on an A5 dual core iPhone, right?  Again, rumors.  So the iPhone 4.5.  I don't know what they would do.  Whatever they could do.

Start time: 1450.94
End time: 1464.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You upgrade the processor, you finally do something crazy,  like a 64, 128 gigabyte version of it,  and you get half of the current user base, the iPhone 4, to buy that,  and then most of those people will buy the iPhone 5,  and it eventually ships before Christmas.

Start time: 1465.36
End time: 1471.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Then you have a Christmas product for Apple,  and a dual core iPhone, and that's an exciting product.

Start time: 1472.69
End time: 1497.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what do you think of this, though?  I mean, the problem is these are so easy to Photoshop.  This is from Boy Genius Report.  It is a white iPhone. It says T-Mobile 3G in the upper left-hand corner.  Confidential and proprietary, Apple's learning.  If found, please contact 408, and then they've blanked out the numbers.  Boy Genius is pretty good.  It makes perfect sense.  It does. They had it exclusive with AT&T,

Start time: 1498.45
End time: 1499.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and now they're opening it up to everybody.

Start time: 1501.01
End time: 1507.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why not?  Yeah, they said the Verizon deal was non-exclusive.  They did say that.  There's nothing stopping them from opening the phone up to every carrier.

Start time: 1507.84
End time: 1524.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it makes really good business sense,  because at this point they're losing overall market share to Android success.  What takes Android 72 different models from 19 different manufacturers?  So, yeah, at this point it's painting over the door.  It's the single user you can on carrying an iPhone.

End time: 1543.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me search. It might actually be.  I didn't play the music.  It just sounds like a Dropkick Murphy song.  Actually, the new Dropkick Murphy's album is out,  if there are any Dropkick Murphy fans out there.  Is it plural or a singular?  Dropkick Murphy's S, no apostrophe.

Sorry, I'm having a vision of their campus in Sebastopol, but can't remember the name  of the publishing company who do make and everything else on the planet and all the  animal books.  I should remember...  O'Reilly, thank you.  O'Reilly.  Yeah, I'm sitting here, I'm like...

Start time: 1627.84

Start time: 1630.84
End time: 1646.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're around here somewhere.  But they basically revealed that there is a, for whatever reason...  And we should point this out.  One, your carrier always knows where you are.  And anybody who says your carrier should know where your phone is, you send them to remedial  math and you have a conversation afterwards.  But...  They know not...

Start time: 1646.88
End time: 1650.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe, but they don't know within 60 feet or five feet, they know which cell you're on.

Start time: 1650.84

Start time: 1653.84
End time: 1696.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you never know what else they know that the engineers aren't talking about.  But let's walk away from that.  Okay.  So the researchers found two really interesting things.  One is that Apple is recording your location constantly.  Two is that it is available on the machine you back your iPhone up to.  Which means, three, with some very simple software, which now everybody on the internet  knows about, they can...  If somebody can run that on your machine, they can now track where you've been.  Which, depending on how you look at this, it's either a minor deal and not really worthy  of considering, or it's incredibly potentially catastrophic thing that everybody should panic  about.  I mean, it was Apple...

Start time: 1697.56
End time: 1702.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't bother me in the least, and I'll tell you why.  First of all, you knew that, didn't you?

Start time: 1703.24
End time: 1712.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I assumed that because of Dr....  I mean, come on.  Here's...  Yeah.  My polypsi professor in college who basically said you should always assume that someone  is listening.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a map of Stephen B. Johnson and his whereabouts for the past.  Not one, not two, not three, not four, but five years.  Now, one of the reasons that's stored for so long is because Apple, when it backs up  the phone, backs up everything.  So we don't know if that's an intentional move to the desktop.  It's just part of the backup.  Well, this was added in iOS 4.

Start time: 1733.86
End time: 1735.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I went back and I looked at the iOS...

Start time: 1735.96
End time: 1737.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's not in the original iOS.

Start time: 1738.50
End time: 1740.60

Start time: 1741.28
End time: 1744.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think they were creating that unencrypted file that you could go in and actually...

Start time: 1746.32
End time: 1749.47

Transcript:  Do you think it was a mistake?  No.  Or intentional?

Start time: 1749.84
End time: 1785.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a log.  I went back and I watched the keynote for iOS 4 and they had the name of the guy who heads  mobile.  I forget what his name is, but Scott Forstall.  They had him on stage talking about how multitasking works, how location services work.  And he talks about, we need to ping for your location and we keep a log of it so we can  pass it on to apps so they can send push alerts based on this info.  So this was stuff that was like...  They went over it, but I don't think it really sunk in with anybody when they were just  discussing the back end of how this works.

Start time: 1786.32
End time: 1819.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also, nobody probably really thought they were going to hold onto it forever.  That's right.  If I fly from San Francisco to Las Vegas, great.  I'm going to get the really irritating sponsored ads on Google for stuff I'm not searching  for when I search on Google Maps.  I'm not bitter about that.  But if I'm searching for a diesel gas station, I don't want to get information on a Ford  dealership in the area or something like that.  Not that I don't love Ford.  I love Ford.  But it's fascinating that they are keeping all of the data in a single file backed up  on your iPhone.  It's just bizarre.  Is it sloppy code?

Start time: 1819.90
End time: 1823.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1837.94
End time: 1854.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, I'm going to pull up the response to Ed Markey from July 2010, in which Apple  said, not only do we collect this information, we tell you in the terms of service, it is  part of the deal.  You can opt out, they said, by turning off location services.  They told him that July 2010.  We've known this for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's walk away from adultery and let's talk about maybe spousal abuse.  Because most of the impassioned stuff I've gotten about teaching people how to clear  their cash or stuff like that have come from people who run centers for abused women.  Because, you know, if a husband looks at the cash and sees somebody who's looking for social  services or something, and goes ballistic.  So, and not that I don't take adultery seriously, but let's walk away from ... because everybody  can laugh at the ... cheating spouse, ha, ha, ha, whatever.  What about people who are abusive?  What about people who have figured out a way to access someone's computer and take information?  What about stalking?  What about, you know, what about if you're searching for another job at the office or  something like that?  Then you shouldn't be carrying a cell phone.

In fact, we ... remember there was a phone that was made that allowed a spouse or whoever  to turn on the microphone at any time, and you'd substitute this for your wife's or  husband's phone, and then any time you wanted, without their knowledge, you could turn on  the microphone and listen to what was going on.

Eric, that's why Eric's no longer CEO for a lot of reasons, but one of the reasons is  he always put his foot in his mouth.  But that's a paper tiger.  The fact ... I mean, people say that, but the fact is, if you're carrying a cell phone,  you should know that you're carrying a ... I mean, people do now know that, that you're  carrying a device.  All of the companies that make these smartphones collect anonymized location data because  it's how they market to people.  They say, well, Pizza Hut, I can tell you when he's near a Pizza Hut, would you like  to know that?  People log in with Foursquare.  People are using Google Latitude.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was my mistake.  I guess here's my point.  If you carry a cell phone, you probably should be aware of the fact that it seems to know  where you are at all times.  It's got a microphone.  It's got a camera.  We know that there are apps that turn these things on without letting you know.  It's a spy device.  It's good that this came out because people know it.  I don't think Apple kept that file because Apple had some nefarious purposes for it.  I think it was a mistake.  The fact that it's not encrypted points to that because if they were going to keep it,  they'd encrypt it.  The fact that it's encrypted opens this huge security hole for other people stealing your  location data.  It just jailbreaks them.  The final point that I would make is that as you said, law enforcement has been doing  this all along.  We know that Sprint has a portal for law enforcement.  Law enforcement for $1.50 can go and say, where was Mark Millian last night?  And they'll tell him.  It's not like law enforcement doesn't have this information.  You know what?  Every phone.  Right.  Exactly.  The wireless companies don't know this and they offer this.  The standard for a pen register is very low because it's not considered content.  It's not the contents of your emails, just where you are.  I think the reason for that is because I could look out the window and see where you  are.  I could follow you with a car and see where you are.  That information by itself isn't necessarily private information, is it?  Oh boy.

I've politely asked them to keep them off my Delete Expo to Wikipedia entry because,  you know, on some level, you know, there's a certain level of privacy I'd like to maintain  until, like, if my son decides, hey, I want to be famous, like, you know, great, let's  go make you famous.  But I'm not going to, you know, and partially also because my wife is intensely private.  My wife would have the Jennifer zone where the cameras don't work.

Transcript:  Another interesting statement from the chat room.  And I like this.  This is from H in our chat room.  He says you can care about privacy, but you can't take the advantages of publicness without giving it up.  And there are advantages to being public.  I mean, by posting, you know, for instance, Blippi is a great advantage for people I follow who follow me because it's a recommendation engine.  So if I follow you, Patrick, and I see what movie you're watching, that's of interest to me.  You get to choose whether you're public about that or not.  I think that I'm not saying people shouldn't have the right to choose privacy.  But if you do, then you shouldn't carry a cell phone and have location services turned on.  And shouldn't be too shocked when you find out that in fact they're using that information to market.

You're you're you're going to give consent on some level for that information in public.

You had a button that was tapped.  It would be like, you'd say their stock was not two dollars.  Was it really that low?  Yeah, it was like one or two.  I mean, it was so low and you used to play taps.  We thought we should have bought some of that stock.

Start time: 2878.96
End time: 2883.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 2884.45
End time: 2993.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Uh-oh.  Hold that thought.  Dropbox says.  What does Dropbox say?  Before we get to that, I want to tell you about freshbooks.com.  Do you do invoices?  Yeah, you do invoices.  Who doesn't do invoices?  Do you have people to do invoices for you?  If you've seen my operator.  Can I show you?  This is the, you know, I'll tell you, I'm so bad at invoices.  I mentioned this before.  I once didn't invoice a company for nine months and they weren't too happy about that.  They didn't really want to pay me nine months later.  No.  So you got to send out the invoices on time.  But who likes doing that?  Well, Amber MacArthur told me this 2004 about freshbooks and it changed my life.  I and two million other folks have been using it since it started in 2004.  It is a complete.  This was the first really web 2.0 site I ever saw.  I have to say.  What you do is you upload your logo.  Then freshbooks, the invoicing is done very easily in a web form and simple to not like doing an Excel spreadsheet.  And then freshbooks emails the invoice to your client.  But one of the things I really love is that invoice has a pay him now button.  And they can pay you right away with a credit card or one of 11 online payment services.  There's also automated invoicing.  So if you send the same invoice every month, it'll do it automatically.  It'll even collect automatically if your client says, OK, so you the whole process can be collected.  The whole process can be completely transparent.  Now, I was invoicing companies in Canada as well as the US.  This was a great solution for me because it works in any currency.  I didn't have to figure out what a Canadian dollar was worth.  It looks good.  It looks professional.  And if for some reason you get a client that doesn't pay right away, automatic late payment reminders, you don't have to remember those either.  They even send paper invoices for those of you who like dead trees.  Send your client a dead tree for a small additional fee.

Start time: 2993.90

Transcript:  And I'm just at me and my stack of papers.

Start time: 2995.96
End time: 3063.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you and your papers.  They actually print, stamp and mail the invoice.  I always send it both ways to those clients because that way they get they get the best of both worlds.  They have an iPhone app, which makes it easy to track hours and put those hours right into the invoice.  It's just a great solution.  But get ready for this.  My favorite part free for the first three clients.  So for many of us, that's all we ever need.  Thirty back, a 30 day money back guarantee in all accounts.  There are no contracts.  You don't have to worry about it.  It's just use it as you need it.  And I tell you what, you're gonna love it.  Try it right now at fresh books dot com.  And once a week they have a drawing among all the people who sign up.  All of our audience members to sign up for a birthday cake.  It doesn't have to be your birthday.  Just a nice cake.  It's a good cake.  A number of our listeners have won them.  Fresh books dot com.  You'll love your invoicing.  So Dropbox changed and this is this raised a red flag.  They changed their terms of service to say, oh, by the way, if the federal government asks for your information, we will give it to them.  That's not unusual, except that they had been promising that it was encrypted.  Right.  Well, it is encrypted.  But they know the password.

Start time: 3063.88
End time: 3067.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 3068.80
End time: 3072.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the reality is, is like pretty much any other competently run company they we hope.  Right.  Because you can't really see inside of somebody else's company unless somebody gets their whistleblower on.  Right.  And then you're like, well, yeah, we have to be able to turn this federal law says we have to be able to turn this information over.  If they have access to it, if they have access to it.  Right.  So I that's where it gets interesting.

Start time: 3119.88
End time: 3130.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what Randall Schwartz told me about the service that LaCie owns called Walla.  You know about Walla?  Have you ever tried Walla?  Not even a little bit.  So Walla encrypts before they send it.  In other words, you have the keys and they don't.

Start time: 3130.92
End time: 3142.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sounds better to me.  Yeah, it's it's encrypted on your device.  Right.  And then you can see on the map it just pulls in the raw data and then the app uses processing power to encrypt.  Do you use it?  I don't, but I met with a guy at South by Southwest.

Start time: 3143.32
End time: 3146.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I would use it except that everything supports Dropbox.  Right.

Start time: 3147.15
End time: 3151.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Dropbox is great.  Walla is huge in Europe, but not so big.

Start time: 3151.98
End time: 3184.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things I like about Walla is if you give them this is a little weird and may not pass the sniff test, Patrick.  So listen, if you you can set up so you set it up.  So I set it up on my Mac that's running all the time and I gave it 100 gigs.  I said you can use this to store other people's stuff.  And if you do that, then you get as soon as they validate that you're online a sufficient amount of time, you get 100 gigs of storage free.  Cool.  So, you know, it's I don't know, it's like 20 bucks a month for my 50 gig Dropbox or 15 bucks.  It's expensive.

Start time: 3185.23
End time: 3185.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It adds up.

Start time: 3186.38
End time: 3198.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this way I get a lot of storage and now I'm storing people's stuff, but they say they slice it in such first of all, it's encrypted.  Right.  So this is why they have to have encryption because otherwise I could see I could see somebody else's porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of our sponsors, Carbonite, used to do it the Dropbox way where they would have the key.  And then somebody said, wait a minute, I'm not going to use it because I want AES encryption that I have the key.  And they did change their system so that you could.

It is more private.  If I want to get paranoid about privacy, I encrypt everything with TrueCrypt before I put it anywhere.  You know, and that's the answer.
