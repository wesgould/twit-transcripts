Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello, how are you, sir? Chairman of the board, I am well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Welcome back. Great to be back on the program. You never really left, but  good to have you back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they need to share a video on your side, by the way.  Oh, you don't see me? Not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, let me just get you back here. No, I'm just kidding.  Let me just turn on the video now that I've expressed myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this vision of Armageddon when the Russian  space astronaut is running around kicking things to make them work so they can go back to Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Heel, quick, fix it, fix it. That's Patrick Norton, my friend from the screensavers. Hello, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I'm also at Tekzilla.  Yes, he's got a new show for the last five years.  Tough to watch the screensavers these days outside of YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what's funny? I have, and I will play it for you a little later on, the first Patrick Norton screensavers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Windows 98 explainer before...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was with the day Kate left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or whatever, because I keep saying, oh, Patrick's now the host. It's from April 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you have it like on old school DVD. How adorable.  How adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know, it's funny because I have a lot of nostalgia. By the way, that's Brian Rushwood.  Shwood. We know him as Shwood, the host of the great NSFW on this network and of course, Scam School on revision three.  Hey, Brian.  Howdy, howdy.  Calling from Austin, Texas. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, considerably less travel this way. I mean, not that I don't love being there in studio.  We love you on the Skype too.  You know, I'm upstairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, Skype is doing it. I haven't tried it. Have any of you tried the new Skype five way thing that they just put out in beta?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's for Windows only, I believe at this point. You got to hold off on Mac.  And unfortunately, like I literally don't have any friends that are that are using PCs for their stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Friends don't let friends use PCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll be glad to call you, Brian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are, you know, Skype of sources, all Windows XP machines, actually.  So I have to try it. So none of you have you tried it, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have downloaded it on another machine. I have not.  I haven't had anybody to call.  So maybe I can call you later on, Brian, and we can see who else will join.  It'd be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm scared to upgrade because last time I upgraded, totally hijacked.  We had to do an entire show using UVU instead of Skype.  So I'm kind of scared to mess with it on this PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, on this old screensavers, I review Wi-Fi access spots in like thirteen hundred dollars.  Here's here's Patrick Norton.  Real presenter. Maybe that's what now it's not the presenter.  I think we're answering questions here.  I mean, if you can't find it, I don't think anybody's not aged one day.  I look the same. There's Patrick. He looks the same, too.  I look 12 in that shot.  You know what's funny, though, is that for all the nostalgia we had about the  the old days at Tech TV and screensavers and all that, it's kind of a crappy show.  Why do you say that?  It's not that good.  Just a couple of guys standing around in a basement answering questions about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was wondering who was going to take that shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And look at that, look at the because we had the net cam network.  So we had to have the double box and they had to be on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still remember, I still remember right before the Nielsen's came out.  And it's like everybody knew that the ratings, the traffic, the ratings,  we were going to get crushed in the ratings because none of these Internet  people actually watched us on television and the ratings came out.  And the numbers were surprising for a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I think I think there's about the same number of people  listening to this show has watched the screensavers.  I think it's almost exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys got over like I would imagine you have some deep seated rage  at the way everything crumbled at the height of your awesomeness with the screensavers.  Like, do you feel vindicated now?  Are you guys relaxed or do you still want to kick the corpse of those who opposed you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, dude.  The best way to think about it is the guy who's responsible for  the guy who's responsible for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  see that laugh tells me that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're talking about the famous Charles Herschel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, we don't need to bring up the guy who's responsible for bringing  tech TV and combining it with G4 pretty much bled three quarters  of a billion dollars out of Comcast before eventually signing for the Star Trek  reruns to be chopped into strange pieces and have double box  push stuff put on them, which annoyed all the people who would actually watch  Star Trek like six weeks before the box set DVDs came out and got fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know where he went?  He went to a channel called Retirement Living TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in either case, he's probably still worth more than the two of us  put together and multiplied several times.  He he he had his mission and we were not part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I'm a little worried because his new company is called TV Live.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Anyway, with that, no, I don't know.  I'm a little bitter. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I didn't I didn't notice what with the laughing in the middle.  A little bitter. Yeah, I'm a little bitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody's happy when you spend six a half six and a half years of your life  busting your ass, building something to have it, you know,  pretty much ripped out of your hands and turn into something completely differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going OK now. We're happy.  We're happy. Right, Patrick. We like what we're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, you know, we have a lot more access, a lot more households  and a lot more control, which is really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going it's going OK.  And as I said, as many people listen to this show, this one show  as as watch the screen screen savers, I think on the on the best day  was two hundred twenty five thousand people.  And that's we got about two hundred thousand people on Twitter.  That is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And do you know, I don't know how much you're able to talk about,  but are those numbers continuing to grow because it seems like podcasting  as a pie is continuing to get bigger.  Are you seeing a commensurate increase in in your numbers with?  I mean, obviously, with the network is expanding and expanding.  But like this week in tech specific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, the numbers had kind of, by the way,  we've chased Jason completely out of the show.  He's out of here. That's it.  That's the top of his chair.  Oh, there he is.  We'll talk a little more about this.  Then we'll actually get to some news.  There is some news.  In fact, I owe Jason a big thank you because he talked me  into doing something which he himself has not yet done.  Committing suicide.  Yeah, I jumped. Jason, Jason, Jason.  And he's still on the ledge.  I don't understand.  But we'll talk about.  Close. You're close.  Yeah, we'll see. We'll talk about that.  And you're going to happen this week. OK.  You should save it for May 31st.  And I'll tell you what all that is about in a second.  But let's complete the thought, which I've completely lost now.  I have no idea what we're talking about.  We're talking about numbers.  Numbers. Oh, yes, they have gone up.  You know, I believe podcasting is plateaued, actually.  I think that most podcasts that I know of  flatlined about a year and a half, two years ago.  There's some slight we were doing like one percent a month.  Something is very slight growth.  Then we started released.  We released video of this show and most of our shows.  And I was afraid initially that that would cannibalize the audio  and it would be a zero sum game and be, you know, net nothing.  But it turns out we've got it did, in fact, increase the audience about 20, 20 percent.  Now, that may be don't tell the advertisers.  It could very well just be although no, we know our numbers come from Unix.  I was afraid that maybe they were downloading audio and video, but no.  Come to think of it, the way PodTrak counts our numbers, it's unique IPs.  So we have 200000 unique IPs up from one seventy five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, like iTunes does a good job of purging people  who aren't really watching the content they download.  So if they really are listening to a full episode and watching a whole episode,  I can't imagine that if you skip five episodes, if you skip five episodes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you stop subscribing on iTunes. Right.  So it's my belief, a little bit self-saving,  but it's my belief that, in fact, going to video did help.  And of course, we're doing a lot to promote and expand.  We just hired Tom Merritt.  His last Buzz Out Loud was on Friday and he'll be joining us in a couple of weeks.  And so I think we're I think we're kind of growing.  We're going to do an iPad show. I think that's going to do very well.  Is your iPad show doing well, Jason?  Does that get good numbers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's pretty extraordinary.  I think it's getting over 100000 downloads each episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I was kind of thinking for us.  There's another one that's doing 50.  So, you know, I mean, if you pick the right topic, the Google show did 50 out of the box.  So if you pick the right topic, I think I think you'll do well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Speaking of Google, the big.  I think it's just starting, actually, the podcasting thing.  I think it's going from this sort of like incubation phase and it's going to be mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know better than others, you've been through this with blogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think it's analogous.  It's very analogous, I think, because there was a sort of hobbyist moment  in blogging and then there was the professionalism moment,  you know, what professionalization of it moment.  I think you were the first person really in Rev 3 to professionalize podcasting  and then blogging was obviously Gawker, Weblogs Inc.  Were the first people to professionalize it.  And if you look, you know, there's only maybe one podcast or two podcasts  about every topic that are published on a consistent basis.  And they generally don't have technology behind them,  a sales team behind them, a management team behind them, social media behind them,  you know, all the stuff that in order to scale this,  is necessary.  And right now there's, I guess, three people or four people doing this.  And to me, I think it's just starting, just starting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure it's completely analogous, partly because you've also got these big,  big media guys who want to play.  And a lot of the biggest podcasts are NPR  and other mainstream media outlets.  That wasn't the case with blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say it's almost podcasting as a concept is kind of it was  it was a it was a, you know, you certainly tried to change the name of it, Leo.  And that didn't work out so well.  But podcasting is dead because, you know, nobody  you're no longer restricted to downloading through iTunes.  People are using set top boxes.  People are using I mean, Blu Ray players can access, you know, directly.  Most Blu Ray players not can directly access video even through RSS streams.  Widgets are coming up on HDTVs.  I think it's gone for being like you have to go.  You have to you need this really specialized piece of software  and you've got to download this cool radio show over the Internet to.  Hey, you know what?  It's right up there next to, you know, my set top box next to my Netflix,  next to HBO, next to DirecTV or whatever it is.  In that sense, you're kind of competing against all the big names out there.  And it's all just video that happens to be ultimately it's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, in a way, we could say victory because we'll be treated as  roughly as a peer with mainstream media, but it isn't going to be us.  And then they're going to fade away by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did I hear right?  Did I hear you say that the term podcasting was dead?  Like, have we settled on a new I killed podcasting years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know why I knew that we were going to be, for instance,  doing live streaming. What do you call this?  What do you call the live stuff? It's not a podcast.  Podcasts. It's a show.  It's always been a show.  And I guess the name of the show has nothing.  It should not contain the means of distribution  because there are multiple means of distribution.  Correct. Absolutely correct.  I said that, but you know, I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it is. But it is its own category of consumption.  TV is something you sit down and give your full attention to.  Radio is something you have on while you're driving around the car.  There's got to be some different word for the fact that it's it's what's on your  iPhone while you're pulling weeds or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the thing is, Brian, those is most television sets are still on in the household  on average in eight to 10 hours a day.  And you're not telling me if there's somebody sitting in front of that television  for 10 hours, scope locked on the screen and it's activity.  And I but certainly for certain programs, they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think I think that's something that's part of the reason there needs to be  a different word for it is because there's a different level of commitment  and involvement on new media like the way I mean, look at the chat room.  We're over a thousand people right now watching us live.  The level of user engagement is so much higher that there needs to be a different  term for what it is we're doing here, if not podcasting, then something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One common complaint about podcasting and this kind of stuff is that all we ever talk  about is podcasting and this kind of stuff.  So let's stop.  Let's talk about Twitter.  Let's talk about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't talk enough about Twitter on the iPad.  How about Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the story.  In fact, and we're going to get to Google I.O. too, because Google I.O.  is Wednesday and I think Google is up to something and there's a lot.  There's a lot of tech news.  So we're going to get to all of that in just a second.  And I owe you, Jason, a debt of gratitude.  I'm going to go back onto the ledge and ask you how you're doing there in just a moment.  So don't go anywhere else before we do, though.  I do want to mention our friends at GoToMeeting, the folks from Citrix have done it again.  They've done it in the last two weeks.  Folks from Citrix have done it again.  They do such great products.  GoToMeeting is their online meeting service that eliminates your need to travel.  It takes that boring conference call and makes it something engaging.  You see us here, four of us talking.  We're seeing each other.  And with GoToMeeting, you're seeing the screen of the person you're talking to.  You're seeing the PowerPoint.  People are visual.  A conference call, it just doesn't engage.  If you've been on a call where people are wandering, they're playing Tetris or answering  I guess it's not Tetris anymore.  It's Farmville, isn't it?  They're there answering their email.  You got to try GoToMeeting.  Every one of the calls more focused, more interested, more engaged.  You will save time.  You'll be more productive.  You can get out of that meeting faster for sales presentations, for product demos, for  training, for collaborating, weekly update calls, just about any kind of conference call.  I think you got to try GoToMeeting.  And I'm going to give you a chance to do it for free for 30 days right now.  GoToMeeting.com.  Citrix gets better and better all the time.  They really know what they're doing.  128-bit SSL encryption, 24-7 support.  It's the easiest thing to install, easy for your clients, which is important.  You want to make them jump through hoops, try it right now.  30 days free.  This is the best part, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's the best part?  It's available on your iPad.  Oh, have you tried it?  And it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so cool to do GoToMeeting on an iPad because your microphone works, the audio works.  You don't need a phone.  You're just holding it.  On Wi-Fi, I'm sitting out in the backyard on a meeting.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did miss the best part.  It's like an AT&T, like you will commercial when you're at the beach.  You'll be at a meeting at the beach.  And it's like, oh, here it is.  GoToMeeting, iPad, go to the beach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will anybody ever sit at the beach having a meeting?  You will.  And it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Imagine going through a toll booth at 65 miles per hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are fun, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Watching those ads.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got to pull those up.  You know what's funny is that almost all of them actually happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, they all have.  It's like one of them was going through a toll booth at speed.  One of them was taking a meeting at the beach.  Another one was like watching TV on your phone or watching a video on your phone.  GPS directions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only one that didn't, I think really didn't happen is the one where the woman's in the  phone booth making the video call.  We have thousands of miles away across the country.  What's that?  Without stopping for directions.  How does that work?  Whoa.  He knows where he is.  Or send someone a fax.  That's an iPad.  That's a freaking iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but the iPad can't send faxes, can it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  True, true.  That app, it's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you want to send faxes from the beach?  Do you really want to send faxes from the beach?  Have you ever paid a toll?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sending a telex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Without slowing down.  Yes.  No, I didn't need a card.  I just drove right through.  Wait, he just swiped his card.  He swiped his card.  You have to do it at the exact moment.  I've done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's funny is like those-  This is the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the one.  Nobody ever does that.  And nobody ever will want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know what?  You know, iPhone HD, front-facing camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, isn't that interesting?  And the new Evo has a front-facing camera too.  And I'm starting to think-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm wanting.  That's what I've wanted every generation of the iPhone is the front-facing camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want that Dick Tracy two-way face-to-face conversation.  And it's never happened until this is the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm so excited.  Yeah, I have that on my iPhone 4.0.  It's right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah?  You lie.  He's doing it again.  Don't listen to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's incredible.  I mean, it's incredible.  Did you see that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get 20 bucks and it says they don't activate the front-facing camera on AT&T, Brian.  Oh, yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We get a note from AT&T saying with video chat capability coming later this year, along  with tethering.  Exactly.  Tethering at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, when tethering shows up.  It will do it all at the same time.  Have you ever talked to somebody on your cell phone and seen a picture of the baby?  You won't.  Not on our watch, you won't.  Look at that cute little baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you ever watched jerky video of your baby?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you ever had your-  See, that's straight out of 2001, a space odyssey.  And it didn't happen in 2001 either.  Here's one more.  Have you ever opened doors with the sound of your phone?  That hasn't really happened either.  Well, yeah.  It happens in my car.  You talk to your car and it opens?  No, you don't even have to.  You just get near it and it opens.  The fob, yeah.  Yeah, the fob.  And Schlage makes a lock that you can use your iPhone to open the door.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The new way to get locked out of your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't have your iPhone.  I'm out of reach dead on my iPhone.  I can't go home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I was thinking of putting it on the front door of the cottage because if somebody calls  up and says, I'm out front and I can't get in, I don't have to come down.  I just go, okay.  And you do it from the iPhone.  I have one of them.  I just haven't installed it.  So I guess that's close enough.  That's a you will or you do.  Car card, please.  Carried your medical history in your wallet.  Not yet, but soon, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Tom Selleck voicing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who is it?  Or attended a meeting.  Who is that?  That does sound familiar.  Tom Selleck.  It's Tom Selleck in tight short shorts.  Doing the two in your bare feet.  And they have a few other ideas.  You will.  All of these things came true.  I think that's the funniest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, so many of them happened because of the experience you get with the iPhone,  which was only available.  AT&T was the first network to have those things.  So they kind of fulfilled on their promise for all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I think when these ads were made in 1993, they'd already signed a 20 year deal  with Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're like, listen, you guys are going to come back from the dead and you're going to  create a magical device and we're going to have the only one.  All right.  You will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, that's another story that I don't know if it's a real story that was a gizmodo.  One of the I think was gizmodo again.  Why do they keep coming up with these?  They said, oh, we looked through the court papers from last October and Apple has a deal  through 2012 with AT&T, except of course, that was three years ago.  Maybe they don't anymore.  Does anybody believe that the iPhone will ever be on anybody besides AT&T in 2010?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In 2010, I'm going to say probably not.  Jason, you must know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's not saying.  Oh, your mic's moved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought that was a clever way of you like avoiding actually saying anything.  I was like, for some reason, my mic's not talking.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually have the answer.  Steve Jobs just told me on text, he said, tell everybody we'll only be on AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what's happened is that AT&T keeps sweetening the pot and Apple keeps saying,  well, we're going to Verizon and then said, OK, you can have $30 unlimited on the iPad.  No problem.  Month to month, no problem.  Anything you want.  Because they're making so much money.  I mean, one third of new customers to AT&T over the last three years are new.  I mean, one third of their customers are new buying iPhones.  It has propelled them to as close to you.  I mean, Verizon's gone down, AT&T's gone up.  On the other hand, Verizon has now said, we don't need the Nexus One.  We got the incredible.  We got the droid.  We got the heiress.  Sprint is coming out with Sprint may be back, baby.  This new Evo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That Evo, it's the first time that I've ever regretted being an iPhone user where I was  like, oh, that would be so awesome.  I kind of wish I was on Sprint.  And I'm like, what am I saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who am I?  What is this?  It's a really nice phone.  I get to handle one at CTIA this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've held one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've held one.  I've used one.  Screen spectacular.  4.3 inches.  Yeah, it's a really nice screen.  It's a really nice device.  I'm a little, I was actually at first I was a little bummed that it's going to cost the  built in Wi-Fi router is going to cost you 30 bucks a month.  But I realized that that's half the price of getting their wireless broadband for a  3G, 4G overdrive modem.  So I can kind of see the angle they're playing on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're also going to charge $10 more for 4G even if you can't like if you live in San  Francisco, if you can't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're charging a $10 fee for all network access to give you an unlimited cap on 3G.  Everybody has 4G is an unlimited cap.  They're going to charge you an extra 10 bucks a month to basically take the cap off of the  3G bandwidth.  Because currently, I guess about a year and a half, two years ago, Sprint finally fell  in line with AT&T and Verizon and capped your monthly downloads for your 3G modems, which  kind of broke my heart a little bit because I had an unlimited bandwidth plan with them.  Now the unlimited bandwidth plan is back in kind of a weird way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were always a Sprint fan, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sprints done.  My customer service on the telephone side of things actually is why I left Sprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I left.  Their service was so good.  But I loved the Sprint PCS and I liked their phones a lot.  I was sad to leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the Sprint, I've been using the Sprint data.  The Sprint data has been, generally speaking, incredibly fast and incredibly solid.  Pretty much everywhere I've traveled, even in the sticks.  In theory, Verizon's got some more network coverage, but their bandwidth was slower and  AT&T, everybody owns an iPhone.  Raise your hands.  You kind of know what the AT&T data plan lifestyle is like.  So I never even thought about buying an AT&T data modem.  The Overdrive is a really neat piece of hardware.  I'm just kind of waiting for 4G to roll out anywhere near where I live, closer to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  top.  Supposedly San Francisco by the end of the year, they're trying to push it.  But I have a couple of Portlanders in here, Justin and Justin, who, and this was my experience  in Vegas.  We seem to agree.  4G is, in most cases, no faster than 3G and in many cases slower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder how much of that is the website, the implementation or the location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well look, Vegas is a Sprint town and it was a heavy 4G promotion.  Clearwire was...  Were you there at CES or...  I was there at other times as well as CES and it just sucked.  But you're right, CES, it was really terrible.  But you know, I don't think there are a lot of Sprint users at CES.  They were all iPhone users.  And you guys are in Portland and you said the same thing.  Again, location specific, but even at its best, not particularly good.  So I have yet to hear somebody go, 4G, it's great, it's great, I love the 4G.  It's all hype, it seems to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, at least it's uncapped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uncapped is good as opposed to the unlimited 5GB that everybody else does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At times, I know when I come to San Francisco, I stay just outside of SFO, but the hotel  has terrible Wi-Fi, so I actually use a...  3G?  ... tethered iPhone and I get like 1.3 megabits down on that.  3G ain't bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, supposedly...  So Patrick's talking about the fact that Sprint is going to allow you to use this as a Wi-Fi  access spot, this Evo, up to six devices using the 4G or the 3G if you're in a 3G area.  It's actually eight devices.  Is it eight?  Yeah.  So it's kind of like a little Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  It's a 4G Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty awesome.  Yeah.  I think I'm going to buy one of those, I think.  I think the battery life is going to be atrocious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The demonstration, they had two of them side by side, live streaming on quick, and it looked  amazing.  And of course, that screen is gigantic.  It's a really pretty phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I am seeing some people in the chat room...  Make some nice hardware.  I am seeing some people in the chat room who are saying that they're getting...  They like 4G.  Biggie John, how fast is it though?  Rob Schneider.  Oh, hi Rob.  Big fan.  How fast is it?  You know, that's the question.  I mean, people say, oh, I like it.  But what does that mean?  Now, let's get some numbers.  Anyway, the phone, just for the size of the screen and the fact that it's...  I have to say Android is coming on strong.  The latest stats from NPD say that there were more Android handsets sold in the first three  months of 2010 than there were iPhones.  Eric Schmidt, last week at the shareholders meeting, said 65,000 Android handsets a day.  Dwarfed by Nokia, dwarfed by other companies, but still respectable, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and continuing to grow.  This is what you get when you create an open platform.  This is kind of the PC versus Mac debate of the early 90s all over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what happens when Verizon spends $100 million in one quarter to promote a single  phone and spend a lot of time promoting Android in the process.  It's not just one phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like you've got the incredible and all these...  The phones are the subcategories, but the brand in general, I think, is doing very well.  And it makes me wonder what has Apple done with its lead for the last three years.  These tiny incremental increases of the capability of the iPhone are nothing compared  to the leaps forward that the droid's doing.  I can't believe that I'm even considering getting a phone besides the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree.  And I've been using a Nexus One in lieu of an iPhone for months and I've been very...  Jason, didn't you switch to a Nexus One as well?  Oh, you're muted again, sweet.  Jason.  Jason.  Muted.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We can't hear you.  He's chattering away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's going on and on and on.  Oh, you know what, Jason?  This time it was my fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did he say you were muted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I had you turned down because you dropped off and I turned you down to call you back  and then I...  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jason.  No problem.  No, I have a Nexus One and I found that I stopped using it because I couldn't get some  of the applications I had on my iPhone.  And so now I'm basically iPhone and BlackBerry and iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I find, see, I have the iPad so everything I really...  If I need something, I use the iPad.  I love...  Some of the Nexus One apps are great.  Mint is now on Nexus One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I feel like I'm drowning in so much connectivity now because I have...  We are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're drowning in connectivity, isn't it?  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have the iPad and I have my MacBook Air, my desktop and my iPhone and my BlackBerry  and the real loser has been my MacBook Air, which I just opened today for the first time  in like three weeks.  That's not connectivity, Jason.  That's a lot of toys.  Connectivity is bandwidth, 3G, Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just ways to accomplish the task.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I find the iPad is the most delightful way to check my AdSense for the day or the  analytics or chart beat or email.  It's really nice to just read email at the end of the day or in the morning on my iPad.  I'm shocked at how much I love the device.  And as pissed off as I am about it being locked up and all the other things, that email thread  with Steve Jobs and the Gizmodo writer where he's like, listen, our idea here is to make  things work and user experience and we have the best user experience and what have you  accomplished in your life?  Nothing.  So shut up.  Wasn't that incredible?  I love it.  I mean, people are like, Jason, how could you write back to one of your employees, like  when I told that employee to like, congratulations on being employee number 4000 at Yahoo.  And everybody's like, oh my God, Jason, so offensive.  And then Steve Jobs writes like, you have no life.  You've contributed nothing to society.  I have done so much.  We've done so much.  You need to shut up now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an amazing.  But he did it in such a classy kind of way.  Steve Jobs struck this really careful tone where he even used the word gosh at one point.  Like, he's just sort of like, golly, why are you so upset about all this?  It was a very interesting exchange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jobs, it's a different jobs than I think I've ever heard of or met before.  He first of all, he's engaging with a stranger over email.  I mean, this is the guy who's famous for somebody.  Somebody had a meeting with Steve Jobs.  Jobs comes in.  The guy says, how was your weekend job?  Says, can we raise the tone of the conversation a little bit?  I mean, this is a guy who has no time for small talk.  I think some are saying because of his illness that he is maybe a little bit of a different  Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's a one a.m.  It's a one a.m.  One a.m.  email thread with like four back and forth.  So, I mean, it's awesome.  It's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ryan Tate was testing out his new liver that night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that what you're saying?  I mean, with somebody else's liver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  No, no, let's not make those jokes.  So Ryan Tate, 934 p.m.  Ryan Tate to S Jobs.  And he had just seen the iPad ad talking about revolution and Dylan.  It says, Ryan says, if Dylan were 20 today, how would he feel about your company?  What do you think the iPad had the faintest thing to do with revolution?  Revolutions are about freedom.  Now, that's very, a very incendiary thing to say.  If I get that email, I ignore it at best.  At worst, I might say, F you.  Jobs responds.  Yep.  Freedom from programs that steal your private data.  Freedom from programs that trash your battery.  Freedom from porn.  Yep.  The times they are a changing and some traditional PC folks feel like they're working  and some folks feel like their world is slipping away.  It is.  Now, you've got to know all the subtext to really understand what that message is.  But that's a very rich, you know, four sentences or five sentences in there.  That's quite interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, he's talking about Windows and Microsoft, like, and he's coming back and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this goes on and on and on.  In fact, at one point, Ryan writes several paragraphs and I couldn't get through it.  Steve responds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.  The last one is the best.  Read that one.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So back and forth, back and forth.  We're now at two twenty in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ryan has written.  And by the way, Steve's responding within minutes to each of these.  Do you think it's really Steve?  I think it is.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Ryan says, I don't like Apple's pet police force literally kicking in my co-workers doors.  He's finally admitted that he works for Gawker, but I suppose the courts will have the last  say on that and I can't say I'm worried, which is quite a shot.  Jobs response.  Again, I think fairly even handed.  You are so misinformed.  No one kicked in any doors.  You're believing a lot of erroneous blogger reports.  Microsoft had now that now this is getting back to the windows and Microsoft saying you  can only use the Windows API.  Microsoft had has every right to enforce whatever rules for their platform that they want.  If people don't like it, they can write for another platform, which some did, by the way.  Macintosh was the benefactor there, or they can buy another platform, which some did.  Clearly, Jobs is a smart guy.  He's leaving a lot between the lines, but it's very clear that he's talking about Mac.  Mac was a benefactor there or the benefitter there.  As for us, we're just doing what we can to try and make and preserve the user experience  we envision.  You can disagree with us, but our motives are pure.  That's very interesting because, of course, people impute evil motives.  There certainly are pure reasons for Apple to do, and that's what they're doing.  They've always said these are our reasons.  By the way, he says, and this is the shot, it is 2.20 in the morning.  The bars are closed.  By the way, what have you done that's so great?  Do you create anything or just criticize others' work and belittle their motivations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Damn, Steve Jobs threw that job.  Wow!  Snap!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you didn't!  But even then, it's like that's such a minor swipe, and that's after he's dedicated a half  hour of his very valuable time.  I mean, I thought it's very difficult to engage somebody who's obviously fired up over something  and to come out looking so classy.  I would say Steve won here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did he not?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Steve Jobs, four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ryan, nothing.  It's funny because Ryan published it, and it's published in Valley Wag.  Ryan is saying that he thinks that this freedom from porn line will resonate for years and  will hurt Apple.  You know, that's the headline, but I don't think that's the headline.  That's the takeaway from this.  The takeaway is a new Steve Jobs who took a lot of time with a dick and in every respect  responded not only appropriately, but I thought fairly coherently and fairly effectively.  I think he's trying to change his position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's actually trying to say, like, listen, here is my position.  You don't have to accept it, but I want you to understand clearly why we're doing this.  It's user experience and malware and viruses and porn.  It's amazing.  Make people not want to use Windows computers, and the reason people are buying our computers  is because they don't have those things.  Well, it's not that they don't have those things, it's just they're finally getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a large enough user base to get the attraction of people that are violating it.  And saying you can't get porn on the iPhone, you know, as soon as they disable IP access  and take the browser out of there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can get porn.  You can get plenty of porn.  Take it from me.  There's no lack of porn.  I mean, you know what I mean.  Well, I think you're just talking about the application layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, like the application layer isn't FUBARD.  It isn't like malware everywhere.  I mean, it's very hard to get a virus onto the iPhone.  I mean, how do you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Now, he raises an interesting point, which says, and this, to me, there's some reflection  to this to the Facebook guy, Elliott Schrage, who talks to the New York Times, and I'm going  to get to that in a second, where he says, hey, you don't have to buy an iPad.  This is how we do it.  We're trying to create a vision.  We're enforcing what we envision, but nobody's making you buy.  It's a competitive world.  You have a choice.  Is that how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the ultimate, that's the ultimate rebuttal.  Whereas just like, you don't like it, go somewhere else.  That's what we're about.  This is how we're, you know what?  When you start your company, you do it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't argue with that.  It's not like Apple has a monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I actually thought that was the best point in the whole thing.  You know, like the products, don't buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody's making you buy it.  And here's the good news.  There's, there is solid competition from Android, from Google.  I think Windows Phone 7 is going to be pretty dynamic.  There's BlackBerry's not dead yet.  WebOS, Palm, HP bought Palm, that they're alive.  I mean, there's competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  BlackBerry is the large, by far the largest platform in terms of smartphone usage.  It dwarfs both the iPhone and Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although Android's coming on, I mean, but you're right.  BlackBerry is still a good sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Android is still a fraction of iPhone users and iPhone users are a fraction of BlackBerry users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're all a fraction of Nokia, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, worldwide, the US Nokia barely has a presence at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I have to say, Nokia is struggling.  In the US primarily.  Yeah, we're talking about smartphones too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can be dominant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can be dominant in terms of sales and still be struggling, can't you?  You could be number one today and still be in trouble.  Am I wrong, Jason?  I mean, isn't that the case?  The trend is not their friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are plenty of examples like Yahoo was number two in search and had a huge market share and just slowly watched it ride down.  AOL.  30 million user accounts down to 3 million user accounts.  I mean, you can make a case that Apple's had that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I want to take a break.  We got to talk about Facebook because there is a direct correlation between what Steve Jobs just said and what Elliott Schrag just said in the New York Times.  The New York Times last week.  And I want to address that in just a second.  And I still want to talk you off that ledge.  Can I get a jump?  Jump?  Jump?  Before we do that, though, I want to talk a little bit about Squarespace.  Our good friends in New York City, Squarespace.com, they do a site that is just really made for somebody who wants to create a website, not just a blog.  Photographers use it for their portfolios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought on that iPhone app, what's great about it for me is, you know, they do Schwud.com.  And again, like you nailed it on the CSS customization.  You cannot tell it's it's it's, you know, it looks amazing.  But what's funny is I always intend to find out where my traffic is coming from and how I'm doing.  But I never think to do it when I'm at the computer.  It's always when I'm sitting on a bus or waiting for a plane.  I just decided to poke in the online app looks phenomenal on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you use I can see you use their Twitter plugin.  And they have a lot of social media plugins.  Makes it very easy.  So easy as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I love the fact that my website organically automatically updates based on my other postings on other things.  So that people going to the website get a new, fresh feeling every time they go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really nice.  Did you do the design?  Do you have somebody come into it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I had an older website that had some elements that are here.  But they when when we signed on and they became a sponsor of Scam School, they had one of their CSS ninjas put it together.  And he just nailed it.  It's amazing.  Beautiful, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's easy enough now that it's set up.  I can actually create entire new pages and update the content.  It's good for me.  Who knows just enough to be dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, if you want this this column to be wider, you just drag it over.  I mean, it's really, really simple.  Anyway, give it a try.  It's it's free for the next two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because, you know, it's like you don't you don't jump ship from one platform to another when it comes to your website very often.  So that definitely adds up.  Make it worthwhile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You bet.  So, Jason, you wrote, I thought anybody who doesn't subscribe to Jason's newsletter is really missing the boat.  You publish this thing how often?  Weekly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It depends.  I took four months off when London was born.  And then I came out of this fog and I wrote literally a dozen pieces and I've been refining them and then I released them like one a week.  But I've done about four in the last month.  So about I would say weekly is the max.  And then, you know, probably monthly is.  By the way, Weezer?  No age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just found that out.  You buzzed this and I said it's Weezer without an H, you geezer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do I know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it is a little ridiculous that I'm going to nursery school benefits and like Weezer's playing in the backyard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, if Weezer shows up, I'm there.  I'm there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Basically, Weezer's kid goes to the school.  Oh, that's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which Weezer?  Which Weezer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The lead singer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've had Jeff Wilcox on the show a number of times.  He's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anyway, the newsletter is at Jason Nation.  I basically set up a listserv and there's 23,000 people on it.  And yeah, it's a way for me to have intelligent dialogue with people because the open web is just not a good place for that anymore.  You stopped blogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You stopped allowing comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I basically do like photo blogs on my personal blog.  You know, I put up photos or videos.  But when I put stuff on the open web, I just get every stupid person or mentally disabled person.  You know, like the all feel.  Always political.  Always politically correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason Galacanis, ladies and gentlemen.  You just called your fans mentally disabled.  It's not the fans, it's the trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's basically like everybody who I've either fired or beaten as a competitor over a 20-year career feels the need to check in on everything.  It just becomes this dialogue of jaders.  I know what you mean.  And so it's just like if I send it on email, I'll get replies back from like CEOs and they'll write 500 words or a thousand words or VCs or punch lines.  It's a much better dialogue for me.  I get more out of it.  So anyway, I find can I find this Facebook issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's what did I say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jen, what did I call it?  You've got the title.  You've been zucked.  I know something like, you know, we talked the last time you were on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You pretty much said the same thing that Zuckerberg talked about this like six months ago.  Right.  Yeah, you said that Zuckerberg was well, I like the analogy here.  You said he's overplaying his hand.  It's a poker analogy.  I know you're a very serious poker player.  What do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In poker, when you think your hand is stronger than it actually is and you bet like you have the nuts, the best hand, and you behave that way, a lot of times somebody will turn over cards and you find out, gee, I didn't actually have the best hand.  You said you think about all the ways you can win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But not the ways you can lose.  And not think about enough about where the risks are.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the risk with Facebook, I think, is a repeated and people really attacked me on Twitter because I said I don't trust Zuckerberg and I think he's got an ethics problem.  Well, I think the chat transcripts that have come out, all the lawsuits and the behavior of his organization show exactly that.  Right.  And people don't trust him and they don't trust the service and they should not.  And, you know, if you say Facebook to people, I think, and do word association, the two words people will say are, you know, you're not going to get a lot of money.  And the words people will say are Farmville and, you know, like lack of privacy or not trustworthy.  That is a terrible thing to have your service pinned with is being the untrustworthy service, the service that violates your privacy.  And it's the first company, I think, in the history of the Internet and technology that has been pegged as the place to lose your privacy.  Right.  You know, in the place you can't trust.  And that is not a good thing to happen.  I've got a question for you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a question because it's in and maybe I'm way off base here, but I thought it seems to me like this may be a branding issue because back when my space was still a player, it was my space versus Facebook.  And Facebook was winning because it had a reputation for being able to keep your stuff private.  You get my default.  Everything was open on my space, but you could say things on Facebook that you wouldn't want your mom to see.  And that's why people were melting down when their moms would actually join on Facebook and they had to see these pictures of what they're up to.  If that was how much of this problem, how much of this is because they built a reputation for being good at protecting your privacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's privacy and privacy.  There's privacy like mom not seeing your post versus privacy like whether or not third party applications, internal databases, whether or not your your your actual information goes away when you delete your account actually being able to delete your account.  You know what I mean?  It's like the overt level is like mom's not going to see my post because mom doesn't have an edu address.  Ha ha ha.  And then it's a secondary level of or lack of privacy would be what's happening to all the information on there.  Can you refuse to have third party applications use your information or some of the second party services that work with with Facebook?  There's a lot of layers to privacy going on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you seen this Will Moffat site open book where Will Moffat dot get hub dot com?  He does.  He's using the Facebook API.  So this is all legitimate Facebook searches and he gives you a few samples like cheated test and lost virginity and shows you that what people obviously think this is private and it's not.  And you know, this was a concern.  I read your post, Jason, and then I talked to my family.  I talked to my family.  I took my kids and I said, you know, you can use Facebook.  It's fine as long as you understand that everything you post on it potentially will be public, whether through a lapse through a change in policy.  At some point, it may become public.  And so my strong suggestion to them was go ahead and use it.  Just only use it as you would use Twitter where everything is public.  Right.  And they don't want to do that.  They said, no, no.  But that's the whole point is that we can have private conversations on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If there was a viable competitor to Facebook today, I think we would see their numbers tanking.  What the problem and the issue is, there isn't really a viable competitor out there who does private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, like the diaspora that they're trying to put together, terrible name, by the way, terrible, terrible name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, you understand it's the wandering tribes of Israel.  It's the diaspora.  Right.  So we've left Facebook.  So we're wandering in the desert.  So they should probably have called it Oasis, not Diaspora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's probably like my space means something.  It's a word that that means, oh, I get it.  It's a place that's mine.  You know, Facebook.  Oh, I get it.  This is my public perception.  This is my face.  Well, it's a project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do that meant search.  Well, some brads are obvious.  Some brads.  It's a bad name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It may not be the name of whatever they come up with.  And, you know, it's just for NYU students who thought, oh, this would be, you know, we'd like to do this.  They asked for ten thousand dollars.  Have you seen what it's up to now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, dude, there's no doubt that this is addressing a very pent up demand.  Like they have nothing.  They have no product.  They have no they've got the you are there in school still.  But then but people are throwing money.  They're like, yes, please create an alternative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I gave them when when I gave them one hundred bucks, as I deleted my Facebook account, I gave them one hundred bucks just to say, just kind of more of a statement than anything else.  They were at five, I think twenty three thousand already doubled what they'd asked for.  They are now at one hundred seventy one.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is turning into an age around the financing and they don't have to avoid any equity.  This is all a donation equity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't have to have a freaking design.  You have to have a product at all.  So, you know, you know what Ken Sheppardson, our CTO here said, he said they should write 50 lines of PHP code and go to Belize.  They got no commitment to do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but it does speak volumes to the fact that people feel like Facebook has double tricked them, double crossed them.  And they have.  It sure does.  It started as the closed service and we had the discussion of, you know, the, you know, hey, we've changed our service to protect you more.  Click here to say OK and have all your stuff become public.  I mean, it was the ultimate bait and switch.  This guy's the next Mark Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at him.  I could tell.  I'm not trusting my data this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If not them, I can tell you there's a lot of high level discussions going on right now in Silicon Valley.  And I've I've been pulled into a couple of them.  And what would you do?  What would you do to do it right?  Well, it's very simple.  You just come out with it and say, I'm creating a new version that is Facebook, a new social network that is by default private.  And if you want something to be public, you have to explicitly do it.  And we promise that you will get a warning dialog box that you'll have to click to make something public.  And it's simple as that.  And we will never change the default from private.  It'll always be private.  And, you know, the point is absolutely correct.  If they had just stuck with one thing and not become obsessed with, you know, the public facing Twitter, which is really what drove them.  And this is the other reason I really don't care for Zuckerberg is because I feel like he's just he's just chasing.  He's just chasing everybody.  And he's so the thing that makes me crazy about him is you can tell he's so brilliant and such a good executor on things and has such low moral.  Low moral fiber that that's a really dangerous conversation.  I think he's immoral or amoral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know what I mean by the difference?  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is he evil or just lacks ethics?  I think he is.  And I said in my newsletter Asperger's like I was very careful to say like because I don't want to diagnose anybody.  But I don't think that he cares or particularly thinks about the users.  I think he thinks about building a huge hundred billion dollar company and becoming the next Bill Gates.  And he thinks about himself and he thinks about what would make the biggest, most powerful company.  And it doesn't ever occur to him.  Well, what did I promise the users?  And, gee, if other companies came up with these great ideas, should I really be, you know, incorporating them into my product like this?  Maybe I should try to buy some of these companies.  I mean, this sort of a gentleman's rule in the valley where like if you were going to knock off Foursquare, you would at least go to them and say, hey, listen, I think your features are great.  I'm inspired by you.  May we buy the company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you did that to me.  I think Jason actually did do that to me just before you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, just before I stabbed you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was right before then.  Oh, now he froze.  OK.  OK.  Jason and I are buddies.  We have never stopped being buddies.  And I don't know what that that was another case of just kind of things spin out of control a little bit.  So and I'm a little sensitive to when people like Facebook say, look, this is bloggers.  It's out of control.  In fact, they even said it's the media that hates us.  Our users love us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the users don't know.  That's because they don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I deleted my Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did not deactivate it.  I deleted it.  I deleted my private page and our Twitter page and our public stuff.  And the reason is not because I don't know.  I know.  I know exactly.  You know, I only post stuff that's public there.  I'm not worried about my privacy.  I'm not worried about them selling my data.  Yeah, I'm not worried about them misrepresenting their policies.  I don't want to coerce other people into participating in Facebook because that's how they would participate with me.  I don't want to be a shill for Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you use the word coerce, which I thought was a little bit strong.  You're not physically threatening them if they say, listen, you need to use the Facebook.  I mean, it's like you are giving a tacit endorsement of it, which maybe you're uncomfortable with.  But I mean, I think coerce is kind of a strong word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But look, if you want to see that picture I posted on Facebook or you want to see that video I posted on Facebook.  How about compel?  I think coerce is exactly the right word in my mind because I'm incenting people to join Facebook in order to interact with me.  One of the things I was doing is I had two accounts, a personal account and a public account with 5,000 fans.  And those people we were wishing them happy birthday, right?  Because we know what their birthday is.  It says 30 people a day.  It's their birthday.  It's that kind of interaction that we were offering that you don't get anywhere else.  I don't wish you happy birthday on Twitter.  And in a way, if you want to be part of that, you have to be.  It's the same thing with Farmville.  There's a subtle coercion, Brian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still have a problem with the word coercion.  And again, I understand if you don't want to be associated with it, that's one thing.  But to say that somehow you're forcing someone against their will.  I mean, unless...  No, not against their will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not against their will.  Brian and I both work at nightclubs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Coercion usually involves like having to donate some of your, you know, gate so you can get your equipment back out the back door.  There's usually just a stronger association with that.  You're right.  I'll use the word encourage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is encourage okay?  Yeah.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So am I the only one who has a really hard time, anytime I see Mark Zuckerberg's name now, divorcing this person from the character portrayed in The Accidental Billionaires?  Like now that I've read that book on autopilot, actually, it's so damning of him that it's just like, it's hard for me to separate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it interesting though that all the things that were like the recent IAM stuff we're seeing all kind of coincides exactly with the way he's portrayed in that book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard not to notice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's pretty scary.  I mean, and the fact is, you know, the business insider has done an incredible job with these scoops.  And I think that they have a source who was involved in some of the lawsuits.  You think it's Eduardo?  I don't know.  And I don't want to even insinuate that I might know, like I'm an insider.  I know, which I do sometimes.  This is one of those cases where I do not know.  Really, I don't.  And I think somebody who's involved in that lawsuit who got screwed by him, and there's a long list of people now, right?  Eduardo, ConnectUGuys, and a lot of other people.  They have access to discovery documents and discovery documents for those people don't know when you're in a lawsuit, there's a period of discovery and you have to legally give up all of this information, especially with it.  So when these lawsuits happen, they might say any communication with Zuckerberg we need, including your IM transcripts, including your emails, whatever it is.  Well, the stuff that was really damning is he broke, according to this scoop, I don't know if it's true or not, but reportedly he broke into journalists' emails accounts.  And then he faced a Harvard ethics review and he also wrote that IM chat.  All of that was in the accidental billionaires, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And also the IM chat transcript that said he was purposely going to delay the launch of ConnectU site, which they paid him to build in order to screw them and launch Facebook at the same time and set them back.  By the way, that's like all fraud.  That's like very high level fraud.  Remember, he's a college sophomore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know what, though?  That doesn't fly.  If you're 18, 19, 20 years old and you want to be a billionaire and you want to raise hundreds of millions in venture capital, you can't have it both ways.  If you're savvy enough to raise tens of millions of venture capital when you're 18 or 19 years old, you know right from wrong.  And if you did electronic trespassing and some hacker who did it can go to jail for five years, you know, at Zuckerberg, Ken.  And so, you know, that's true.  That's true.  This 20, 18 year old hackers who went to jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And, you know, I think this, you know, like a little bit of Harvard, you know, glow on him, you know, gets him a pass and this, you know, anointed by all these venture capitalists and being so effective at building product gives him a little bit of the money.  And I think it built up his ego and he is overplaying his hand.  And now the chickens are coming home to roost.  And it's in mainstream media now.  Once a virus like this gets unleashed in mainstream media and the movie comes out in a couple of months, October 10, Facebook's done.  I think Facebook's done.  So this is the beginning of the downhill.  Gosh, that would have 400 million users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How could it be done?  Well, 30 million users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, how could anything get huge like that get done in my space?  You know, got collapsed.  People said, you know, I'm going to be a billionaire.  People said, friends to would never collapse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not going to happen until there's an alternative.  People like you, like you, Brian, need and use Facebook.  It's a valuable tool for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  And I would like to point out that this exact scenario was posited on this week in tech like two years ago.  I can't remember if it was Dvorak or who, but they were everyone was marveling at how big Facebook had gotten.  And I think it was John C. Dvorak that pointed out like the problem is it's a fickle market.  These are adolescents that are choosing one trendier thing over another thing.  And that comes and goes.  And I think the moment that something else like out of the entire pitch that Jason put together, the most important word was new.  Everything after that, I'm sure is good.  And privacy is good.  But the moment the kids hear new, there's a chance there's another option.  There's another way to go, especially when you have such a bad PR problem, the way Facebook does right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you think it's sinking in with real people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or at least the perception's reality, I guess.  You know, I don't know.  So May 31st is Facebook quit Facebook Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems to me that more people will join Facebook that day than will quit it.  In fact, more people will join Facebook in one hour of that day than will quit it.  In fact, maybe even more people will join Facebook in one minute than will quit it.  I mean, it's thousands, maybe tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands.  It's a drop in the bucket.  Yeah, they are up to almost 2000 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I quit.  I quit Facebook.  So when are you going to quit, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got me to quit.  I am.  Jump, jump, jump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I'm right now.  I am considering it.  Why haven't you?  Well, I've basically my usage of Facebook now is limited to like syndicating marketing stuff from Twitter or whatever.  I don't really use it that much.  But I agree with your argument.  And I think I'm going to clear out.  I got to get my photos out of there.  And then once I get my photos out, I think I may deactivate it this week.  Because the truth is, I don't get any value out of it.  I really don't find it valuable.  Yeah, I don't miss it at all.  I don't even know if it was much PR value, to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, I got more press requests.  I got press requests from quitting from CNN, from CBC, from the several local television newspapers.  I mean, Financial Times printed my name and said, in fact, the one of the reasons I didn't do all those interviews,  I didn't want to be known as Facebook quitting boy.  I mean, I didn't want it to become my trade show.  Well, can you actually, can you really get your photos out of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, here's my suggestion.  And one of the reasons I was unhesitant to quit is I'd been using back up a file along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  And this had, you know, I have all my Facebook stuff.  If I go to my Facebook, you know, my backup a file account and I look in my archives, I've got every photo, every video that I've ever posted there.  And unfortunately, I did this a while ago.  So I'm going to go back to my Facebook account.  And unfortunately, I did this a while ago.  So I don't even have to think about it.  It was like there's nothing I've lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they don't have archival copies stashed anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook.  Oh, you mean, is it going to go away because I deleted it?  That's a very good question.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think if other people comment on it, I don't think it goes away.  No, it's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It becomes an anonymous post that somebody's commented on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's like it's even worse.  I mean, it's just like how slimy can you get?  You know, it's like just the worst.  It's a full disclosure.  I'm an angel investor in Backupify and they were at the Open Angel Forum and I am backing it up there.  So you're done.  I forgot. Yeah.  So I think I can I think I can I think I can jump.  Yeah, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I was actually very relieved when I thought about it.  They've got everything in here, you know, and it's actual JPEGs.  You know, I can actually see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, this was a big controversy if we were in.  What will probably happen this week, unfortunately, is because I've been involved in some of these discussions.  I don't think Facebook likes this backup feature.  Oh, really?  You can be pretty sure that now that you've mentioned it, it's going to be turned off.  You're kidding.  Yeah.  It's it's been like a little bit of an underground thing.  But other people who've built backup tools for Facebook or export your social graph have been shut down and sent law legal letters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's not good.  Well, quick folks.  Join back up a fight.  Com before the show airs.  Those of you watching live and for those of you listening, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And for those of you who had, you know, one thing people don't know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stuff like that.  Oh, there's lots of ways.  And the truth is, I never posted anything.  I have another somewhere else because I knew that Facebook was downgrading the quality of all the pictures you post there.  Those are not full quality.  So it's a lousy place to store pictures.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is interesting.  So it's like you're quitting Facebook on principle because as you mentioned, you're not worried about the privacy settings to you.  You use Facebook as a megaphone, right?  And I think all of us are of the same same.  Yeah, we're the wrong people to talk to.  Talk to my kids.  Right.  Well, and that's who that's who I wish was represented on the panel because all four of us are are the type of people who are producers of content, not consumers.  Or at least we don't consume.  We don't use Facebook as a well.  That's why I'm taking a bigger hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I never I never used it as a megaphone.  I started signing up for it and just realizing that there just wasn't a lot of value out of it for me.  Plus, also, actually, I didn't particularly want the the difficulties in locking things down for me early on when I finally showed up on Facebook.  I just I just didn't trust it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at this business, this graphic from Business Day in The New York Times.  It was May 12th.  Brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was actually going to bring that up.  There's 50 different settings with more than 170 options.  Facebook says they want to make privacy controls as granular as possible.  The reality is it's a nightmare the way in the last couple of evolutions of Facebook to try to figure out, you know, with everything basically being default public, there's a ridiculous, ridiculous number of options inside of this.  You know, it'd be great.  And maybe they'll do this on Diaspora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what if you just had like three different orbits?  You had the innermost orbit, which was your family, and you could place it wasn't just you were a friend of them or you're not a friend of them.  But you had like, you know, you had you had your Mercury orbit closest to the sun.  You had your Jupiter orbit where there these are friends.  These are colleagues.  These are coworkers.  And then there's the last orbit, which is people you met at a party and you kind of like.  And you could very quickly and simply and easily decide what level of content you were releasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's that opt in versus opt out.  All they had to do.  All they have to do today is bake it.  And this was kind of the reason I think regular people don't understand the problem is they think this is still the case that everything is private unless you say otherwise.  And if they just said everything is private, if you flip a switch, you can make it public.  But it is private will stay private forever and ever.  But they don't.  In fact, this is the other part of the New York Times infographic.  The Facebook privacy statement in 2005 was a thousand words.  Today it's five thousand eight hundred thirty words.  It's bigger than the U.S. Constitution, twice the size of my spaces, more than ten times bigger than flickers, five times bigger than Twitter's.  It's it's unreadable.  Now, here's my question.  Is this intentional?  Are they obfuscating things or are they actually well meaning?  Do they just kind of screw up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think this is all part of a master strategy they have.  You think it's part of being zucked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we've been zucked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've been suckered.  We've been sucker punched.  You know, it's it's it's his process, I think his process is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brian, do you think you think Facebook's evil or just confused?  First of all, you guys got you guys got to get a grip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First of all, Facebook's a private company.  They'll do whatever the hell they want.  And if they if it agrees with the user base, then they're going to get away with it.  If the user base doesn't like it, they're going to move on to something else.  And this is a this is a fickle market to begin with.  This is something where through no fault of Facebook's own, a lot of people gave up on  Facebook when their mom joined.  And that's not something that Facebook can control.  The nature of these social sites is that people are always looking for the next big thing.  And it may be that we're about as clearly everybody's piling on right now.  But it's like as far as, you know, is it right or wrong or morally right or wrong?  It's like you vote with your dollars and you vote with your feet and people are going to  go somewhere else if it's a big problem.  And if it's not, then Facebook will be fried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it doesn't forgive them from acting unethically and doing the baiting switch and  from having a leader who people don't trust.  So you are correct.  People will vote with their dollar.  And what we're seeing right now is that that process is happening.  And if there is a viable competitor that is even just on par, you will see people leave  over the trust issue.  And this is a good sign.  And, you know, people have wondered when will people care about privacy?  Well, guess what?  People are starting to care because I'm talking to normal folks and they're like, I don't  trust that Facebook.  So the same way you could do people and be like, oh, Facebook's private and they don't  know it's not private.  You can actually do people the other way.  And they'll be like, oh, you can't trust the Facebook.  You know, that's not a trustworthy service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of the in the chat room was complaining that I was saying that perception is reality.  And in many things, it shouldn't be or it isn't.  But when it comes to a social network and especially fads, perception is definitely  reality.  And it'll be interesting to see how Facebook tries to spin this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And they have not handled it well to date.  I mean, they literally say nothing about it.  And when there was the big comments about Zuckerberg saying people are so stupid or  whatever he said in his I am chat script about the user base when he was a kid or younger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like on the one hand, we all know that's totally unfair and taken out of context.  But then on their hand, there's a reason that we're all so giddy to see that because it  so perfectly encapsulates the suspicions people have about Facebook, about Mark Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick, Facebook immoral or just ill run?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I kind of lean towards the private company pushing to get is I don't know whether  it being privately held has a whole lot to do with it.  I think they're just pushing to maximize their revenue opportunities.  And if, you know, you know, a moral, sleazy or sleazy to calling on morality.  But, you know, it's certainly sleazy.  And I think a lot of cases, most people don't care.  There's I'll be really curious to see, you know, it amazes me what people post on.  And there are still people using MySpace, but people post on MySpace and Facebook and are  shocked when somebody reads about it.  You know, it's an interesting it's a it's a larger philosophical question because I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think corporations as opposed to individuals are fundamentally immoral corporations are  designed not immoral.  I'm sorry.  A moral.  They're designed to maximize profits.  And yet corporate governance.  Look what's happening to Facebook.  Corporate governance would you would think would you maximize profits also by being good?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By serving your by serving your customer.  And clearly at this moment, whether it be in the way they're handling the PR or whether  it be the very decisions that they're making about privacy, they're clearly not serving  their customer base at this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  Come back with more.  I was trying to see if my mom was on Skype.  Mom, if you're watching, get on Skype because there's a normal person.  She's actually not that normal.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Does she have an iPad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every time I Skype in, we get your mom on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because she loves you, Brian.  I'm trying to hook you to that.  No, because I'm just curious.  I think as I remember when I started talking about this, mom sent me a note saying, how  do I get off the Facebook?  How do I stop this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to get off the Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm going to see.  Everybody's liking everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if I don't like it?  I don't want to have to like it.  Stop poking me.  What?  This is crazy.  You keep poking me.  I put a photo.  Everybody's got a comment.  I don't.  Everybody's got something to say.  That's why I like photo albums better.  There's no room for comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't want to hear what you have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a perfectly good technology when it was in a photo album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to talk a little bit about audible.com.  There we go again.  There we go again.  Jason loves that audible.  Audible is of course the bookstore of audiobooks and shows and entertainment.  75,000 strong and now plays on 500 different devices.  Still working on that Android version.  I'm sure that's soon.  But until then of course every other device including your Kindle, your Zune, your iPod,  iPone, iPad, all the iDevices, iRiver, the Sansas, many GPSs as well.  I'll tell you I love audible.  We should really actually make accidental billionaires our pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know about that.  I have another book.  Okay, go ahead, Jason.  I have the kid now and so I'm trying to catch up on things.  You're busy and I have the audible two a month subscription and I'm like wait a second.  There's a lot of books on being a parent.  I need to start listening to these.  I don't have time to read them.  This is important information.  In fact critical.  So I got Nurture Shock by Poe Bronson.  Oh, I love Poe Bronson.  This book is fantastic.  I am so glad I found this out.  This book is going to make me a better parent.  So if you are out there and you're a parent, you have no excuse.  Get on the audible and get the stuff on your iPad, your iPhone and your desktop.  And it remembers where you were like last.  It bookmarks it basically.  Even if you change devices.  So like I'll get to my desktop.  It knows that I'm on chapter five.  I listen to a little bit on my desktop.  Then I listen to a little on my phone.  And what a great book.  You're good.  And actually that's not what you should say.  Even though you think you should say it.  You're saying, you know, describe their behavior.  You did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the myth of self-esteem they correct.  And a lot of other common sense ideas in the late 20th century.  And a lot of the really bad.  They basically corrected a lot of bad propagated ideas that have come out through the media and other places in the last 20 years.  It's a spectacular piece of book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  We interviewed Ashley Merriman, his co-author, who did a lot of that research on jumping monkeys are monkeys.  It's a funny cast and fascinating.  Really great stuff.  Although a word of warning, if you are the parent of adult children or teenagers, it's too late.  And you may not want to read this because you've already screwed up.  And it's pretty much nothing you can do right now.  So if you're a parent of a young child like you, Jason, it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, if you're a parent of an older child, we'll listen to it with them.  My kids are screwed up.  I blew it.  I blew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't hate me.  I'll play this for Henry when he's sleeping.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Your parents suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your parents?  They praised you.  You know, he's funny.  He totally knows about this stuff.  Yeah.  I mean, he totally knows.  Thank God.  Nurture Shock, a very good recommendation.  That's the story of the Facebook founding, starting in Harvard, a fascinating book.  Listen to it before the movie comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's hard to listen now because then you can see the movie with like having actually read the book.  So much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We interviewed, you know, Dana Brunetti is a good friend of the show.  He is Kevin Spacey's partner on Trigger Street who's producing the Accidental Billionaires movie.  We interviewed him and the author of Accidental Billionaires on A Net at Night a few months ago.  Really interesting, fascinating and a great book.  audible.com.  Here's the deal.  You'll get two books a month.  It's the one I subscribe to.  Two books is a minimum for me.  I know people have multiple platinum accounts.  They listen to so many books.  If you have a big commute, that kind of thing.  If you're rowing across the ocean, Roz listens to a book a day, a book a day.  Because she's rowing the whole time.  I turned her on to Audible for her row across the Pacific.  She is so grateful.  She's going to do the Indian Ocean next year.  She said, I couldn't imagine it without Audible.  audible.com slash twit two.  You sign up for the platinum account.  That's two books a month.  First month's free, so you get two books free.  So this is two free books.  audible.com slash twit two.  And I do apologize for that.  Book licensing.  That's crazy.  Talk about antiquated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's how authors get paid.  They get paid per territory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything's in negotiation.  So, yeah, so, well, you know, the audiobook may not be available in the country or maybe a different audiobook in that country, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or God forbid you had like a Tor server and you logged in and had an IP address from another country and created an account for Spotify or other services.  You might be able to get around it somehow.  I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, as long as your credit card also agrees with the IP address on the Tor account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, Jason, is that amoral or immoral?  That is practical.  audible.com slash twit two.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech and all our shows.  They've been one of our most staunch supporters all along.  Just a great product.  There's so many stories.  I think it would be imprudent and proper of me to mention the Facebook privacy issues and not mention the fact that Google's Street View was collecting.  Data inadvertently, they say from open access points like 600 terabytes of data or something like that from open access points.  There was a pro due to a programming error in 2006.  I don't know. Most of you probably know this.  When the Street View cars are driving around, they're also mapping Wi-Fi access spots to GPS locations so that it's like a poor man's GPS.  They can say, well, if you can see on your iPad or your Wi-Fi iPad, you can see this access point and this one and this one's stronger.  Oh, you must be here. They triangulate you.  There's other companies like Skyhook that do this.  So they were collecting this data. That's normal and perfectly legal.  You're broadcasting.  They would collect the GPS location, the MAC address and the Wi-Fi access SSID.  However, there was some code and in the case of non-password protected Wi-Fi networks in Europe,  in other major regions, they also collected whatever data was going through the air at that time and saved it to a hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you got to remember this is unencrypted data.  This is the equivalent of, first of all, isn't it, to me, it's a little bit hilarious that people are bent out of shape over this while nobody has a problem with cars driving around taking pictures of your physical houses.  Like we caught Patrick Norton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the Germans don't like...  Yeah, that's right. Patrick, you're in this street view, aren't you? Are you still in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to be honest. I thought this was masterful headline writing for a non-starting story because I saw this and I've been using Gmail for everything except for my corporate account.  For years, all this information, Google Docs, my calendar, I'm like some scumbag employee inside of Google is rooting through people's accounts.  And I get to the article and I'm like they captured information from open access points. Who cares?  Fragmentary information.  If you're one of the eight people left in like... if you're one of the people that doesn't lock down your access point, congratulations, you learned a lesson.  By the way, if you're on cable, if you have cable internet, all of your information that's not encrypted to the point that you're connecting to is open and available.  By the way, people can sniff your email, wake up to reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much data does Comcast have access to? Let's face it, as the massive ISP, they've got it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you wanted to go after Google about a privacy issue, the issue is how long do they keep user data.  And that's the real issue that nobody's really been talking about, but I don't understand why any of these search engines need to keep over just a month or two of data.  It's very weird. I don't know why they should do it at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought they were legal. I thought they had to retain this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So here's what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  18 months I think and the EU wants less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I have to say kudos to Google for... they discovered this and stepped forward before it was revealed by others.  And they immediately took care of it. It is minor.  It was a story. They took a hit on it. I think you're right. I think it's a silly story, but they took a hit on it.  And I think they handled it appropriately.  And I think that's an example of handling an issue well as opposed to the way Facebook's handled its issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Basically, they're building credibility by how they're handling this as opposed to Zuckerberg who continues to lose credibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They pulled a Jobs instead of a Zuckerberg on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of Jobs, Apple apparently, according to Bloomberg, Apple did in fact press local police to investigate.  In fact, we now know that Steve Jobs, in court documents, Steve Jobs called Gizmodo and said, give me back my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is another story. I'm like, duh, they filed a complaint with the local police.  And because they're Apple and they had a relationship with the task force, they called the biggest stick they had access to and the task force went after these guys.  And maybe you guys can clear my head up on this, but I'm not feeling a lot of sympathy for Gizmodo on this one.  I'm reading the EFF and they're saying it's the reporter's shield law.  Basically, they're claiming the reporting shield law applies here.  The warrant that allowed them to take the computers from Jason Chen's house is a very serious complaint.  Jason Chen's house is bogus.  They don't really care.  They just wanted to, you know what I mean?  At what point is this a shield law and at what point is this theft of property?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it's reasonable if you feel your phone was stolen, you call the cops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Completely reasonable.  And Gawker Media is abusing the shield laws, which were intended to protect journalists.  There are times when for the social good, you might have to break the law and journalists have to be aware of that fact and pay the price.  If you want to do that investigative story where you carry a knife through a security checkpoint at an airport, you have to be prepared to get arrested to prove your point.  And if Gawker is so high and mighty that they prove some point about the new iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They wanted to prove that they could buy the 4G if they felt like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And now they have, sir.  And they broke the law for no social good reason.  And in fact, I think a lot of their motivation was to get into a criminal situation, an illegal situation.  And I think this kid, Jason from Gizmodo, I don't know him personally, is a dope or fabulously naive.  Because Nick Denton is making so much money off of this and building his brand.  And this kid may go to jail or whatever, get a felony.  And you know what?  When you steal something, you should face the consequences.  That's what the law is for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're saying Nick should go to jail, not Jason.  Jason's a fall guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Jason did all of it.  So Nick can be like, I didn't do it.  This guy did it.  And so he's a dope.  And I think this is a good way to get people getting educated to reality.  It's like the lowest form of education we have.  You go to college or the cops can pick you up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good way to think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's what's happening here.  This kid's a dope.  And getting the EFF to protect them is stupid because when we actually really have to use the shield laws because somebody has an important situation, we don't want them to go, oh, why?  So you get more pages used for the iPhone.  It's abuse of something that is intended for something that is socially good.  Move around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're doing a lightning round.  Moving along.  A quarter of US homes only use cell phones.  25% of Americans don't have landlines anymore.  I don't even know why I have a landline anymore.  Why do you need a landline?  And here's an interesting stat.  For the first time ever, the amount of data used exceeds the number of minutes used.  People are using their phones more for data than they are for voice in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My phone rang today and neither of us knew where the phone were and neither of us moved at all.  We just rang and rang and rang with the voicemail because we both knew that if they care, they'll call the numbers that we answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they care, they'll call our real phone, not this fake phone in the living room.  Let's see.  4chan founder Moot raises, I don't know why a VC would give Moot any money at all.  Maybe you can explain this, Jason.  4chan founder Jason raises $625,000 for a stealth startup called Canvas Networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  VCs like backing young people who understand the viral nature of the internet.  He is one of those young people.  And I'm sure that the idea has some amount of merit and is probably in no way related to the 4chan debauchery.  In the same way that Chatroulette's founder can't become, you know, like, you know,  the toast of the town, if you can figure out a way to go viral, you know, you know something.  And so would you rather give $600,000 to an MBA out of Harvard?  Or Moot?  Would you rather give $600,000 to somebody who already has a website that got a couple million people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, 4chan gets, get this, gets 8.2 million uniques a month, an average of 800,000 new posts a day.  Yeah, he understands something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so he's just got to take, you know, that insane, you know, energy that's there and put it into something productive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In piracy news, LimeWire crushed by the Recording Industry Association of America and their infringement lawsuit.  They were found liable of copyright infringement last Tuesday.  They'll probably be out of business, the RIAA.  Kimba Wood back in the news, U.S. District Court Judge Kimba M. Wood ruled that LimeWire's users committed a substantial amount of copyright infringement.  That's shocking.  There's gambling going on in here. Shocking.  You're winning, sir.  And they had not taken meaningful steps to mitigate the infringement, so they're liable.  The RIAA is seeking $150,000 per copyright violation.  Yeah, they want to put them out of business.  Yeah, let's see, they've got 50 million uniques a month, hundreds of thousands of users downloaded every day, millions of active users in a given moment times 150,000.  That's a gajillion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what'll be interesting is this is where, this is where it's politically safe and easy to go after.  You go after the businesses that are clearly profiting on a model that is based on piracy.  But as these giants get slayed, eventually they're just going to have to turn on the juice and go after all the individual people pirating their movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, good news.  The producers of Hurt Locker are going after...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hurt Locker, U.S. copyright, sorry.  The Hurt Locker producers freaked out.  You know, Hurt Locker's made like 16 million U.S., maybe 42 million worldwide, movie costs 15 million, and there's been zillions and zillions and zillions of downloads.  They started five months before the U.S. release of the film, and then it went ballistic, it went viral after it won all the Oscars.  So they've hired the U.S. copyright group to go after all of the people, basically to go after all of the ISPs for all the BitTorrent traffic related to downloading copies of the Hurt Locker.  And they're going to offer a settlement, and if you refuse, they're going to offer you a second settlement.  And if you refuse, the company's history, the U.S. copyright group's history is to then take you to court, go into a lawsuit.  And apparently a lot of independent movie producers are looking at this because they're seeing huge amounts of traffic on BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're seeing dollar signs in their eyes is what they're seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's an interesting related story.  The U.S. copyright group is suing over Far Cry, and Time Warner Cable says, we're not going to give you the information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was shocked by this, seeing an ISP standing up against the, it was a massive 2,000 per person lawsuit.  And they basically said, look, we've got four people who do IP lookups.  We've got four people, that's three months of their full-time effort.  We can't do it. We can't do it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to have to do it because what's funny is the lawyers that work for the U.S. copyright group said like 75% of the ISPs they contacted complied immediately.  And the ones that have currently refused to reply will have to once they're subpoenaed by the court, because at that point they have to give up the information.  And that they were objecting because it was a fine, they felt it was a financial burden to just turn over the information.  So apparently a lot of ISPs just immediately handed over the information to the U.S. copyright group lawyers.  So I don't, I don't, I don't see Time Warner being able to back out of this once the court subpoenas the information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why they call it file sharing kids.  Patrick Norton is the host of our newest show, of course the host of Tekzilla and so forth, but you're great on This Week in Computer Hardware.  And I'm going to come by with Ryan Shroud.  He is so good on this show and it's all about, if you're into computer hardware, it's all about computer hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There he is, Patrick Norton on This Week in Computer Hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to twitch.tv slash twitch, you'll see Ryan, Patrick, and now that Colleen is leaving, I'm going to show up on that show more than once in a while, I think, if you don't mind.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The door is always open, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks.  It's your network.  You're the best, Patrick Norton.  Patrick Norton also at Tekzilla.com.  Make sure you watch.  Let's not forget our great friend, Brian Rushwood, who is also the host of a few shows, one on Revision 3 as well, called Scam School.  What a great show.  And also NSFW.  Can I play a little clip from NSFW since I played a little clip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is from, we started a summer movie draft league.  And if you want to see how we're doing, in fact, my co-host, Justin Robert Young, who you should have on the show sometime, is actually dominating our fantasy movie league right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you have to bid for a movie?  Is that what happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We also had a hundred Brian Bucks or Justin Robert Rubles, and we auctioned off all the summer movies and we're basically going to see at the end of the summer who got the biggest gross for the money they were able to spend.  And it's all up at Bitly.  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then what is this here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're eating food?  Oh my gosh, I think you opened the wrong clip here.  This is clearly the episode where we took our young for food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This isn't the one where you made the kid throw up, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.  This is him giving up his vegetarianism after two years.  And we did it in style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it looks like he's eating bacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, no, we got all the Rudy's BBQ.  Austin has phenomenal BBQ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say, I really enjoyed the BBQ.  Is this the dolphin that everybody's been telling me about right there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the one?  You mean this guy right here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is our tribute to the dolphin.  To the dolphin boy.  This is on Toy Story 3, and it got up to $50 actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It went for half his budget went to Toy Story 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now does it have to be the biggest movie of the summer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I think I spent most like $18 on a movie, but I got eight movies.  Now meanwhile, Justin, he got Iron Man 2, spent half his money on it.  And so far it's looking like a good call.  But like next week we got, you know, Prince of Persia,  I actually find myself rooting for Sex and the City 2, which is weird for me.  I want to, this is, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you going to actually?  I don't care if you root for it, you're not going to go see it though, are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what, I may, I may send the Mrs.  I'm sure it'll be amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Send the Mrs.  My Mrs. made me watch it.  It was the two hours of my life I will never get back.  Just the most horrible, horrible, my eyes are still burning.  Shwood.com, S-H-W-O-O-D.com.  And it is a good insight into the mind of the woman.
