Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Once upon a time there were three little girls who went to the police academy.  They were assigned very hazardous duties.  But I took them away from all that, and now they work for me.  My name is Charlie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hello, angels. This is Leo the Port welcoming you to the next and last edition of The Return of the S**t.  Yes, that's right, the last.  Because we have a new name, and we're not going to call it that anymore, and I'm getting tired of bleeping out s**t and b**t every time I say it, so it's not The Return of the S**t anymore.  Thank goodness. The new name will be revealed in due course.  We do have a new name, and as a result we'll have all new URLs to this podcast will no longer piggyback on my TLR podcast feed.  It has a feed of its own, leoville.tv slash podcasts slash twit.  There'll be a couple of different feeds. There's one for MP3s, one for bookmarkable AACs for you iPod users and an Aug Vorbis.  For you open source types, and they'll be available both in choral and bit torrent forms.  There's also a direct URL. All of this is fully explained at my blog, leoville.com slash blog.  So do please, after you listen to this podcast, modify your podcast software to point to the new feeds.  I want to make sure you all get next week's episode.  Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, Patrick Norton, Kevin Rose, Robert Heron, and from beyond the grave, John C. Dvorak.  In this, the last edition of The Return of the S**t, etc. etc.  Okay, who is playing, who is doing slam dancing in the back? What's going on? Somebody's dancing or something.  What is that sound?  I hear that tapping. Are you hammering, Patrick?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My, the house that I'm leaving in the next month is, I don't know what my housemate is doing in the tub right now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but there's this really amazing three part leak that's coming from up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, well tell him to stop leaking and we're working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm waiting for it to stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's not a lot I can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We got a lot of good suggestions for the show name, but one of the ones I liked the best, Patrick, was Sledgecast.  Nice. Wouldn't that be great? It's a Sledgecast.  We are going to unveil on the podcast this week our new name.  I'm embarrassed to say that it was none of, as far as I can tell, well, there's two possibilities, but the one that I'm kind of in favor with,  nobody submitted, probably because it's so boring.  We got so many creative, clever submissions.  You want to hear some of the names that people sent in?  Absolutely.  Al Hill said, Saved by the Geeks. That's kind of keeping the screensavers idea.  In fact, a number of people did that.  Claudio Flores said, WWSSD, what would the screensavers do?  No.  We'll leave that one out.  There was also a G4 Eats is Young, but in deference to G4, we'll leave that one out.  Are you now or have you ever been a G4 employee?  No.  How about this one? I think you'd like this one, Patrick.  Those, by the way, were all from Shane. This is from Lance.  Return of the Meat Popsicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Green Megs of Ram.  That was from Kevin Davis. I like that one.  Kurt Golick said, Goodfellows.  But I think maybe Geekfellows might be good. Geekfellows. What do you think? No?  That's pretty cool.  Kurt also suggested This Week in Geek, which is the closest to the one we're I think going to actually use.  What do you think of This Week in Geek?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not bad at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We can call it Geek Week.  Twig.  Twig. Yeah. T-W-I-G.  I like the fact that it rhymes. How about Alex's? My big fat video cast. My big fat tiger.  My big fat geek wedding.  Yeah. My big fat geek cast.  Let's see. Attack of the Podcast.  A lot of them were plays on Attack of the Show, Kevin.  I think that like Dave said, a hack of the show, which I kind of liked.  A 10-year-old named Sonia suggested Reunion of Tech Support Scholars.  She wanted to keep the R-O-T-S-S acronym. Reunion of Tech Support Scholars.  John Wilson, Geek Weekly, The Pocket Protectors, Ray Bromley. That was a good one.  Here's one from Dustin that incorporates all of our, you know, kind of reputations.  It's the revenge of the dark tipping, sledgehammer swinging, PC modding, lab rat tech guys.  Excellent.  It's a little long.  Winner.  But I like it.  Hey, the domain name's available.  It is. Yeah, I think we can register that.  Wasn't there a domain name somebody registered that was like,  because all the other good domain names were taken, somethinglikethat.com?  All the other good domain names were taken.com?  Joel suggested four guys in a box of crap.  Ouch.  Robert wasn't here last week. He doesn't know that that's the grand prize for this.  Patrick's going to donate a box of crap from his garage.  Excellent.  That's the grand prize.  It's incredible, vital, vintage computer technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Completely random.  Yes, and it will definitely be.  The mystery prize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm kind of embarrassed to admit that we're going to, I think we're going to go,  Robert, you weren't in on this conversation because you were busy finding headsets,  but I think we're going to go with the boring, this week in tech.  T-W-I-T.  And the only reason is I think the podcast has to say in its name what it is,  because otherwise when people look at it in the directory, they'll have no clue.  Is that so boring that we should just say no?  Oh, thanks for backing me up, guys.  Well, dead silence.  I think the Skype just faded out again.  Oh, it's, yeah, it's the Skype problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same here, Leo, same here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, right, you couldn't hear a word I was saying.  Sunspots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I've registered twit.tv.  We are all twits now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Twit.tv will be the domain.  The email address will be thisweekintech.gmail.com.  And nobody is a winner, but somebody will be the winner.  We're all going to receive web hosting from VISAweb and Jinx Hackware  thanks to our donations there.  And that raises another issue real quick before we get to,  because Patrick wants to do a look at WinHack,  which is the big Windows hardware conference that just ended.  And I know you all have lots to talk about,  and we have a lot to talk about on the show today.  But real quickly, I just want to mention we've decided not to take advertising,  at least for the time being,  because we're going to be doing a lot of advertising on the show today.  So quickly, I just want to mention we've decided not to take advertising,  at least for the time being, on the show.  I know that's kind of radical.  We want to support the show, and there are costs associated with it,  like registering 20 different domain names,  which is what I did this week,  trying to save all the ones that might be our winner.  So we thought it would be better if we asked for your support, your donations.  The podcast, I want the podcast to be free and always free.  And I think we all agree it's going to be that way.  It'll never be a subscription podcast.  However, we wouldn't mind if you subscribed as a way of donating.  So what I've set up is three buttons on the podcast page and on the feed for your choice.  Not required. Podcast is free.  But if you'd like to support the podcast,  you can subscribe for $2 a month in a recurring subscription.  Now, that's less than a latte a month.  Less than 50. It's 50 cents a show.  We see less of it because, of course, PayPal takes its cut, I think, 36 cents.  But I wanted to make it small so that everybody could participate.  There were some people who said, well, no, we'd like to just do it once a year.  So that's a $20 a year subscription.  Again, that will recur.  So you can cancel it at any time.  But if you don't, you'll be billed again next year.  We plan to keep doing this for many years.  And also, by the way, if you're worried that we'll go away but the subscription won't,  if for any reason we decide not to do the podcast anymore,  I can, with one button, cancel all the subscriptions.  And I will do that, of course.  And then I also am going to leave a donation button for those of you who don't want to subscribe  but would like to make a small donation.  No donation too small or too large.  I'd like to add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do such a good job at this, Lee.  I'm about to sign up right now. I'm like, this sounds great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think $2. I mean, how much did you pay to subscribe to Tech TV?  How much did you pay for your last gallon of gas?  There you go. Yeah.  I paid $3 for the first time last week.  I was stunned.  So $2, I think, is not an unreasonable amount.  And what it will do is it'll help us make this a better podcast.  It'll give us a reason to be here every week because we all need to make a living.  And it'll also show your support for grassroots user broadcasting on the net.  And nobody really has made a success of this by donation.  Everybody's trying to do advertising.  My problem with advertising is I don't want to be anybody's pocket.  I think it'd be nice if we could just do this without advertising.  So we're going to try it.  There you go. That's my pitch.  By the way, Patrick, you should know that one of the first things we're going to do is buy you a Mac  so we can do the video iChat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, maybe we'll buy Kevin's iMac for you.  How much do you want for your Mini, Kevin?  I don't know. $500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You paid $6?  Yeah, it paid $6 plus it's got a gig of RAM and it upgraded the RAM as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that would be good for Skype.  And then Patrick, do you have a regular PC keyboard?  What am I asking you?  I think I can manage the crap.  A monitor lying around. Just take one out of that box of crap.  There's no monitors in the box.  Because I really would like to try this.  And do you have a DV camera, Patrick?  No.  We're going to have to buy him an iSight as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I can figure something out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Any Firewire camera will work on this.  So with iChat AV.  And Robert, do you have a Mac? I forgot. You don't have a Mac either.  No, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have video cameras and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, what we're going to have to do, I think, is maybe make, and I know there's some people who do this,  a little package that we mail around to whoever's going to be on the show that week  that comes with everything in it.  And you just plug it in and there you go.  The camera and everything.  Because Dvorak has told us he's going to join us.  And I said, do you have a Mac? And he said, no.  Can you believe that? He doesn't even have a Mac.  Anyway, we'll figure this out.  But I would like to try it with video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dvorak's so soft and cuddly.  I can't believe he's telling you the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You probably didn't know I'd mention it.  I did tell him that he should call in.  And he could be on the show.  And so he said he may stop by from time to time.  So that would be nice.  So, the big event of the week.  In heck, the Windows Hardware Education?  Hardware...  Hardware...  I used to know that. Engineering. That's it.  The Windows Hardware Engineering Conference was this week.  Bill Gates revealed some details of Longhorn.  And I know Patrick Extreme Tech sent some people up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, actually Lloyd Case was up there.  And I'm sure a couple of the other guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lloyd's got the softest hair of anybody in showbiz, by the way.  I'm going to take your word for it.  He has really nice hair.  I'm sorry, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, I have this vision of you petting his hair.  I haven't petted your hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You used to pet me all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because your hair is magnificent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody thought it was fake, Leo.  That's why we all had to check to see if it was fake or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was that why everybody was touching me?  It was just to see if I was wearing a wig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could be a badger. It could be the man's hair.  But if it's fake, it's glued on really, really well.  I don't have Ted Koppel hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think my hair looks like real hair, doesn't it?  You have a magnificent pet.  I paid a lot of money for this hair.  So, Winhek, did they reveal anything about Longhorn that we didn't know already?  Not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, what's been interesting is between the 64-bit windows and the release and the beta of Longhorn,  I think those two completely overshadowed anything that was going on in terms of actual hardware engineering at Winhek this year.  There's some pretty interesting side stories.  It's actually a good story in extreme tech.  Samsung actually announced that they are going to be, middle of next year, they're going to be shipping hard drives that include flash memory  to basically reduce battery life consumption on notebooks.  So they're basically going to put a gigabyte of flash onto the notebook to help reduce battery consumption.  How will that work? Will it be like a cache?  Essentially.  It'll be slow, though.  Well, it depends on how they do it.  It depends on how they set it up.  But yeah, that's a question.  I think it should still be faster than rotating media or actually physically writing it to the drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I know you can get CF that's 40x, maybe 80x.  It's pretty fast now, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, my USB 2.0 key that I have is faster than my notebook's hard drive.  It is.  It stains reading writes above about 12 to 14 megs a second, as well as about 2 gigs in size, too.  So that just comes in handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Notebook hard drives are big, slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I could see, for instance, if you're watching a DVD or a movie off the hard drive,  if you could load it into the flash cache, then you would save a lot of power.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By far the biggest consumer of electricity or battery power,  if you want to call it on a notebook, is still the screen by far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we can't fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, not with existing technology.  It would be an interesting idea if maybe if you had an organic OLED screen, whether or not that would help.  But I don't think LCDs are going to lose their power consumption any time soon.  What else happened?  You know, the Longhorn beta was released and everybody made fun of it.  Avalon looks pretty cool.  Microsoft said that Apple...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's that?  Avalon looks pretty cool.  That's the graphics layer that's going to replace DirectX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then other than that, they yanked a lot of the really interesting stuff that was supposed to go in the Longhorn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No WinFS, the file system.  That's gone.  Well, they're going to release that afterwards.  2008 or something.  What else did they yank out?  I mean, it seems some people are starting to call it Service Pack 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's probably a pretty good thing to call because Avalon is still there.  They've yanked out WinFS.  Debates are raging as to how good the communications layer they've set up is going to be.  You know, people are already making fun of the whole Windows 64 Longhorn split, which is another odd one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Microsoft for years tried to narrow down into one operating system.  Now they're going bifurcating again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's going to be 64-bit versions of Longhorn, though, right?  Correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no argument there.  But I think part of what people are saying is they've set themselves up for sort of yet another parallel set of operating systems.  Right.  Which, I mean, given the fact that the vast majority of the planet is running on 32-bit processors makes a lot more sense right now.  Yeah, I got to say, though, not a lot of, you know, some WinHeck's it's just a lot of repeating what was going on in the years before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  WinHeck is traditionally where Microsoft tells the hardware manufacturers, the Dells of the world, what they should be doing so that they can support the next generation of Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's WinHeck and IDF.  And basically, you know, at this point, I'm ashamed to admit I forgot which one was started in a hissy fit in a reaction to the other trying to control the platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Intel Developers Forum versus the, you know, these guys, it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Intel Developer. There's no apostrophe there.  Developer. Pardon me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  IDF. Developer Forum.  It's funny how much these guys are at each other's throats given that they're the quote, Wintel platform.  So Bill did speak and he said that even though Longhorn will run on existing hardware, it won't run beautifully if you really want Avalon and all this, you know, if you really want the animated icons, which I know I look forward to, and the transparency on the desktop, you're going to want a 3 GHz processor and a pretty hefty video card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But at this point, you know, by the time it actually ships, dot, dot, dot, you know, that 3 GHz processor should be well down into the $100 range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So meanwhile, while Microsoft's talking about vaporware, Apple comes along on Friday with Tiger. Did you upgrade to Tiger? Kevin, you've been using it for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been using it for a little while. I have to tell you, I'm getting more. I love it. I really do.  Finally, for the longest time, you know, I watched OS X from a distance and I thought, oh, that's cool. I like that. But I never really wanted to make the switch.  And with some of the features like Spotlight and some of the other new things, it's just it's making more and more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I'm going to be contrary. I'm going to be contrarian on this because I'm a little disappointed. Now, I agree that Tiger is well worth it. It's a good upgrade.  Under the hood, there's some amazing stuff, things like SQLite being built in so that developers have applications to kind of lightweight data basing, the kind of thing WinFS was supposed to do.  But I'm disappointed. I thought Spotlight would be faster and easier to use. You know, their usability is bad on it. I'm used to something called LaunchBar.  You press Command Space just as you do in Spotlight, type the first few letters of what you're looking for just as you do in Spotlight, and then hit Enter.  So I hit Enter and Spotlight instead of launching what it found, it launches itself.  The thing it found should be at the top so that hitting Return or Enter will launch it. And it's a lot slower.  It takes a second or two, maybe even longer to find the thing I'm looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just don't see I have nothing. I don't have that whole history with the Apple products that you do or other applications to compare to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For me, X1 on Windows is so much faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean for me right now, a good example is the other day I was trying to do a search for a file that was on my hard drive.  I did a search with a little dog in the corner and it took me like 10 minutes to go through all my data.  And this is a huge improvement for me. Yes, much better. And it's amazing. It's where Windows is definitely going to go.  Everybody is.  Yeah, everybody is. I like the fact that it searches all the metadata. So if you have certain type of images and things tagged with certain keywords, it'll pull that information up.  I mean, it does it is like everything from music to PDFs, calendar. It's pretty you got to admit that it may be a little slow, but it's pretty amazing technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's very slick. And one of the things that is part of Spotlight, by the way, SQLite was also put in because of Spotlight.  One of the things that's part of Spotlight is these smart folders, the ability to create a folder that collates information from across your desktop.  Those are really cool.  What I think we're seeing is a shift in the proper shift in the way we understand information on our computer.  You know, the same thing happened on the Internet. At first on the Web, people tried to categorize.  In fact, Sarah probably would have something to say about this, Patrick, as a librarian.  People try to categorize the Internet as they did the library, like with the dual decimal system saying, well, there's 16 categories and 24 subcategories and third.  And it didn't work. You know, you had to you couldn't fit everything into these boxes.  And then along comes Google and says, well, there's no categories. Just type what you want.  Tell me what you're looking for and I'll find it for you.  And that's exactly what's happening on the desktop. Instead of folders and folders within folders and hierarchy and organizing our mail using filters into different folders.  Forget it. Just dump everything in there and a good search tool is going to find it wherever it is.  And smart folders will organize it post post facto instead of having to do it ahead of time.  I think that's that's the way it should be. Right. There's no there's no shelf.  Yeah, I really processor. Well, that's what we now we have the ability to do it, of course.  What else do you like about it, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The well, the conferencing with the eyesight is pretty amazing.  The fact that you can do three people now, the H two six four codec is just it's amazing.  I've been doing some comparisons for the different videos.  I've been taking portions of our video that we've shot and recompress them with QuickTime seven using the new H two six four.  And it's creating better quality videos, the same bit rates that I would typically have to bump up to get that that the type of quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So how big are your file sizes? What kind of what are we talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're still talking for about 15 to 20 minutes of video.  We're still talking about somewhere in the range of 150 to 200 megabytes in size.  So it's not like the file sizes are that much smaller.  It's just the improved quality at lower bit rates. Right.  And is really what I'm saying.  And I mean, I'm doing it side by side, same bit rate with Divix.  And you'll see so much better crisper quality images and not so much artifacting with the H two six four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's exciting. It's a standard, unlike Divix, which is proprietary.  So QuickTime seven, is it available on Windows yet or I don't believe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think there's a download for it yet, but they say it's coming soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That will be what you'll need to do this on Windows as well.  Have you seen the trailers? They have four trailers on the Mac on the Apple site in high def in HD.  Yeah, it's pretty amazing. I just downloaded the 1080p Serenity trailer.  It's a two minute trailer, 138 megs.  And by the way, it doesn't play back on my one point six gigahertz laptop.  You've got to have dual two gigahertz to play this thing back.  But man, does it look good. Yeah, it's pretty strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Strong compression going on right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Robert, do you think that that's the future of is that where video is going?  Is it going to instead of MPEG four, we're going to see H.264.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, H264 is MPEG four. It's the one thing. What's the difference?  There really isn't. You have advanced video coding, AVC.  You have H.264 and basically have MPEG four, which is the umbrella term for all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's a subset or a superset of MPEG four or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  MPEG four is the standard that was agreed upon by the motion picture experts group.  And 264 is really speaking directly toward the video side of things.  Got it. One of the nice things about it is it's scalable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can you tell it the bit rate and it does the best job it can given that bit rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's hopefully that and the just support for greater resolutions and things like that,  especially when we're talking about if you're pulling down 20 megabit streams of HD content,  you'd like to make them more portable.  It's looking to be just one terrific format for that.  1080p guys, 1080p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Most I mean, it takes a hell of a machine to play it.  But boy, does it look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the extreme DVD Terminator two actually includes the Windows Media nine HD version.  That's in 1080p as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, how does that's what the extreme what they call extreme windows like the extreme DVD version of Terminator two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How does that compare?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was the first one I saw.  Is it the same as H.264? Is it Microsoft's own thing?  What is the deal there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is it's their own flavor.  It's you know, it's essentially they are using a next gen codec very similar to what MPEG four is doing.  But it's it's Microsoft's proprietary their own software basically for the encoding.  So that's it.  Now they have real time hardware encoders.  That was the cool thing I saw at the cable show here in San Francisco about two weeks ago was the fact that they now have one you rack mountable either H.264  Windows Media nine real time encoders or you know MPEG two and you can deliver.  So I think the cable companies themselves will be will be it'll make their transition not only to digital  but just to maintaining backward compatibility with people who don't have HDTV yet.  Yet for the new customers who go out and buy the latest and greatest they're going to be able to deliver the good content.  And I'm hoping I'm hoping to see formats like 1080p just become a default for a lot of content and then you can scale it down from there if you need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now no TV or very few TVs out there are going to support it.  Right.  I mean 1080p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Almost any any any flat panel LCD that's greater than say about 40 inches is usually 1080p.  P.  P as in 1920 by 1080.  OK.  And that's because resolution.  Yeah.  It just they tend to have you know high resolution for plasmas you don't see 1080p until you hit about 71 inches.  Which that's that's still in the.  That's the 40 grand version.  Yeah 40 50 60 on up.  But I'll tell you it's just it's beautiful.  What have you seen outside of the DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean most of the stuff that I get broadcast in my house is either 720p or 1080i.  Are we going to see you know broadcast start coming out in 1080p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I highly doubt you're going to see the broadcasters to punch it for a while just because of the additional costs involved in supporting yet another format.  And right now it was hard enough just getting people to wrap their heads around you know what is high definition.  And then you see a lot of movie transfers being done at even greater resolutions.  So if I have a display that's capable of it I would hope that in the specs coming up for the new DVD formats the high definition DVD and Blu ray I'm hoping you'll be really simple just to create a 1080p format for you if you have the hardware to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way Kevin mentioned that was one of the things you wanted to talk about.  Finally we're going to see maybe an HD DVD format that is compatible with both HD DVD and Blu ray.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I'm excited about that.  Did you hear that Robert about Sony and Toshiba are supposed to be teaming up to unify the new format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When I was talking with Pioneer basically it was all it's going to become just like the format war was with DVD right now where you have plus and dash formats.  They're basically going to make pickups laser pickups that will support all formats and they just don't care.  They just want to build devices so if there's going to be two three four formats so be it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hold on just a second because it looks like we've got a special guest stopping by.  Let me answer the phone and see if we can get him into the Skype conference here.  He's calling me from his fortress of solitude high atop the Berkeley Hills.  Ladies and gentlemen John C. Dvorak.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't need hecklers.  We got him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin Rose Patrick Norton Robert Heron all with us and John is.  I told Johnny could be the Bob Hope of the show anytime he wanted to stop by with his golf club he's welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely.  The question is you know this thing is my Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As cuts it off.  Oh well yeah.  One thing you got to do is turn everything off on the damn computer.  You're cutting off a little bit actually as you talk.  No well.  That's not John you wrote a call you wrote three columns that we want to talk about today.  One saying podcasting is no big deal.  One saying Skype is the greatest thing since sliced bread and the most recent one saying there hasn't been anything new in gaming since first person shooters were invented.  Do you want to pick one of those to address.  Well that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're actually reading these once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know why I read them.  People send me irate mail thinking I have some sort of conduit to you saying can you tell Dvorak he's full of shit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah they do that all the time.  They send that to my wife too.  You know and I'm so hard to get a hold of I've only had the same email address in the past decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Robert is a gamer.  Robert you want to ask any questions of Mr. Dvorak here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought some of the points were valid.  It was just when it comes to what everyone harps on in the gaming world like a new title like Half Life 2.  I honestly didn't see Half Life 2 as really pushing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a lot of sequels but that's true in movies it's true in books.  I mean John you've written a few sequels to your books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Never.  No I don't believe in them.  Really.  Is that true.  No I think I think everything should be original one shot only.  I've never been a fan of recycling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead.  You never did a second edition of any of your books.  Well yeah but that was.  Oh yeah we lost him.  I was too hard on him already.  He's dead.  Can you hear us John?  Oh man.  Okay now everybody when John comes back let's be real nice to him okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually I think his gaming article and the one big thing is he bagged on Starship Troopers which I just it's one of those favorite camp movies of mine.  That would be about the only thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was a terrible movie but it was a good movie.  Yeah.  It was a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The first like half the first hour of it's pretty hard to watch for a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah we were talking about how you didn't like Starship Troopers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah no Starship Troopers.  In fact it was on again on HD the other night.  It's almost impossible to watch it.  Tell you a couple problems I've had because I've had fans call me single.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh this isn't going to work.  I'm bummed out.  Do you think it's me guys or you think it's him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No it's because you're dissing Starship Troopers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder what's going on.  I think it's him.  We got to get him to set up his system so it works.  This is ironic because the one thing that he liked in those three articles was Skype.  And it's the one thing that's not working for us right now.  It's got to be on his end.  We've been fine and you know I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well hey Robert were you hit with that DNS outage?  No.  Through Comcast?  Oh I got hit a couple weeks ago.  We were down for two days because of the DNS outage at Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you know what I think was when I was calling him to get my new service set up up here in Northern California is that their advertising from an internet company was mixing up the total.  Term bit and bite left and right and throughout this entire ad they played over and over.  They kept saying that we're giving you four megabytes per second.  I'm like you are.  That's cool.  I'll take it.  It's like their entire print campaign and ad campaign was based around they couldn't get the bees right.  And I was like oh these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh you can hear me John.  Oh that's weird.  You know what John you could just type and I'll read your answers into the podcast.  I think it's Windows.  Well anyway.  We were talking before we tried to get this working.  John I'll tell you what.  Hang in there.  Maybe you can get it working and show up.  Otherwise just he says the settings shut themselves off.  So maybe it's something weird going on with Skype.  You might want to try rebooting.  Dvorak says rebooting.  Ha!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know I still have my Dvorak in a can recordings that we used on the radio show.  I could probably just fill those in.  I have about 10 ports from John.  I just play them randomly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll get a good soundboard program made up.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak.  What?  That's a good idea.  I bet you it's out there.  That's a great idea.  Let's see if we can find that.  There probably is one.  I bet there is one.  John would know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  All I can think of is do you have Dvorak in a can?  Let him out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have some questions for you guys if you'd like to answer them from our listeners.  This is something we'd like to start doing to get a little more interactivity into the show.  If you'd like to send us a question.  Instead of trying to get you through on Skype you can see we're having trouble.  Yeah.  John says do you think I'm spidering around five sites right now?  Do you think that's an issue?  Yes.  Don't do anything else.  It's killing your bandwidth.  What was I saying?  Oh, if you want to ask a question the best way to do it, we might take live calls if we can figure out how to get Skype to work reliably with a lot of different people.  But in the interim, email us.  Thisweekintech at gmail.com.  But we won't take printed questions.  You have to record your question.  Make it 30 seconds or less.  Use a microphone that works.  Record your question and we'll play them back on the show.  And our panel of experts will answer them.  You ready guys for our first question of the day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi guys.  Mike B from the KFI chatroom.  I'd like to know what you guys think has been the greatest technology failures within the last five or ten years.  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We need Dvorak for that one.  Everything's a failure from Dvorak's point of view.  Five or ten years.  There have been so many.  Original Dvex.  Oh yeah, that was a bad idea.  Yes.  That was the ones where...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bought a unit.  Did you?  I actually bought one of the players.  Yeah, I thought it was cool at the time.  Yes, it was kind of cool for a few weeks there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to be able to buy Disney flicks in the 7-Eleven and watch them for 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you'd buy the movie and you had to have a special Dvex player.  And then you'd pay... it was connected to the phone line, right?  And you'd give them a credit card and they'd unlock the DVD for a limited time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Well, the second you put it in, you could watch it for like 48 hours or whatever it was.  Oh, okay.  And after that, you would have to re-rent it or you could buy it and unlock it forever.  Oh, geez.  So it was kind of cool because you would pick up a disc for, you know, four bucks and then you would take it home.  You'd never have to worry about returning it to, you know, Blockbuster or whatever it may be because there's no late fees.  You play it, you watch it, and if you ever want to watch it again, you either play it a couple more bucks or you unlock it.  Well, here's the follow-up to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get questions periodically with people who have an entire library of Dvex discs and wondering how can they play it?  Because it won't play anymore because there's no service to connect to.  You know how to hack it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't think about that.  So that's why they're out of this disc right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you have any of those discs?  I don't recall them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was the technology around for that long?  No, it was around for a week.  I mean, only like six months or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I thought.  It was terrible.  You know what?  That's the problem with being an early adopter is like you get screwed sometimes like that and I definitely did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Disney, for some reason, seems to be at the forefront of these bad ideas.  They also created a disc that rotted away.  Do you remember that?  It was...  Well, they came...I don't think they ever released it.  Oh, maybe they never did it.  The idea was you'd buy this at a 7-Eleven.  Same thing.  It was in a special sealed package.  It was like vacuum sealed, right?  It was vacuum sealed because as soon as it hit the air, it would start to oxidize and you'd have 48 hours.  After that, it was worthless.  What a terrible idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Could you use like one of those wine savers where you squirt the inner gas into the wine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Try to preserve your rotting disc.  It's awesome.  What a pain.  Disney has also tried...  I mean, you know, we've come up with enough failures just from Disney alone.  Disney has also tried in Florida, it's kind of a TiVo box that they put on your TV and it has movies inside.  And in order to play the movies, you pay a fee and they're on the hard drive already and then it's always connected and downloading new movies all the time.  So it has like, you know, a hundred movies in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Has that actually been a failure?  Well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought that was actually working.  Is it?  Maybe it is working.  Is it around?  I haven't seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was...  We looked at one technology where you had the box, the top box that used over the air through local broadcasters and it would constantly cash for you.  And then they were delivering movies right into the box for you.  But it was in very good quality.  I just can't remember off the top of my head if it went anywhere.  My TiVo is my favorite technology.  TiVo is a winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although, ironically, the company is a loser, right?  I mean, how long is TiVo going to be around?  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they did make the deal with Comcast recently.  So that will at least give them a little lifeblood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They'll be eaten like a fish.  You're potted up, John.  You can say anything you want, but we just can't hear you.  John says, can you hear me?  Because I know John...  John's just...  You know, this is torture for John.  For us to be talking about this stuff.  Totally.  And John can't get a word in.  Go ahead.  Try talking, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're listening.  The one thing I wanted to say was that, you know, the original laser discs were all designed to rot or at least it turned out that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I still have them.  I play them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the first ones, the early, early ones, the ones that came out like, you know, in the late 70s.  Yeah?  Most of them are rotten.  Really?  The giant ones.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're called laser rot.  That's where the term came from.  There's an example of a technology.  It wasn't a bad technology, but it didn't survive.  I mean, I have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, actually, don't forget the RCA Selectivision, if you're going to go into that stuff.  What was that?  That was a physical disc that played videos.  How did that work?  It was pretty...  Was it like a...  Yeah, exactly.  It was in a cartridge.  A lot of people have...  George Morrow used to have a huge collection of these things.  You slipped this disc into the player and it was just spun at real high speeds and it had a little needle that wrote in the groove.  It was unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the classic interim technology where they've got phonographs and they say, well, there's got to be a way to make it do video.  But it was only a brief... one brief fling.  I don't remember that.  I must have missed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, there was an advertisement on TV.  You just missed it somehow.  I don't know how you could have possibly missed it.  I think you'd be right on it.  You're like an early adopter.  I still have my laser discs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a whole collection.  I watched A Hard Day's Night.  You know, there's a problem with the laser disc.  This is a question for all of you guys.  Is it a digital or an analog format?  It's an analog format.  It's analog.  Yeah.  It is?  Yeah.  It only has analog out.  How does it work, John?  I mean, it's not pits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was essentially the same as the signal that comes over the air for your analog TV.  Are you talking about laser discs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They encoded the RF signal.  Wow.  Well, whatever it was, it doesn't look that great.  I have to say it's a little noisy.  The audio might be better.  I've heard people say the audio is better because it was uncompressed audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know how you can beat the audio on today's HGC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to have some pretty good ears to hear the difference on that.  You ready for another question, guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sure.  Another question for the Twits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm really glad to see that you guys have been reunited here on the podcast and certainly  appreciate the fact that you're taking questions from the listeners.  Mine deals with the new Tiger OS X operating system for the Mac.  In the past, when Microsoft would come out with a new operating system, it would be painfully  obvious that my old existing PC hardware would never be strong enough to take advantage of  all the bells and whistles in the new operating systems.  I'm thinking about buying a Mac Mini, and I'd like to know whether or not it would be a  good companion with Tiger and whether it has enough horsepower to take full advantage to  all the enhancements that Tiger has to offer, and if I'd get a good user experience out  of those two items being put together in one package.  Thank you for all that you've done in the past.  Look forward to many, many great podcasts in the future.  Thanks so much, and you have a great day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was Wayne in Akron, by the way, who is a longtime fan.  Go ahead, Patrick, you've got your hand in the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the biggest problem with a Mac Mini or any other of the low-cost Apple systems is  that they just don't put enough memory in them from the factory.  256 megabytes of RAM, it'll run, kind of.  But upping that to 512 megabytes, or better yet, a gigabyte, is going to be a huge performance  equivalent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To answer this question, though, I mean, everything else runs just fine.  I can launch iMovie HD, GarageBand, you name it.  Everything comes up with enough speed to where I'm happy with the performance at 1.4, 2 gigahertz.  What processor is the Mini using, though?  It's a G4. It's a 1.42.  Okay, so you should be fine with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't notice a lot of difference between a G4 and a G5, to be honest with you. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the OS X, 10.4, the Tiger requirements are a PowerPC G3 or better processor.  You know, 256 megabytes of RAM.  I think the biggest thing is getting more RAM in there, especially if you have a G3 or a slower G4 processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I want to invite you all over to my house to watch the Serenity trailer at 1080p on a cinema display.  I can't... oops, sorry.  On a dual the G5, because it looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I want is a ticket to see the Serenity preview that's May 5th.  Those sold out in like eight minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're showing a pre-release, right? Because it's not out for the fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and not final, but it's coming out... the movie comes out September 30th.  They're showing a pre-release on the 5th.  And they were... I guess Universal didn't expect a lot of people to be interested in it.  And the Serenity fan boards managed to... literally the brown codes managed to get the thing sold out in a matter of minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the deal? Why is Serenity... what is the deal? I mean, is this hype?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you remember Firefly? The series from Joss Whedon, the guy that created Buffy and Angel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't remember Firefly, Chris and Iff Buffy and Angel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Firefly, after Buffy and Angel, or currently... it's hard to tell because Joss Whedon's been working on so many projects.  And I should openly admit that I am a huge Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan.  Who the fuck can ladies and gentlemen...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Boy, is that a rebel. Oh my.  Yeah, a little life.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What, like tomorrow?  Are you through?  Well, it's funny. I saw the premiere of Firefly.  I was right about the time when I first started watching Buffy.  And it was just... you know, it was... it didn't enjoy it.  It was like this really over-processed Civil War Western space sci-fi thing.  And I was like, ugh.  And it turns out that Fox basically changed because the way Whedon set stuff up is he has character development  and he has all these interlocking threads and they kind of... over the course of a season they come to a pretty heavy climax.  And Fox decided they didn't like the pilot, the opener, the show opener that he put together to start the season  and gave him like three days to cut something else.  So and then they showed... instead of showing the episodes in order, they showed them out of order.  They didn't show the premiere which sets up all the... the pilot which sets up a huge amount of backstory.  So they basically started with episode two, jumped around in different episodes which means the character development makes no sense.  And a lot of the actions of the characters make no sense.  And then they killed it after 11 episodes.  So it's... and recently they released the DVD recently and it's like...  Once I saw the pilot episode I was amazed at how much more sense this second episode which is the one they actually showed first on television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this movie is Firefly made for the movies or is it something completely different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Firefly made for the movies. Trinity is the name of the ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because I'm trying to understand. You know on this trailer it says the must-see movie of the year or the best movie, the top ten movie of the year.  How would they know that? The movie's not even out. We're looking at a trailer for something that won't be out until September.  So they're talking about the Firefly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a top ten must-see movie of the year but just because it's got Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well anyway, it's a great... it makes a great trailer and it's certainly a good way to show off your HD.  John C. Dvorak says he's lighting himself on fire right now so...  Maybe we should move on to another topic.  Unless of course we could get the Skype to work and we could listen to that in which case it might be worth pursuing.  You want another question from a listener here or anything else you guys want to mention about Serenity?  I guess going once...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anything in high definition is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anybody other than me see Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?  Oh, did you see it? I saw it. I subbed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, got to give you reviews.  It was great. I loved it.  You're kidding! Everybody I talked to said it was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, good. I'm glad to hear somebody liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a lot like The Lord of the Rings where if you want a strict reinterpretation of the text you have read 733 times since you were 6 years old and first found the book.  You're going to be like, you know, they forgot that part with the glass in the bar.  You know, they just forgot that part.  But I think it... I mean Kevin, let me know if you agree with this or not, but I think it really captured the spirit of the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, I read the book like you did and I think it was just great.  But there was a lot of people that walked out of the theater a little confused because they didn't read the book.  I don't think they quite understood what was going on or it took them a while to kind of understand what was going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Most of the critics said that there was no humor. It wasn't funny in the book if it wasn't for nothing else.  I laughed my ass off.  Alright. So I thought it was good.  I wish we could get John on because of all of us John really has the most to say.  He interviewed Douglas Adams many times.  In fact, as I remember, talked to Douglas Adams just shortly before his death for Tech TV.  I'm a big fan from the original Hitchhikers, which was a radio show.  It was made into a book later and a cheesy TV series, which was the ultimate in cheese.  But I've been reluctant to see the movie.  I'm thinking I don't want my memory spoiled.  So you say it's worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think anything is going to spoil the book, Leo.  I mean, it even breaks the story.  The New York Times hugely like it.  I'm up on my favorite movie review site, which is RottenTomatoes.com.  It just coagulates all the different ones.  Yeah, it's kind of funny to read the snippets in here.  Sturdy, hugely harmless, Stutney's long and development film rendition, pasteurizes the book's renegade verb with typical means, special effects and gooey romance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to save John's comments in this log here and put this in as part of the...  This is the funniest thing.  You guys are missing the fun here.  He says, do watch the TV show on DVD.  He says, very good.  And he's asking maybe a little editorial input there on the word coagulates.  Just thought I'd throw that in.  Let me get another question in for the Twits here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, Patrick, Kevin, Robert, Yoshi, whoever's there.  Anyway, my question basically is, Kevin Rose, you have a Mac Mini.  Did you ever do any kind of video editing?  I know it's only on one point something gigahertz processor, but I mean, how is it?  With Tiger on it and iLife O5, I mean, how does it hold up?  Is it worth it?  Or is it worth me going for Mac?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All these guys are asking Mac questions.  I guess it is Tiger week, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess so.  You know, as far as video editing is concerned, I really wouldn't recommend going with the Mini just because the hard drive is only a 5400 RPM hard drive.  You're going to have a little bit of some issues if you're capturing all that from your DV cam.  Can you get an external firewire?  Yeah, you could.  You could go firewire.  You could go USB 2.  But I don't know.  I mean, for me personally, we do a lot of heavy...  We treat our video quite a bit with different plugins.  And so with the G4 processor at 1.42, it's probably not going to work out for us as far as what we do with it.  If you're just looking to do little home movies with iMovie, maybe you'll probably be fine.  But if you're looking to do something with a little more production value reaction, you're going to have to sit there and render out frames.  You'll probably want to beef it up a little bit and go with at least a low end G5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's more of an are you an iMovie editor or are you a Final Cut Pro editor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd say screw it. Get the 2.7 GHz Dual G5. You'll be happy. Life will be rich and full for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My editor Keith in the background is yelling at me not to recommend it.  He's a Premiere Pro type of guy. So just stick with the PC and get Premiere Pro.  Well, I have to say that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Premiere Pro is just like an editing system, only harder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it. Premiere Pro is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have to say that is one area the PC has a huge advantage is the variety and power of the video cards available.  And that can make a big difference in rendering and 3D graphics and things like that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For rendering though, for video rendering itself, that's usually a CPU intensive task.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's CPU based. Okay, okay. You're not going to benefit on the cards there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think if you're a light editor, there's a bunch of people on this podcast right now that did a bunch of editing on G3s with iMovie.  And it didn't kill us. But I mean, you're always going to want more power, but there's no reason you couldn't use it for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dvorak says Premiere Pro sucks and the caller sounds like a mass murderer.  I agree with that one.  That's Mav631. If you'd like to ask a question, it's not a call. It's a recorded question. We don't take emails either.  You've got to record your question and email it along to us at thisweekintech.gmail.com.  And we'll feature maybe your question on the air.  Anything else on your minds these days, guys?  I thought one of the funniest stories of the week was Steve Jobs banning all John Wiley and Sons books from the Apple stores. Did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was interesting. Did anybody get a copy of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the new book isn't out until June 30th. I haven't seen the galleys of it. Maybe Dvorak has.  It's Jeffrey Young who's already written a biography of Jobs.  This is about Jobs' second act.  It's a second act. And if you look at the subtitle, it says, The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business.  Can't be much of a slam of Steve Jobs. I don't know what Jobs is so angry about.  But that's pretty high handed to say, well, just because of that, not only are we not going to sell the biography, that I can understand,  we're not going to sell any books from that publisher. That includes books from David Pogue, from Andy Inocco, from Bob Lovitis.  I mean, these are some of the superstars in the Mac book world. All the dummies books, OS X for dummies, gone.  I thought all Pogue's missing manual books were O'Reilly.  They are. They're a different publisher. But he's written, apparently, I'm reading the article here.  That's what I thought too, but apparently he has written. You know, Pogue will write for anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pogue also can write more than any other human being I've ever met.  Pogue is scary. Pogue is scary, I have to say.  But in a cool, I want to be like him when I grow up way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, again, I wish John could be here because he says he has it on good authority that Jobs was not behind the decision  and that the book is not much worse than the first book by Jeffrey Young.  So I still don't understand the decision. If Jobs wasn't, how could Jobs not be behind it? Jobs was behind everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  After the war, was it a toady then? Was it a Jobs toady that shut it down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't understand. I mean, doesn't Steve sign off on every single thing that happens at Apple? Of course he does.  Of course he does. And do you think anybody would dare do anything without Steve saying yes,  especially something that draws this much bad attention?  Frankly, if you want to sell a book, this is the best way to do it.  Make it be banned. Make it be so bad that Jobs pulled all of the publisher's books from the bookstore.  Don't you think everybody in the world is going to read this book now?  Jeffrey Young has to be jumping up and down.  DeVorek says it was a toady.  This is strange having John be... You know what it feels like?  It feels like John died and I'm channeling him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You need a text-to-voice translator so you can just...  The body of John. I will channel him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is just bizarre. I can't tell you folks, I mean I've worked with John for years,  I'm looking at his picture, his smiling picture with a goofy hat on,  and he's typing at me and I feel like he's talking to me from beyond the grave.  It's scary!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just going to tell you about a random site I just came across,  you guys got to check out when you get a chance.  It's called boxedthoughts.com  and it basically allows you to put in what's going through your head in a little tiny box,  a little 100 pixel by 100 pixel box,  and then you can only post every four hours so you can see people's different thoughts,  and it's all anonymous.  Can you just drink a Berry's Go Mega?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was me!  Isn't that cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's rich in Omega.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a pretty cool little site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Alright, let me do something here. So how do you do it? You just click...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you have to sign up with a profile, then it creates an anonymous user.  These are all anonymous thoughts.  People are talking about how they want to break up with their girlfriends,  but they can't tell her, and there's all these crazy thoughts floating around.  So you're 012853. See, now we know.  Well, you're not supposed to know that!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're supposed to be anonymous!  Why is telling her so hard? And you get to pick the color too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't write that one.  Jesus is alive!  Yeah, you get to pick the different colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did I ever tell you how much I hate you? Oh, this is cool.  This is like that confession thing that...  Right.  Yeah, I like this.  It's fun.  Remember the old...  Boxed thoughts.  There was the old international confession booth. That was very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, good.  I'm partial to the churchsigngenerator.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I like that. That's a good...  You know what's cool about this? It's been out two days.  Kevin, you're so... This is your site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. I'm not. I saw it on Digg. That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is only been out for... This is the second day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That just goes to show you how quick stuff gets...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I see. I've never heard of Digg.com, but welcome Digg users.  Good. I'll stick this part in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Digg is yours, isn't it?  Yeah, Digg's mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I surf that every day.  Isn't that great?  I like that service.  Brilliant. I like it.  Good. Well, watch this. We're going to send this guy through the roof.  That's our site of the week, boxedthoughts.com.  That's awesome.  Let's see if we can bring the server down. He's going to hate us.  Ladies and gentlemen, I think this is going to conclude this edition of...  Do we really want to call it This Week in Tech? That is so boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you want to extend the naming contest for another week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe. Now, what about This Week in Geek?  The problem is I need to have... You're piggybacking on my TLR feed,  and it needs to have its own feed, I think.  This thing was huge, beyond belief.  I can't tell you how the servers were slammed.  Just the torrent tracker I was running was slammed, let alone the downloads.  I'm not downloading them directly.  We're using the Coral Content Distribution Network and BitTorrent,  because otherwise it would be terabytes.  That's a really good response.  So John has a couple of suggestions.  He says the Tech Tits and Ass Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be T-T-A-S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tech Tits and Ass and Celebrities.  Tech T&A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Celebrities are good for ratings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not bad.  And he says the Nude Tech Guru.  He's obviously been listening to Dawn and Drew.  This is a podcast with a couple who live in a farmhouse  somewhere in the middle of nowhere.  And I swear the reason it's one of the most popular podcasts  is because they pretend... I don't think they're doing it.  They pretend they're naked when they're doing it.  And she played a juice harp with her private parts the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So much more information than I needed, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you like to volunteer for that?  Is this something you subscribe to, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's strangely compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I've listened to a couple of Dawn and Drew shows.  I've never once caught on to the idea that they're supposed to be naked.  Well, maybe it was just the one I listened to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's a sexy kind of no-holds-barred show, right?  Okay, so I guess we're going to... I don't know.  We're going to call it TWIT.  We're going to call it This Week in Tech.  Just because we have to have a name, but that's not really the name.  That is just the name that we give out on the directories.  Okay? And we'll come up with a better name someday.  What about Geek Week? Do you like Geek Week, This Week in Geek?  That's not bad.  Geek Week? The nude...  Sounds catchy.  Geek Week.  For sure.  Well, if we did that, we'd have to award a prize.  Because that was suggested by...  I'm looking for his name.  You win a box of crabs!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Kirk Gullick!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kirk Gullick, come on down for your box of crap!  See, now Dvorak says he likes TWITs, so there I go. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See, the acronym of that is great. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  TWITs? Yeah.  Well, TWIG is This Week in Geek.  Oh, I don't know. I think TWIT is good.  I was thinking Mr. TWIG.  Mr. TWIG?  South Park.  Gentlemen, I'm sure you have other things to do in your life.  This has been a two-hour edition.  I'm going to be editing it a little bit.  But I thank you for your time.  And again, we want to encourage those of you who enjoy the podcast to subscribe.  Keep it on the air.  Your $2 a month helps us do this fine programming.  I'm starting to sound like a pledge break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like you're sponsoring a child or something like that.  With every pledge of over $2, you'll get a fine mint.  Well, and that's the other thing.  We'll write personal letters to the people that subscribe.  No, we won't. You will. Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, we've got, we saw it. We have 200 subscriptions.  And I'm thrilled. I thank each and every one of you.  We are saving your email addresses as you subscribe.  So at some point we could do a special event.  I'm thinking a meetup.  Maybe we'll start doing some giveaways to people who subscribe.  I think we could do that. We can arrange for some nice prizes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need to do a meetup. That would be a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Meetup would be fun. Find out who these people really are, huh?  We'll figure it out. But there will be additional benefits.  But the main benefit is the good feeling to know that you're supporting  this kind of unadvertised programming.  Maybe you don't want to. Maybe you'd like to take money from us.  There's no button on the page for that.  The email address this week in geek at gmail.com.  The webpage is not yet up, but at some point it will be twit.tv.  But meanwhile, you can subscribe to the podcast at all the usual places.  Hey guys, thanks a lot.  You guys still there?  Just going out with it.  Just got in and out there.  Well, somebody sent me a fake screensavers theme.  Where did I put it?  And he thought maybe we would like to use this as a theme for the show.  It kind of sounds like the screensavers, but let me play it for you. It's pretty funny.  Alright guys, I have a lot of editing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To beep or not to beep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, let's all meet again here, same time next week.  You got it.  Thanks. See you guys.  Take care guys.  Well, that does it for this edition of This Week in Tech.  I'm Leo Laporte.
