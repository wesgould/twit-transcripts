Transcript:  This is Twit, This Week in Tech, episode 24 for Sunday, September 25th, 2005.  Welcome once again. This week in Tech Live from Nunez Bar and Grill in beautiful downtown  Larkspur Landing, California, and a big cast of Twits today in our once again live broadcast.  Shall I introduce you? Somebody sent me an email and said, for some reason my pod, my MP3 player dies  after the first half hour. So could you do all the good stuff in the first half hour and introduce people at the end of the show?  And I thought, no, I can't. Patrick Norton, ladies and gentlemen.  I love you. Sitting to his right, John C. Dvorak. Hello. He gets no spam. Although apparently that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, actually, well somebody sent me some in the mail, but I do have some news later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right. We'll talk about that. Robert Herron from PC Magazine. Robert. Roger Chang from Gamespot.com.  David Prager is here. He's from Rev3. And of course, last but not least, Kevin Rose.  And also, we're going to talk a little bit later on to Amber MacArthur who is here from Command & Television and Call for Help.  And from OpenAlpha.tv, we've got Jen Cutter. So we've got more people. And by popular demand, we finally got some women on the show.  You know, after we had Jessica Corbin on, I've been asking her back again and again, and she just won't come anywhere near us.  Her email address doesn't work either. Yeah, she's decided to even. She's changed her locks.  Maybe she's not getting the emails with the requests. So because, John, you're so famous for I Get No Spam, we got some hats.  This is a I Get No Spam hat for John C. Dvorak. Look at that. Isn't that great? This is what I need.  I didn't order that. I want to thank Chris Haynes from Corporate Casuals who made those. We get a lot of good stuff.  There's a twit hat. If you guys like these, we can hand these around. If you guys like these, we can make...  Would you buy twit hats if they were available? It's going to end up being like one of those...  We don't have enough to give them to everybody. We don't do any advertising. We just sell clothes.  Well, it's going to be like one of those concerts for somebody who hasn't had a hit in 30 years, but they're selling the stuff in the back.  And then, from Australia, you came all the way from Australia? Step up to the red mic there.  This is going to be the first twit where we actually spend the first 20 minutes talking nonsense.  Where are you from? From Sydney, Australia. That's great. Welcome. And you brought us something to eat. What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you say something about shrimp on the barbie? Shrimp on the barbie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  When I get back there, can you say hi to my friend Canadian Paul, who's in Sydney right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure you'll see him right off the... They brought you some kangaroo jerky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Mmm. That's good. I'm glad you're enjoying it. You're eating it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Australians wouldn't eat that, you know. They don't drink fosters either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's true. We don't drink fosters. We wouldn't touch fosters. They eat it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm told that. It's for Americans.  By the way, the flavor enhancer is 621. That's monosodium glutamate.  Oh. Hey, we figured it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It says not to be sold in the United States.  I made that up. I did declare it coming in. And they thanked me.  The customs guy said, thanks for bringing us jerky. They said, thanks for actually admitting it.  And he let you in. And he let me in. It's sanitary jerky. It's sanitary, yeah.  Well, thank you. It's very nice of you. We really appreciate it.  It is good. And we're giving it to everybody.  He's our longest guest ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's our longest traveling audience member.  The farthest audience member? People come from all over.  To see us.  Let's give him a can of Spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, it's a...  Cultural exchange. That's what that is.  We apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's a cultural exchange.  Are we going to talk about the most important story of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is the most important story of the week by far?  The MS Re-Org or Tebow driving itself off a cliff?  The official announcement of the breakup of Microsoft.  That's not the biggest story of the week.  Oh yeah, DeVoyac announced it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But Microsoft didn't. Now we're all going to sound like we're eating beef, kangaroo jerky the whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Let's pause the tape for a moment while we all finish chewing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's no tape. There's no tape.  So Microsoft did a Re-Org. First, what's the story there? What did they do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it looks to me as though they're in a panic mode.  Here's a company, by the way, that has basically the stocks flatlined over the last few years.  Historically, Microsoft's always attracted a lot of really good people by promising them a lot of stock options  and then letting the stock go flying high and then they'd make all the money on the stock.  And they wouldn't have to pay them a lot.  Right. But they made millionaires.  Now they've got to actually pay them real money and people aren't interested.  They'd rather be millionaires than high salaries lurkers.  This accounts for the brain drain to Google.  And many a brain drain. I mean, there's a lot of guys I've run into over the last couple of years  who work for Microsoft. And they're all these go-getters and they're much happier working in a little startup  where they can get some, maybe make a few million dollars on a stock deal.  So by Re-Orging it, and it looks like if you look at the Re-Org, it's almost like if you could,  if you just theoretically divided the company up into three companies that could stand alone,  that's what they're doing. And it seems to me they're either going to punch out a couple of, one or more of these companies.  So what are the three divisions?  You got Xbox and all that stuff.  The consumer.  Yeah, and it's got the keyboards and all the other things.  And then you have the operating system tools guys.  And then you have the office software stuff.  That does sound like three, and three fairly good companies.  Yeah, and the office guys, they can do the SAP kind of products and they do the enterprise stuff.  And then the original Microsoft I think would be, I think if they were going to retain a name,  they'd retain it for the OS part of the business.  Oh, so they'd have to rename these other, these spinoffs.  I think these could either be another public company that could have their separate stocks or it could be,  they could even take the Xbox one, it seems to me, and roll it out as an IPO.  And because they're going to need a lot of cash to compete in that business, roll it out as an IPO and then become a, you know, just a gaming company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But John, if you were going to do a Re-Org, you would re-org along business lines anyway.  I mean, it doesn't mean that they're going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've re-orged five or six times and they've never re-orged this nicely.  I mean, you know, there's all kinds of ways of re-orging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Or are they finally trying to get back to the original flat management structure that kind of carried them during the first couple decades?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, it seems to me that what I argue is that if you take a look at the Microsoft cash cows and their core competencies,  each one of these separate entities has one of them, not two of them in it, which means that they could sustain.  Right.  I think it's a bust-up.  So when is it going to happen?  It would take probably a year and a half to two years.  And where does Bill go?  I think Bill would go with the OS company.  That's what it is.  But he'd get a lot of stock with the other companies.  Yeah, it'd sit on the board of all the companies, right?  Where does Balmer go?  Well, you know, Jeff Rakes is...  Who gets Balmer?  I think Balmer's going to retire.  I think Jeff Rakes, by the way, they had to give him something eventually.  He's the guy that they gave the office division to.  And Rakes is the guy they've been grooming since day one to be the CEO.  Right.  And he can't just be sitting around forever waiting for Balmer to, you know, retire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, does the center fit in in all of that?  Do you think that would go for the entertainment Xbox side of it?  Is that OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Interesting. Not OS.  That would make a pretty powerful...  No, I don't think it would go on the OS side.  Pretty powerful group.  Jim Alchin's going to leave next year.  He has health problems.  Oh, okay.  That explains that.  Yeah.  Interesting.  I think that's a good theory.  I mean...  It's as good as any.  It's as good as any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It makes the stock more attractive as a speculation.  There's precedent for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Other companies have done this.  AT&T's done it very successfully.  HP's done it.  HP did it.  It's successfully in the short term, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, actually, you're right.  I shouldn't say AT&T's was very successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Motorola's free-scale successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's plenty of examples.  The HP stuff where they spun off the...  Right, the printer division.  There's a...  Well, HP spun off all the...  Instruments.  Right, the instrument.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it's not an unusual thing to do.  unwieldy.  It's too big.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I wanted to...  Is TiVo...  You said TiVo shot itself in the foot?  We did that last week.  Oh, the subscription stuff?  The red flag?  What's the subscription stuff?  This is stuff that actually...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is stuff that actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Something new?  I think TiVo is trying to drive itself out of business as quickly as possible.  I got a nasty letter from...  It sure seems that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  ...from somebody at TiVo who said, how could you say that?  It's a great company.  We love...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It may be a great company and it may be a great product, but with like...  I mean, you look at MifTV.  There's all the different media boxes that are coming out there.  Any new TiVo service subscription activated on or after September 6, 2005, you agree to  subscribe to the TiVo service for no less than 12 months, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah.  And if you cut out, they charge you a $150 early termination fee.  And you agree to pay such an early...  Any such early termination fee.  That's like a cell phone company, doesn't it?  It's very much like a cell phone company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But that would explain...  Then they can give you the hardware cheap or free, right?  Well, they're all...  Is that the plan?  It's 50 bucks after rebate.  I mean, that's pretty close to...  It doesn't get a lot cheaper than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What percentage of providers don't have their own system that they want to give out?  Everybody does.  I just got the Comcast cable box.  It's just like the TiVo box.  So then who are the customers now for Ti...  Who are TiVo's new customers then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't know, because it's a pain in the butt.  Because you have to get the cable to work or the infrared blaster.  See, that's why they're doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  If they can partner with the cable card individuals, the company's much more bad.  That makes more sense.  And right.  Use their front end to...  They don't want to do that though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, people like Comcast...  And the child got information.  Is there anybody that would buy TiVo?  As a company, you mean?  I would buy a dual tuner TiVo.  No, no, he means the company.  That would buy the TiVo.  Buy the company out.  You know, Apple was rumored for a while, but that doesn't really make any sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I mean, someone like Comcast, I mean, their DVR sucks if you look at it.  It works.  Well, he says it works.  But it doesn't have the recommendations and things like that.  Do you use the recommendations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I haven't before.  My TiVo thinks I'm the gay pregnant man, that one?  No, I don't.  I think the only thing that's missing...  That's the show's the same thumbs up to you.  The only thing that's missing is the wish list where you can enter in, you know, I want  to see everything...  And season pass.  Right.  It has a season pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, it does?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, I haven't played with that.  It's not intuitive to get to it.  That's where you can record every episode of a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Everybody does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody does that.  Do all PVRs at this point match TiVo's functionality in terms of if your show changes times or  channels?  Well, I don't know.  I have to say if the show changes times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think so because shows are identified by a number, a unique number, and all it's doing  is looking for that number.  I don't think it cares what the program guide looks like.  That's a VCR you're talking.  TiVo's recording by number.  I don't think that's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Dish Network one seems to work on time constraints.  Like, you're recording a time, not a show?  Yeah, I mean, it says show and you click on it and it spins it out, but if the show doesn't  show up or it gets moved, it doesn't record it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'll tell you why.  The Comcast is because you can look ahead to when the next recordings will be and it  will be in a variety of different times.  Not far ahead though.  Can you look ahead a year?  No, you cannot.  That's because of the Tribune listings.  It's using the Tribune listings.  You can only look as far ahead as the listings go.  A couple of weeks.  Yeah, but that means that the machine is smart enough to say I'm recording this show, not  this time slot because that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But TiVo isn't that smart though because you can still set the little buffers like five  minutes before the show or five minutes after because it can't tie into that program guide  information like a Comcast box could.  Right?  No, TiVo offers all of that.  But what if it changes on the back end?  What if Comcast flips the time on TiVo?  TiVo doesn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's up to the program originator, either the station broadcasting it or the owner itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't tell TiVo to record a sporting event and go over time.  You're not going to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It doesn't know.  The providers tweaking start times and stop times of programs by a minute or so just to  screw up the TiVo people who are recording.  What I'm saying is if you have a Comcast box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which makes like zero sense if you think about it.  What would you want to screw up somebody that wants to watch your show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That it really boggles because you want them to watch the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  If you have a sporting event and there's like a Comcast box running and it runs a half hour  late or you know extra innings or whatever, will the Comcast box continue to record all  the way through the end of the sporting event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  None of them will currently because it doesn't know.  Unless you tell it otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It don't know.  There might be a plugin for Myth that does something like that.  How many people offer dual tuners?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Of all the direct TV users.  Comcast box has dual tuners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah it does.  I just got my new box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It has HDMI out now.  Does yours have it too?  No I have DVI out.  I would like HDMI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Although DVI is the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Do the end of those boxes let you actually pull the content straight out?  No of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's so funny because they have like a couple of Firewire ports.  They have a couple USB ports.  They have ethernet but you can't do anything with those ports.  None of them work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I tried the Firewire port.  I thought oh cool.  Because my TV has a Firewire port.  Nothing happens.  It's just a connector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's actually no wiring on the inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I sat down with TiVo to go service this weekend and actually tried to move content from my  TiVo to my PC and then burn that to a DVD I could play in a set top player.  How'd that work?  It sucks.  It sucks so bad.  Number one they've clearly made a deal and part of this is the Macrovision that has been  there for a long time but the new features that allow a content broadcasters to then  flag willy-nilly however they want whether or not you can keep it.  But the other deal is with Sonic Solutions and their DVD burning software.  The only way to burn from a TiVo box series 2 to a DVD that you can play in your set top  box is using Sonic Solutions software which costs you 50 bucks.  So they must have made a deal with them at some point to say look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well it seems like they're desperate for revenue streams anywhere they can get them at this  point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  what it's encrypted on your TiVo or whatever but the time it takes you not only to move  it over however fast your network is but then to simply decode all that video.  I had two hours of content.  It probably took me close to two hours to get that onto a DVD and that's just.  Most people use the Mythbox for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The MythTV takes care of all these problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You turned him on to MythTV Kevin and now he's like this big MythTV supporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually it was Milo.  Oh Milo Medin?  Yeah.  He turned me on to MythTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You did watch the System episode though right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah but actually I saw his thing afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Somebody would just make a generic set top box though that you could do that with without  having to.  MythTV was going to have a reference platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you been following that?  A hardware and software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No I haven't seen that.  Is it going to say this is the specs that you should build the box on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah the guys who invented MythTV combined with some other hardware guys were going to  come out with a reference platform so you could have an Opix like disk that was MythNopix.  Well there is.  That's what you used isn't it?  You have all the specs for exactly what you can put in there.  That would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That would be nice yeah.  And then just build a disk.  You don't have to do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just follow the instructions, throw this thing together, throw the disk in your recording.  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Keith has been sitting on the same hardware designs for way too long.  Why are there no analog dual tuner boxes yet?  Sure you can get it for DirecTV but that's it.  I think that's one of the most important.  Once you start using a system like TiVo it's having that dual tuner ability.  The ability to watch anything you want and to record anything you want simultaneously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Item 3 Steve Jobs says the record companies are greedy.  They are.  Wow.  No more than iTunes.  Isn't this news from like 2 or 3 weeks ago?  2 or 3 years ago.  Well you know that in January the, no because here's the story.  It is old news in the sense that in January and we've known this for a while the record  companies get to renegotiate with Apple and they're pushing Apple to raise, to have two  tier.  We talked about it at that time.  Yeah like those margins Apple.  We talked about it.  Well Jobs has stepped forward and said if the record companies do that they will be  encouraging piracy and they're greedy and he's actually taking a pretty firm stand  that he will not establish two tier pricing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well it's other thing is that the record companies are already hitting back and saying well yeah  we're not getting a split of the iPod sales so cough up or find another source for your

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  music.  Yeah well I mean both of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah but why should they get a cut of the iPod sales?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They don't want, no what they're saying, what Steve is saying is there's no room to make  more money here.  It's got to be 99 cents.  I'm terribly sorry you negotiated the deal and the record companies are like hey we don't  have this fabulous hardware model we're making money off of.  You're making a lot of money off the access we've given you to our catalogs.  Do you want to continue to have access to the catalogs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're getting 70 cents on every one of those sales.  What are they bitching about?  They're doing okay.  That's not what I've heard.  70 cents is what the number of the media is.  70.30 yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.  Edgar Bronfman, former Seagram's heir, who now owns Warner Music Group said iTunes needs  us as much as we need iTunes.  So I mean there is a battle there.  It's true.  Who is more powerful?  Obviously record companies could pull out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a tradition with the record industry that used to happen with the retailers.  Tower Records is a classic example.  One day some years ago they said we're not paying you.  And they put the screws to us and said we're putting on net 90.  You're not getting paid for a while and the record companies.  What are they going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What are they going to do?  Of course Tower is still around.  They're still doing it.  Kind of.  You've got to think that Apple in the long run, the iTunes music store, is pretty important  to the record companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So would you still buy if they bumped the prices up to a buck fifty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well what they're talking about, which is fine with me, is charge a buck fifty for the  new stuff and then charge less for the old stuff, which I think is fine.  This is what Bronfman says.  He says there's no content in the world that doesn't have some price flexibility.  Not all songs are created equal.  So some songs are worth more.  We want to charge more.  Some songs are worth less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll charge less.  I think that's the confidence of this in the history of the record industry.  Those singles always sold for one fixed price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, you go to the store and there's a sale.  They have a close out bin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some junk they're trying to move into the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Now you have online retailers with flexible pricing.  Well that's the thing.  They could change the price all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's nothing physical that they have to get rid of.  It's just a file on a disk.  It's nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  From their point of view, look we're in this great ultimate flexible world.  It's like airline seats.  Look at the airline seats.  You can charge whatever the market will bear and you can change it minute by minute using  computers.  I'm sure they'd love to do that.  Screw the customer as much as possible.  Sales go up, price goes up.  It's a perfect situation.  You can monitor it and change it as ad hoc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't think that'll happen?  Who knows?  I just think it's ridiculous that these guys don't have their act together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think Steve's right that if consumers get PO'd, they'll just go back to Kazan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I agree.  Right now, I'm okay with spending 99 cents a song, but with a dollar 50, I'm going to  go to a Russian site and go crazy.  You know what I'm talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How do those guys get away with all of MP3?  What is this you're talking about?  Russian sites?  I don't know what you mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All of MP3.com.  How do they get away with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I guess there's no copyright law in Russia, right?  Would you like some more kangaroo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's no enforcement.  They've had people go after them, but they've...  It's Russia.  What are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can say the same thing about the States.  East Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of sites there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Bulgaria.  We must drive the record companies crazy.  I've talked to end users who say, no, I'm paying.  I get it from all of MP3s and I pay them 10 bucks a month.  Technically, they are paying.  They are paying someone who claims that legitimate right to resell the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They think it's legal.  And then according to the guys at all of MP3s, scumbag is legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Except for the latest tracks that come out, music is really a commodity at this point.  It is.  Damn it.  And then we'll have it on...  Pretty soon, every hard drive you're going to buy is going to come preloaded with music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It gives you 50 cents a cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's going to be library type material.  What about the Yahoo!  It's open to everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Five bucks a month unlimited.  Is that a good model?  There's a subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of people like it.  You get the program called Move Audio.  MUV Audio.  You can go look it up.  And you strip out the copy.  I know.  It does.  It's like an intermediate thing.  It's like a song.  It takes the data stream and kind of slips in between like a plug-in and says, hmm, let  me just move the file over to this, over to here.  I'll take that.  And then so as it's playing it, it's saving it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But if you think about Apple's model for a dollar a song, that is no bargain.  That is as expensive as a CD going to the store and buying it.  And the quality is worse.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  You don't have the nice little package and the liner notes and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There's room for innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Item four.  Name that worm.  There is the common malware enumeration initiative.  I can see you're all very excited about this.  This is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is worse.  Well, this was like the phone mergers you had up.  All of us are like, hmm, tell us more, Mr. Burrows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I think this is a good name, good idea, because right now, if you get a virus, PC  ceiling calls it one thing.  Symantec calls it another thing.  Kaspersky calls it one thing.  You don't know what your virus is.  And go do a search.  You can't figure it out.  So they're finally saying, look, we have to come up with a common naming scheme.  It's actually cert.  So we have a computer emergency readiness team that's promoting this so that there's  one name for each virus.  One girlfriend named in each virus name.  And just leave it at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's about time.  All in favor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're done.  Next item.  Certified normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So it shall be done.  Make a note of that, will you, David?  Of course.  Firefox.  Is it safer than Internet Explorer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It is if you patch to 1.07.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Not if you don't patch, though.  Yeah, big flaw.  And now there's a very explicit online, a very explicit description of how to take advantage  of this flaw.  And you can just take over somebody's computer.  You should put this on dvorak.org slash blog.  They will.  They just go there and you could own their computer.  Make them come back again and again.  I can rack up my numbers and then show it to some advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Make some money out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Some security, I get this a lot.  And I'm actually curious what you guys think.  Some security experts say, oh no, look at Internet Explorer.  There are fewer flaws this year than there were in Firefox.  Firefox is holy.  And then others, and I include myself in this, say, you know, but the problem is that Internet  Explorer is an invitation to spyware.  Firefox is not.  And it's open source.  So of course we know about the bugs, right?  I wouldn't use anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  How many people here use Internet Explorer currently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, how many in the audience?  How many in the audience?  Internet Explorer users.  That one guy.  Step forward.  Okay, we got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  How many people are using Firefox, Mozilla?  Anybody?  Yeah, almost everybody else.  So obviously we've conned you all into it.  It's our fault.  It's our fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's our fault.  Because we make millions.  You know, you find that the smart money, I noticed this on my blog because I track all  the users.  And when this, you can tell when somebody links from like a kind of a dumb site and  then somebody links from a smart site, depending on, I mean, by dumb I mean users that aren't  really sophisticated.  They come from MSN or AOL.  You can see the browser stats change drastically.  The Firefox people, or smart users all use Firefox.  It's like Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Anybody intelligent?  Well, this was a few years ago.  But this is how you could test if somebody, you used to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used to do it all the time on the Big Thinkers.  I'd ask, you know, whoever it was.  In fact, I got Newt Gingrich.  I said, what do you use for a search engine?  You know, he should be using Google.  He says Yahoo.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does anyone use Opera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Opera's free now.  I bought Opera back in the day.  I bought Opera back in the day.  I used it over Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two.  Yeah, there's a couple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a couple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like Opera.  Opera's a great product.  I think Opera's pretty nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Introduce tap browsing in a popular browser.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And now they're free.  What's their plan?  How are they going to survive?  Survive?  They took the ads out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You know what though?  They've done some innovative stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's how they make money.  Oh, is that how they make money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  What is it, Mozilla, off of Firefox, they make like 12 million a year from their Google  searches.  From the Google searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, you mean Google gives them a kickback when you use that little Google thing in the  address bar?  They get a kickback?  We've got to write a browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  12 million a year?  Yeah, you didn't read that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They're making, they're creating a for-profit section of Mozilla.  And this is like a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It says, Opper's built-in search box is currently powered by Google and Opper gets a cut anytime  a user happens to find their way to a Google ad via that search box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Don't we all use that search box in the browser, right?  I mean, you don't go to Google.com anymore.  You use the search box in the browser.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I miss out on all the Google doodles now.  It stinks.  Yeah, you're right.  You don't see the cartoons on the front page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, I miss them completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Because you use Google's start page.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also have a good, their browsers are scalable, so they license to a lot of phones.  That's where they really make them.  When we had Jan van Tetschner on, that's what he was talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The portable market, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Speaking of which, there's the first portable phone that makes an attempt to jump to your  PC virus.  It's a Symbian virus.  I don't know, they're all Symbian for some reason.  When you sync up to your PC, it jumps off your phone onto your PC to infect your PC.  Fortunately, it's hard to get on the phone.  It's probably harder to get on somebody's phone than it is to get on their PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  How many people are making Mac dimensions?  Sounds like a publicity stunt.  Either a Bluetooth link or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think all viruses are publicity stunts, ultimately, for the virus author, don't you?  Do you see this?  Google's offering free Wi-Fi now in San Francisco.  No one I know has been able to find it.  It was cracked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not cracked, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It uses PPTP, which if you use a bad password, it's easily crackable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's secure, here's the deal.  It's secure.  They're doing it.  I think there's a couple of access points in San Francisco, so nobody here has tried  it, has just found it.  The idea is, people are saying this is the next thing for Google.  They're going to do free Wi-Fi.  I don't know, it must be one of them things where you get revenue somehow just by people  magically using your system.  You probably have a splash screen that's got something.  We'll be sitting here, we'll be using Google Wi-Fi, but right now, you go on a Windows  machine, you have to download a little app.  What the little app does is it handshakes.  Somebody's figured out that it's just PPTP.  In fact, there's an Apple script that makes it work on OS X for free.  If Google does do this, unless they turn this off, you'll be able to use Google VPN.  Actually, you can do it now.  You can use Google VPN on any wireless.  I could use it right now.  What you'll do is you'll log into Google's servers, VPN servers, and you're securely  surfing on any access point.  That goes into their Google servers.  Right, it's VPN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I was using that actually from some of the hardware that works I was playing around with  this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Isn't that cool?  This is going to make Google a ton of money.  A ton of money.  How?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Targeted ads or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Targeted ads.  We'll be sitting here right now.  You'll have your little sidebar.  It'll know where we're at.  It'll say, hey, Noonan's has a special on beer.  That's the key.  I mean, it'll be amazing.  That's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I finally figured out that that's Google's entire strategy is as long as they know what  you're going to buy, they can-

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Or where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They can give you ads that you don't mind seeing because they're relative to what you're  doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So how long is it before the local stuff on Google actually starts to become accurate?  Because I like certain things like tire sale and it's like, wow, I can go to Sacramento  and buy tires.  That's local.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can't you just tell it to your radius?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You can't tell it your radius is five miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, but a lot of times it'll still spit back some unusual and peculiar results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because there's always some guy in Sacramento who paid for that ad sale.  You know, I don't care.  Put them in there.  Throw it in.  I mean, Norton might drive out 93 miles to Sacramento.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know, you've driven further for less.  I think Norton would.  Not for an extra $70 a tire, I won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's so funny, though, with all the wireless protection schemes we've come up with, be  it web or whatever, that finally we're rolling back to VPN in order to have a good, secure,  easy VPN.  But people have been saying that for years.  It works, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  People have been saying that, especially in the corporate world.  It's like firewall it, put it outside the network and have the VPN through it.  Guess what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You can't incline on it or use the one built into Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yep.  And that's what'll happen.  We're passing around the kangaroo meat.  Let me actually, I want to talk about an interesting story that happened in World of Warcraft.  But in order to do that, we have to bring in the two more members of our Twit contingent.  Would you mind, David and Roger, letting your seats, giving up your seats to Amber MacArthur  and Jen Cutter.  Why don't you come on down?  Amber, of course, is co-host of Call for Help with me in beautiful Toronto.  What brings you to the, go ahead, put your, yeah, you'll hear me better and we'll get  this here.  There you go.  What brings you to the States?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just decided to come down for the weekend.  Just for the weekend?  Just for the weekend.  Yesterday I went to a Webzine conference, which was pretty fun.  Webzine.  How was that?  It was really fun.  I think that's how you say his last name.  From Make Magazine.  Or is Make now, yeah.  Yeah, so it was good times and flying back tomorrow night.  Got to get ready for Call for Help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's right.  We've got a big shoe to plan.  Yes.  Well, I'm glad you're here.  How's Command End going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's awesome.  Actually, Brian, our post-production editor and camera is right there.  Brian came too?  There he is.  Yeah, with his fiance, Barb.  They're getting married next weekend.  I saw the Command End t-shirt and I thought she was just a fan.  She's in the family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Congratulations, you guys.  That's great.  Sorry, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're outing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So you're traveling the week before the wedding?  So everything's planned or are you guys eloping?  So basically, it's all, is somebody else handling it?  Okay, I'm just, okay, I'm like, wow, you're like, wedding, most people are like sweating  blood and like trying to buy napkins.  Yeah, I think you guys should just elope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Cut out the middle, man.  Vegas rocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's nothing more peculiar than watching a Vegas on a casino floor or watching a wedding  on a casino floor in Vegas.  On a casino floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  At least do the drive-through.  Yeah, the drive-through is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Inevitably, you go into a casino, there's a bride walking through going to the slot  machines.  It's the strangest kind of experience I've ever seen.  Big white dress.  That's my dream.  Is it?  Yeah.  Good luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Where were we at CES a couple years ago?  You and I are trying to like eat for the first time in 22 hours and it's like above the  Venice fake canals and there's just like, they're hammering through like every eight minutes.  There's a bride every condo.  They're coming up and there's like a guy with a Bible and like, you know, bam, they're through  and the next one comes up.  It's pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's really bad at the Venetians when you have the couple, especially the guy, you can  always tell he doesn't like this, they put him in the gondola and sing to him and drive  him up and down that idiotic canal they have in there which is like way too clean for Venice.  It's chlorinated.  Have you noticed that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They get this chlorine coming off the canal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Would you rather have a dirty, stinky, mold-filled canal?  I smell Venice's canal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is much better, probably.  Not as realistic though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm sure they could pipe in a scent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you do Command N is internet only?  Yep.  About 15 minutes a week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, actually we're getting up to almost 20 minutes now, so 20, 22 minutes.  This recent episode which is going out tonight is about I think 16, 17 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And you do it with Michael Zazara?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Michael Zazara and he's back in Toronto.  We've put him to work and Brian and my brother Jeff.  So there's only four of us involved, so it's a small, swift team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's good though.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I watch it regularly.  So this was our 16th episode that's going out tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Do you have any idea how many people are watching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's hard to say.  We estimate that approximately 50,000 downloads is about what we're getting each week.  So again, that's a bit of an estimate because of people bit-torning the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And you don't know if it's mostly Canada or if it's worldwide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we have some pretty decent stats.  So it's worldwide.  That's the interesting thing is there's people from all over the place watching from Australia,  the Netherlands, Sweden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That blows me away too for this.  Yeah, I know.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's really, really fun.  So I've met some interesting people from different places.  So that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And now you've met Dvorak and Heron and I know finally, I always listen to you guys.  So it's good to actually be here.  Also want to introduce Jen Cutter, who also has a internet television show called OpenAlpha.TV.  And have you done episode three yet?  Yes, I really did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's out just before I came here.  Hallelujah.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Quick one though.  You've been busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I shot it in the last shot, edited, posted in the last 24 hours before I got on  the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's just amazing to see this kind of emergence of all these shows.  What gave you the idea to do a show?  I mean, you had you don't have any TV experience or anything, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, nothing like that.  I would just I wanted some way to geek out about all the games and tech that I can't  do locally because I don't have many friends who are into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  She's a World of Warcraft player and I wanted to ask you about this virus.  Did you guys hear about this?  In World of Warcraft, there are instances, right?  These are dungeons that occur just for that party.  So you're the only ones wandering in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you go in with your group and then you get your own copy of it.  So the next group behind you isn't going to be in the same dungeon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Which is good.  You don't want to be fighting that.  So what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happened is there's this boss, I'm totally going to say his name wrong, but it's in the  Zalgora.  Well, no one knows how to pronounce it, right?  Yeah, they always have so many vowels in them.  So this boss is called Hacker and what happens is when he hits you, you get this corrupted  blood disease.  He's the god of blood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you get sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get sick.  Now this disease is pretty powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you've got to be a 50 or higher to even get in this instance.  So these are the top players.  You have a level 60 character, yeah?  But I'm a level 11.  I give you an example.  I've been playing for months, I'm a level 11.  So you've got to be pretty good.  So this god is fighting you with some pretty nasty stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this disease actually does about 300 damage a second.  Every second, your health is just plummeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If you're a level 60 and you get 300 a second, can you survive that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, especially because when you're in that kind of instance, you've got a priest  and a druid behind you.  The druid's going, you're better, you're better, you're better.  But you can't cure the disease though.  That was the cat.  So you just keep talking to him.  It doesn't wear off?  That was the problem.  Someone survived the fight, went back to the city with this disease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And infected the rest of Azeroth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Including the non-player characters like the Griffin Masters.  They would get sick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They would get sick.  Oh that's so cool.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But what happened is...  So these are the robot characters in the game.  They're getting sick too.  That's how realistic I guess the simulation is.  That's amazing.  And because if you're less than a level 50, it's going to kill you right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I started a new character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean I don't have 300 health in my whole life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've only got 200 right now with a level 6.  What happens is when you die of this disease, you then explode and everyone around you gets  that disease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes!

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's sick.  It's the Ebola of World of Warcraft.  They didn't plan it though this way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, not really.  The same thing happened a long time ago when someone's pet got sick and then they took  that pet into Ironforge and the pet exploded and took out everyone in the auction house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That just sounds like a great way to keep people coming back for more and more.  Now when you die in World of Warcraft, you're not out of the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You don't have to start over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's a 10% item durability penalty.  You just have to run back to your body from a graveyard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's the pain.  You have to go back.  You have to find your body and all that stuff.  So it's not like the end of the world.  What was the reaction of people to this?  Were people pissed off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Surprisingly, people thought it was really cool that this could happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  See, that was Robert's reaction.  It's a plague.  Bring it on!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Medieval times, oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, you get everybody ready for bird flu.  Yeah, right.  Avian flu, we're all set.  I think what's interesting is that that's how realistic these simulations have gotten.  If the programmers do something a little bit wrong, it kind of acts like the real world  and then spreads and all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I really anticipated some sort of scenario like that to leave that kind of code in there.  But did they think it would stay in the instance?  It might be organic, you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think they thought it would stay in the instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it was planned quite as it was going to get out the same way.  Someone probably just beat the boss on Hurstone back to town and then died in a touch of rain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  She was supposed to stick around and collect stuff and high-five the other players.  Instead, she went back to town and got everybody sick.  She was like Typhoid Mary.  So what did they do to control it?  Did they fix it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, some GMs are trying to quarantine players saying don't leave this area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  GMs are game masters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so of course those players would know and went running around trying to infect as  many people as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Watch out, I'm on Splode!  Hey everybody, party at my house.  Come on over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So the wacky coders who left the plague code in, basically, now the GMs are dealing with  the aftermath.  It's like, okay, if somebody gets it, we don't actually have a fix for this to keep it from  spreading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can quarantine them though, somehow.  They can.  So it puts you in an area where you can't contact anyone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They put you in a tree somewhere you can't get out of.  It's like an annoyance, but a fun one.  I think that you're going to see this is a success.  And I think whether it was serendipitous or not, I believe it was accidental, it's going  to happen a lot more now.  Because doesn't it make it more exciting and more interesting?  Throw in some variables like this into the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's kind of cool that usually with a high-level character, once they're set, they're a permanent  fixture of that game from that point on.  And I have a lot of friends who've made good money per month.  What is good money?  A couple, over, say, $2,000 to $3,000 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good money!  People are making $2,000 or $3,000 a month playing games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Jumping onto a brand new massive multiplayer game, building up a character before anyone  else and selling those characters.  You have to get in fast?  They buy it the day it comes out and they are just so damn good at those games.  Just because there's more newbies in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Jen's like that.  Jen told me she could level up very, very quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how much money can you make a month?  She doesn't do that.  Don't do it so much anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You did before?  It's a lot of grinding, but the cash was there and it probably still is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You make stuff too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You learn skills and you can make things.  She likes to fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I like to do a fish.  I made lots of money that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you ever actually fished in real life?  No, never.  She fishes in the game.  I think you should try it.  And then she shows the fish to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Spends a little too much time inside.  I thought that was a very interesting story.  I just think that we're getting...  I think it's kind of creepy personally.  You do?  Yeah, for some reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Really, I loved it.  I loved it.  I loved it.  I loved it.  I loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I loved it.  I loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I loved it.  I loved it.  Snow Crash, Neil Stevenson's classic sci-fi novel.  Really that was the first book that talked about a metaverse, a world that is so...  A virtual world that's so realistic that people live their lives in there.  There's an economy.  It's kind of like your place in Sebastopol.  Yeah, they're very much like that.  It's like the barn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, but in Snow Crash they were going to send the virus back into the real world.  That's right.  Could happen.  So if you all start twitching and talking to each other...  No, it can't happen.  Stay away from Jen, I guess.  It can't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It can't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Come on.  I guess.  All right.  Any other stories that we want to cover before...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I got the one about spam.  Oh, you get some spam.  No, actually, here's the deal.  Raise your hand.  I'm going to post this, by the way, so anyone listening should go to my blog.  What would that be?  And type in davorak.org slash blog.  Type in a content spam.  We have a fix for blog content spam that is astonishing.  It's essentially...  Mark Burkel came up with it.  What he's done is he's found a command within the Apache server command structure that you  can... which essentially do is block anybody who hits your...  Anyone who's got a blog that's running off of any of these systems has got content spam.  And you know...  It's a big problem.  It's ridiculous.  You have some problems with that, don't you?  People put the little numbers up to make you tell...  There's all the stuff you can do.  Well, essentially, there's a simple command... and I'll have the exact code posted... that  basically tells anybody coming in to your specific domain...  If they're not coming from your domain and they're posting comments, then it's just thrown  away because you can't really post a comment unless you're already on the site clicking  on the comment button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you're saying they're using some sort of bot to post the spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most...  It turns out...  Because my spam on content spam went...  Once Mark put this online, went from about 50 to 100...  Well, 50 typically, but sometimes as much as 100 over the weekend.  Content spam hits to two.  Wow.  And the two, we can't figure out how they got through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So this is just verifying that you'd use the in-page or inside the forms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, you're using his form instead of blasting...  Coming in from outside.  Simple, but...  It's so simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, Marcus is stunned that no one has come up with this because he can't find it  in the forms or anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, Kevin, you and Amber both use TypePad and they have any spam.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's called like TypeKey or something like that where they...  There's a couple different ways.  They give you the option in your account on how you would like to prevent spam and there's  one that you can turn on like...  I think it's called like TypeKey or something.  Do they have to use a capture?  You have to register.  Oh, you have to register?  You have to register as like a registered user and that kind of sucks.  It sucks.  It's nice to let people just comment it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because they're so far looking.  Yeah, but you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  People who comment anonymously and you can't email them tend to be just righteous bastards.  You have to...  Why moderate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's how I handle it on Twitter is you have to be a registered member to post on the comments  on the Twitter board.  Yeah, I don't like that.  I think she's a barrier.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's nice if people could just post.  Yeah, I think so too.  they want to just post comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I don't blame them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't want to give you my information.  I just use bug me not log in with somebody else's info and just say whatever I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I should have a blogger account too and occasionally I'll be on somebody's blog  and I want to say something and then they say I have to log in.  I hate that.  And there's a point where you say, is it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I still go in as an anonymous user if I'm posting comments anywhere just because I just  don't want to log in sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  I understand that.  And I wish we could do something else with Twitter, but we've had problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Slashdot at least gives you the anonymous coward tag if you want to post anonymously.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But anyway, this is a pretty cool fix and it really makes...  I mean, I'm stunned by the...  It just disappeared.  So he's published this somewhere?  Yeah, I'm going to put it up on my blog and put it in some forums probably tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's take some questions from the audience.  What do you say?  Should we do it?  All right.  Audience members, here's your chance.  They can actually hear us now.  Can you hear us?  Yes.  Good.  Has the show started?  Has the show started?  I got a PA system and they now can hear us a little bit.  So if you've got a question, step up to the red microphone or comment or suggestion or  if there's something you feel deeply about, anything we were talking about, please just  step up and say hello.  What's your name?  Jay.  Hi, Jay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi.  This is actually more of a comment question, but I saw on Dave yesterday they had a video  from 1998 of you talking about the open gaming machine.  Oh yeah, yeah.  Me and Kate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Somebody actually posted that.  What's your comment on that?  It was a Pentium II.  What was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you see it?  Yeah, it was like a...  You were saying it was great.  That was 128 megs.  You're never going to need more than 64 megs.  I didn't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did I?  Yeah.  Did you?  Oh, that's great.  You got to get me the link to that.  It was like $4,500.  It was hugely expensive.  Pentium II system.  Yeah, I remember that.  That's cool.  So that was on Dig?  That's awesome.  Well, you know what they did?  The Tech TV or G4, all that video is online if you just can kind of dig through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You always have to be careful about making these kinds of comments.  I don't think I said that.  I don't think you're ever going to need more than 100 terabytes of main memory.  That's safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't think I'm going to need...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You'll be dead before you need more than that.  Maybe not.  Maybe not.  Yeah.  If you follow the Ray Kurzweil longevity method, you might live forever.  Oh, I thought I had a question.  He's just going to the bathroom.  Any other questions?  Anybody want to...  Here we go.  A couple guys.  Step right up.  Fight it out.  He's got a great t-shirt.  Will work for bandwidth.  I like it.  Yeah.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Your Firefox t-shirt.  Let me get a shot of the bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was just wondering, are you guys going to have Marty or Megan on the show anytime soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I keep inviting Megan.  She's got twin boys.  And as soon as she can, she will.  Yeah, absolutely.  She said she would.  And Marty is in LA.  He's invited him.  He'll be coming up here soon.  Yeah, but he'd still love to be on.  Oh, more than welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If Amber can come all...  This is the number one podcast.  Why wouldn't Amber be on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If Amber and Jen came all the way from Toronto, he can come up from LA.  Exactly.  I think.  Yes, and absolutely.  We'd love to have him on.  In fact, really, the invitation's open to anybody who was ever on Tech TV.  If...  Anybody?  Anybody.  Even...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What are you coughing about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right, maybe not anybody.  There are a few exceptions.  Go ahead.  We'll work for bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's your name?  My name's Al.  Hey, Al.  And, you know, I always thought you were a little bit taller, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I am shorter in person right now.  My head is huge, isn't it?  Is there any way you guys can like push some of your feeds that you read?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, RSS feeds?  We could talk about them.  We could talk about them.  That's a good idea.  You guys have a lot of good information.  I can't find them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's what geeks do, I've noticed, is they'll share their RSS feeds.  Mike gave me his RSS feed, his OPML, and I gave him my OPML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get most of my stuff from other people.  I don't really do that.  I don't have any...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  People email you things?  Yeah, people are always emailing me stuff that's off-beat.  That's one thing is that when you're doing what we do, people are always sending you  email.  I mean, you never...  You know, you see all that stuff always.  Goodbye, your email.  What do you...  Do you read anything besides DIG?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No.  Actually, DIG has a lot of stuff.  DIG's a great resource.  You know, we just added...  I'll be the first to announce it here.  People don't know this, but we just added RSS to our search.  So now you can search for, say, Dvorak and say, show me just the articles that have X  number of DIGs under Dvorak that have been promoted, and you can subscribe to that feed,  and it creates that dynamic feed constantly.  That's pretty sweet.  That's a very good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That could be useful in a lot of different ways.  People are doing that more and more.  You know, DIG needs to be the...  Where did that mechanism come from?  From me.  Kevin invented that.  From scratch?  Yeah.  Have you thought about, you know, the thing...  Every time I see the way the mechanism works, because it's essentially a variation in terms  of the way it attracts people, the way Slashdot did, only it's a much more modern concept.  But I'm thinking to take the exact same structure and use it in other venues.  Oh, it's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, okay.  It's coming.  This guy's way ahead of us.  It's going to be licensable.  It's going to be subscribable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's going to be an upgrade version.  There's all kinds of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's going to be a member version.  He's got...

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Not right now.  Not right now.  There's some really exciting things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We at Revision3 and dig.com plan to make future shareholders a mess of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's Leo and Kate on the TV.  Oh, you actually pulled it up.  It's up on Google Video.  Running a little slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't have the greatest connection in here, especially with 18 of us all using  our Wi-Fi at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  All downloading off BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Everybody else is watching that video now.  You can stop.  Yeah, it's like, froze.  So, seriously, that's all you look at?  You must look at other stuff because you have to put stuff in the dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I like some of the really funky blogs out there.  There's one like We Make Money Not Art.  Have you seen that one?  I like that.  The dashes in between.  They're really cool.  It's a good name.  Just unique stories.  I like all this stuff from the Engadget folks and the Gizmodo folks.  Boing Boing is a fun site.  Boing Boing is the greatest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Boing Boing and Metafilter are must-reads as far as I'm concerned.  Yeah.  They're just wild stuff.  What do you read, Amber?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I tend to read WaxiLinks.  I don't know if anyone else reads that.  Waxi is great.  What's WaxiLinks?  It's basically a blog that this guy has put together and he puts four or five or six links  every day of interesting things that are happening online.  He deals a lot with Web 2.0 businesses.  So I tend to read that as well as...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, we're watching the video and you're so thin.  Oh, stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That was seven years ago.  I'm sorry, go back.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I read TechCrunch as well.  That's interesting.  Also, this other blog called ruk.ca was a friend of mine so he always posts interesting  stuff.  But I also use Ferl a lot, as you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I subscribed to...  Now, that's a good use of RSS.  I subscribe to Amber's Ferl RSS.  How do you spell R-S-I-S?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  W-A-X-Y.  You just have to...  I don't know what the URL is offhand, but...  We'll put it in the show notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was so lazy last week.  I didn't do any show notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Because I didn't write them up and send them to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because Patrick didn't send them.  Yeah.  He wasn't here.  I know.  That's why I didn't do any show notes.  That's not going to do them.  It's just not fair.  You know what I've been reading a lot is 43 Folders.  I think you told me about it.  Yeah, that's great.  It's kind of a getting things done.  This is the new geek thing.  Have you read this book?  Dave Allen's Getting Things Done book?  You don't need to do this because you're so organized and...  You're talking to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every geek...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  43folders.com?  43folders.com.  Is it four or three?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Four or three, yeah.  Every geek has this issue, I think, of organization.  And we're all kind of looking for systems because we're systems oriented.  And that's the whole thing.  This is a system.  And this blog, actually, is it a wiki or is it a...  It's devoted to life hacks.  It's like lifehacks.com.  Yeah, productivity pins.  I love lifehacker.com.  I love that too.  That's really fun.  I'm going to get me a Moleskine.  That's the key.  I have one.  That's the key.  Do you have one?  Yeah.  That's the geek.  You don't know about these?  No.  This is another geek fetish object.  Yeah, tell me.  They were supposedly...  This French company used to make them.  They stopped in the 60s.  They're oil skin notebooks.  Do you have your Moleskine?  Everybody buys them.  Here's these kind of...  I don't have mine with me, unfortunately.  So it's a little notebook.  Apparently, Van Gogh used one.  All these famous people have used them.  It has this little rubber band on it.  It's a little black book.  That's it.  It works.  I'm impressed.  Yeah, I rolled my eyes.  It is a geek fetish object.  All the geeks are starting to carry these things.  Is it very...  It's thin paper.  Yeah, it's pretty thin.  You can get it like graphed or straight-liner.  There's a lot of them.  There's a lot of them.  There's actually a group called Flickr where people are hacking their Moleskine notebooks.  By the way, it's Moleskine.  Moleskine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's an Italian company.  The French company went out of business in the 60s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was originally a French paper store.  Yeah, and they went out of...  The guy named...  I can't remember his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You probably can't even buy them there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'll wait for the time when you knock off.  Let's sell some twit...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Moleskine notebooks.  Moleskine is on the website.  Except we'll call them Moleskines.  And you can buy them at the pocket one.  We can get them in China for about 50 cents max.  They're underground, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got to keep them on the downhill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll keep them underground, too.  Oh yes.  Yeah, tell anybody.  Yeah, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's probably a little heavy.  I love them.  I love that they're called Moleskines.  The quality of the little things.  I can't even imagine a person buying those.  They're underground, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You got to keep them on the downhill.  Oh yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  A man who's started to dig back out, really, because you like keeping things on the downhill.  Frick that word was making something else, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get your terminology correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  More questions.  Come on, guys.  Step right up to the microphone.  Here we go.  Really?  Am I a lot thinner in that video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You look like a male model in that.  I know.  It's depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So, I'm going to go on a diet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, sir.  I don't have a cool t-shirt for you.  I left it at home.  That's okay.  I do have a question.  First, I've got a friend who's a little ticked off from me that I'm here today as opposed  to his birthday barbecue.  Oh, man.  That's cold.  Dude, that's wrong.  It's a four-hour drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You better hope you don't need to be bailed out.  You drove four hours to get here?  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, well, there you go.  It was all math.  Where are you from?  Modesto.  Oh, great.  Good.  So, I can just say happy birthday to Chronic.  It's a movie reference, not the drugs.  No worries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think we're all going to Chronic for the next Twitcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The question was, what do you think is the best way to, if somebody's having a conversation  over Skype, to record that and then convert it over to an MP3?  Oh, I just saw a new app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's something called Hot.  Hot Recorder.  Hot Recorder.  It's good.  It's one of the most popular.  The problem with it is that Skype, you only get one half of it, right?  You get your side or you get the person's side, but to get both voices is tricky.  So there are little hacks.  There's a Windows side hack and there's a Mac side hack.  I think they use Hot Recorder on the Mac to do it, and it gets both sides of the conversation.  The way we always did it was with a mixer, because I always had radio hardware, and it's  much easier with a mixer, because then you're just recording your voice straight into the  mixer, then feeding that into Skype, and then I'll record the output of the computer.  But I'm poor.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  That's the expensive way to do it.  Yeah, there's definitely software ways.  I'll tell you what, I'll put in the show notes, I'll put links to Hot Recorder, and I'll find  the Windows technique.  There's a way to do it, though.  Are you doing a podcast or you just want to record your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're looking into it.  Oh, good.  Just a little something for ourselves and our family.  You in Chronic?  Huh?  You in Chronic?  No.  Chronic-ation now.  Yeah, Chronic's never gonna...  It'll be very self-indulgent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Is that common with most VOIPO apps, though?  Yeah, it is.  It's a problem, yeah.  You can record yourself or the other person, but not both.  Both get both sides, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What is that you're looking at, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This is the one that I saw floating around that records all of your Skype conversations.  It's supposed to be the easiest way to do it.  What's the name of that one?  PowerGrammo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's pronounced Moleskine.  Moleskine.  It's spelled...  Yeah, it's thinking the same gag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's funny.  It's spelled...

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'll give you the URL for the show notes.  I'll paste it over to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm so glad you're here, Patrick.  I don't know what I would do without you.  Patrick's the man.  All right, yeah, go ahead, ask another question.  There's only four people in the audience anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't want to monopolize this.  No, no, that's fine.  Okay.  This is more something that I'm geeking out over, and I don't know if you all have talked  about it much, but what do you see about online schools that are working with professionals?  The one I'm actually in now is animationmentor.com.  That's neat.  But it's where you just do webcams with people who work in the business, from Pixar or whatever.  I know there's others out there.  I just haven't checked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Alex, you should come over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Is this a mentoring program, or is it an organized six weeks to a full better rendering you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's an actual certified school, California certified, based in Berkeley, but it's all  webcam and ...  What's the name of the school?  Animationmentor.com.  It was created by people from Pixar, and you work with ILM.  What do you think of it so far?  I love it.  I was going to a traditional school, and I graduated from one, and I wanted to go to  one of these art schools here in the city.  They're too expensive.  This one is a quarter of the price for half the time.  You're talking to people who are actually in there, and they know you by name, first  name basis.  Shout out to Charles Allnick right now, if he's listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Might be a good way to get a job, too, down the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When you're done with it, you're going to know six people in the business.  The guy I'm with, he did the Yoda fights and all the Star Wars.  I'm sure there's a lot of good people there.  I know there are.  You actually get your foot in the door because you're working people in the business.  I know this is not the only one.  If there's others out there, let's have them come out.  Maybe somebody can email us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the name of this one again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's animationmentor.com.  Alex is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Alex probably knows a little bit about this.  He worked at LucasArts.  In fact, did Star Wars Animation, too.  Do you know about this animation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Animationmentor is fantastic.  It's a little different than what we do.  When you say we, you mean Pixelcore.  The Pixelcore, because we're really a guild.  We do a lot of training like a school would, but only because we have to, to get people  up to speed.  The big thing is about 70% of our members are actually people working in the business.  30% are really full-time students.  The price is much different.  Animationmentor is really inexpensive.  I think it's like $13,000, $14,000 for the whole thing.  Instead of $30,000 or $40,000, the Pixelcore is $400 a year.  It's not a training course.  It doesn't do what we don't do right now currently is that hands-on, you meet one-on-one meetings  with instructors and stuff that Animationmentor does.  You think that's a good program?  I think it's a fantastic program.  I think it sold out in six weeks.  What a good idea.  It's really well done.  I think a lot of the schools are trying to figure it out.  The Academy of Art, Art Institute, they all have their own online versions of what they  do, but they're a lot more expensive and they don't really have the mix that Animationmentor

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  does.  Leo, I think maybe podcastmentor.com.  We could do it.  Yeah.  We're the top podcast apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What did you just get, Kevin?  That looks good.  I don't know.  It's awesome.  Is that the Dipsea Barley Wine?  It's like a raspberry.  It looks like some raspberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How did you get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Somebody just brought it to you?  Yeah, somebody just randomly showed up.  It's poisoned.  Have a try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Try it.  Try it.  Try it.  Try it.  Try it.  Try it.  If he explodes in a bloody mess, it affects everyone around me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It affects all of us.  It's like a raspberry.  It's cassis.  It's a ...  It actually might be cassis of some sort.  That's what it is.  Oh, it says framboise on the side.  Framboise.  It's a glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's got cassis too.  That sounds delicious.  We've got to get the Dipsea Barley Wine.  They're famous for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah?  Well, that killed the conversation.  Barley Wine.  You could try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I sure could.  You could be the Barley Wine guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's get another talker up here.  Another talker, please.  All right.  This is this topic that keeps coming up when I say that the Mac's going to be bigger than

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ever because they're going to the x86 and I just have to wait for time to prove it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you're going to be right.  I think you're going to be right.  I think you're going to be right.  I think you're going to be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was very negative about it.  You were very bullish.  You're going to be suicidal.  I was suicidal.  Oh my god.  It's all over in the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We're going to end it.  I've got to buy some more computers so they get more expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The problem is, I think there's still a reluctance to, you know, because they have a lot of bad  experiences over time and there's a reluctance to take the full advantage of what's happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in the world.  They have a lot of bad experiences over time and there's a reluctance to take the full  dip so they're not going to like go charging into this market.  They're going to do it, you know, like going to the waiting side of the pool and kind of  work their way over.  So it's going to be a while.  But I'd say three years from now they're going to market shares going to start.  That's when it's going to begin to double.  So it'll go from-  Double?  Yeah, five to ten and then twenty and probably they'll be a dominant player.  Twenty's pretty good.  I can see them going to higher than that.  Really?  With operating systems I think they can actually dominate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If they were just selling hard software.  No with both.  In addition.  Yeah, in addition to.  Well, I think I agree.  I mean-

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There will be no Apple computer in twenty years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's the other side of this.  Now finally, thanks to Amber, we finally, you know, usually we have all these ThinkPads  out and Amber's finally brought a Mac to the table, which is good.  Thank you for doing that.  I hope it's okay with everyone.  Yeah, I know.  Oh no.  We were at the Apple store.  We had a lineup of IBM.  There were no Macs in evidence at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although everybody sitting in the front row was all Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac.  With cameras and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You can humble a Windows user really quick sitting him down in front of an Apple system  and just try to figure it out real quick.  Is it that hard?  It is.  For me it's so unintuitive.  Really?  What, the Apple?  Yeah.  No.  You're kidding.  If you've never seen a computer before, it's not bad.  It's easy to fall into it.  What, you keep going to the bottom of the screen trying to click the start button?  Finally, what are you doing wrong?  We've got a left basic.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I wish everyone could see your face right now, Leo, because you're like, these people are  idiots.  I'm stunned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  How can they not understand?  I grew up learning to program on Apple computers.  Look up the befuddlement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm befuddled.  A one click mouse will stop and it's more easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I tell Windows people, the first thing to do is get rid of the one button mouse and  get a two button mouse.  But then it's exactly like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, I expect the two button mouse to be very slowly adopted by Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh yeah, this stupid Mighty Mouse.  I'm so sorry I bought a Mighty Mouse.  What a junky mouse.  It's a collector's item.  Don't use it.  I'm going to autograph it and give it away in the box of crap.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's not just a mouse, it's a design statement and the evolution of interface devices.  It's stupid.  Yes it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got one more can of spam to give away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did you give away the other can to the Australian guy?  Yeah, he could...  You're going to have to declare that to the Australian customers.  I don't think they're letting you bring it in.  They're going to say no way.  Yeah, they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No way.  No can to eat in Australia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They steal it and then eat it for lunch.  That happened to me once coming from France.  You travel a lot with spam, John?  You can't bring in meat.  You can't bring in meat in Europe is bad, he says.  I had a salami, a beautiful one.  Oh, so he had a salami.  He took the thing, it was right around 11.45.  FedEx everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You're in a foreign country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You should have just sat there and ate the damn thing before going through FedEx and  eating yourself.  Nobody's eating whole salami in front of somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Isn't that a Lucille Ball episode?  Probably.  I think so.  I may be wrong.  I may have fantasized that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, I'll give you the last can you wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Come here.  Take the last can.  This isn't just spam.  It's crazy tasty spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's a macaroni, cheese and spam recipe on the back too.  Yeah, it's delicious.
