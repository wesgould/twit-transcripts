But now it's like the thing where, oh, you can't.  I was like, some people's stereotypes just works.  Like when a black comedian comes on and makes a joke about black people loving chicken,  it's because black people love chicken.  And yes, everybody loves chicken.  Everybody loves chicken.  When he says that, like, as far as speaking in the culture of another language, like you  hear that voice, you know what it is, you know what it's about.  But as long as you're not using it in a negative, evil tone, it shouldn't be that big of a deal.  Like when you have the old Asian things, they have slanted eyes and, you know, some people  take offense to it.  Some people know it's a joke, but it depends on the context and the use of it and how you  try to do it.  Like, where's comedy going anymore?  Like, it's like they try to destroy everything because you got to be so PC.  I mean, I don't go Donald Trump crazy, but I mean, like if it's playful and it's funny,  if it's funny, it's funny.  Like I heard that and I literally thought like, oh, he's about to cut that off.  Yeah, because I'm here because somebody else, like if I wasn't here and it was a path, oh,  yeah, white man.

We don't we we take on idiotical things, but we never make fun of religion or or color  or although, you know, man has really changed over the years.  Very funny because a professor or someone writing a thesis on comedy said, you know,  I looked at some very early mads and they did a lot of mad gay stereotypes.  Oh, interesting.  And he gave me an issue number and I went back and looked it up and I had written it.  It was your kid.  Every kind of camp that kids could go to.  And one was camp drag.  Oh, how funny.  And it was, you know, like eight stereotype things kids could do there.  And I was talking to John for Kara and I was and he said, you know, I told him about the article.  And he said, well, you know what?  Sometimes we reprint things, but we put a banner at the top of the reprint saying society has changed.  Mad has changed.  But this is something that we thought was doable 40 years ago.  Right.  So so that, you know, it's like turn to classic movies.  They'll be a terrible black person stereotype.  They don't edit it out.  But you you sort of look at it and go, well, that was terrible back then.  Well, yes, it doesn't age well at all.  It doesn't age well at all.

But I'm like, back then, again, like I'm like, if you're watching it and the kids are enjoying it, just watch it and then explain to them about stuff.  But, you know, it's almost just as bad as if you turn it off and don't let them know that it's not OK.  It was. That's how it was.

And Frank Jacobs said, could he paid off at five dollars a week?  Irving Berlin didn't think that was funny.  So it did go to court and the judge said, Mr. Berlin, they are not printing your music.  And in fact, you should be flattered that people know your music well enough that they can sing this parody to the tune.  But Mad owes you nothing.  So there you go.  That was like that was like one of the landmark cases of fair use.  I believe I bet it was.  Yeah.

So I'm just telling you now so you can start looking for work, but you have two months of shows.  So it's just a heads up.  And then over the weekend, I was thinking, God, you know what?  Something could be done with this show.  So on Monday, I went and I said, Mark, I have an idea.  I said, you know, I work for MAD.  He goes, I know.  I said, so why are we doing these straight questions when we could be doing things like Mary liked to pour gravy on John's blank?  And that was the very first match game question ever.  Was it really?  Yes.  And Goodson laughed and he said, well, that's funny.  But what are people going to say?  I can say, Mark, they're going to laugh and then they're going to say meatloaf mashed potatoes.  Right.  And he said, well, it's can it's canceled.  They can cancel it twice.  Do it.

Transcript:  Dones.  Ladies and gentlemen, our show today brought to you by, I love this microphone.  This is awesome.  Our show today, and it's now very firm and upright.  Our show today, we're playing, we were playing a game before the show began where I would ask our esteemed panel.  And Dick, you have to rule yourself out because you've been doing shows here a long time.  Probably owe Dr. To, but Paul and Storm maybe don't know what Fresh Books is.  It's actually a lifesaver for probably a lot of the panelists here.  Anybody who works as a freelancer and has to bill a client to get paid.  And you know that's the worst part, isn't it?  The worst part of being a freelancer is rummaging through receipts, trying to keep track of your expenses.  And then at the end of the month, God, creating and formatting and sending invoices.  Do you hate that?  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  And then, oh, worse than that, the client who doesn't pay you.  Like, and now what do you do?  Oh, this is too close to home.  When is our check coming, Leo?  Yeah, well, no, you guys forget it.  If you use Fresh, you know what?  Clients love Fresh Books as much as you do.  First of all, Fresh Books makes it really easy to invoice with professional looking invoices.  They go out, you can mail them, but they also go out by email.  And that's actually great because there's a pay me button right in there.  And clients love it because, you know, the truth is, and I've learned this about clients,  they hate paying you as much as you hate invoicing them.  It's just more paperwork.  They want to do their business.  You want to do your business.  So make it easy.  They press the pay you button and you get paid faster.  In fact, now you can even get paid up front.  You can request a deposit in Fresh Books so you don't have to cover costs out of pocket  or wait to the end of a project to get your loot, your moolah.  It lets you organize the expenses easily.  They have an app so you can actually take a picture of receipts  and then put it right into the invoice.  If you do time and hours, which none of you guys do because obviously, you know, you don't.

Transcript:  Pretty much that's, I was going to say that, but I backed down.  Maybe not.  You can track your time if you have the app.  And that's nice because it goes right in the invoice.  And here's the best part, automated late payment reminders.  So they're the heavy, not you.  You can avoid those awkward emails and you get paid faster.  With Fresh Books automated customer...  That's the best.  I know.  You guys should be using this.  They also...  If you're in a business where you get reviews, you can do this.  They have this new thing, this customer reviews report.  So you can collate your reviews.  You can see them.  You can post them on your website.  And they have now, they're using, they have a card reader.  So you can accept credit cards.  Swipe it right through there on your iPhone in less than a minute.  It's EMV.  That means it works with chip cards as well as swipe cards.  It's the new standard.  It works right out of the box.  So this is awesome.  You open your invoice in the Fresh Books app.  You plug in the reader.  You say, this is the bill.  They swipe or dip the chip or swipe the stripe.  That's the new, that's how the kids talk today.  Dip the chip or swipe the stripe.  Oh, kids are always swiping the stripe.  They're swiping the stripe, man.  And you get paid.  Fresh Books, they continually innovate.  They're really good.  They're Canadian too, which makes you...

We got to see the planet Pluto.  Even if the planet Earth doesn't have love, the planet Pluto has a big heart on it.  Yeah.  It's, I think, in some way...

And this is somebody who's a very angry man.  He's a very angry rapper.  But even he can see the joy in life when it comes to the holiday season.

Transcript:  No, they knew how to play the game.  I think the thing I liked about Match Game was it was very spontaneous,  and also it was a show where you could make fun of everything.  My favorite Match Game moment ever is Brett Summers,  who we had a contestant on who never matched anybody.  And after her fourth terrible answer, Brett turned to Gene and said,  Gene, stop a minute.  Are there no qualifications to get on this show?  Ten minutes before air?  Do you just open the door to the studio and say you, you and you,  you're on a game show?  Because that's the worst contestant I've ever seen.  So who was the biggest slut on the Match Game?

Transcript:  This is probably not going to be interesting to anybody under the age of 40,  and I don't care.  But growing up watching that, in the bonus round or whatever it was called,  I remember it became very obvious for a very long time that Richard Dawson was  always the guy to go to.  And then there was a season where they introduced the wheel.

Start time: 5248.09
End time: 5251.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  Oh, that's why, right?  Because Dawson would always win.  And then shortly...

Start time: 5253.19
End time: 5260.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was that introduced because there was resentment on the part of the other cast  members that they always went to Richard Dawson, or was it just let's mix things  up a little bit?

Start time: 5261.10
End time: 5358.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, it was because the producers felt that the other celebrities felt left out.  It was also the reason that shortly after, you'll notice, Richard Dawson left the panel.  Oh, really?  Richard Dawson was furious.  We're getting some deep dirt now.  We're getting dirt.  Yeah, exactly.  Ira Scutch, who was producing it back then, told me...  I was in New York.  Goodson said, you know, I'm moving the show to California.  You want to go to California?  I said, Mark, I'm a New Yorker.  He said, you can write it anywhere in the world.  And he said, I'm keeping offices on Park Avenue anyway, so stay here.  So I sent my stuff out.  But I would meet with Ira Scutch every couple of months, either fly out or he'd fly in.  And he said, Richard Dawson started like being so quiet on the set.  And he said, he told me that he was personally offended...  What?  ...that they brought the wheel in and that celebrity, that contestants couldn't pick on him all the time.  And Ira said, Richard, we can arrange if you'd like to be off the show.  And, you know, Richard had gone on to do Family Feud, so he didn't need Match Game.  And Richard Dawson said, yeah, I'd like to be off the show.  And so the wheel ended Richard being on the show.  But the funny thing was that the day they put the wheel up, it landed on Richard Dawson the very first day, the very first time they spun it.  But that did change things for Richard on the show.

Ah, that's me.  Storm.  I'm totally out.  I've been trying.  No, no spoilers.  Just a question.  How many of you in the audience and at home and in the show, how many of you have seen the new Star Wars?  I have.  I have not.  Owen's seen it, Paul's seen it, and Dick and Storm have not.  So the top part has seen it, the bottom part has not.  All right.  There's nothing to say except that it made a lot of money in opening weekend.  We're taping this ahead of time so we don't know how well it's done by now, but probably the largest opening of all time.  And then I was watching Twitter and I just saw that the Steve Jobs movie total, total made $17.5 million.  Oh, Steve Jobs.

Transcript:  Yeah.  They sold $100 million in pre-sale tickets.  And the Steve Jobs, in fact, Apple made more money in the running time of Steve Jobs, $54 million than the movie made by a long shot in its total history.  So I don't know if there's something there, but there's a moral there somewhere.  I think Star Wars deserves to do well.  You know, there's a moment, and Storm, I'm not giving you any spoilers at all.  But when you are at the beginning of the movie and you see Lucasfilm, it's just a great moment, isn't it?  In the theater, oh, Doctor and Paul, isn't it a great moment where you just go, yes, we're back, we're back, baby?

The question is if you want the really big image, if you have to see it in 3D,  will you go to see it on a smaller screen in 2D or will you suck up the 3D and see it on the big screen?

Transcript:  Alright. We're going to take a break.  When we come back, it's the day after Christmas.  This is they call it Boxing Day.  That's because it's not anything to do with, you know, pugilism.  It is because in old England, this is a terrible tradition,  but the Lord of the Manor would box up the leftovers from the Christmas feast  and bring it to the tenants in the town as a gift.  That's why they call it Boxing Day.  I think a more modern interpretation is this is the day you bring back the gifts you got.  You put them back in the box and say, I want a different one.  I'm going to ask you guys, even though you don't know what you got,  what you got that you didn't want or what you do want that you didn't get  for Christmas when we come back.  Alright?  A little bit of a break.  This is a chance to think.  Wait a minute.  There's no more ads.  The clipboard is empty.  Uh-oh.  Oh, that's terrible.  That should never happen.

Here, have another one of these.  These are really good.  By the way, I just want to say this is excellent.  This is a local eggnog by the Organic Strauss Family Creamery.  That's excellent.  Is it Moonshine Eggnog?  It is.  It is now.  It's called American-Born Moonshine Dixie and it's Sweet Tea Moonshine, 83 proof.  Whoa.  It blew my mind.  You stashed right off.  And it's actually incredibly good and it goes down very smoothly.  That is not the commercial.  I just want to say it's a recommendation.  Our commercial is by audible.com.  We love Audible.  They've been a member of the family for years.  In fact, I first started listening to Audible Books in the year 2000.  I was listening to books on tape.  You know, you get the box of tape for a month.  It's on cassettes and you put a cassette in.  It saved my life because I had a long commute down to Tech TV, like two hours each way.  I loved that.  But when Audible came along, and this was before the iPod or the iPhone, so I had to listen.  Audible made a little thing called the Otis.  It was like the first early MP3 player and then my Diamond Rio.  Now, of course, you can listen to Audible on anything, on any smartphone, any tablet.  They have Windows apps.  They have apps for every platform.  And by the way, that Mindy Kaling is an awesome book.  Why not me?  Fantastic.  Here's the deal.  We're going to get you two free books.  So this is the challenge is which two books.  I have just started listening to a wonderful book that I can't remember.  Oh, that's a good one.  Angela's Ashes was one of the first books I ever listened to by Frank McCord.  He narrates it.  Oh, my God.  That's an amazing book.  I didn't even know.  I forgot about that.  I probably listened to that 10 years ago.  Incredible.  And Frank McCord has a beautiful story about a childhood in Ireland.  And it's just wonderful.

And on Christmas Day, my daughter is getting no presents from me this year.  Why not?  Are you going to do?  Because Uncle Leo.  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  So first of all, when I grew up, there was a time period where I had everything, like  all the toys in the world.  Then there was a time period where we were really poor and I didn't have anything.  And there were three Christmases like that where all I got was clothes from other family  members.  I didn't have anything.  And I never got upset with my dad.  I knew the situation we were in.  I dealt with it.  I always loved him.  He did his best.  Now, my daughter lives in a world where I'm separated from her mother.  She's talking to her friends.  She has Christmas at her grandmother's, Christmas at another grandmother's, Christmas with her  mom, then Christmas with me.  She has a playroom at my house, a bedroom at my house, a playroom at her mother's house,  and a bedroom.  Like she has so much stuff, Leo.  When I asked her what she wants for Christmas, she said, I already have everything.  And blessed be me that my child is not a greedy, evil child to just want more and more.  But I said, wow.  She's like, I don't need anything.  And I'm getting so much stuff anyway.  And I'm like, you know what?  I bought her presents, mind you.  But on Christmas Day, we're not having no presents.  We're going to the movie.  We're going to go see our family and friends and hang out all day.  And as long as she don't complain, I'll buy her something extra on top of that because  the next day I'm going to give her all her presents.  But for Pete's sake, sometimes you got to, when she gets older, she's going to know we ain't broke.  So I got to hit her up now to make her realize it's not about presents.  It's not about the presents.  Like her little friend was like, oh, your dad's a Grinch because he doesn't have Santa Claus come over.  And she's like, Santa Claus comes everywhere.  And Leah's like, well, Santa doesn't come to my dad's house.  He comes to my mom's, my grandmoms.  And she's like, why?  And she's like, because my dad buys the presents at his house, not Santa.  And I'm like, I'm not giving her credit to no jolly fat man.  Oh, no.  You're the mean one.  Ain't no leaving cookies out for somebody else.

He's like, well, if they didn't tell you, then how do you know?  And so he gets really frustrated.  He looks at his mom and he's like, Mom, tell her.  And she's like, well, Leah, it's just the thing that we're saying.  He loves everybody.  She's like, well, I understand that.  I've just never seen him.  So if you've never seen him, how do you know?  And the little boy gets really upset.  And the mom's like, look, she's allowed to believe in something different.  It's totally OK.  But the mom was really frustrated with Leah's take on the whole thing.  So after 30 seconds, she turns to Leah.  She says, so Leah, do you believe in Santa Claus?  And Leah says, of course I do.  I see him at the mall every year.
