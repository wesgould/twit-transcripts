Some great people joining us today to talk about the week's tech stories in a informal and happy-go-lucky fashion.  Starting with the happy-go-lucky Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle.  Hello.  Hey Dwight, is it cron.com slash blog? Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's blogs.cron.com slash techblog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to change your lower third right now.  And I just want to let you know that all of the stories we're doing today I stole from Dwight.  Yay, steal away.  He has a link list.  Well, I'd like to include stories that the panelists have already been thinking about and writing about.  So I also stole stories from Veronica Belmont of Tekzilla.  Hi Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not true.  You didn't steal any stories from me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys do tech news every day now though, don't you?  We do our daily tip show. It's not tech news.  You don't cover tech news? Yeah, you do a little bit, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the weekly show usually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then also with us, Harry McCracken of the Technologizer blog. Hi Harry.  Hey Leo, how are you?  Great. Great to have you back.  Nice to be here.  I was watching, I was on I think the History Channel the other day watching a history of computing in the 80s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They must show that a hundred times a week because I did that five years ago and everywhere I go people see that.  It's a good thing too.  Oddly enough I've never seen that but it's the most played thing I ever did by far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really funny.  They're talking about Atari and stuff.  And actually I thought there was something I got out of it, frankly, which they were talking about how Atari, the failure of Atari in the 2600 because it was an open platform.  Atari did what we would today think was the right thing, which was to allow anybody to develop software for the Atari platform.  And of course a lot of crap games were developed and it killed the 2600.  And I thought, well that kind of applies a little bit to today to the iPhone.  I mean, that's what Apple does with the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's actually Atari 2600 and iPhone is a pretty interesting comparison in a lot of ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's odd to compare the two but Apple has an absolutely closed environment.  And they're doing it for the same reason that Atari didn't do it.  The same reason that Nintendo looking at Atari said, oh, we really can't let that happen.  We better license everything.  And as a result, you know, Apple has full control, but they get a lot of heat from people who say it's not an open platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Certainly none of today's gaming consoles are anywhere near as open as the early ones were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they learned their lesson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They all want to make money selling the games even if they lose money on the consoles.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, some of the games that started on the Atari 2600 are now starting to show up on the iPhone.  You see a lot of these classic games.  What goes around comes around.  I love that. I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to see more ColecoVision games on the iPhone personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The atom.  You know what they just released?  If you're an old Mac person, you'll recognize that Myst is available for the iPhone.  This shows you how powerful the iPhone platform is.  The full game.  100 something megabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a huge download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you get it already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't get it yet, but I saw the story today actually when I was going through the delicious links.  I said, oh my gosh, I got to get that.  That's so fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's so cool.  You must have been pretty little when Myst came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. What year was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  1995 or so, I think.  Mid 90s.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like 13.  It wasn't that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was actually the perfect game for a 13 year old.  You know, that was exactly right for a 13 year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was the golden age of games on CD-ROM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  Yeah. Which lasted about a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and you know, as a corollary to that, this is the week that Encarta died.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that made me sad actually, because I use that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think my kids grew up going through elementary school using Encarta on a CD-ROM as a way to study.  And so when it went away, it was kind of like sad for all of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it was a great program.  And if you were to do a list of the top 10 best things Microsoft ever did, I think Encarta  would be on that, because for the mid 90s, it was really well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used it all the time for schoolwork.  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're making us feel old now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I reviewed it back then.  I've got that perspective, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use it for schoolwork.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't they start with like Funkin' Wagnalls?  They started with like the worst encyclopedia, the one that they gave away in the grocery store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the only one they could license.  They licensed everything.  The janitor turned them down and World Book turned them down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They licensed that and Compton's and a bunch of others, and they added onto it.  They had a great user interface, though.  The multimedia aspect was great.  Even Wikipedia Today does not really do multimedia in the way that Encarta did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I remember using it a lot like Wikipedia, the way I use Wikipedia now, which was going  to an article and then continuing to browse through related articles and just spending  hours and hours just learning about totally random stuff because it was, you know, relevant  to my interests or just something that was cool to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At the time it came out, there was Encyclopedia Britannica on CD-ROM, but it cost $1,000.  It had no artwork of any type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a smart move on their part.  Where are they now?  I guess they're where Encarta is.  Actually, it didn't really matter.  Nobody needs the encyclopedia.  I have a World Book encyclopedia right here, a printed World Book encyclopedia that I got  because I thought the kids would use it.  No, they never used it.  They use Wikipedia.  What happened?  You know, the whole CD-ROM thing was a big flop.  Well, not at the time.  At the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know, was it?  Dwight, I mean.  Yeah.  It particularly was for kids.  Obviously, a lot of games came on.  A lot of the early games, shooters and popular PC games would not run unless the disc was  in.  I guess that counts as a CD-ROM.  Particularly for kids, a lot of educational software and so forth came on CD-ROMs.  That's what I'm thinking of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm thinking of, oh, I remember there were tours of museums.  There were games like Myst.  There was Encarta.  I mean, some of those, I remember reading later that some of those titles sold dozens  of copies.  I mean, they put millions of dollars into production and they just, nobody would buy  them.  The internet completely superseded it and it happened within a few.  I mean, look, it was 95.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the CD-ROM thing started about 1993 maybe.  By 95, the web was taking off.  And so 680 megabytes or whatever a CD-ROM held went from being a huge amount of data  to being nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember going to Staples.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Say again?  The web was generally free and CD-ROMs cost money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  What were you saying, Veronica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was saying, I used to go to Staples and they would have these bargain bins just full  of CD-ROM educational titles and games and you could pick up a whole armload worth of,  for like, you know, 50 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But education, the educational market just died.  I mean, that I feel sort of sad about.  My kids did the Broderbund Living Books.  Remember those?  Did your kids do those, Dwight, the Living Books series?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they loved it.  They were great.  And they're gone.  It was one generation got those and now they're gone.  And I don't know why that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be a perfect addition for the iPhone.  If whoever holds the rights is listening, hey, those make a great iPhone app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty funny that you could get all of Myst now on my phone.  And the graphics are good.  Yeah, I mean, it looks pretty much, you know, it looks just the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you download it already?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you get it?  No, I have.  I was going to wait until after the show.  I don't want to kill my bandwidth.  It's like a hundred, what is it?  143 megabytes, something like that.  How much does it cost?  It's not expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what, the original one was like $39.95 or something on CD-ROM?  Remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think, I just think that's a, that's kind of a neat story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Dvorak is not on and here we are already going down memory lane.  Yeah, yeah.  What's wrong with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't got the old guy on and we're still doing it.  All right, let's talk about the present.  Disney buys into, this was a very interesting story.  30% some say of Hulu and Disney's put all of the ABC shows on there, lost.  I mean, just a ton of shows on there.  Just, I mean, this is a huge victory for Hulu.  This is a real, this is a real proof that Hulu's the future of television.  Don't you think?  Dwight, why did ABC see this as something they wanted to be part of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, this, I think it was probably in the works before this, but this was also  about the same time that there was a report that Hulu had a huge increase in traffic.  And I know that almost everybody I know has at least sampled Hulu.  I hear from a lot of readers who started asking about Boxee, even though they don't have a Mac or Linux.  Boxee being the interface that can sit on top of the Mac or Linux or Apple TV and make  it easier to look at Internet video.  And Hulu keeps trying to block them and they keep coming through.  Yeah, Boxee, yeah, yeah.  I think there's just a lot more buzz and people are kind of getting the idea of doing it over the web.  And, you know, the commercial, it has commercials just like regular television, but they're  not as intrusive and they're not as long.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you watch, are you a Hulu watcher, Veronica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I use Hulu all the time.  I was really bummed out by the whole situation with Boxee in particular because, you know,  when I miss shows on TV, I like to watch them on Hulu, but I also like to still do it in  the comfort of my own living room.  I mean, my computer's great and all, but it's a lot better to be able to sit on the couch  and control it that way.  So this makes me even a little more angry because now it's got all the ABC content on there  and NBC rather.  Is it ABC or NBC that just signed up?  I forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ABC, ABC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm a big Lost fan and I've wanted to watch it on Hulu for a long time.  Yeah.  So it's kind of a disappointment for me, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use Hulu primarily when I travel, you know, when you're in a hotel room and you just don't  want to, you know, you just kind of want to chill out for the evening.  Hulu is how I watch television.  I don't even turn on the television in the hotel room anymore.  I just fire it up and catch up on stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Hulu.  I watch people like Veronica and Colleen Younger, people in their 20s.  And you know, I think a lot of times, I think the reason Hulu got pulled off of Boxxy is  because some of the content creators somehow thought that displaying it on a screen, on  a computer screen was different than displaying it on a TV and they didn't want to display  it on the TV, right, for some crazy reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they definitely complained directly to Boxxy about that and they tried to come  up with some kind of work around.  Boxxy worked very, very hard with them in order to keep that content on there.  But at the end of the day, they wanted to pull it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The downloads of our shows are on Boxxy, odtv.me.  I bet Tekzilla's on Boxxy, right?  Yep.  It's stupid of somebody like NBC to say, or Fox say, we don't want to be on Boxxy because  if you're not on Boxxy, others will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a huge problem for broadcast TV because Hulu on Boxxy is so good.  It's such a good experience.  But you know, they're not making millions of dollars on ads on Hulu.  If you look at the ads on Hulu, a lot of the time they're public service messages and I  think they're all afraid of the notion that they might be giving up those expensive Super  Bowl type ad campaigns for whatever they can get for Hulu.  I think it's really regrettable that they're being obnoxious and screwing up Boxxy, but  I also on some level sort of understand why they're terrified of it catching on.  This is I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But don't you think it's short-sighted?  I mean...  Yes, it's very short-sighted.  Oh, it's very short-sighted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because eventually all TV will be that basic metaphor.  It'll all come over the internet and it's going to happen fairly soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think people like Veronica and Colleen, the younger people, a screen is a screen is  a screen.  It doesn't make a distinction between it being on your screen in your living room, Veronica,  and your computer, or does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, like I said, it is nice to be able to watch it in my living room.  You like to sit at the couch.  At the end of the day, I'm going to go where the content is.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's very good for people like you, for independent content creators.  If the big...  See, the big guys have...  And this has always been the case.  When you have an existing business, whether you're the record industry, the television  business, the movie industry, and you don't want to cannibalize it, so you stay away or  the New York Times, so you stay away from these new distribution media because you go,  Oh, gosh, it's going to cannibalize our TV viewing.  That is an opening for everybody who doesn't have all that existing relationships.  We don't have all the baggage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  The other thing is that Harry mentioned that they don't have a lot of ads on there, but  when they do have ads on Hulu, you don't have the choice to not watch them.  When they play, you can't fast forward them.  That's interesting.  You can mute them.  That's about as much control as you have.  If I was an advertiser looking at the way people deal with ads, say, on a DVR now, where  they can fast forward through them and skip them and certainly mute them, I would look  at Hulu as more of an opportunity.  Probably more people are actually sitting and watching the ads rather than, say, on  a DVR.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a really great comment because it's true.  I've sat through tons of commercials on Hulu and not even thought twice about it, but if  I'm on my TV watching it over TiVo, I fast forward through those suckers as fast as my  thumb can hit the button.  It's a captive audience when you've got them on Hulu there.  They don't really have a way of not watching it unless they switch tabs, I guess, in their  browser and mute it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does seem like Hulu is hard as in the right place and that it's the content owners who  are preventing them from doing things like boxing.  My sense is that if Hulu controlled that stuff, they'd be moving a lot more aggressively.  Hulu is owned by old Hollywood, but they really do a great job.  The interface is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did a deal with the devil and now the devil wants his due.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  They have to get those guys to understand and sooner or later they will, but I hope  it's sooner rather than later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm also curious as to the number of people who watch boxy on a computer, use boxy on  a computer versus on something like Apple TV.  If you're doing it that way, it just presents it in a really nice wide screen version.  I use it on my 24-inch iMac.  In that case, it's just the same as watching it on Hulu.  I don't know how many people are actually using it, say, through Apple TV or some other  hack where they're getting it on their big screen TV, which is what they're afraid of.  I'd love to see some numbers as to how people are actually using boxy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're dumb to be afraid.  I think the ABC deal proves it because ABC has its own website.  You could watch those shows on the ABC website, but they saw the value of being on Hulu and  some of the value of Hulu is not just that it's another website.  I think it has to be that it offers more opportunities.  I bet you ABC, with a third of that company, pushes them back towards things like boxy.  They must.  Otherwise, what have they gained by going to Hulu?  Except I guess there's more eyeballs, but they put the stuff on ABC.  Why would you buy Hulu if you've already got a website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Disney historically has been fairly progressive in terms of adopting new technologies and  being open minded.  And Robert Iger seems to be fairly smart about this stuff.  So I would hope he would push them in the right direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's still a connection between ABC and Apple, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's actually the interesting thing.  Yeah.  I mean, Steve Jobs is on the board of both.  Pixar is owned by Disney.  But Businessweek supposes that it actually hurts Apple because Apple, it doesn't create  content, distribute it for free online.  Hulu is going right up against Apple's model.  Hulu is saying, yeah, not only do we own the content, we're going to offer it to you for  free.  Yeah, you could buy it on the iTunes store, but wouldn't you want to get it for free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The advantage that Apple has in this scenario is that it's very easy for you to download  an episode of Lost, even though you are paying for it without commercials though, and put  it on your iPhone or iPod touch and taking it with you on the go.  So which do you prefer?  It just depends on how you want to consume the content.  I mean, I, at the end of the day, I travel enough that it makes sense for me to want  to have it on my iPhone there so I can take it with me.  But when I'm home, I'd rather just sit through the 15, 30 second commercials on Hulu and  watch it that way now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I have an opinion on this stuff.  One of the reasons we're doing live streaming video is because, you know, our bread and  butter is still downloadable content, whether it's audio or start doing downloadable video.  I think it's too hard for people.  And I think that the generation that grew up with turning on the TV and watching prefers  to watch on Hulu or live.twit.tv because you just go to a website and there it is.  You don't have to figure out how to download it.  You have to find the content, download it, put it on a device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think there's something about having a tangible copy of what you want to watch.  I think people like having a copy on their hard drive for watching later or using on  different devices.  I think there's still that feeling that goes way back to when we had everything on CDs  and VHS and DVD.  Streaming video is all well and good, but unless there's some kind of copy that you  can refer to later, people feel like they're not getting that sense of value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you have to do both.  I mean, I know that people want to TiVo it, right?  I mean, we've offered streaming video and all that did was increase the drum beat for  downloadable video.  But I think streaming is the future just because it's so easy.  And if you want to download a copy, fine.  But it's the starting point.  And I think that's why Hulu is really, really, really important for these networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think streaming is the impulse and downloading is kind of the planning.  So when you sit down at Hulu, it's kind of like, I think I'll watch some Hulu now.  I don't think anybody says, I'm going to go home and then after dinner, I'll sit down  and watch Hulu.  I think they do it on impulse or they do it on the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do that with their TV, though, right?  How many people?  This is how we watch TV.  You sit down and you watch TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  But I'm saying in terms of if you're planning it, you download a copy to watch later, you  save it to your DVR.  I think that's kind of the planning, the forethought.  And streaming is more of an impulse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you don't think it's that it's so hard?  You think that it's just that they're...  It's easy.  It's actually easy.  Streaming is easy.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  It's not merely planning.  It's that it's hard to figure out.  I think the early adopters are going to figure this out.  The four of us have figured it out.  Anybody listening to Twits figured this out.  But if you're going to get the mass audience, which Hulu and Disney want, you got to make  it really easy for them.  And right now, getting a podcast, video or audio is not that easy.  I mean, I don't know.  Veronica, Tekzilla is downloadable only or do you stream it too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can watch it on the site and you can also download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it.  You have it on the site and it's playable.  Do you know what percentage of people watch it on the site versus downloading it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I don't.  I have a feeling that it's more downloads and streams, but don't quote me on that.  I'm really not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, for us, it's more downloads for sure.  But it's a surprise.  Like 40% come to our site and listen to the audio, which to me seems inconvenient.  I mean, but as far as our stream is far more, you know, maybe I don't know, I'll have to check.  Four or five thousand people are watching this compared to the 180,000 that will download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I suspect they listen to it while they work.  Yeah, that's just runs over the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of the new model, I think, is, yeah, you got to go in all the time.  It only works if you.  You know, that's what I think.  That's why we're doing this stream.  I mean, I might be crazy. I don't know.  But that's why we're doing the stream is that people would just go there and they leave it running all day.  It's like a race. It's like having the radio in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like having radio. In fact, it's for some businesses, it's an issue.  We haven't done it. We're not in it a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're blocked in a lot of businesses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Because of the bandwidth.  Yeah.  So I think that that's, you know, it becomes a bit of a lot of people do use internet radio and streaming audio and video is kind of there.  The way they used to have a clock radio next to their desk all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, get this talk about bandwidth cable vision, which has always been kind of the most forward looking cable company, I think they they pretty much serve.  It's mostly New York City, Long Island, a little bit of New Jersey, a little bit of Connecticut.  They have announced that they are going to offer uncapped.  This is a response to Time Warner and Comcast. Right.  Uncapped. 101 megabit service starting next week in their entire service area for 99 bucks a month.  I'd buy it. I'd buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder how fast it will really be given that any broadband I've ever had has never come anywhere close to what they claim on a on a relay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, but if they claim 100, you might actually get 50. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  True. That would be fabulous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's DOCSIS 3, which is capable of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it depends on what the server you're talking to is capable of giving you to and what the rest of the pipes between here and there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Really. No, no, no. None of my servers are 100 megabit.  If you if you came to our server, if 10 people with 100 megabit connections came to our server, that'd be saturated.  They'd be over. Right.  No, I mean, that's a gigabit right there. We can't do that.  However, I think the more important word in there is uncapped.  That's really what that this is.  And I know this is why competition is so important.  There is no competition in the cable industry, but I just love the idea that when Time Warner has, you know, they've gone back and forth.  The latest is, well, all right, maybe we won't do capped service.  But they were talking really low caps.  Even even Comcast with its 250 gigabyte cap was bothering some people.  It bothers me because if you watched all of our content, it could easily eat up 250 gigabyte a month.  So I like this. But what it's also saying, I remember talking to these cable vision guys at CES about five or six years ago.  And I said, well, I said, why don't you guys just think of yourself as a Internet company?  Just provide bits. And they said, that's not our business model.  We can't do that. We would we would go bankrupt. There's not enough value in bits.  We have to sell premium content.  And I think that's why Comcast and Time Warner are saying we're going to do caps.  Is there afraid of people using this high speed Internet to get all their video to watch everything on Hulu?  So this is almost cable vision capitulating saying, OK, we can get 100 bucks out of you.  I guess you can get all your content on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, and as you watch AT&T, which has not gone into this yet,  but keeps talking that they as though they might start capping things as they get more and more involved and sell more and more subscriptions to U-verse.  They're starting to pay more attention to it.  And I wouldn't be surprised if because they have to sell premium content to that you don't see AT&T getting capped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think when one company like Cablevision comes along, it might cause a shift.  I would love it if all these companies would say.  And I think, you know, what do they need to make?  I mean, 100 bucks is a lot of money.  If they could get all their customers to pay them 100 bucks, wouldn't they be happy?  I mean, how much what's your cable bill, Dwight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My cable bill, I have I use unbundled Comcast.  I think it's I think it's eight megabits for about close to 70 bucks.  If I bundled it with tape with Comcast cable, it would be about 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and so you don't get any TV on your Comcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I use U-verse television and Comcast Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you combine the television and the Internet, what are you spending?  Probably 150, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably about 120 bucks altogether.  But it's but it's less actually than when we were using TiVo and Comcast and  television and Internet.  So it's actually less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're what scares these companies because you're spending less and less money as you get more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm breaking it up. I'm not bundling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about you, Veronica?  I mean, you're somebody who watches a lot of Internet television.  Do you have a big cable bill for TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think our cable bill total.  Oh, geez. I paid automatically.  So I don't even remember what the charge is.  I think it's like 140 bucks for TV and Internet.  That's a lot. I'm guessing it's up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you were smart enough to get all your TV via this hundred and one megabit connection,  you'd be saving money at 100 bucks.  Yeah. And they'd be saving a customer.  They may be happy to get your 100 bucks instead of your 150 just because at least they keep you.  How about you, Harry? What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's for me, I think I also pay it automatically.  I believe it's 140 for TV, Internet access and a phone line, which I don't really use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, phone line. I don't have a phone line. That's fancy.  Oh, are you all white?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to give Comcast less money.  And if Comcast gave me incentives to give them more money, it would be a good thing for them.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds like we have the same Comcast deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And of course, I signed up for the triple play at some absurdly low rate and then discovered  it didn't include HD. It didn't include even really basic TV channels like MSNBC.  So the moment I actually started to get it, it jumped from from $50 for triple play or whatever to 140.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this could be the first domino.  The cable vision may have finally said, you know, this is the way it is.  Let's at least get the 100 bucks.  And when people start looking at their cable bill, as soon as they get smart enough to figure out  that they can watch everything for free using the Internet, this is going to be the this may be the  beginning of the end for this whole mess.  That's true. It's a huge conflict of interest right now, you know, for Comcast to say,  well, we don't want you to use VoIP. We don't want you to download files.  We don't want you to watch streaming video because you're undermining our business model.  They're not going to get away with that.  And I think the new FCC commissioner, Julien Genachowski is not going to go for it.  Julius Genachowski is not going to go for that.  I think that this is they're seeing the writing on the wall, the regulatory environment's not in  their favor anymore. And I think they might be saying, all right.  But it's how big is is 100 bucks too much cable.  Cable vision is not that big. They're small, but they but they're very they're very  technologically sophisticated. I would say they're the most sophisticated cable company.  Their optimum online is very it's always been very fast and good.  And they are in a very dense metro.  I mean, they are in the most dense metro of all.  So that makes them, I'm sure, very profitable.  They don't have to string as much cable to get to the customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But in the in the in the ecosystem of cable television and cable Internet providers,  how influential are they?  In other words, for example, if Comcast were to do this, that would be I would say that you may have a point  that it could be the domino.  But cable vision is a relatively small player compared to Comcast and Charter and Time Warner.  And so I'm not sure that, you know, I'll play the John Dvorak role here.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe maybe it's a little wishful thinking on my part.  It might be a little wishful thinking on my part.  But but what I do believe is cable vision is is kind of at the forefront of all this.  They're very advanced thinking.  So that's why I think they might be a bellwether for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although in looking at the statements that Time Warner made when it backed away from its tiered  and multiple cap service, which it was testing right down the road here in Beaumont,  when they backed away from that, you know, kind of their closing word was this is this is what we want to do  and we're going to figure out a way to do it.  We're going to do it. Yeah. Right.  And but I was really intrigued by your comment about the regulatory environment.  I wonder if, you know, granted, they had a consumer uprising, but I also wonder if they didn't look at what was happening  at the FCC and said, we got two fronts against us here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jenikowski is is big on Internet Net Neutrality, huge net neutrality guy.  In fact, we're going to get Debbie Jones wants to come on the show and I'll get her on maybe next week.  She's big on this broadband access, universal broadband access.  Jenikowski very big on that, too.  I think those are two important initiatives already that are in the forefront.  And I think this impacts them.  I think that they're this is not the friendly FCC and it wasn't so friendly in the last eight years,  but this is not the friendly FCC that they might have had.  Comcast had their own tussles with the FCC for the last few years.  But I think you're going to I think there's some push in that direction.  I'd love to see that. I hope you're right.  I hope I'm right, too. And I hope you're wrong.  I'd be happy to be wrong.  I hope you're wrong. Please make me wrong.  Let's talk about I'll tell you what, we come back.  I want to I do there a few other things we might want to talk about the Palm Pre and the Pixie.  So, you know, there's a little trouble in paradise.  We'll talk about that.  Time Warner is going to spin off America Online.  Could be good for both.  Apple says they might want to design their own chips and 60 percent of Twitter's are quitters  within the first month.  All of that coming up in just a little bit.  I do want to mention audible dot com.  You use sometimes on Sword and Laser, your science fiction podcast, Veronica, don't you  use audible, listen to science fiction on audible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do. I'm actually listening to the Eye of the World series right now on audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was hoping I was going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, the Wheel of Time series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds familiar. Who does that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is Robert Jordan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it good? Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that right? Sometimes I get my authors confused.  Yeah, it's really good. I'm right now.  I'm on the the Dragon Reborn, which is Book Three.  And I listen to the second book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's like a dozen of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is literally a dozen.  Oh, my God.  I think they're working on Book 12 right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they go one or the other or are they?  Tell me a little bit about these stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a one continuous story.  And we've read I read the first one in regular book form.  And then I was reading so many other books at the time that I was like,  I want something to take with me to go during my commute.  So I download the second and third book and listen to them while traveling  and also during my commute, just sometimes at home also.  And there's two different voice actors that read all the parts.  And they do a really great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you are in a book club, that's a great reason to join Audible.  It's a great way to read your books.  They have beefed up their science fiction  section immensely with the Audible frontiers and so forth.  And I think I'm just going to make this a recommendation.  The Eye of the World Book One of The Wheel of Time.  There you go.  And there are 11 Wheel of Time.  See, I love it. If you find something you're really into.  Book one, by the way, 30 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a long, long book.  Yeah, they're all pretty long.  Are they all that long? Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it fantasy? What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's fantasy. Yeah.  And actually, Robert Jordan passed away this past year.  And so they're getting another author to finish the series on Book 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that awful when that happens?  I know. Can you believe it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was going to be the last book.  And so it's someone who's really familiar with the storyline  and the characters, though, and who writes in a similar tone.  So hopefully it'll be as good as all the other ones have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me this is Kate Reading and Michael Kramer.  Let me play a little bit of this just so you can hear  kind of what it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you hear the voice, stranger?  It will soon be time for the singing.  And here all are welcome to take part.  Eliana, my love, we have a guest. Eliana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this going to be one of those books  where they got like eight thousand names you have to keep track of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little bit. They stick with the same characters, so they so you get used to them.  And it's funny because the male voice actor does female voices in the book  and vice versa, there's a female voice actress who does the male parts.  But you get used to it so quickly.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, there's two different styles of audio books, one where the guy  like Jim Dale does every voice and everyone's a distinct character.  In fact, it's funny because the Harry Potter books in the US  were recorded by Jim Dale in Audible England.  It's Stephen Fry and Fry is much more of the thing where he gets  made slight differences, but he's not trying to act out every voice.  And it's just a different style.  I kind of like the Fry style of you.  I don't mind it at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Well, it's just a slight difference between the different voices.  Yeah, it's subtle enough that you can tell who's talking.  But at the same time, you know, it's not too distracting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes it takes me out of it when all of a sudden he's talking like this,  you know, and it just kind of it sounds it's like the guy's  kind of a little crazy, to be honest with you.  So I kind of like that. I like a little bit more subtle in my in my book.  Have you read I'm reading  talk about another long series.  It's what's his name?  I think you would like this is another fantasy series.  I'm reading on audible dot com, seeing if I can find it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you say you're reading on audible.  Yeah, I say I say listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get in trouble.  People say you're not reading.  But I am reading. It's every word of the book.  What's the difference whether it comes through your eyeballs or your ear hole?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your ear hole. Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the difference? It's reading.  It's reading a book. I think it counts.  I'm going to anyway.  You can call it whatever you want.  Go to audible dot com right now.  If you actually go to audible dot com slash twit to you get the platinum plan.  You're going to need it if you're going to read the Wheel of Time.  The Platinum Plan gives you two books a month and your first two books are free.  So you want this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the regular standard plan, the one book a month.  You're a gold. That's all I need because it takes so long to get through these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have a long commute.  You don't have a long commute.  If you had a long if you had a two hour as I used to, I'd go through three books a month.  I know people have two platinum plans because they do four books a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're a fast listener.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. You know, you can, by the way, turn the speed up.  You can turn the speed up on these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't. How fast can you go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But while you and still understand it, the iPod only lets you go slow, medium, fast.  It doesn't. So I don't know.  It's like 30 percent. It doesn't.  It's you know what? Your your brain's very good at absorbing.  In fact, it turns out it's better at hearing stuff if people talk quickly.  So it doesn't sound like Alvin the Chipmunks.  No, no, no. That's they're doing.  It's the iPod does some sort of pitch shifting.  Anyway, this plays on the iPod, the Kindle, the Zune,  pretty much every portable device.  I'm told that GPS devices are big for Audible because people have them in their car.  They often have memory and they all play Audible.  So give it a try. Audible dot com slash twit to.  I'm going to let Veronica pick our book this week.  Book one of The Wheel of Time.  Thirty Hours of the Eye of the World by Robert Jordan.  And then you can go to SwordandLaser.com and talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we had our that was one of our recent books.  So we actually had a whole podcast on that one as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you do a podcast.  And then is it like a book group where you have like forums and people will come  and talk and that kind of thing? Or how does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we have NING forums at SwordandLaser.NING.com  where we do all our discussions about the books that we're reading.  And then once a month, Tom and I get together.  Tom Merritt from CNET, of course, and discuss the book a little bit  and talk about readers comments and just, you know, regular book club stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did Tom like this book? Just give us a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he liked it. Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, then I'll read it.  It's not it's not a chick book.  It's not a chick book. Don't worry.  Well, there are fantasy books  that are just really romance novels. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you might you might not like the Jacqueline Carey novels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, some of them are kind of romancey.  And then there's but there's some with there's some like swordfighting in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, there's a good amount of swordfighting and magic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and explosions. Don't forget explosions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As long as they're magical explosions.  Apple has decided this is a very interesting story.  I don't know what to make of it, that they've been hiring.  You remember they bought P.A.  Semi, so they have engineers in house that could design chips.  It's not clear whether these are arm.  They're basically arm chips for, I would assume, the iPhone,  but maybe other portable devices, including the rumored tablet iPhone.  And now there are more than 100 job listings  for Apple looking for chip designers, chip engineers, quality control engineers.  It's pretty clear Apple has decided to design and build its own chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they would be taking that away from like Samsung, for example.  Yes, it's arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, if it's arm.  But, you know, what if they decided to do this for desktops, too?  And here's one conspiracy theory.  It would be a way one of the problems Apple has is it's really easy  to build a hackintosh. Right.  It's trivial.  You could put a you could put OS 10 on a I have it on the MSI wind.  It's easy.  They haven't been able to shut that down.  If you made your own chips that only you sold, you wouldn't have that problem.  You'd have absolute control of hardware and software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But haven't they been down that road before?  I mean, to a certain extent, their early processors were  no, they were always early used in their machines.  Not that the power PC.  That was the power PC processor was a was a joint development  between IBM and them and Motorola.  And it seems like they kind of have done that before.  And then they moved to Intel because of performance and heat and batteries.  So you think it would be a bad idea?  I think I could see them doing it for a handheld device.  I think that makes a lot of sense.  And increasingly, things like the iPhone are becoming more and more a part of what they do.  And I can see them wanting to get some kind of an edge and hold it in that area.  But for desktops, at this point, I think there's a benefit for them using a relatively open platform.  I think the percentage of people who are actually doing hackintoshes aren't enough to really impact their sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like it's more of them trying to control their supply line.  Because I mean, wasn't it back in the day when the iPhone first started coming out that Samsung couldn't meet up with the demands for the chips?  And that kind of restricted how many iPhones were coming out at first?  Am I?  That's it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if they actually control their own manufacturing line with the chips, they might not have to worry about that kind of situation.  And also, Samsung is technically a competing company, and they have to worry about less leaks that way if they aren't putting in orders for new products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although presumably somebody other than Apple will be manufacturing these chips.  So they'll still have that issue.  I really feel like the operating system, which is currently on the iPhone, is going to be around after their no longer Macintoshes.  As we know them now.  And I don't know whether Apple is thinking the way I am, but I think they could be preparing themselves for that.  Because I think we're at the beginning of the end of desktop PCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whoa, wait a minute.  Now, this is interesting.  You think desktop PCs are going away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Eventually.  I mean, I really believe that the phone is going to be the new PC over time.  We're at the beginning of the end of Windows and Windtel.  And I don't know whether Apple is thinking that way.  But I feel fairly confident that the descendants of the iPhone will be around after they're no longer descendants of today's MacBooks or iMacs.  And they'll probably be a little bit more proprietary than today's Macs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'd be a wise thing for them to plan for an era, a post PC era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I sure would be if I were them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really interesting.  It's the kind of thing Apple would do.  They're really, they do think ahead like that in a way that a lot of manufacturers don't.  Huh.  What do you think of that, Dwight?  Do you think that's a good, that's a reasonable scenario as a PC?  How soon?  What's your time frame for that, Harry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I always feel like it's better to guess that things will happen more quickly than you expected.  So I feel like a decade from now will be well into sort of a primarily past post PC era.  Not completely, because there's still mainframes out there.  Oh, yeah.  But I think that most of the things that people do on traditional computers today,  they will be doing on something which is a descendant of a phone at some point.  I still have large screens and large keyboards, but there's no reason why you can't use them with phones too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  I heard somebody describe the iPhone as being the multimedia server that everybody,  maybe that was you, Harry.  Did you write that?  That the iPhone was a, is kind of, everybody was talking about the multimedia server controller  in the home and that the iPhone is turning into that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, people have written about the idea that maybe the iPhone is going to turn  into the next Apple TV.  You don't even really need the Apple TV.  If you have a TV with an internet connection or Wi-Fi and an Apple and an iPhone,  it might be how you get media onto the TV directly.  And maybe so, there's kind of no technological reason why you can't do it,  particularly as you get faster access to stuff in the cloud.  I feel like the cloud and the phone will replace the PC sooner or later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're just looking for an interface into the cloud, basically.  Something that's user-friendly and easy to get online with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what Steve Perlman is trying to do with OnLive.  He's saying you don't need a graphics chip to play high-end video games.  We'll do it all for you on our servers.  In fact, it's ironic because the OnLive controller looks a little bit like an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you talked about that a lot on the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're the gamer expert.  What do you think of that?  For people who didn't hear about this, we talked a little bit about it after GDC,  the Game Developers Conference.  Steve Perlman announced this.  He has big partners, Electronic Arts, Atari.  It looks pretty real.  The idea being you'd sign up for the service.  You could use an old, low, cheap PC or buy one of their kind of interface devices  and attach it to your big screen TV and now play games even as high on as Crysis.  They do the rendering on their servers and with some proprietary technology.  I'd be worried about the latency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's probably the biggest worry is the latency issues, lag issues,  especially with bandwidth caps.  Is that going to be a major problem sometime in the future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you my conspiracy theory.  This is the cable company.  This relies on a deal with the ISPs because that's who you're going to end up buying this  service from.  You're going to go to Comcast.  Comcast says you want our gaming package, $10 a month.  You can play any game.  Then they prioritize.  They do QoS stuff with OnLive.  In other words, I think OnLive's whole business model relies on partnership with the internet  service providers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I absolutely agree with you.  I think this is something you're going to see on Comcast boxes.  I think that's probably where they're planning on going with this in the near future  because that makes total sense.  If you don't need to have a separate console or a separate PC, you want it just on your  TV right there.  If it's on your cable box already, you don't need to have to worry about it.  You just need a controller to play it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From Atari and EA's point of view, it introduces a whole new group of casual gamers who don't  own PS3s and Xbox 360s as customers.  It broadens their base.  No piracy.  Makes a lot of sense for all the players.  It's a technical problem, but I think the ISPs can solve that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then you have to make sure that everyone has the same kind of level of connection.  Or I guess you'd have to make sure that the host at least has a very high-speed connection  because when you get 16 people playing on the same game, there's going to be some problems.  There's problems now with the systems that we already have set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When this happens, though, not only does cloud computing become capable of word processing  and spreadsheets and calendaring and email, cloud computing becomes capable of high-end  computing, video editing.  Gaming is just the beginning of all this.  I think, Harry, you might be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The cloud, though, has to get a lot more reliable.  You do have to have the bandwidth issues.  Veronica mentioned earlier, people want to have a physical copy.  I think that before you get to the point where people trust that and that's  where their primary computing is done, it's got to get a lot faster and a lot more reliable.  You don't have to worry about bandwidth caps.  That is serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Definitely.  Even Gmail, as cool as it is, I'd say about 15% of the time, I have minor to major problems  getting my email off of Gmail.  You can't complain, it's beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Always beta.  You can't complain, it's a beta.  I think they're going to change the name of the company from Google to beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If Google can't scale this stuff, nobody has figured it out yet,  so it does have to get way more reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've painted an interesting picture, though, Harry, of a world with  very simple devices that aren't PCs connected to very powerful devices on the cloud.  That's my guess.  I worked at PC World for years and who knows, maybe I'm overreacting to shift in the opposite

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  direction and think about the future, but so often in the past, stuff has happened more  quickly once it's got going than you would have expected.  I mean, the whole thing with digital music is only about the future.  The whole thing with digital music is only about 11 years old and think how much 11 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a prediction beyond the cloud.  At some point, as these cycles go, because essentially the cloud is a return to main  frames and terminals, we're going to start talking about the personal cloud, where you  have your own server at your house that ultimately other people will be able to play on,  and remotely you'll be able to connect up to your own system that you rely on.  It'll come back to that eventually.  Some of that's there on the HP PSX server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does that now?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This also relies on ubiquitous internet because we're not talking about just a direct connect in  the house now.  I'm going to go out the door and I want this device to also work there, right?  Everywhere.  But I think we're getting close to that.  All of these pieces seem to be falling in place.  I hadn't really thought about this, Harry, but I think we might be  heading quickly to the post PC era and it might be faster than we think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're having so much trouble even just trying to get blanketed Wi-Fi in major cities that would  seemingly support it like San Francisco.  That's a major hurdle too.  If you're not blanketed in Wi-Fi wherever you go, how are you going to access your content?  3G is one thing, but I was in a restaurant today that didn't even have edge connection.  Ooh, how did you survive?  I know.  I couldn't even do the Twitter on my phone while I was eating.  What a shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should put a sign up on a restaurant to say, you can't Twitter here.  I mean, that's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's still major hurdles to the whole cloud situation, especially on the go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Zagat has to add a new thing, food quality, service, decor, Twitter capability.  It'd be a whole new section.  Cell phone reception.  Cell phone reception, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There should be. There's Wi-Fi in Zagat now. Don't they have a Wi-Fi listing in Zagat?  Do they really?  I think so. I was at a restaurant last night, a fairly fancy one in Houston called Churrosco's,  which if you're ever in Houston, it's the place to go for South American steaks.  Let's go. We're all on our way. We'll be right there.  And I'm buying.  OK.  I had my iPhone with me and I happened to check it. And they had free Wi-Fi, their own Wi-Fi.  Now, this is a kind of place where this is a really nice place to eat and almost a kind  of place where if someone whips out an iPhone, it's semi-frowned upon.  But they had free Wi-Fi for their customers. And I was pretty surprised and pleased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is odd in a fancy restaurant to have...  Yeah.  But everybody does it now. In fact, it's almost the bane of modern life is that everybody's not  looking at... They're all looking at their iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both my daughter and I now have iPhones. We got my daughter one a while back.  And we sit in the living room while my wife watches television or whatever. And we're both  going on our screens. And what's interesting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't watch TV without a screen in my lap anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. But what's interesting is...  It's like picture in picture.  Yeah, exactly.  I no longer sit there with my laptop. I use the iPhone instead of the laptop I used to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is going to sound really bad. Ryan and I actually have a touch that we keep in the living  room for exactly that purpose. It's the living room iPod touch. If you need to look up like a  cheat in a game or something about an actor on a TV show, you've got the iPod touch there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, when Apple does its tablet, it's a legend tablet.  This is going to happen next month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is going to happen next month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You will have that on your coffee table instead, Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Veronica and Ryan are the couple of the future. We need to watch them.  There need to be glass, one-way glass put into your apartment.  Oh, no, no.  Reality TV.  Yeah. And we will see what the future is going to be like. The future is now.  Ryan, by the way, is Ryan Block, who is the host of GDGT and former founder of Engadget.  Between the two of you, you must be completely wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It gets a little scary sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not one of those couples that goes to a restaurant and sits across from each other and  talks via IM, are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we're not that bad. There's actually kind of an unspoken rule that you can take out the  iPhone after the check has arrived.  Oh, that's good.  No iPhone until the check has arrived.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I like that. I like that.  There's some etiquette here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to make some kind of etiquette because this is the final frontier.  You have to make some ground rules early in the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the etiquette for the new world.  Yeah.  I love that.  So the pre, you know, you were talking about how Apple struggled with supply problems.  It's apparently that at least one analyst says Palm's going to have some problems.  They cut back their initial order for the pre from one million to just a few hundred thousand,  not as some thought to create an artificial scarcity, but because they cannot make enough of  them. Mike Harrington at TechCrunch told me that he thought that he heard that the pre was kind of  cheesy feeling in the hand.  He and others now in gadget also have broken the story that there's a Pixie device, which is a much  smaller pre that will come out just a few months later with an actual keyboard instead of a soft,  oh no, I guess the pre has a slide out keyboard, but it'll be more like the Centro where it's a  smaller screen and a keyboard right on it like a candy bar phone.  Some say that's the one you want.  Both will run the new Palm web OS.  Palm's betting the farm on this one.  Would it be disastrous if they couldn't get enough to market?  Seems like it.  Yes.  Have you played with anybody played with a pre here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't really let people touch them hardly ever even in demos.  I've seen it close up and in terms of software, it does look terrific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've seen it in a guy's hand, but they won't let us touch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there's a cat behind you. Watch out. He may leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know he got in. That's Mr. Little Jeans or at Mr. Little Jeans on Twitter if you're interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would laugh at you, but my dog has a Twitter account.  I did not create it.  We don't let our cat near the Twitter.  No. I had a caller on the radio show today said,  my cat was sleeping on my Lenovo keyboard and now the backspace delete and enter key won't work.  I said, you didn't sit on the cat while it was on the keyboard.  Did you? A little something came out there. What happened?  Anyway, we don't know what the story is on that one.  So I think the pre, we agree the pre is very important for Palms continued survival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a huge amount of anticipation with this device.  I think if they don't deliver big very early,  people are going to start calling it as a failure.  That's really depressing to me because it could do well over time.  But people are so looking forward to seeing how it does right away, right off the bat.  Comparing it to the success of the iPhone when it first came out,  that there's a lot of anticipation there. A lot of, I don't know.  Palm definitely went on a limb with this and the reception so far,  at least when we saw it at CES for the first time, was very good.  So I hope if they can meet up with demands,  it'll continue to go along on that positive route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to get in line. I'll go to the Sprint store and buy one.  I'm going to get in line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it similar to what happened with the G1,  which had a huge amount of hype and a lot of anticipation before it?  And they've sold a decent amount of it.  T-Mobile says $1 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it definitely hasn't been a game changer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going to be hard for either T-Mobile or Sprint to change any game given that  they're the weakest of the big carriers.  And if the pre came out on Verizon, say,  it would have a bigger chance at being huge instantly.  Do you credit it?  I say that as somebody who's very excited about the pre.  I might switch to Sprint to get a better...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, Sprint has really great data, but they just don't have the numbers there.  There's not enough people on Sprint.  And I don't know if Sprint has a big enough draw to get people to switch over for this one device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the real problem right now.  If you want an iPhone, you have to go to AT&T.  You want a G1, you have to go to T-Mobile.  This is not good for consumers.  I wish they wouldn't do this, but I guess it's good for the companies.  Do you credit the rumor that Apple might be doing a deal with Verizon,  putting in the iPhone or something like it, or maybe an iPhone Lite on the Verizon network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It makes some sense in some ways, and it doesn't make any in another.  For one thing, if Apple were to do it now, they'd have to do it with CDMA,  which doesn't have a long shelf life.  On the other hand, with LTE coming along and them swapping out phones every year like it seems that  they're on that cycle, it would give them a foothold with Verizon and would expand their  market share quite a bit.  So it's probably good for a long-term play, I mean, a short-term play.  And then if they keep up with the technology, it'll do good in the long-term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like Android, and now we're seeing a lot of news that Android's going to show up on other devices  that Google will put the Android operating system or offer the Android operating system on some netbooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the problem with the G1 is that it's just a little too geeky for the average consumer.  That's the only thing I can think of because it's a cool device.  It's a little bit on the large side compared to most of the cell phones that are out there these days.  Not ones with sliding keyboards, I guess.  But I just feel like it hasn't caught on with that regular consumer set for one reason or  another, and maybe has to do with Android.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Android Cupcake, with a version 1.5, is now being pushed out to the T-Mobile.  I keep waiting for it to show up on mine.  Rumors are it really improves performance, adds nice features, including a soft keyboard.  Maybe that's all that the G1 needs.  I mean, a million phones is respectable.  So, you know, it's a third of Apple's sales in the same time period, but it's respectable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't have the apps, though.  The developer crowd has not come to it.  If you go and look through the store that is available for the G1, there's not a lot there.  Certainly not as what's compared to the iPhone.  I think that that's the big deal with the iPhone is the apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Developers, developers, developers.  They've got 35,000 apps.  They've sold a billion of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  I read a great article recently done by an iPhone developer, and he was responding to  a lot of criticism about why developers haven't been creating more apps for Android.  And the reason being is there's just not the amount of people there that are buying  these applications.  I mean, so many rabid fans of iPhone applications who are just downloading apps  constantly from the iTunes app store, they're not getting that same kind of response  with Android and with the G1.  So obviously it makes more sense for them to focus their attention on something like  the iPhone apps as opposed to doing it for Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's always been the case.  Whatever platform gets the most apps is going to win.  And that's why Windows for so long beat Macintosh.  If you get the developers behind you, you're going to have an advantage in the marketplace.  Let's talk about Amazon just bought Stanza, speaking of iPhone.  Stanza is the best e-reader, much better than Amazon's own Kindle e-reader on the iPhone.  And it's an interesting choice to buy Lexcycle, which is the company that makes  Stanza.  Do you use Stanza, Veronica?  That's a really good e-book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I didn't actually, but I just bought a Kindle this week and I got it in the mail  on Thursday.  How do you like it?  So I love it.  I freaking love it.  But I downloaded the Kindle app for the iPhone and I haven't used it yet,  but I didn't use Stanza before because I've always had a hard time with  e-book readers on the iPhone.  Stanza is pretty good.  Is it good?  It's my eyes.  My eyes just get so strained after reading on the tiny screen for too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can pinch the text to make it bigger or smaller so you can get big fonts.  But you're right.  I mean, it's not as good as the Kindle.  So you like the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I absolutely am so happy with it.  You freaking like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I frack and love it.  Frack and love it.  You know, it's funny.  We're escalating.  I don't know, is frack worse than frick?  I saw some stats that said that more than half of the Kindle buyers are over 50  and a third of them are over 60.  And I wasn't surprised at all.  I showed my 75-year-old mom my Kindle and she said,  I've got to have this because the font, the text size, you can get it big enough.  And she said, I'd stopped reading because the text was too small on printed books.  And she loves the Kindle.  She loves it that she can order a book and it appears there.  She loves the form.  She's getting one.  I hope she's not listening.  She's getting one for Mother's Day.  That's a good gift for Mother's Day.  But yeah, she really likes it.  So that's interesting.  The Kindle's audience is not the young hip kids.  It's pretty expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's for a young hip kid.  I mean, it's the cost of an entry-level laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  But hey, look, Veronica bought one and she fricking loves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had to sell part of my kidney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you're young.  You can afford that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got an extra.  Has there been any word if Amazon is going to replace its Kindle app for the iPhone  with the Stanza app?  No, but you got to think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they'll probably integrate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the iPhone app for Kindle.  I've been reading.  I've read a couple of books with it.  And it doesn't bother my eyes that much.  But the font is very nice.  It's the same font that the New York Times uses on its app, which is also very readable.  And I like it.  I don't have a Kindle, but I've bought a couple of books to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Download Stanza and see what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What confuses me is that Stanza did a blog post saying they had no plans to make any  change to the app or add new sources of content.  And if they're owned by Amazon, how can Amazon not essentially replace Kindle for the iPhone,  which is not that great, with Stanza, which is so much better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they must.  That must be the plan.  The other advantage is Stanza is worldwide.  You can buy Stanza anywhere.  It would let Amazon...  It would open up a market.  Well, maybe they don't want that global market because of the publishing rights issues.  But it would open up...  Everybody could use it.  It's a much better reader.  The big thing about the Kindle app, the only advantage the Kindle app has is that when  you read on the Kindle app, it updates your Kindle and vice versa.  So when you get to page 69 on the Kindle, it's suddenly page 69 on the Kindle app.  That's all they have to add to Stanza and one more source, Amazon.  It wouldn't be a big change.  So when do they say that, Harry?  Do they say that after the sale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, after the sale, there's a blog post saying essentially they have no plans for  changes, but who knows?  Maybe Stanza will stay the same, but there'll be a new version of the iPhone app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm reading Confessions of a Shopaholic.  Oh, that's a great book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a great book.  And have you read it a lot on the iPhone?  Or you read a lot of pages?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I just downloaded it just a second from my Kindle stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I just downloaded Myst, but you don't see me playing it.  By the way...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just wanted to show you what it looked like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm sure you're not reading...  It was for the show.  I'm sure you're not reading during the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I wouldn't do that ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am playing Myst, however.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nor have I ever played World of Warcraft while on the show.  I've never done that, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The way you say it makes me think you have.  Are you playing World of Warcraft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What? No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to 71, I saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm at 80 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to 80?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to 80, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's as high as you can go, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can go, yep.  Leveled out.  I'm sad.  Let's not talk about it anymore.  It's too depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Level 80 Vixen Warrior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I am a Torrin Shaman.  For the Horde.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A Torrin Shaman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For the Horde!  For the Horde.  Such nerds.  Moving on.  So sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just two losers sitting here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just totally rat-holed us, didn't I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I love it.  First of all, I love rat-hols, but I love talking about World of Warcraft.  It's completely appropriate since I'm now going to play Myst.  773 megabytes was that download.  It only takes, they say, 100 megabytes on the phone,  but you need a free 773 to install it, I guess.  I wonder how long this sync will take.  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then you have Myst on your phone, so that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't wait.  Before the show's over, I'll boot it up  and we'll take a look at it.  We're going to take a break.  Come back.  I would like your impressions of the DVD copying trial.  This is a big, big story which we have not yet covered.  It's happening in San Francisco right now, the Ninth Circuit Court.  It's Judge Marilyn Patel.  Back to her old tricks.  GoDaddy says, don't buy .tv.  The island is sinking.  And Windows 7 comes out Tuesday in Release Candidate 1.  Supposedly the only Release Candidate.  Before we do all of that, though,  I do want to mention our friends at Citrix and GoToMeeting.  Has anybody here used GoToMeeting?  You can be honest.  You don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  What do you think, Dwight?  I liked it.  I wasn't driving.  It was for a meeting at work, but it worked quite well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm using it more and more.  In fact, we just asked for a few accounts for some of our hosts who are using it,  actually during the show, to show screens,  which is very cool.  You said you've used it too, Harry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, a fairly significant percentage of the demos people do for me these days are done via it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Everybody's moving to GoToMeeting.  GoToMeeting from Citrix, they're the company that does GoToMyPC as well.  They really know the ins and outs of Windows and how to do remote access.  And I don't think there's anybody better, frankly,  at remote access than the Citrix folks.  Basically, here's the problem.  You're on a conference call.  You're talking to somebody and you're showing them something visual or you're talking about  something visual, a PowerPoint or a keynote presentation or a drawing or a slide,  and you're describing it and it's just frustrating as heck.  What you can do if you've got GoToMeeting installed is say, hey, well, let me show you.  This is kind of wild.  And you say, go to GoToMeeting.com.  It takes you about a click of the mouse to get it started.  And then you tell them, go to GoToMeeting.com.  Here's the meeting ID.  And it's kind of cool because they go, wow.  And they're looking at your computer on their screen, no matter where they are.  They see the presentation.  It's great for sales, great for product demos, for training, for collaboration too.  You can both work on a document together.  Very affordable.  And right now, free for 30 days when you use this special URL,  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  These guys, I have known these guys going back to Ed Iacobucci,  who founded Citrix many moons ago.  And I've always thought the world of them and their technology,  it's secure, it's affordable, it's effective.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  I invite you to give it a try.  So Microsoft is going to Windows 7.  According to Acer, Acer will have a Windows 7 PC available for sale.  October 23rd.  Somebody's going to get spanked at Acer for that one.  But it may even be sooner.  Who knows?  Maybe it'll be September and then Acer's just saying,  but we're going to have our computer by October.  You using Windows 7, Harry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As we speak, I'm installing it on a Netflix.  I installed it on a larger laptop yesterday.  I'm gearing up for Tuesday so I can have more hands-on experience  with the release candidate.  I've been using the early preview version since last October,  whenever it was it was released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have 7,000, which is the preview version on a number of PCs.  And then the 7,100 comes.  I'm not a member of TechNet or MSDN,  so I'm going to have to wait with the unwashed masses till Tuesday.  I look forward to trying it on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's excellent.  I think it's in a lot of ways, even the beta was a better product than this.  That's got to be depressing, but that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's way better than Vista in a lot of ways.  And my main concern is PC manufacturers don't have a great track record  of making Windows look good on their machines  because they load it up with demo wear and junk,  and they replace the Windows utilities with ones that aren't as good.  And I think they might do that to 7,200.  I'm hoping that because 7 is all about making Windows less annoying,  I hope the PC companies move in that spirit and don't mess it up  because they totally could if they wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft was on top of the manufacturers when Vista came out.  I remember talking to product managers who were working on Vista at the time,  and they were telling me they were leaning on the HPs and Dells and Sonys of the world  not to crap it up as they had done with XP.  That's a good slogan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't crap it up.  Don't crap it up.  It's freaking fast.  Don't mess with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Microsoft is in a much better position today to lecture people  about not being annoying than they were even with Vista.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And a lot of companies already offer ways to yank out the crap wear.  Sony and Dell both have ways when you configure a machine bottom line to remove it.  You have to pay Sony extra for that.  That bugs the hell out of it.  I think they rescinded that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did they change that?  I believe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I remember that.  Yeah, we were real worked up about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We would be glad to sell you a computer that runs fine,  but you would have to give us an extra $100.  It was like $50, I think.  Yeah, it was expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it was $50, if I remember correctly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a lot of money.  I think that they'll end up doing the same thing they did before.  I think that that's one of the ways that they subsidize the cost of PCs,  and one of the reasons why Microsoft can run the Laptop Hunters ads,  and people are buying $800 computers in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Totally.  Although, I'm worried it's short-term thinking, though.  If you make somebody now, would it annoy your customers enough,  eventually they will move elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Windows 7.  I think this is the best Windows in a long time,  and I do hope they don't frack it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been using the beta on my HP Mini 1000, and I've really enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It runs on a netbook, fun!  Yeah, it runs great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It left me with only 4 gigs of space, total, but you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so you have an SSD drive in your Mini.  Yeah.  By the way, I bought a Corsair 128-gig SSD.  Very pricey.  They're $330 for only 128 gigs.  Put it in my MacBook Pro.  I am loving this.  Does your Mini seem speedy because it's using an SSD?  I don't know if they put a very good one in there.  They can't put a very good one in there.  No, it's pretty fast.  I haven't had any trouble with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your Mini costs less than the hard drive I bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I have to say, it speeds up the MacBook, especially boot time is very, very quick.  And application launch very, very quick.  Which SSD did you buy?  The Corsair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the Corsair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have a show with Ryan Shroud of PC Perspective and Apple,  and Alan is like the king of SSDs.  He's tested them all.  And they talked me into it.  I said, well, I don't want to spend 800 bucks for 64 gigs for the Intel X25.  And they said, no, no, no, you don't need to.  You can buy the cheaper Corsair.  You get more space, less money.  And it's just as fast.  And I have to say, I've been blown away.  I think this is the future.  I think what you're going to see in PCs going forward is solid state drives for the boot  and the applications, and then a terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible,  two terabyte spinning drive for the extra storage for media and all the other stuff you use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't think eventually that the price of SSDs will come  down to the point that you can that terabyte?  That may, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be great?  But the problem is they've got the price on mechanical drives.  I'm buying terabyte drives for 80 bucks now.  Right?  150 bucks for two terabyte drives.  It's just mind boggling.  Harry, you know, at PC World, if I told you six years ago,  oh, you'll be able to get two terabytes for 150 bucks, you would have laughed at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Laughed in their face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The one dependably popular story we ever did at PC World was always hard drives reach X for  X amount of dollars.  And even when it was like them reaching 100 megabytes for God knows how much,  that was a big story.  And I feel like 10 years from now, it'll still be a big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just can't, I mean, yeah, 10 years from now, what is it going to be?  You know, oh yeah, I got a couple of petabytes running on solid state.  That's amazing.  So I don't know if GoDaddy was just looking for headlines or what,  but when you go to GoDaddy and try to buy a .tv domain now,  a pop-up comes up that says, don't buy this, the island is sinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't believe GoDaddy would ever do anything solely for publicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How dare they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sinking island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What the heck it says, why choose .tv?  Note, .tv by the way, is Tuvalu, the island of Tuvalu, which is in fact sinking.  I mean, it's not a joke.  They say, no, the island of Tuvalu is sinking.  Recommended alternatives are .com.net.info.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it goes away, does the domain go away?  Well, that's a good question.  What happens to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What difference does it make?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Makes a difference to me.  All my domains are .tv.  What do I do?  I don't have .com.  I have .tv.  If .tv goes away, if it sinks, I'm sunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It kind of sounds like a, like just a publicity stunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could switch to .at, which is for Atlantis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they'll give Tuvalu the Atlantis designation.  That's right.  Yeah.  FM is Federated Micronesia.  I use AM because that's, but that's Armenia.  But yeah, TV is Tuvalu and it is in fact, it's just a little volcanic island that's slowly sinking.  By the way, somebody said, boy, that's for you to worry about that is pretty coarse  because I mean, what about the people who live there?  But it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure the people have been steadily moving off for the past few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's only a few hundred of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's sad though.  And I've been spending a lot of money on their .tv domain.  They've got, they got a lot of my money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should be rebuilding with your money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, build a, you know, get some, get some floats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they'll have their own little state in Australia and it'll survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want to, I'm going to call ICANN and say, please,  can you assign it to somebody else so I can buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their Royal Anthem, I'm looking at the Tuvalu, I guess, I'm looking at the Tuvalu website and  their anthem is God Save the Queen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, yeah, they're probably a British part of the Commonwealth.  It's weird when you go to Canada and you're in Canada,  they play God Save the Queen, the Queen's on their money.  Yeah, they're part of the Commonwealth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't really do anything.  I actually had a big discussion about this with our Canadian crew because we were just  up in Vancouver shooting and we were asked, well, we were just in England, so what's the  real relationship between Canada and the UK and with England especially?  And they're like, well, it's just kind of symbolic.  Like we have our own parliament.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not, you know why it's not?  It's not.  Because there's a, you should ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's Canadians that told me this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they know and they just weren't thinking, but there's a, the Queen appoints a Governor General,  there's a Governor and she's got some power because when, there's a term for it, I can't  remember what it is, but they were during this recent battle between the Conservatives  and Labour with Stephen Harper and there was a whole thing going on.  What is the, the Governor General can dissolve the government  and then there's this weird thing that she can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a huge argument going on in the chat room now.  They're going, no, she doesn't, she doesn't, but there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I remember I read a whole article about this.  Pro-rogue.  She can pro-rogue parliament.  She's not an elected official.  She's a, she's representative of the Queen's government in Canada.  And I presume appointed by the Queen and she has this power,  considerable power with the government.  Well, that's very interesting.  Isn't that weird?  Yeah.  But it has to be, it has to be a very,  oh, the Prime Minister appoints the Governor General?  Oh, never mind.  I take it all back.  Right.  She's fracking useless.  60% of this is, we're going to end with this story.  There is a guy who wrote, by the way, a program.  I love this.  That will eliminate the mentions of Twitter from this show.  I encourage you all to get it.  It's a little Python program that actually goes through the whole show  and redacts any, any sentence that has the word.  Through the audio show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  It redacts the words and the sentence that has the word Twitter in it  throughout the entire show.  It's brilliant.  And it works?  Well, I didn't, I didn't actually try it.  It's called Twitter Killer.  And well, it's from a dingoeskidneys.com.  I'm thinking he's Australian.  I might be wrong.  It says, it's a Twitter Killer, a Twit podcast improver.  Like many of you, I grew tired of listening to this week in tech.  And a panel blabbering on and on about how amazing Twitter is.  I enjoy the rest of the show, but they have to ruin it with their incessant fawning.  Not anymore.  Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, you know, he's going to do another one.  Kill Leo's bad accents.  That's what we really need.  I present to you Twitter Killer.  This fabulous program uses pocket sphinx to detect, mark,  and edit out sentences containing the word Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can he do one for Scoble that deletes friend feed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Snap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like friend feed.  We're using friend feed now.  In fact, we have a Twit conversations room.  And we get a lot of, you know, really interesting comments via friend feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were good in this episode with not talking about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's why I mentioned this, that you may want this program,  because I'm going to give you one last story that actually mentions Twitter.  You know, I do that because there's a Twitter drinking game for people  who are listening to the show and they're parched.  And I want them to have a little beverage here.  60%, according to Nielsen, 60% of Twitter users are Twitter quitters.  They were, they don't return the following month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I believe that.  I think that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, you know, Twitter is a problem because it's very easy to sign up for and use,  but it's a lot harder to get any value out of it.  Takes you a while to figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of like you either get it, you either get it or you don't.  And then you figure that out pretty quickly.  If this is something that's going to be interesting to you.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think if I look at my usage, I signed up in December 2006 and it took me about four or five  months before I used it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think for a lot of people not signing up, trying it, not understanding it, going away  is part of the process of eventually getting that because I certainly tried it and did not know what  I was doing and came back after a while.  So I would bet even other people who love Twitter, a fairly high percentage,  abandoned it for a while.  And Twitter is trying to make it easier to get going because originally, you know,  you had no friends when you signed up and they are now looking for some folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what the suggested friends are about.  If they're going for the mainstream, that's why there are so many celebrities in it,  is that they're trying to hook you that way.  But yeah, when you first get there, it's like an empty room.  And I think most people look around and go, OK, now what do I do?  And they don't come back.  But then once they do come back and if they kind of work it and look through their friends and  look through their friends' followers, they end up kind of figuring out what to do.  But initially, yeah, it's like an echo chamber.  There's nothing there.  Dave, why don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just finally added search for everybody this week.  Yeah, that helps.  That's a huge help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because you could search for Swine Flu and get a lot of content.  And then you can follow up.  I think that's actually better and more important than the suggested users because  if you search for something you're interested in, you can see who's talking about it.  Add them as friends.  That's how you build a friends list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, another thing, too, I don't think they're taking to account with the study  is people using desktop applications, which may not reflect the numbers in the same way  that web users do.  Yeah, they're only counting websites.  You're right.  Right.  So that probably does have an effect on this study.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook this week announced an open stream initiative, which I thought was kind of interesting.  Facebook's looking more and more like Twitter.  I don't know if you've noticed.  And I would love to see.  In fact, I think Facebook missed a bit a little bit.  Essentially what they announced only meant that it was easier for third party developers  to create Twitter style applications to access Facebook.  And Microsoft was there and Adobe was there and Seismic was there.  What I'd love to see, though, is for Facebook to open up much more completely so that you  could, for instance, follow people on Facebook.  They say, well, we'd like to do that, but our privacy commitments don't allow us to do so.  But don't you think that's one way Facebook could suddenly overtake and beat?  Well, overtake, they've got 200 million users, but they could completely put Twitter out of  business by just saying, well, follow the people you're interested in at Facebook.  Would you do that?  If I mean, would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess if they make better use of pages, as opposed to just having private profiles,  if you could follow pages or got more people into interested in following pages,  as opposed to just friending people.  That's what they're trying to do is make them landing pages where you can get all the  information about the people you're interested in and then still be able to have a dialogue with  them. So it's a little bit.  There's a lot more information there than maybe you would get from following someone on Twitter.  But you just have to get the people the eyeballs there to use that trite term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a total 180 because I think at least until recently, maybe even now, Mark Zuckerberg said  that Facebook is not even for meeting new people. Facebook is for kind of organizing the people,  you know, in the real world online. And obviously Twitter is nothing like that. Twitter is for  meeting new people and even following people you'll never meet. And I think Facebook has to  get their head around whether they want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use them differently. I use Facebook. Well, I don't use them appropriately,  but I would use Facebook to keep track of friends and family. And Twitter is more an  informational tool where you follow people who say things that are interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Twitter is increasingly for me used with search and increasingly used for both  direct interaction with people who read me and who I'm interested in following.  But when I go over to Facebook, I'm looking at my co-workers, my family, my friends,  and it's a completely different culture. And it's kind of odd that Facebook, almost in terms of the  features it's trying to bring in and the design that it's moving towards, is almost obsessed  with Twitter. It wants to be Twitter, but it's like you said, it's already bigger.  And it's a completely different thing. I think to paraphrase that 80s phrase,  you ought to let Facebook be Facebook. Yeah. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they definitely have a little bit of an identity crisis right now, because like we  mentioned earlier, it's meant to organize the people, you know, in the real world, yet they  see the success that Twitter is having and they want to implement some of those features. But  that doesn't work with the way they're set up. So it's becoming a clash of ideals there a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bit. It's irritated a lot of users too, with that set up. Got to be careful about the irritating the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  users. I mean, it all comes down to the fact that none of these services are meaningful at all,  unless users pour content into it. They live on us, right? It's interesting because these are  sites that are created not because the site, it's completely the opposite of the Houston Chronicle  or the New York Times where you go to the site because the site creates content. There is no  content on Facebook or Twitter or dig or a lot of these sites without us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Content on Facebook is a weird thing too, because it's really hard to take anywhere with you. It's  hard to, like if I leave a video comment on someone's page, I can't tag myself within that  comment. That video doesn't then show up in my video section of Facebook. It's like a total  separate entity. There's not a lot of usefulness there for me in that kind of sense. That's why I  don't create a lot of content for Facebook in particular. It's a different group of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that uses it, that's for sure. Hey, we're going to wrap this up. I just wanted to put the Twitter  story at the end so that we could test this program and see how much shorter the show is with that.  By the way, he has a setting you can also reverse it and cut out everything except the Twitter  mentions for those of you who want a really short show this week. Hey, Veronica, I'm so glad you  could be here. Veronica Belmont is the host of Tekzilla. She does that with my buddy,  Patrick Norton, and also on Core for Sony, which brings her all around the world. Q-O-R-E. You can  subscribe to it on your PlayStation 3. Do you have to have a PlayStation 3?  Yes. Sometimes it's on YouTube too. Don't tell. Is that illegal? Is that not right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't do that. We don't agree with that at all. No, bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thank you. It's great to see you, Veronica. Thank you for being here. Harry McCracken is the  technologizer. It's very, it's very gubernator of you, the technologizer. How's that going?  We first talked to you when you had left PC World and started it up. It's been about, what,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's eight months now, something like that? Yeah, it's a little over that. I guess the site turns  one in June, so I'm almost there and it's been great. This is the best job I've ever had and  I've had some pretty cool jobs in the past, so it's saying a lot. It's really encouraging that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you, somebody can strike out on their own and I think there are a lot of reporters working for  newspapers that are slowly pulling a Tuvalu who are saying, this is good. This is good news. We  can go out, strike out on our own, create content and make a living. It's doable. I don't need to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  make millions of dollars for anybody to be a success. The bar for being a success is fairly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  low and it's doable. It's kind of like, I mean, it's kind of what I'm doing too, right? We're an  inspiration. Yeah, the TV left me, so I started my own little TV station. I love it.  Dwight Silverman is still an ink-stained wretch at the Houston Chronicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm mostly on the web, so I don't have as much ink on me as I used to.  There's no ink from the web, huh? No, there's a little grease and a few  leftover bits, but other than that. I love it. And you and Harry are my heroes. I love that people  can strike out on their own and make it. And someday I may end up doing that. We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We all do it really. I mean, I think that ultimately that's the future is you have this brand  around yourself and you come and you offer that. That's what you offer of value. It's always been  what you've offered of value, but now I think the individual is a little bit more valued than it  used to be thanks to the internet. I think that's really great. I think it's really great. Well,  thanks all of you for being here. Folks, I want to mention a concert that I'm going to go to on  Memorial Day. It's a charitable event. It's May 25th in San Francisco. It's called Let the Sunshine  In. It benefits Christopher Rodriguez and the scholarship fund of the San Francisco  Conservatory of Music.
