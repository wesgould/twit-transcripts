And I'm passionate  about technology as we all are here in this studio, in this show, in the audience. But I  wanted a place to embrace my other passions as well, which is outdoors and stand up paddle  boarding and music. And I think as people, you know, we are all passionate about various  things. And I wanted a community that that was able to embrace everything and be comfortable  being ourselves. Fun. I'm thrilled about this. And so go to geeks life dot com. And then

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we should explain. I've known Luria for many years, more than 10. And I knew all along, I  think most people, maybe most people did that. Your real name is Luria Petrucci. Callie Lewis  was a creation and invention. Well, the name itself was kind of just an alias because for

Start time: 274.92
End time: 287.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  whatever reason, I thought early on when I started this whole video thing online that  people had butchered my name my entire life and I thought, well, maybe I need more of an  American name. And you were but it was also a spy, right? You were like a there was like a

Start time: 289.92
End time: 294.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  character that was a spy. And yeah, it was like I was like the head of the geek intelligence

Start time: 294.94
End time: 342.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  agency and some silly for backstory to this whole thing when I first started doing shows  online. And, you know, that was that was just kind of creation. You know, I was like, I'm  sure I'll see you later. I'm sure I'll get something for you guys. And so we kind of  just pretty much started doing shows online. And, you know, that was that was just kind of  creation. Yeah. But with this eventually when you do stuff like that, it sometimes sticks.  And what? Yeah, I know. Right. It's it's stuck. And I didn't really intend it to. And I didn't  know that this would all turn into what it has. And I realized over the last year that I  want to embrace me for who I am. And I want people to be embracing of themselves and,  you know, some stuff in my personal life with I found love. And that helped me learn to

Start time: 343.26
End time: 400.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just be comfortable with me. OK, well, I'm going to talk about the love stuff in a second,  but I'm glad to hear that. But I remember going through that same thing because when I  got in radio, you could you were I for some I had the same notion. Oh, you're not supposed to  use your real name. So I was I was Dan Dave. I don't remember anymore. Dave Allen. And then  I was Dan Hayes. Wow. And then and then John Smith. Yeah, practically. It wasn't until I  started working in San Francisco that my program director, I said, could I use my real name?  He said, what's your real name? I said, Leo Laporte. He said, you cannot use that. So he  said, well, it's spelled like Leo. He said, use that. So I had to go through very much what you're  going through in my own mind. Nobody ever heard of me. So it wasn't the same issue that you have  of people saying, well, who's Luria? So from now on, everybody is watching. We're going to call you

Start time: 401.70
End time: 441.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Luria. This is the name. This is her name. And, you know, it was a scary thing for me to kind of  start to embrace that just because because of nine years, you know, and a lot of people have told  me nine years worth of Callie Lewis brand equity. But the audience, I actually was a complete  mistake to really switch over to it because I just did a behind the scenes video when I opened up  Geeks Life and it was just kind of talking heart to heart conversation with the audience. And I  used my real name and said, you might know me as Callie Lewis. And then from then on, everybody was  like, you're using your real name. You have to love it. I love your real name. I was like, OK,

End time: 496.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, congratulations on the new venture. Congratulations on going back to your real name.  I've always thought of you as Luria. So I'm going to call you Luria. No, I appreciate that. It's  really great. Really great to have all three of you. Happy Easter. I appreciate your working on  on a holiday. But the tech news goes on. Strangely, always Friday. We're going to be able to buy or at  least order Apple Watches 1201 according to some anyway. I don't know if Apple's announced this yet.  Twelve oh one Pacific a.m. on Friday, April 10th. Are you going to get in? Patrick, you don't look  like you're going to get in. You don't look like an Apple Watch. Where I haven't worn a watch. I

Start time: 499.64
End time: 575.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  started working at magazines. They don't know. Actually, it's funny. Everybody's I usually am on the  last on all the smartwatches I've tried. Usually the second to last or last band sort of notch will  fit me. I never noticed this, but you have massive risks. I have massive risks. I've no if I was I  could be a heavyweight boxer if I wanted to be because I actually have the frame to support the  punch. Right. You never noticed that. It's it's most people don't really look at my bone structure,  Leo. That's OK. But it's funny. I mean, you mentioned that right, because I don't wear when I  started typing for a living at magazines a thousand years ago, I realized I had wrist pain and I took  the watch off and the wrist pain went away. So I stopped wearing watches and went back to using pocket watches.  Yeah. And then I started carrying a phone and I stopped carrying a pocket watch. And now I need to  test the Apple watch. And I'm kind of like, oh, you know, I'm going to show you like, OK, I can get the  three hundred fifty dollar one. I'm going to shatter the screen. I'm not going to be able to replace the  screen. And then I'm going to be really pissed off because the Apple care is astonishing. Watching the  way they're they're they're introducing this is so interesting, even for an Apple product. So I think  one of the first stores you had up on the list today was like Apple care plus. OK, I can afford the  Apple care plus for the sport watch, but a thousand dollars for the edition watch.

Start time: 576.12
End time: 591.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you spend ten thousand dollars for a watch, it's only ten percent. Oh, OK. That's much more.  That's nothing. You know, I haven't. In fact, it's ten percent across the kind of across the board.  Seventy nine dollars for the so stainless steel and fifty nine dollars for the aluminum. If you do the

Start time: 592.16
End time: 615.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  last two cars I bought plus the my computer plus, I don't know, all the clothes I bought in last year,  I still wouldn't have enough money to buy the edition version of the Apple watch. Oh, I know. So it's  it's I'm I'm I'm you know, go Apple, go for that luxury thing. But yeah, OK. So fifty nine dollars for the  sport I can afford. I'm really curious to see how the screen on the sport holds up. I'm curious how

Start time: 616.28
End time: 633.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple. Well, I shouldn't even say how they can get away with this because Apple care doesn't replace  the watch. Apple care is is extended warranty support.  Well, it should be exactly the same for all three because they're technically exactly the same.

Start time: 634.82
End time: 641.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but if you have to replace certain parts of the but the inside of the gold is the same.

Start time: 642.90
End time: 675.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, but the bezel is not the same. The band is not the same. The case is not the same.  So, yeah, I mean, it's kind of a joke that you're paying ten thousand dollars to get the same interface in a  really shiny band. But I mean, also, I mean, I cracked I they didn't have any cases in stock when I bought my  iPhone six. So within seven days, I had cracked the screen and bent the case.  You should get Apple care. And I did. And I was able to replace it was ninety nine dollars to replace the phone  after I bought the Apple care was in a really expensive week. Actually, it doesn't happen.

Start time: 676.06
End time: 686.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple care. OK, so there's Apple care, which is just an extended warranty. Plus does have a replacement.  I never buy it because it's if you figure it out between the deductible and the limits, it usually is kind of

Start time: 687.64
End time: 704.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  expensive. Yeah. Well, in the case of like, I guess it's the with the Apple care plus on an iPhone for the  iPhone six, it was cheaper to do the Apple care plus plus the charge for the screen replacement, which is  basically they swap your phone than it was to buy a replacement screen anywhere. It's like two hundred bucks.

Start time: 705.00
End time: 721.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get two hundred bucks for the deductible and you can only do it. Here's what was my here's my issue.  You only get two a year. So anyway, I just sell. I usually don't buy extended warranties.  Will you get a replacement addition for nine ninety nine? Mark German says it's not clear.

Start time: 723.86
End time: 726.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I think there'd be like a concierge service. Yeah.

Start time: 727.66
End time: 731.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they'll come and they'll in white gloves bring you a new thing.

Start time: 731.96
End time: 753.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What would they. Go ahead. I'm just surprised that you still have to pay extra for insurance on the addition.  I was thinking that's such a high like that.  That's the most expensive single product that Apple's ever produced.  Like that should just be like a concierge service warranty built in because, you know, extra warranty at that price.  Why not? I don't understand the extra one thousand dollar charge.

Start time: 753.94
End time: 760.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The seventeen thousand dollars may be the most expensive, but ten thousand dollars with the Lisa cost.  So it is not the most expensive product ever.

Start time: 760.96
End time: 767.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, yeah, everything put together. Seventeen to I think some people even got it closer to twenty thousand.  You could get it with all the stuff. So insane.

Start time: 768.42
End time: 793.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you know that if you're going to pay, you know, ten thousand dollars for watch, you're just not going to care about that price for Apple.  You just won't. I mean, because it's going to be a it's just a it's just a fashion thing.  And that's the next coolest thing, you know.  So it's really although my main curiosity is how many they're limiting it to.  Have we ever heard a number on that? No, no.

Start time: 794.34
End time: 833.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the thing to watch Friday and I guess we'll just have to guess is how what how busy the Apple stores will be.  Will there be lines? I'm not going to go into an Apple store.  The way it works is you call ahead or you go online and you make an appointment for a 15 minute window in which you'll get to talk to the genius and try on the watches.  And they are encouraging people to do that. They want you.  And in fact, we talked, I guess it was last week with Christina Warren, who wants the sport with the pinkish white pink band.  And she says, but I'm not sure I have to try it on and see how it looks with my outfits before like a guy would worry about that.

Start time: 834.24
End time: 871.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But does it work with your outfits? First of all, I mean, look at me.  I mean, this is not I'm not particularly worried about things working with my own.  I wore a kilt for many years. Yes.  I mean, I obviously have my own distinct sense of fashion to be.  I don't know. Does this Apple watch make my shorts?  I mean, does this Apple watch make my ass look fat?  Let's just say it right there. No, but it's interesting.  I know people who own twenty five thousand dollars worth of watches and they have the one they wear when they're going into the serious business meetings and they have their bang around watch when they're doing sports and they have their everyday work watches.  And it's you know, it's great. But they're they're they're directing an entirely different community.

Start time: 871.92
End time: 893.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And we've talked about this a lot before.  But I agree with you, Callie. I'm sorry, Luria.  I'm sorry, Luria. I am interested in this will happen a few times.  Of course, I'm interested in, you know, Apple never reveals numbers, but I'm very interested in what kind of response to be because I feel like on the one hand, there's a lot of people who just don't wear watches who are not in the market for a watch under any circumstance.  They will be now.

Start time: 893.92
End time: 908.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what? I I have this I haven't been an Apple user.  My computers, yes. But my phone has I've been on Samsung, you know, Galaxy.  I'm on the note for the edge right now.

End time: 921.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And wait a minute. Did you buy the note for edge? Yes, you did. Yes. And I freaking love that phone. You do. Yes. But I use a regular note for I'm just curious about the edge because that's the edge.

Start time: 922.22
End time: 956.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought it was gimmicky actually at first, but now you like the way I do everything really and the way I move about my apps.  It's it's great. But I haven't been on an iPhone for many years and they have me wanting to go back to the app to the iPhone.  You kind of have to. Yep. I mean, that's pretty impressive for for that drag to happen, you know, and I've never I don't wear watches.  I don't wear jewelry. I don't wear any of that stuff. So I think that's pretty impressive for them to be able to continue to have that draw.

Start time: 958.14
End time: 963.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to have to wear carry an iPhone for a while, too, because I'm a I'm a note for user. I'm an Android person. Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 964.28
End time: 968.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although I have to say, I don't think I'll be wearing the pink watch. Since you say you found love.

Start time: 969.92
End time: 985.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me ask you if your loved one will be getting one, too, because a lot of the benefit of the Apple watch is like sending your heartbeat to your honey.  OK, that sounds so dorky. I'm sorry. Listen to this. Listen to this a little bit. This is always take you to friends.

Start time: 986.00
End time: 1007.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here you'll see the people you like to connect with most easier. You can add friends in the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.  This person has way too many friends. Simply turn the digital crowd. I have three friends, maybe.  From here, you can make a call or send a message. But or if your friend has an Apple watch, you'll see this icon, which means you can send a digital touch.

Start time: 1007.92
End time: 1013.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, if your friend has an Apple watch, you'll get this icon with a little finger. And now watch what she does.

End time: 1021.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tap the icon. You can draw a sketch. Oh, really? Your sketch will automatically be sent to your friend's watch where it will animate exactly as you drew it.

Start time: 1022.04
End time: 1026.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right now. Now, how much would you pay? OK, wait a minute. That's not all, though. Watch.

Start time: 1028.46
End time: 1034.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can also use your finger to send taps because your friend is wearing an Apple watch. They'll feel the same tap pattern on their wrist.

Start time: 1035.92
End time: 1050.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so Callie, with your honey, you set up a code. You say, if I tap three times, then I want to get the hell out of this party.  If I go knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, it means I love you. Right. Like you would set up tap code.

Start time: 1051.52
End time: 1058.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. I know salespeople who would buy this for the ability to just like reach over and tap, tap twice and then their manager would come out.

Start time: 1059.12
End time: 1071.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. You have to get one for your secretary. Watch, though. This is the one you're going to go for, Callie. What's your honey's name?  David. OK, imagine this. You're there wearing your pink eye watch. Right, of course.

Start time: 1072.06
End time: 1079.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can rest two fingers on the screen to send your heartbeat, which your friend will also feel. Now just wait and see if you receive something back.

Start time: 1081.10
End time: 1086.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 1107.02
End time: 1125.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just, I mean, that it's one of those things that to me seems really dorky and like so gimmicky.  But again, I thought the edge was a little gimmicky and it may become one of those things that you find uses for.  I'll just have to wait and see. I'm kind of surprised you found the edge useful. That's interesting.

Start time: 1126.40
End time: 1130.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just missed it out of hand. I thought I don't need a screen saver on the edge of my phone.

Start time: 1131.62
End time: 1156.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's not about the screen saver. It's about putting all your apps on the edge so that you don't have to click that home button to get to your next app.  I'm a multitask user. I'm a power user. I go back and forth between my apps like a fiend chicken with a cut off.  So, you know, I'm constantly swiping over on the edge, clicking my next one, swiping over, click, click, click.  You know, it's become a dock. It's like the dock for you. Exactly. It's interesting.

Start time: 1157.68
End time: 1169.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I've ordered and I get it. I think I get it on Tuesday, the S6 edge. But it's not the same. It's just cosmetic.  It doesn't do all the stuff on the sides that your Note 4 edge does. Yeah. So that's dumb, right?

Start time: 1170.16
End time: 1174.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It has some features, right? It has like a I think there's you can see some notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a night clock mode, but you have to put it face down, which I'm not going to put my glass screen face down.

Start time: 1183.74
End time: 1216.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Divinder, have you played with the S6 yet? Yes, I've played with the S6 and the S6 edge.  We reviewed it over in Gadget and the S6 edge feels so great.  It's kind of weird because I actually didn't like the way the Note 4 edge felt because that one's kind of asymmetrical because the edge is only on one side.  It kind of makes the phone a little bigger than it needs to be or a little wider.  But the S6 edge just feels great. And I am halfway tempted to just like, I don't know, maybe figure out a way to send my iPhone 6 back and kind of swap.  But I do have a T-Mobile plan, so maybe I'll try that. But it's very it feels very, very nice.

Start time: 1217.04
End time: 1244.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A couple of things. I'm holding that. Yeah. I'm interested in the camera. People are starting to early review units went out.  You had one. And one thing most reviewers seem to say, I can't remember what the Engadget reviewer said, is don't get the edge because it's just goofy.  And for 100 bucks less, you get all the benefits of it. And it does look like an iPhone 6. I mean, it really is beautiful.  But I got the edge because I'm kind of a stylish guy in case you haven't noticed.

Start time: 1245.52
End time: 1267.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It feels it feels almost like you're touching a gadget that's a little more advanced, even though it's exactly the same thing as the S6.  So I think that appeal. I'd spend 100 bucks more for that. And honestly, after holding that, the iPhone 6 feels not as I don't know, not as exciting to me.  So that's just maybe I'm just being like the guy who wants the newest, hottest, greatest thing. But that's surprising.

Transcript:  Well, that's and that's what I was going to say. For everything else, it's fine.  But the screen's not great either. But the camera is useless. And I have to say more and more, I'm not even I think I'm not alone on this.  I don't even consider a phone unless it has a good camera. The iPhone has a great camera.  The Note 4 has a great camera. But I'm starting to hear raves about the S6 like best camera ever.  And of course, in the Samsung demo, they showed low light. It's F. What is it? F1.8? It's a very fast lens.

Start time: 1321.22
End time: 1337.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Short number. Yeah. I mean, the S5's camera was pretty good. I thought that was the best Android camera we got till now.  But it seems like the S6 may be even better than what the iPhone 6 has been doing.  And surprising too, because there aren't that many great Android cameras out there. It seems like Samsung's the only one who could do it.

Transcript:  Right. And part of it part of it's a scale. I got to sit at a table with a developer that's worked on some of the the guts of the Android operating system.  And he said when it was put together, they hadn't really thought about cameras as being that important for the mobile experience.  And by the time they realized that it was a big deal, they they nobody could buy like, you know, Apple had basically sewn up all of the new sensors and all of the new technology and was a couple of years ahead.  And, you know, their code was a mess. And finally, we've gotten to the point where the internal core is allowing them to do is not doing terrible things to the photographic images and allowing raw access.  And, you know, it takes somebody the size of Samsung to compete on a scale with Apple to get the latest sensors and the best technology in there.  So I think hopefully Android photography is turning a very big corner.  I just wonder how long it's going to take to get it down through the less expensive phones, too.

Transcript:  Yeah. So I just feel bad for HTC, right? Because this is the second year with the one M9.  And like the second year, they have a subpar camera in their flagship phone.  That's kind of tough to convince somebody to go for the one now with what the S6 is doing.

Start time: 1402.92
End time: 1446.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and reviews are terrible for the M9 camera, even though it's 21 megapixel.  And a number of people pointed out that the SOC, the system on a chip that they're using, which I'm sure is the 810, the Qualcomm 810,  they're they're they're clocking down to to prefer to increase battery life.  And so the performance is apparently not very good on this. And heat issues, too, I think. And lots of heat issues.  So, yeah, I think HTC, you can't afford to stumble when you're in this right.  This literally this foot race with Samsung. Well, not literally this figurative foot metaphorical metaphorical foot race with Samsung, Apple.  And, you know, you stumble your BlackBerry. Right. You stumble your AMD or AMD.

And Kelly, I got to ask you about the note for edge because the thing I didn't like about it was it was upside down.  Remember, they said that you were going to be able to put it on a table and then the edge you would be able to see notifications.  Right. Surreptitiously, except they're all upside down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that I haven't used it quite like that and I haven't figured out how to flip it.  So it wasn't just me. That's not no, that's not just you.  I had the same kind of question. I was like, that's fine if you can read upside down.  But well, I think if you if you kind of place it as opposed to so this is the edge, right?  So as opposed to leaving it like this and, you know, kind of reading it from this side, right?  You leave it like this. Oh, and you lean over it and read it.  You kind of you kind of leave it in a position where you can kind of see it from that angle.  So to be honest, I the one thing that I did that I haven't figured out and maybe I'm incorrect.  But when you have it up, it doesn't actually I haven't gotten it to like show my notifications without hitting the activate button.  That worries me a little bit. Yeah.  Yeah. So that that was one of the things I was looking forward to when a notification would come through.  It doesn't actually pop up on that screen without the whole thing activating.

Transcript:  Lots to talk about.  But we're going to take a break right now and talk about something Luria needs to know more about Squarespace.  If your website's been going down a lot, Squarespace is the easiest and best way to create a beautiful website, whether it's a blog, your photography portfolio, your online store.  Just gorgeous, elegant interface.  They've got beautiful templates.  And the thing and I've really learned a lot about this going through our own web redesign process.  The thing about these templates is you may not see it, but under the hood, there's a lot of sophisticated technology that makes these modern templates that are unique.  I mean, no one else is. For instance, they're all mobile responsive.  In fact, when you use Squarespace and you post an image on it, it automatically generates seven or eight different images of different sizes.  So it fits the screen that it's going to be on from an iPhone to a 30 inch to a well to a 55 inch HDTV.  They they make it so easy now with Squarespace seven to make changes to no more going back and forth from preview mode.  Changes are live. You see them. You see what it looks like.  It really is wonderful.  And boy, is it easy. And of course, if you have any issues, they've got the best help in the world.  Live chat and email support 24 seven, not outsourced from Squarespace in New York.  All of this just starts at eight dollars a month.  That's the hosting. That's the software.  That's even the domain name when you register for a year and when you pay for a year.  All Squarespace websites look great.  They all have e-commerce. Every single one of them that come with a with a free online store.  Lots of support to and shipping and calculations for taxes.  All of that's built in. They have this new feature called cover pages.  Very useful if you want like a one off page.  Could be your you know, your about me page, but also a great landing page for a new product or let's say a new podcast, a new show.  Podcasts love Squarespace because it just never goes down.  I want you to start a trial. You do not need to give them a credit card.  You just need to go to Squarespace dot com. Click the get started button.  You get a couple of weeks. You can import data from your old site.  You can really get a sense. Change the templates at willy nilly.  That's the beauty of it's all separate from the data.  So you just press a button. You get a whole new look.  But when you decide to buy, I ask you to use the offer code twit.  That gives you 10 percent off your first purchase.  And that's why you're going to want to sign up for a year or more.  Ten percent off your first purchase. Squarespace dot com.  Squarespace built it beautiful at Squarespace dot com.

Transcript:  No, it was the founding of Microsoft.  Microsoft is middle aged officially.  Economist magazine had a very interesting look back that begins with the F word right at the beginning there.  So just a little word of warning. You might not want to put it into a sixth grade class.  Actually, I should I should read the quote because it's really good.  Let me see if I can pull it up here.  I don't know why I don't have it up on my screen.  Microsoft at middle age is the name of the article.  Of course, let's get an ad out of the way.  I love you, Economist. I really do.  Going to pay for you.  This is the quote, and I will not read the word aloud, but those of you who are watching video can see it.  Quote, what are you on the F Windows strategy?  End quote.  Back in the late 1990s when Bill Gates was still Microsoft's boss,  any employee who had the temerity to suggest something that could possibly weaken the firm's flagship operating system was sure to earn his wrath.  The F Windows strategy was actually a phrase used at Microsoft.  Everything Microsoft did had to strengthen Windows, make it ever more crushingly dominant.  Most of or many of the company's best innovations were killed.  They call it internally a strategy tax.  You protect Windows at all cost, even if it means killing great products.  Steve Ballmer succeeded Bill Gates, Satya Nadella, now the CEO, completely changed the company.  He recoils when he hears the term strategy tax, according to the Economist,  and says he now tells his staff simply to build stuff people like.  Wow.  That's not the Microsoft.  Yes.  Wow.  But it's true.  It's not Windows first anymore.  In fact, remember that Microsoft released the touch first versions of Office, not on not on Windows phone or Windows, but on on iPad first.  In fact, it's still not available on Windows phone.  I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's unheard of.  But what Nadella has said is that Microsoft software will always work best.  The best experience will always be on Windows.  But he says we want to be where customers are.  I submit that what Microsoft's going through is just the way the tech industry is.  They grew up and we thank them in a world where the desktop operating system and desktop software was king.  Bill Gates saw very early on in 1975 that there would be two parallel developments, hardware, chips and software.  Without software, hardware doesn't do anything.  And by making a stable platform that was good for programmers, they really, I think, jump started the PC revolution.  But we've moved away from desktop computers.  What are those?

Start time: 2159.22
End time: 2166.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if it's moved away so much as the mobile market has exploded in a way that Windows was entirely unready to capitalize upon.

Transcript:  They've been struggling for a while as we've all seen.  But I'm liking where they're going.  I do too.  You know, right now I think they're finally kind of growing into the space again and finding their way, which all companies have to do.  Apple did it.  Even though we, you know, praise them for being such a great company right now.  They had their struggles.  And so all companies are going to go through this ebb and flow.  And I think Microsoft is hitting it on the head or at least beginning to.

Start time: 2210.32
End time: 2236.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I feel like we could look back to this whole strategy tax thing in the 90s for Microsoft, right?  Because they were Gates was even slow to warm up to the Internet, right?  And to the idea of the Internet and the possibilities of it.  And that like that mentality kind of followed them through the odds.  And then that allowed Google to like rise up and Apple to do a lot more stuff as well.  So I feel like they're paying for a lot of these ignoring strategies so much in the 90s.  They're still paying for it today.

Microsoft is a bunch of little units pointing guns at one another.  I love this cartoon so much because it's actually right on, right?  But this is that's the old Microsoft.  And the question, of course, is whether Microsoft has made enough changes to survive.  You know, it's tough.  I feel that there's a natural business cycle.  There always has been.  And for tech companies, it's just very quick.  Forty years is a long time.  Yeah.

And all of a sudden, you know, it became like, boy, uh-oh.

You know, I remember Steve Jobs saying that we had such a lead in 1984 when the Mac came out,  but when we coasted for 10 years and Microsoft caught up with Windows by Windows 3.1.  I could...  Well, yeah, Steve said Windows 3, actually.  I updated it to Windows 3.1.  Wow.  That's pretty generous on Steve's part.  Well, this was back in 1994.  Oh, I was there.  There weren't enough choices.

Transcript:  Actually, as long as you're talking 40th birthday, it's interesting to think of how Microsoft fumbled it.  And that's how...  I mean, how IBM fumbled it and gave Microsoft the opening.  Had IBM been more protective of their hardware, they built a computer that anybody could build, basically.  The only thing you had to figure out was BIOS.  Yeah, and if Bill Gates hadn't been raised by lawyers, Bill Gates was smart enough to say to IBM, I'll send you...  First of all, he didn't have a DOS.  He went across the street and bought Seattle DOS.  So that was one cagey thing when IBM came to him and said, we need a CPM for a new computer.  Do you have one?  Bill said, yeah.  And then he quickly ran across the street and bought it.  But he also made a great deal saying, but we'll give you non-exclusive rights to sell it.  And IBM said, well, no one's going to make a PC, so okay, that should be all right.

And then Obama signing the executive order imposing sanctions on overseas hackers was released on April 1st.  It was a weird day for April 1st.  That was real too.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Well, it's weird.  But if you go to the bottom of the page for this where it gets really interesting on the Amazon Dash page and you scroll all the way to the bottom of that page.  So this is basically a button.

Start time: 3083.24
End time: 3093.92

Click on the makers and innovators.  There's an API?  That's where it gets interesting.  So the downside is so there if you scroll up, you're going to see where companies that this fall like, you know, OK, Whirlpool, you're going to be able to automatically have to build it into your washing machine or your Brita filter to order more filters.  And I was really disappointed because the quirky coffee machine looks so good.  But I've bought a bunch of quirky products and not a single one has shipped with firmware that was feature complete.  And while I can kind of tolerate that on some weird, you know, temperature sensor in my house, I'm not ready to have a vicious coffee experience because quirky can't finish the firmware before they ship a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this isn't like not an API, but it's an it's something that other companies for plenty of management service build our stuff into your product and we will help deliver the stuff that makes you more money.  There's probably a vague for the coffee brands.  There's obviously brothers going to make money hand over fist on ink or toner or whatever it is.

Because you don't you can get an estimate for your ride in Uber, but if you're sitting there, you have no idea how much you're being charged.  If you're sitting in traffic for a while, you don't know if that estimate all of a sudden you're going to be paying 10 or 20 bucks more.  And it's weird that we're getting used to this world where, oh, just pay just whatever.  Just get me the thing.  I don't the cost doesn't matter.  And the button, these buttons seem to kind of be pushing that even more forward.

So to some degree, merely moving from physical money to a debit card automatically puts a huge layer of abstraction on the human mind between what spending is.  Right.

But I'm sure Patrick will school me on why it's not.  I don't know.  First a word from Carbonite online backup.  We were talking about the cloud.  There are so many uses for the cloud.  There's no better use, if you ask me, for the cloud than backup.  The cloud-based backup is such a great idea because it gets your data off site.  And of course, Carbonite has trust no one encryption.  They have absolutely safe policies about protecting your.  It's HIPAA compliant if used properly.  But the point is, if the data is backed up somewhere next to your computer, it's still at risk.  Fire, flood, human error.  Once you get it on the Carbonite cloud, it's safe.

I'm not saying they don't.  This is just one.  You know, what I thought was interesting is Obama actually wrote about this on Medium.  He published an article on Medium explaining this, which I think is it tells you something about who he's aiming, who he needs to do the PR with.  It's people like you.  It's it's the techno elite who might be worried about this.  I think the problem is how do you take arm against hackers that are outside the US soil?  I mean, what do you do?  How do I mean, do you escalate cyber warfare?  Because that's probably not the answer.  But on the other hand, we need to defend ourselves.

And I think it's going to be really interesting to see what the reaction of the sort of hacker community is to this, because a bunch of the stuff that's been put in place could easily block white hat activities or pen testing activities.  There's been interpreted in ways that people who make their living making networks more secure or researching ways to make networks more secure because a company simply going like there are no holes in our product is not actually security.  It's denial and denial actually isn't very effective in the long run.  But I think it's going to be curious to see how this is used and and and kind of what the response is moving forward.  It's been an interesting few weeks in Washington for technology to to kind of be understated.  It's a challenging problem.

I mean, you can tell Sony, well, you got to tighten up your security.  Obviously, they did a bad job of that.  But you have Iranian hackers upset with the Sands Casino because they're owned by Shelly Adelson, who gives money to Israel, breaking in and totally hacking.  I got to figure the Sands if anybody has good security, it's a casino back end operation, back house operation.  They broke in. You have the Lizard Squad bringing down Microsoft, Xbox and PlayStation Live all day Christmas Day using our routers,  because apparently so many routers are so full of bugs and exploits.

Transcript:  I mean, and that's also why people are so up in arms about the whole idea of the Internet of Things, because the Internet of Things is kind of an even less kind of well looked at corner.  You look at routers, for example, most routers, there's a chipset, there's a set of software that comes with the chip chipset.  Most router vendors, right, you know, they're going to throw an interface on it.  They're going to walk away and never come back.  I might do an update, right. But I remember like that's one of the reasons why the open source community has been so valuable for routers,  because in many cases there's either been like one update, you know, a few months after routers released and it's never been updated,  which means they never may have patched inherent flaws in the code that came from the factory because they take the factory code, they skin it and then they walk away from it.  And the Internet of Things promises to be even worse, because in many cases, by the time you have like this chip that goes into this thing and it's got, you know,  it just it's amazing how many holes are being created. Let's just put everything on the Internet and cross our fingers.

I think we did this on the screensavers. Maybe not.  But putting DDW RT on a Linksys 54. Yeah. WRT. Yeah.  So Asus actually now ships routers with support for DDW RT. They do their own, I think, weird version of DDW RT on here.  But you can then upgrade it. It's called Asus WRT. But then you can upgrade it to the full open source.  But that's one way to handle this is to say, OK, we'll put our own firmware on here, but we'll make it possible for the open source community to do something.

And it's it's it gets really rancorous because the people who are developing these like I'm assuming that at this point  that they've worked closely with the community and please don't roast me online if if this is not true.  But but it was interesting like when Linksys said they were going to have I want to say open WRT and the open WRT community was like what?  And there was this like two month cycle as they kind of worked everything out. But I think it's good.  I think it's smart because it allows people buying a two hundred fifty dollar router.  This kind of like two categories. They're like, hey, it's two hundred fifty dollars. It's going to make my stuff faster, which isn't probably true,  depending on some areas of you know, I mean, if you've got 802 11 B or 802 11 G, you know, this multizillion dollar router is not going to make a lot of things better.  But there's the other side of the people that are spending as much money on the router who are demanding performance and will take the time to set it up and configure it and are thrilled at the idea of having a big fat open source operating system available.

And I just imagine one day like a huge hack on an entire neighborhood and we give, give, give so much of our privacy and our and our security away just in an effort to get so such cool tech that I think it'll come to a head and the bubble will burst.  And eventually we're going to have to really start in mass paying attention to security.  But I'm not I'm not sure that that people are really putting their efforts into it as much as they should.

Those are pretty benign. OK. But they're but these are well known hacks that have been going on for a long time.  I can remember the brand that was particularly vulnerable.

This jerk who had a revenge porn site, Christopher Kevin Christopher Ballard of San Diego.  He was this guy was so evil that he was soliciting pictures of ex-girlfriends,  then going to the ex-girlfriend saying, if you give me three hundred bucks, I won't post this.  So he was both at a revenge porn site and was extorting people, putting people's names up,  found guilty in February, glad to say on six counts of extortion,  twenty one counts of identity theft for running a website that posted nude photos of individuals  as well as identifying information without their consent.  Eighteen years in the slammer. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy. Eighteen years.  I think he didn't expect that. It looks like he didn't expect that.  Eighteen years in the slammer. Nice, huh? Nice.

Out of all of this live streaming, including the live streaming that we do here with the chat room and all that.  He said, well, that's really Kevin's a little I think it's too smart.  That really is all about just the ego of the person streaming because it's useless for viewers.  They want to watch it on demand.  They don't want to watch it when you're doing it.

And the thing with on demand is just like TV, you don't get to interact with the host.  And that's what this world today of the Internet provides us is that that one on one and the ability to feel like we are friends  and not just feel like but we are friends with with the audience.  And and so you've got to have that combination of on demand and live.

And every time I've gone to try to watch a meerkat, it's always I always get the message that the stream is over.  So you need both. But I mean, you guys kind of proved, Leo, that having that live streaming interaction, that's been important for the growth of all of your shows.  Like when I started doing a movie podcast, we did it live, too, when we were recording because it was great to have that audience interaction.  There's a lot more to it than just, you know, you being a narcissist, like, yeah, narcissistic.  There's that, too. I mean, you really want us to see you eat bacon, Leo.  Lick that bacon.

We didn't even have a seven second delay.  So if we screwed up, everybody watching got to share in the fun and see it over and over again in reruns.  I mean, I think it's the other thing that's been interesting is watching this whole, you know, what's wrong with tech journalism backlash?  Because everybody talks about Meerkat, the Meerkat raised a bunch of last minute funding and then Periscope shows up.  And now people are arguing over whether or not Periscope has completely crushed Meerkat or not.  I mean, it's I mean, you guys probably know more of her engagement than I would, but it's interesting to watch kind of the reaction,  sort of the meta reaction to technology coverage and how excited people were about Meerkat till they weren't.  Or am I just sort of so far outside of this?  I can't even see what's going on.

And Meerkat, I think Meerkat just benefited from a lot of that hype early on.  I don't think that means tech journalists are kind of dying or aren't doing their job.  But I do think it means we kind of have to wake up and think more about what this tech means for normal people.  When Meerkat, you know, was in its heyday for that one week or that weekend, it was all just tech people talking to tech people.  And that's the sort of thing that bugs me because you get to talk to normal people to really see what's going on.

Transcript:  Yeah. Both Meerkat and Periscope say they are doing Android.  We actually interviewed the founder of Meerkat on triangulation a week ago, Ben Rubin, and he was very smart.  He's not a dumb fella.  And I thought he had some insight.  He said, really, this is a very vertical niche, this idea of live streaming.  But it's ephemeral.  There's no saved version.  It's just one of many possible niches.  Periscope takes another niche.  They save it, but only for 24 hours.  YouTube Live, you could argue, takes the third niche, which saved forever.  And we do that.  We save it forever.  But we also edit it after the fact to tighten it up a little bit.  I think Meerkat's very interesting.

Plus, they seem to have found a UI that kind of, for one thing, it's portrait mode.  So it's natural to watch it on a portrait mode phone.  You get the live chat.

And they're the people who, you know, the lurkers who kind of sit back and read all the tweets.  But I love that feedback I get from Twitter, like all the notifications, everything,  unless I'm like talking about GamerGate or something.  But I love that feedback.  So it kind of makes sense for Meerkat.  But yeah, the better question is, why is it taking off now?  It didn't before.  I think the like social structure we have now with Twitter and everything,  that kind of allows for more of this content to get out there.  Because yeah, live streaming, Ustream has been around for a while.  Justin.TV was doing it for a long time before the whole Twitch thing.

Yeah, this is the article.  It's Tero Kuytinian, who may never again...  We're going to freeze his assets in the United States.  Meerkat is dying and it's taking U.S. tech journalism with it.  But you know what?  We talk about stuff not based on how many downloads it has,  but whether it's interesting, whether it's transformative,  whether the technology is meaningful,  not because it's the number one app on iTunes.  That's not what makes something of interest.  It's not a popularity contest.  Well, it shouldn't be.  Sometimes it is.  We've got a great panel.  I would just hang out with these guys all day if I could.  Well, I guess I will because it's Twitch.  We're here forever.  We're here for the rest of your life.

We're going to take a step back and we're going to grow more  organically and we're going to grow with a base that helps us  stay alive forever.  Because I want to do this forever.

I mean, 5 or 10% growth a year in the tech business is nothing.  But Callie Luria, to the point you made, failure, and this is  one of the things that really has spurred innovation in  Silicon Valley.  Failure is not in any way a black mark in this arena.

Ben Rubin, the Meerkat guy, actually Meerkat came out of the  failure of Yevo, which was a live streaming company they had  founded in Israel where they're from a couple of years ago.  And Yevo never gained ground.  So they said, oh, let's tear it all down.  And what we're going to do, and I thought this was interesting,  is we're going to do experiment after experiment.  This is what Kevin Rose did with Milk.  We're going to do experiment after experiment.  If something fails, we'll kill it fast and move on.  And it just happened that Meerkat was a quick hit.  But it could have been a failure and then they would have tried  something else.  And we're learning each time.  And I think that's exactly the way to look at it.  Exactly.

Transcript:  Okay, I was just a little over excited about that, I think.  Calm down a little bit.  I want to tell you a little bit about Audible.  I think we have done a lot for Audible over the last, I don't know, how many years have we been Audible fans.  I started on Audible in 2000 when I was still commuting to the screensavers.  Audible has been an advertiser on Twitter for probably seven years, seven or eight years, for a long time.  And I'll tell you what, I have a feeling that more than a few  devoted Audible listeners first found out about it here.  Audible is an audio bookstore with more than 150,000 titles.  All of the new books when they come out nowadays come out on Audible.  In fact, I'm listening to the Steve Jobs, the new Steve Jobs book, becoming Steve Jobs on Audible.  It's great.  I have to say, I was a little skeptical at first.  I'd heard these stories before.  There it is.  But as I've been listening, Brent Schlender and somebody else, Rick, somebody,  textile, poor Rick, he doesn't get any of the credit,  wrote, I think, probably the most insightful book about Steve,  both his genius and his flaws, I've read yet.  It's really interesting.  It's an Audible.  Tell you what, I got two books for you on Audible.  Audible is great because you can listen on your computer, you can listen on your phone.  They have Audible apps for everything.  They just updated their Windows Phone app.  It's really great.  iOS, Android, Windows 8.  I actually found out I could finally listen on a Chromebook.  I didn't even know this, but they have a player on the Audible site.  I've been listening on the Chromebook.  So I'm a happy camper.  Everywhere you go, of course, in the car is where I mostly listen,  but Audible is nice for any time where you can't hold a book, you can't read a book,  but you're doing something mindless that reading a book would be really fun,  like on the treadmill, walking the dog, doing the dishes, commuting.  My commute is not as long as it used to be,  but I listen to Audible every single day because Audible lifts you up.  It informs you, it entertains you,  and when you're listening to a great book on Audible, you are transported.  When you listen to some of the science fiction I've been listening to lately,  it just takes you to another world and time goes by,  and suddenly at the end of your commute you go,  I think I'm going to have to drive around the block a couple of times  because I've got to finish this chapter.  Dishes are washed magically.  So there's one book I've been listening to, the new Walter Isaacson book,  people say it's good, The Innovators.  Our friend John Slanina, Jammer B., our chat room, I'm sorry, our studio master here,  has recommended this, and I can't wait.  This is the Otherland series, which just made it to Audible,  Tad Williams' story of virtual reality and how it is both wonderful and challenging,  to say the least.  It's the Otherland series.  How many of them are there?  Four of them?  Book one I just downloaded, City of Gold and Shadow.  This sounds great.  I haven't started it yet, John, but I will soon.  Neil Gaiman's newest, Trigger Warning, just downloaded.  Let me see what else.  I've been really loving that Beatles biography.  I'm still listening to that.  It's like 800 hours.  Here's one if you like, The Princess Bride.  Kerry Elvis, who was the guy.  Dread pirate Roberts?  Dread pirate Roberts.  Wesley, he was Wesley.  Yeah, and later Dread pirate Roberts.

I've got a deal for you, son.  Here's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to get you two books absolutely free when you go to audible.com slash twit two.  That's audible.com slash twit and the number two.  You're going to be getting, signing up for the platinum plan.  That's the two books a month subscription.  That's the one I use.  You get two book credits per month.  Now, this is free for the first 30 days.  You'll also get the Daily Digest or the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times, which is really nice.  Keep you up to date on what's going on in the world.  You can cancel anytime in the first 30 days.  Pay nothing. Those books are yours forever.  You get to keep those forever.  I think this is a great deal.  If you maybe a little say, I don't know, am I going to enjoy listening to books compared to reading them?  Maybe not for everybody.  But all I can do is say, try it, because I'll tell you what changed my life forever.  And I know so many people who feel that way about audible.  Audible.com slash twit and the number two.  Google says 5% of visitors to its site, you know, when you go to Google.com, they're able to see kind of what's going on.  They do this study in conjunction with UC Berkeley.  5% of people visiting Google sites and services have an at least one ad injector installed.  Five. That's one in 20.  That's a lot.  That's that's millions, given the amount of traffic Google has.  So what is an ad? Would you explain maybe Patrick what an ad injector does?

And it was like, you know, I only you know, it's just this bizarre kind of shopping experience where there's lots of Tesla branded crap and then the car itself, which is obviously not crap.  But and then around the corner was a Microsoft store.  And there's all these like two hundred two hundred fifty dollar Microsoft laptops from major vendors that are incredibly usable.  And part of the reason they're they're creating these, you know, you know, their atom based processors that may or may not have a touch screen.  But despite the fact that their specs sound really tiny or make you think, oh, that book run away.  But because of the way Windows 8 is handling the memory and the fact that they've worked pretty hard on what they're doing inside these laptops, they're incredibly usable.  You know, what I want to do like 70 megabyte photos and Photoshop?  No. What I want to edit video on them? No.  For 80, 98 percent of what most people are doing, they'll work fine.  Yeah. Yeah.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.  Life saver for me, Luria, when I was back in Toronto doing Call for Help,  I had to invoice Rogers in Canadian every month.  Oh boy. I don't speak Canadian.  And then and then they wanted to expen- I bought the plane ticket in the hotels and they wanted me to expense it.  And it was annoying because I hated doing it, firing up Word or Excel or whatever and cranking out an invoice.  And so I put it off. And so I'd go months without getting paid.  And this was not fun, not to mention the fact that the bookkeepers at Rogers would say you cannot give us six months of invoices at the same time.  Why not? They don't like that.  So it was Amber McArthur who said maybe you should try FreshBooks.  She was right. FreshBooks was actually it was started in Toronto.  Nice bunch of folks. And boy, they saved my life. They made it easy.  They still do. Ten years later, there's still over five million users now.  Use FreshBooks to send out invoices, to save time billing, to keep track of time and hours, to automatically import receipts.  FreshBooks is built for the growing business, the freelancer or the small business that wants to get bigger.  On average, FreshBook customers double their revenue in the first 24 months.  And this is the one I like to get paid on average of five days faster.  I got paid on the average of six months faster. That's a big jump.  And they do, by the way, handle Canadian. You can do any currency, which is really, really convenient.  I can just go on and on. They've got great apps on Android and iOS.  You can actually use the apps to record time and hours.  It's so easy to bill. And when tax time comes, oh, man, your account is going to love you because these great reports make it very easy.  Try FreshBooks right now. No obligation. 30 days free.

Riff is an app we played with a little bit that lets you make a video and tag it.  And then others in your group can add to that video and more and more and more.  And we, Anthony, you were playing with it here. A lot of us here around were playing with it.  But I think it's dead already. It's like four days old.  It's like gone.

Transcript:  How about this? You're a parent, Patrick. You're the only parent.  I'm a parent, but my kids are grown.  The scrapbook that lets your kid have a Facebook presence.  Yeah.  You think that's a good idea?  Because my seven-year-old needs to be on Facebook.  Yeah, I don't think I'm going to do this either.  For the first time.

Start time: 7380.04
End time: 7399.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not a parent, but I think the scrapbook seems pretty cool for parents to be able to do that.  But they said that they were looking into figuring out how when a kid turns 13, they can take over that scrapbook.  Of course. Yes.  But no 13-year-old in the history of 13-year-olds is ever going to want their kid pictures, their baby pictures on their profile.

Start time: 7404.55
End time: 7411.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 7411.96
End time: 7431.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can opt to co-own the scrapbook with a partner with whom you are in a relationship on Facebook.  Facebook is like a nanny. Oh no, you're not in a relationship.  You can have a tag. You can choose what you call the tag, your child's name, initials, whatever you want, bozo, anything.  You and your partner choose which photos to tag. Only you and your partner can tag your child in photos.

Transcript:  I think this is just going to help guarantee an entire generation.  First of all, Facebook is already the place where you hang out when you have to talk to your relatives.  It's not where you hang out with your friends.

End time: 7457.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, another good example.  But again, it's just like guaranteeing that no one after a certain birthdate is going to hang out on Facebook  except to talk to their parents or deal with their aunts and uncles.

Transcript:  Did you use, you were at Ziff Davis when we were using Lotus Notes for email, right?  Yes.  Most painful period I can ever remember.  No. Lotus Notes was not the most painful period.

Start time: 7470.92
End time: 7484.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That wasn't fun though.  You liked Lotus Notes?  I had been using it for so long at that point it no longer bothered me.  It was the official email of Ziff Davis.  It was the official pain in my ass at Ziff Davis, but it was one of many.  But it predated widespread internet mail.

Start time: 7486.10
End time: 7589.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure.  It was company mail. It was group.  It was also created before the United States allowed you to export crypto that actually worked.  Oh yeah, because crypto is a munition.  Yeah.  So here's how they solved it at Lotus.  They got permission to export 64-bit crypto, which is pretty strong,  as long as the first 24 bits were the NSA's public key.  Then the NSA would only have, you know, what is it, 40 bits, which is nothing.  They could just, they could take an old 8088 and solve that one.  And everybody else would get a 64-bit key space that really, it wasn't really 64 bits.  So a fella has reverse engineered.  I love this.  Has reverse engineered it and has discovered the public key for the NSA that was in Lotus Notes.  Its name was Mini Truth.  The organizational name was Mini Truth.  And the common name was Big Brother.  You got the joke now, because the Ministry of Truth or Mini Truth in 1984 was what Big Brother kept an eye on people with.  At least it's got a sense of humor.  Or had.  He says, he says, I saw this in my debugger one late one night and it was spooky.  So there you go.  Even the NSA has a sense of humor.  Had.  Had a sense of humor.

He tweeted out on March 30th that there will be a mage speaking to Tesla, a major new.  They're going to have two things to have in the store now.  A major new Tesla product line, not a car.  April 30th they'll unveil it.  You think it's a Tesla plane?  No.  A Tesla hang glider?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a Voltron Tech Cat?  People speculate it's a battery.  Yeah, like a home battery.

Start time: 7654.94
End time: 7665.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  What would that mean?  That Tesla has a market to place all of the batteries they're making at the super center in Reno.  So basically you can store solar energy locally on your house.

Start time: 7668.06
End time: 7688.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, okay, so right now what you do, most people don't store solar energy, right?  You just sell it back to the power company.  So the solar panels just get stuffed back down the line in the grid and you get a credit on your bill.  But that doesn't give you self-sufficiency.  What you'd like is 300 lead acid batteries in your basement.

Start time: 7690.92
End time: 7712.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am really down with being off grid, but managing a whole collection of Rolls traction batteries, which requires like basically,  yeah, it's not if something goes wrong, it's if you do it right, it's probably not going to go wrong.  But if something goes wrong, it's a really bad scene.  But that's true of lithium ion too, right?  Yes. But either way, but you can, you know, the.

Start time: 7713.48
End time: 7718.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything that stores a lot of energy has the potential to suddenly release all that energy.

Start time: 7719.54
End time: 7735.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it gets much more in theory in speculating if there is a box I can bolt to my house that they have figured out how to keep from exploding when it gets rolled 17 times on the highway and runs into a bridge.  That's true. I probably don't have to worry about one of my sons hitting with a ball peen hammer.

Start time: 7736.30
End time: 7740.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Okay, so now I'm interested in this. This would be for solar power to store it.

Start time: 7741.36
End time: 7782.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the theory. And it would have a lot of capacity.  It could also be a watch. We won't know until the 30th.  It could be a gold plated Tesla. We won't know until the 30th.  But I like the idea that if they're going to build this giant battery factory in Reno, which is just down the street, it would be cool if they did something that would take this incredible potential.  Just having all these batteries and being able to drop the scale, because it's just incredibly inefficient.  If you have a global power grid, the idea of shipping power during the day from this part of the world that is underneath the sun to this part of the world that is dark is really, really cool.  But right now there's just no particularly effective way to store energy when the sun is not shining.

Start time: 7783.06
End time: 7824.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the only thing, by the way, that keeps me. We live in a place that would be great for solar power.  I get a lot of sun. I've got a roof that faces in the right direction.  Actually, somebody told me don't put them on the roof because you can't wash them off. You can't hose them off.  So put them somewhere where you can go to keep them clean. So I have actually a hillside that would also work.  Must be nice. They're on the roof or they're not going anywhere in my house. I'll just put a hose on a stick.  Get on the ladder, wash them off. But I want to store it. I don't want to just sell it back to the grid right away.  I want to have, because we're on well, if I could have the pump on the well work, then I could just put a big fence around the house.  I was going to say where's your zombie fence?  And then I could leave and I could just check in and never check out.

Start time: 7824.92
End time: 7834.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can do that now currently. You just have to have big banks of batteries and make sure those are maintained and taken care of in the controller system.

Transcript:  I think the bigger story here is the fact that he got any traction out of Twitter. Why aren't we talking about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we've seen it before. Who was it that he tweeted about his water?  Was it Jay-Z or somebody tweeted that and he made a billion dollars and he didn't even get into trouble.

Start time: 7854.50
End time: 7859.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

But what they did with Tokyo Drift in the fourth one the fifth one especially with  Justin Lin coming in and turning this series into like a comic book action movie franchise  kind of amazing what they did.

Transcript:  I think for the time being we're going to stick with our model because it works.  Fix it.  But I think that there are shows that would be probably well suited to that model.  We did it with OMG Craft.  We have a Minecraft show.  Chad Johnson did a great job.  He's got it on YouTube.  But it wasn't going to be a show that was going to do well on our network because frankly  the people who watch Twitter weren't really into Minecraft.  But he's done but he's taken it to Patreon and done great.  So we're really pleased with that and I think that that's a good model for the future.  Devendra, Patrick, Luria thank you so much.  It's been great doing the show with you.  Always fun to see you all again.  Please come back soon.  Thank you.  Thanks, Leo.  Always blessed.  Easter is even Easter we do Twitter.  Every Sunday afternoon 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.  That's 2200 UTC.  Please stop by.  We'd love it if you would watch live because that interactivity is great for my ego.  It also helps us respond to your questions and thoughts.  But if you can't watch live, I understand we do of course make on demand versions of all  our shows available at twit.tv.  That's our website.  Or everywhere you can get podcasts including, and I know most of you do this now, the podcast  app of whatever stripe on your mobile device.  We also have twit apps.  We didn't do them.  Great third party twit apps on every platform including iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Roku.  Please, whatever app you prefer to use, check it out and download one of those great apps.  Those folks do a good job of those apps.  Thanks for joining us.  If you want to be in studio, as I mentioned, we're being a little stricter about in studio.  It'd be good if you just didn't wander in.  We'd like you to email tickets at twit.tv.  It does a couple of things.  Make sure we have enough room for you.  We put a chair for you.  We have a nice bagel under your seat.  No, don't look under your seat.  There's no bagel.  But we do love it if you're here.  Tickets at twit.tv.  Let us know.  We are, I should say, sold out for the April 19th show, our 10th anniversary show.  More than full.  In fact, what we've done is we've created a waiting list.  So if you had asked for tickets for our 10th anniversary show on April 19th and you know you can't make it, please let us know.  Just email tickets at twit.tv so that we can release your seat or seats to somebody who's on the waiting list.  We're actually waiting listing people now because we just, the fire marshal won't let us put a million people in here.  It's going to be fun.  We're getting custom director's chairs made.  Really?  For everybody.  Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton, David Prager, Robert Heron.  John C. Dvorak.  It's going to be the panelists that were on the first few episodes of twit.  Roger Chang.
