Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I see.  I see.  Is that where you got that shirt?  No.  You get that shirt at Walmart?

Start time: 160.81
End time: 165.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Because I'm usually shopping at Walmart.  Over in Oakland.  Yeah, in Oakland.

Start time: 165.76
End time: 200.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that off the 280 or the 880?  You seem to know where it is.  Yeah, it's right near the in and out.  This is twit.  And this week, we've got a lot of announcements coming.  I wanted to give a little peek into the week ahead.  Mobile World Congress is kicking off in Barcelona right now.  Actually, there have been press announcements already today from Samsung, Sony and Nokia.  Tomorrow, LG is expected to announce their 3D smartphone.  That'll be a 2 a.m. Pacific if you'd like to get up and and and see.  Does anybody need a 3D smartphone?  That's just gimmicky.

Start time: 200.80
End time: 204.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought all those phones were 3D.  I mean, I've never seen one a two dimensional.

Start time: 204.90
End time: 215.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that new Samsung Galaxy S2 is very thin.  So maybe it's maybe they're thinking that I'm trying to play off that.  Also Microsoft Steve Ballmer will be speaking at Mobile World Congress.  That'll be at 7 a.m.

Start time: 215.92
End time: 218.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's trying to explain away the Nokia deal.

Start time: 218.58
End time: 233.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Nokia had their shot at it today.  So it's a one to punch.  Non Mobile World Congress news Monday through Wednesday this week is when IBM's Watson takes  on the Jeopardy champ champs.

Start time: 234.27
End time: 234.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 234.92
End time: 242.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, great.  So this is the computer versus man trivia contest.  It's going to be a bloodbath.  Watson's going to kill, right?

Start time: 242.80
End time: 286.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think you could jam a nut.  Well, you know, if they did it right, because I don't know if you've known anyone who's  ever been on the Jeopardy show, but I've known two people.  I have known one person.  And they tell you ask them about it.  Before you go on the show, they kind of first find out what your interests are.  So they're not going to ask you strange things about, you know, Greek history.  And then they kind of talk about kinds of general things that everyone should kind of  know about.  So they kind of give you a hint as to what direction the show is.  They don't give you the answers or questions, but they kind of let you know kind of where  it's going.  So if they do that with the Watson to make things fair, in other words, tell the computer  what they're going to talk about, the computer can load up with every trivia about whatever.  And there's no way that you can beat the computer in that regard.

Start time: 286.46
End time: 303.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a feeling they're not going to do it that way.  I bet they'll probably just ask a lot of generalized questions.  And then the computer just knows so much off the top.  It's more about the way they ask the questions.  It has to kind of parse the English and try to figure it out.  Because a lot of the questions are like riddles, right?  They're not just straight questions or straight questions about history.

Start time: 303.72
End time: 322.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or there's a rhyme involved.  And I hope that the computer fails to answer the question in the form of a question.  That would be great.  Sorry, I wasn't, but you did not answer.  And then the computer would go, what?  I don't know what you're talking about.  And it would do the one small programming error.  Syntax error.

Start time: 322.48
End time: 324.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would start smoking.

Start time: 324.62
End time: 326.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would I answer a question with a question?

Start time: 327.62
End time: 333.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  An advantage in the button pushing thing.  Don't you have to be the first to push the button?  That's true, right?

Start time: 334.65
End time: 339.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How does the computer push the button?  First it has to know the answer and meanwhile it's digging through the...

Start time: 339.54
End time: 355.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it sounds like the computer has an unfair advantage here.  I think it's got an unfair disadvantage.  They're probably not going to, like you said, they're probably not going to narrow the fields  for Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter because the computer has all fields.  And then the computer has the ability to just trigger the button remotely for some kind  of while.

Start time: 355.96
End time: 364.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's extremely fast, of course.  So there's that.  But don't, you know, give Ken Jennings a chance.  He's the smart guy that can.  Now when is this going to be on?

Start time: 364.96
End time: 368.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This starts Monday and then it runs through Wednesday.  So it's three episodes.

Start time: 368.38
End time: 372.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to be the whole week is going to be or this couple episodes are going to be  right?  Okay, good.

Start time: 372.98
End time: 397.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I may actually watch that.  It's worth putting on your DVR just to fast forward through if nothing else.  Tuesday more Mobile World Congress announcements from HTC.  We've seen a lot of stuff from HTC in the past couple months.  I'm not sure that we're expecting anything huge from them.  Has anybody heard anything in the rumor pipeline?  I haven't.  Wednesday, the Electronic Frontier Foundation turns 21.  And they're having a party.

Start time: 397.34
End time: 398.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I can drink now.

Start time: 398.34
End time: 414.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's adorable.  Yeah.  Also, the House subcommittee is scheduling their net neutrality hearings to begin Wednesday.  This is where Congress attempts to stop the FCC from implementing their guidelines.  That going to happen?  That's going to be fun to watch?  Should everyone turn on C-SPAN?

Start time: 414.50
End time: 427.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like any of this to be honest about it.  I think the government's getting involved in I mean, people went on and on about this  net neutrality thing, but I'm totally convinced that once the government gets involved, they're  going to start to regulate the internet in such a way that it's not going to be a good

Start time: 428.08
End time: 439.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  thing.  EFF agrees with you, actually.  They're kind of like, we believe in net neutrality, but we're not sure that we need the government  to come in and enforce it.  I personally think we need more competition, and that will ensure net neutrality.

Start time: 440.18
End time: 442.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would rather go with your thinking than the current thinking.

Start time: 444.40
End time: 457.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Finally, Thursday, the HP pre-2 that was announced.  We'll talk a little bit more about that later.  Will be available for pre-order for $100 on Verizon.  Will there be lines?

Start time: 457.64
End time: 466.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now, give us the price again.  $100 for what?  For the HP pre-2.  And so for what, $50 bucks you get two of them?

Start time: 467.10
End time: 468.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Second prize, two pre-2s.

Start time: 469.87
End time: 472.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're selling it unlocked too.  How much are they selling it unlocked for?

Start time: 473.90
End time: 479.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what?  I don't have the price.  Now you're talking.  Remember, it's something like $450.  It's kind of high.

Start time: 479.32
End time: 490.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's not that different from the original pre.  I don't understand what the draw is, particularly when they've got the pre-cubed and the Veer  coming out later.  So I don't know what the draw is.

Start time: 490.58
End time: 495.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I still don't know anyone with a pre, but maybe my circle of friends is just not  the target.

Start time: 496.43
End time: 496.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.

Start time: 497.49
End time: 503.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a decent phone though.  It's not a bad phone, and that's a good price point.  That's a pretty solid price point for it.

Start time: 505.06
End time: 529.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know two guys with a pre, both of them have had to go back multiple times to get the hardware  replaced.  And Sprint is just replacing it.  You bring it in and it's broken or cracked, or particularly the slider gets real loose,  and they're just giving them back out again.  So I'm not a big believer in it.  It looks like it's not very well made.  Hopefully the pre-2 will be a little better.  I don't know.

Start time: 530.47
End time: 548.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Let's go with the Mobile World Congress announcements that came today.  Samsung did exactly what everyone expected.  They announced a tablet and a new Galaxy S phone.  The new tablet is a Galaxy Tab.  Well, they didn't call it the Galaxy Tab 2.  They call it the Galaxy Tab 10.1.  Lame.  After the screen size, 10.1 inch.

Start time: 550.01
End time: 550.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Start time: 550.72
End time: 564.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll have Tegra 2 inside, Honeycomb dual cameras.  So two megapixels on the front, five megapixels or eight megapixels on the back.  It sounds, the specs sound pretty much like every other Android tablet I've heard announced.

Start time: 565.56
End time: 567.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, okay.  Next.

Start time: 568.40
End time: 572.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a solid competitor to the iPad though.  I think it's a good device.  Oh, you're just being nice.

Start time: 573.54
End time: 574.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh?  She's being nice.

Start time: 575.58
End time: 576.32
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Give them a chance.

Start time: 576.56
End time: 583.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, come on.  It's got the Tegra 2 is really fast.  It's got a solid design.  You never know.

Start time: 583.58
End time: 591.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They may be a sponsor sometime in the future.  Go lie with them.  Go lie with these guys.  I mean, you never know.

Start time: 591.52
End time: 607.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't, none of it matters until we see the pricing on it because if it can't, you  know, if it can't compete with the iPad in pricing, you know, consumers are not going  to go for it in droves.  The disaster of the Zoom pricing is a good example of that.  What are they thinking over there?

Start time: 608.39
End time: 624.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's awful.  Well, you know, there was that Best Buy page that went up with the price at $1,199, $1,199  and then very quickly Best Buy yanked it down and said that was a placeholder price.  It's not going to be that pricey.  But $800 seems to be the consensus of what the Z.  That's still too high, isn't it?  Yeah, it is too.  It's a lot of money.

Start time: 625.26
End time: 628.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd be excited about the 8 megapixel camera on the tab.

Start time: 629.62
End time: 637.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really the only differentiator there.  It's got a pretty nice.  Well, I don't even know if it's a nice camera.  It's got more megapixels.  That doesn't necessarily mean it.

Start time: 638.74
End time: 642.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Samsung is a notorious company for having lousy cameras.

Start time: 643.12
End time: 647.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is funny because didn't they have the first 8 and 10 megapixel camera phones?

Start time: 647.68
End time: 655.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They need tons and tons of pixels because of the blurry quality of the lenses and the  rest of it.  I think that's the reason.  But who the hell needs that many pixels?

Start time: 656.80
End time: 665.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I told you that this was a Tegra 2 tablet, 16 gig or 32 gig with Android 3.0 honeycomb  on it and didn't tell you it was the tab.

Start time: 666.96
End time: 667.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds good to me.

Start time: 668.49
End time: 696.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You wouldn't know it.  You wouldn't know it was any different from any other tablet out there.  I would.  Yeah.  So it's all going to be differentiated on price point, I have a feeling.  The other thing they announced was the Samsung Galaxy S2, a dual core phone, 1 gigahertz  CPU, 4.3 inch super AMOLED plus screen.  As we mentioned earlier, extraordinarily thin.  Everybody's raving about how it just kind of disappears in the hand.  I believe Chris Ziegler from Engadget cut himself on it.

Start time: 697.73
End time: 699.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was bleeding uncontrollably.  It was awful.

Start time: 700.24
End time: 706.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, the shell measures 8.49 millimeters, making it probably the thinnest smartphone that's  been put out yet.

Start time: 707.47
End time: 713.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that.  You can also use it as a weapon.  Yes, that's right.  You flick it, you could probably...

Start time: 713.66
End time: 720.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You get something stuck in your teeth, you can just use it that way.  Use the glossy finish on the back.  Yeah, it's great.

Start time: 720.28
End time: 720.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it running 2.2 or 2.3?

Start time: 722.88
End time: 734.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'm looking for that.  I think I recall seeing something that it was going to come out with 2.2 when it comes  out, but I may be confusing that with one of the other announcements today.  Yeah, I hope they're better at updating it.

Start time: 734.68
End time: 750.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hope they're better at updating it.  Your chat room is saying 2.3.  Okay, it's 2.3, you're right.  2.3, oh, that's good.  Okay.  Because Samsung's been awful about updating the Galaxy line of phones, and that's been  a real problem with Android, and I hope that they do better at it, starting with this one.

Start time: 750.66
End time: 754.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does anybody on the show here have one of these Samsung phones or any sort of Samsung  phone ever?

Start time: 755.30
End time: 769.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we have the Nexus S, which is a Galaxy phone.  Oh, right.  Eileen uses it, so I get to play around with it sometimes.  It's a nice phone.  Any of the faults of the Nexus S in my mind are faults of Android, not faults of the phone.  Phone works great.

Start time: 771.98
End time: 789.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the Nexus S doesn't have a front-facing camera though, which I kind of wish it did.  It's a great...  The Galaxy S cameras are nice.  They've got these odd little glitches that most of them have been fixed, like it came  out with terrible GPS initially.  GPS couldn't connect and hold.  The chat room's...

Start time: 790.22
End time: 792.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, but the chat room's got a bunch of these phones.  They love them.

Start time: 793.86
End time: 796.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, people have them, love them.  People have them, love them.

Start time: 797.34
End time: 863.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also, the TouchWiz interface, Samsung's modified Android interface might be coming on this  as well, which could not ruin it, but that could change a lot of people's minds.  A lot of people just want the generic interface.  Nexus S has a front-facing camera.  Oh, it does?  Yeah.  So says Eileen from the other room.  And she's got one in her hand, so I tend to believe her.  All right.  Sony also had their Mobile World Congress announcement today as well.  The Sony Ericsson Xperia Pro was announced.  The Sony Ericsson Neo was announced, but the star of the show was something we've pretty  much seen everything about, the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play, which is the first phone to have  the PlayStation Mobile Suite in it.  It's essentially going to be the flagship for that experience.  Everybody's got their hands on it out there, seems to be saying nice things about it.  Maybe they're just full of Hamon and Cava, but everybody says the buttons feel good.  It's fun to play on, and they've got some good titles to launch with.

Start time: 864.89
End time: 882.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's going to be a lot of big titles on there.  I'm just curious to see what's going to be exclusive to the Xperia versus what's just  going to be available on all Android phones.  I wonder if the buttons in the control scheme will have any effect on what titles get shipped  on Xperia versus other Android devices.

Start time: 883.04
End time: 898.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because the PlayStation Suite will be available for all Android phones.  They announced today that the system will ship with Asphalt Adrenaline 6, Bruce Lee,  Star Battalion, The Sims 3, and Tetris, along with a quote, legendary PlayStation title.

Start time: 899.18
End time: 904.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which would be, what's the big PlayStation title that would be legendary?  One of the big ones.  Does anybody know?

Start time: 905.12
End time: 910.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe God of War?  I have no insider knowledge on this, by the way.  I'm totally just making stuff up.  Yeah, I don't know.

Start time: 910.68
End time: 911.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Angry Birds for the PlayStation.

Start time: 913.40
End time: 924.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, let's think about it.  Sonic for Sega, it's Mario for Nintendo, it's Halo for Xbox.  What would be the legendary Sony PS?

Start time: 924.88
End time: 930.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're not big gamers, apparently.  No, right at the top of our head.  I made my guess.  Someone in the chat room knows.

Start time: 930.20
End time: 931.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Final Fantasy, everybody.  I made my guess.

Start time: 932.16
End time: 936.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Final Fantasy?  Ooh, maybe.  That could be Final Fantasy.  That's a good guess, too, yeah.

Start time: 936.74
End time: 937.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ratchet and Clank.

Start time: 941.08
End time: 944.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everyone's saying Metal Gear Solid, they're saying Tomb Raider.

Start time: 944.00
End time: 958.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Metal Gear Solid's another one, yeah.  What is the game that was initially available only on the PlayStation where you kind of  roll junk and make a bigger ball?  Katamari.  Katamari Damacy, yeah.  Yeah, that would be interesting on a phone.  I thought that was on a Nintendo game.

Start time: 959.28
End time: 972.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could use the internal accelerator and the gyroscopic internal accelerator to roll  the ball around and catch things up in the Katamari ball.

Start time: 973.41
End time: 978.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember that.  That was a great game, actually.  I like that game.  That was a great game.  That would be.

Start time: 978.84
End time: 981.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little bigger than that.  Alright, let's move on to the Nokia had their announcement today as well.  Their announcement involved no phones.  It was Steven Elop on stage defending the decision they announced on Friday to partner  up with Windows Phone 7 as their future strategy.  It was a classic.

Start time: 1086.98
End time: 1132.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I took some notes.  Of course, I didn't bring it with me.  I think for one thing, Elop has very much got the same cadence and style of Bill Gates  when he speaks.  There's a certain cadence that comes out of Microsoft.  It's just Microsofty.  I've run into a bunch of these guys and they come out of Microsoft as executives and they  go to other companies and they do the same thing.  They have all these ideas and they think that they're going to be successful with them.  But I'm always thinking they never seem to get it.  When they were at Microsoft, they were part of an monopoly company that really didn't  have to do a lot of original thinking.  They didn't have to make the right decision.  The right decision at Microsoft was, let's don't kill Office and let's don't kill Windows.  That's the only decision you have to make.  Anything else you do is just gravy.

End time: 1151.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's not a good idea.  I think they should have at least, although nobody asked the question, I was very disappointed  in the media because they didn't ask the question of Elop whether or not they kept the option  for Android open.  He did mention that they're keeping...

Start time: 1153.10
End time: 1157.47

Start time: 1158.40
End time: 1193.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What they did is they said, we're going to partner up with Microsoft.  They're going to give us Windows Phone 7.  We're going to give them Navtech mapping and it's going to be a tight partnership.  We'll be able to actually change the interface, which nobody else has been able to do.  Symbian becomes what they call a franchise platform, which I guess is finished for we're  phasing it out.  And then MeeGo becomes a research and development platform.  They're going to put out one MeeGo device this year and he kept saying today in his  announcement and it's going to be the disruptive platform of the future.  We're saving it for disruptive stuff.  I don't know what that means at all.

Start time: 1194.06
End time: 1254.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the other thing...  Anyway, there's a couple of things going on in Finland.  There's a walkout at a couple of the factories.  The employees are irked about this guy and the whole process.  And there's a term going around Finland called GOOF, G-O-O-F, and it refers to get out of  Finland because everybody believes that Microsoft is either going to do a deal and either buy  of Nokia and outsource it to China and pretty much close down, killing 150,000 jobs in Finland.  This is what they believe in Finland.  And so this is problematic because if you've been to Finland or if you study how the Finns  think, it's not very compatible with Microsoft the way they think in Redmond, Washington.  It's culturally different.  I think this guy should have taken a little more cultural anthropology.  I think there's a lot of issues here.  I think this is going to be fun to watch what happens.  I hope they're successful, but I doubt if they will be.

Start time: 1254.86
End time: 1290.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just so surprised because I think if Nokia doesn't evolve in this way, there's no way  they're going to stay alive.  Microsoft excels at getting their software out on devices, whether it's Windows or Windows  Phone 7 or whatever platform they're trying to spread across the world.  That's what they do best.  Nokia has been making hardware forever and they make more hardware for phones than I  think anyone else in the world at this point.  So the idea of getting Windows Phone 7 on Nokia devices across the world, I think it  makes perfect sense for both brands.  It may not be good for the people in Finland, but the brand is smart.

Start time: 1290.88
End time: 1300.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll ask a couple of questions then.  One, why can't they do the same thing with Android, which has apps and we're in the world  of apps and Microsoft has none.  They have 8,000.  They have.

Start time: 1301.28
End time: 1305.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're growing apps though and they're going to absorb all the apps from Nokia.  It's weak.  It's weak.

Start time: 1305.94
End time: 1317.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also.  Anyway, your argument, how would that not apply exactly the same way to Android without  the royalties that you have to pay Microsoft for the operating system, which adds to the  bottom line?

Start time: 1318.24
End time: 1320.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they tried to go to Android and it didn't work out.  They couldn't work out a deal.

Start time: 1321.88
End time: 1344.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say that Microsoft has offered them billions of dollars and they said that they couldn't  work out a deal with Android.  And then today, ELOP said, our first priority is beating Android, which sounds to be like  somebody who got pissed off over negotiations and is turning against them.  Although they also said that they didn't want to take Android because it would make Android  too big.

Start time: 1345.44
End time: 1404.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, there's another element.  There's a political element.  The European Union or specifically made a big stink about, oh God, if these guys go  to Android, there's going to be a duopoly with Apple and Android and we can't have that  because we know the EU hates American companies to begin with.  Of course, in Microsoft, they hate them too, but what else could they do?  I think they should have maybe done something, I don't know, maybe altogether different,  which they're not going to.  Here's what the problem is as far as I'm concerned, is that the Windows 7 phone straight up, in  straight competition with Android and the iPhone, shows no traction.  I disagree.  Well, I mean, I'm just reading the monthly numbers.  Apparently they sold a whole bunch of phones right off the bat and then the thing went  dead flat after they filled the channel up.  They haven't released any numbers.  They haven't released any numbers.  No, there's some research companies that have said, I'll have to dig this up now apparently  to back up my own story.

Start time: 1405.34
End time: 1454.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But when Microsoft has a hit, they release numbers and they trumpet them and they have  not released any numbers here.  I think that they are not selling these at all.  When you use one of these phones, when you use a Windows phone, it's a great phone to  use it.  But the problem is that no one's going to try it in the era of Android and in the era  of the iPhone.  I don't know necessarily that the race is over, but you've got two people who basically,  two companies that in terms of mobile have become clueless and they're drowning and they're  trying to cling to each other in order to survive.  And there's no indication that they'll do better together than they would have separately.  They won't be any faster.  They won't be any more agile.  And they're not going to have the same kind of mind share that Android and Apple do at  the moment.

Start time: 1455.90
End time: 1500.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I kind of disagree on that because I think like I said earlier, Nokia makes really good  hardware and they've got the reach worldwide and Windows makes good mobile software.  I think so anyway.  I think the combination is actually a really good fit.  And I think it makes the most sense for both of them to kind of go into a partnership together  and their powers combined, their captain cell phone, I don't know.  But Nokia didn't do a great job of making smartphones these days that people really  fell in love with.  And maybe with the combination of Windows Phone 7, it'll be something that they can  do going forward because I mean, there aren't going to be feature phones are the way the  past.  It's smartphones and even lower priced smartphones going forward and Windows, you know, Microsoft  can make that happen for them.

Nokia is very good at that.  I said that too.  Right.  Everybody says that.  But at that point, if Microsoft and Nokia execute well, they can pull it off.  The problem is, and this is what I said, is that they have not executed well on either  of these lately up to now.  And whether they can do it together is a big question.  They can't be agile.  They can't be swift if they're too big.

Start time: 1573.10

Start time: 1581.00
End time: 1622.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The hardware is fine, but the point is people don't make these associations.  They don't take up a piece of something that doesn't work and say, well, I think that the  software is defective and the hardware is fantastic.  And I don't think people are even paying that much attention to any of these phones anymore,  except for the fact, except what they can do.  And I think people are going for the buzz of hundreds of thousands of apps.  And the whole app idea has been kind of rejected by Nokia from the get-go.  And it has largely by Microsoft with their kind of defensive posture.  Well, everything's included and we're doing it our own way and this app thing is overrated  and all the rest of it.  And I say the same thing with Palm and the rest of these guys who don't have the apps.

Start time: 1623.60
End time: 1636.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the reason that people make so many apps is because the devices are distributed over  like millions of different people.  If Windows has the opportunity to get on more handsets, then that means that more people  are going to be willing to develop for Windows Phone 7 platform.

Start time: 1636.50
End time: 1658.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in your defense, I will say this, everyone that I've been in contact with that does apps,  they claim that the development kit for Windows Phone is better than anything ever done by  anybody.  So you can really crank apps out.  But then again, it's like at this point, you're a little bit behind in this race.  It's like starting way late.

Start time: 1658.86
End time: 1690.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Microsoft is doing what Apple did at the beginning.  They're limiting the platform, limiting features.  Apple didn't allow third party apps at first.  Microsoft's at least allowing them, but keeping it tight control over it.  Which okay, that's all fine and that's all well and good.  But at this point, you're four years behind the game.  So I'm not sure how fast you can catch up.  And Microsoft's not known as a rabbit.  We're looking at another Microsoft Zune possibly, where they have, Microsoft Zune's a fantastic  competitor for the iPod.  Yeah, no, it's a great product.

Start time: 1691.76
End time: 1712.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Veronica's being swayed by the fact and a lot of other people that this Windows  Phone is a nice phone.  It works well.  It's just well designed.  It's a Zune phone, just like the Zune.  But I think there's a jinx involved here.  These guys are too little, too late.  They're not marketing this stuff right.  They have a bad reputation.  People actually want to hate them.  And I think it's doomed.

Start time: 1713.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they've got a marketing problem.  And Nokia isn't any better at it than Microsoft.  And they never will because they're Finnish.  Finnish guys.  Image of the N97 and the N98.  And other than kind of like the people on the show and geeks, you know, your mom doesn't  know about the Nokia N97 and 98.  They have no idea how to market this stuff.  But they've heard of Nokia before.  And Microsoft is losing its Microsoft Mojo, its marketing Mojo.  I think they've been terrible at trying to market the Windows Phone 7.  I think that probably the two of them together, maybe they might make a complete marketer.  I don't know.

I mean, Nokia's got this brand name recognition too that I think is really powerful.  I think a lot of the general population is familiar with that brand and comfortable with  it. And if they want to get their first smartphone, low price and smartphone, maybe the Nokia  will be the choice for them.

And no one actually reported to the editorial directors of.  So when I saw this, I thought, well, yeah, they're going to make her head of this group.

But the if I had been and I was getting no money  and they just sold for three hundred million bucks, you think I'm going to  even write another word unless I get some, you know, how about where's my kickback?  Where's my, you know, ten grand?  I think all the writers that have been writing for Huffington Post  should be demanding ten, twenty, thirty thousand dollars minimum.

Transcript:  It was a great platform for a lot of people who wanted to get their opinions  and voices heard, but, you know, and obviously not being paid, unfortunately.  But this is this is kind of a sticky situation for the Huffington Post.  And I'm very curious to see what kind of conclusion they come to with the writers  who have been doing a lot, a lot of writing for them in the past,  over the past few years. It's it's kind of incredible.  Are they going to back pay people or are they going to not pay them at all?  Are they going to pay people going forward?

Transcript:  Well, you know, it's funny, historically, AOL has been through this before  with their their moderators from their chat rooms.  They there is a very famous precedent setting case  where AOL was hiring and hiring volunteer  moderators for their chat rooms and message boards.  And they got taken to court.  And the court said, look, if you're advertising for positions  and you and you give them access to your corporate network  and you treat them like employees, you got to pay them.

Start time: 2243.18
End time: 2267.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is a little different the way Huffington handled it.  She didn't do it that way.  I mean, I don't know that wisely, probably.  Yeah, I don't know that they've ever advertised for any writers.  And I think they just send letters out to people.  Would you like to write, you know, write something for us, you know,  because we'll print it. We don't pay, but we'll print it.  I think it's all been up front.  They haven't been dishonest.  They haven't been like suckering people into writing forms,  so promising something at the end.  And since they did it that way, I don't think they're going to give them anything.

Start time: 2267.88
End time: 2309.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they just have a big enough audience that people will want to come to them  and say, oh, you know, I have this big megaphone.  And to a certain extent, a lot of the things, a lot of the models  that the Huffington Post has kind of championed and has built up.  We've been trying to mimic in the in the mainstream media world.  You know, we're we're working on doing aggregation kind of in the same way  that they do.  We're linking to our competitors and doing the same type of things that they do.  So to a certain extent, they've been groundbreaking  and have changed the media landscape.  I don't think that I agree with with John.  I don't think that anything is going to change in terms of their writers  unless there's some kind of whole scale revolt.  And they'll continue to work for free.

Start time: 2309.76
End time: 2321.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And frankly, if the writers that are currently writing for them  don't want to continue writing for them and not get paid,  then I'm sure other people will step up to the bat and want that  and not get paid as well.  Yeah. And also still not get paid.

Transcript:  They get paid in exposure, John.  Yeah, I got your exposure right here.  They can return the favor.  Let's move on.  Well, actually, you know, before we move on, I want to ask this one question.  We saw this story from Aleta a couple of weeks back claiming that AOL  makes 80 percent of their money off of subscriptions to dial up  that people don't need.  Yeah, I think that's probably true.  So if that's the case, that's not going to last.  Well, at some point, you would think.  How can AOL continue as a content company if that's true?  And I think what they're doing is very smart here, putting together  these top name blogs. But is it enough?  Can they actually can they actually save AOL and turn it into a top  tier content company this way?

Start time: 2366.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know why they can't, you know, if they have a good  advertising sales network, why they can't make money doing this  the way they're doing it. And they way they keep things separately branded.  You know, you get you get you, I think, a little more attention.  A lot of people have always believed they're having a lot of flat sites  rather than one consolidated site like the New York Times, where you go  to different sections as opposed to going to completely different websites.  Like, you know, the Huff Post still is not going to say it's not.  You don't go to AOL, then jump to the Huff Post.  You just go to the Huff Post, I would think.  I think it's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  Well, I think what AOL does a really good job of is picking up these  these content sites like Engadget and HuffPo and kind of keep being hands off  a little bit with their I mean, they're still branding on those sites.  But what they're really doing is taking that massive traffic that they still get  from their home page, from AOL.com, and sending it out to to the content sites out there.  And so it's it's not like they're a content company, but at the same time,  they're they're just kind of filtering the traffic and sending sending people  places that that a lot of other people already end up at, you know, to start with.

Transcript:  You remember, Tom, that AOL that Yahoo!  did a big content deal with newspapers where they shared content with them.  There was also a big deal that they've done with the Associated Press.  In fact, when you click on a lot of links on Associated  Press content from Google, it often goes to Yahoo! because of that deal.  So they have they have a lot of content from a lot of varied sources.  And I think AOL is probably looking to do the same same kind of thing.  What I want to know is, you know, you mentioned the rock.  I mentioned the idea of their of their web page driving stuff.  I wonder how many people still use that web page as a home page.

HP WebOS announcement, they announced an HP touch bad  nine point seven inch screen, so at least differentiates itself  from the Android tablets by being point four inches smaller than most.  Yeah, one point three megapixel webcam, 16 or 32 gigabytes storage,  making a big deal about the audio quality of it.  They've got the Beats audio by Dr.  Dre integrated in their one point two gigahertz Snapdragon processor  and the touchstone charging.  You can you can get a dock so that it wirelessly charges.  WebOS like true multitasking looks pretty interesting.  I haven't picked up one of these, but does this know nothing?

Transcript:  Really? You may get the original.  The original pre was much smaller than the than than most other smartphones.  And people found trying to use that tiny little screen with the with the cards  and the the multitasking system could sometimes be a little bit frustrating,  particularly if you had big fingers.  So I don't know how how well the fear is going to do.  The thing with the may not work, but I'm just saying  is that other than the operating system, I don't see much differentiation  with that than anything else.  It looks to me like an iPad clone.  Now, the operating system may be very cool, but, you know, when they were showing it  off to journalists who were there after the event, they wouldn't let them actually  touch it. You know, it was kind of like when the way they showed off the zoom at  CES, where you could actually tap on things.  So at this point, it's still vapor, but they got it.  HP has one shot at making WebOS a hit.  And if they don't score here, I think it's over for Palm.

Start time: 2731.88
End time: 2792.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let me bring up a point.  I wrote this up in a PC magazine column, which I think that HP made the mistake  of there's something going on that's very subtle, which is the Facebook phone.  And HTC and INQ have both made a Facebook phone, even though they don't have a  branded as such.  And I think that if HP had rolled out a phone that was blue, it had a Facebook  logo on it and had a button on there or even just booted onto Facebook, which is  an alternative messaging system that could easily bypass SMS or these Facebook  nutballs who use Facebook 24 seven.  I think that would have been a huge success and would change the way things are  going. But right now, there's going to be a Facebook phone.  Somebody's going to do it.  It could be Apple, for all we know, because they have done weird branded things.  They did with the iPod, with a couple of these special specialty iPods.  They could do it with a phone.  And it would be a huge it's going to be a huge success when somebody does it.  But meanwhile, HP drops the ball on this are not paying attention to what's going  on around them, apparently.  And I think they're I think I agree with you.  I think they're long term, they're toast.

Start time: 2792.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, INQ is putting it out exactly what you're saying, which is the the cloud  touch and the cloud cube both boot right to a Facebook page.  Right. It's integrated right in the front.  So you think they'll benefit from that the way you're talking about?

Start time: 2805.94
End time: 2830.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I and Q and the and the HTC.  Well, they're going to be rolling this thing and discussing it at the Barcelona  event. So we'll see.  You know, but I think when I first heard this as it off, there's an idea that is,  you know, because the Facebook guys apparently worked with them, especially the  INQ people, to engineer it so it's seamless, so you can pop it.  So it actually works well.  And I think that this is an interesting idea.

Transcript:  Facebook is your user interface on the cloud touch and the cloud cube from IMQ.  Yeah. So you go right to the newsfeed.  You can. And there's some four buttons across the top for people, events,  notifications and places. It's your contact manager.  It's your photo app, your videos.  You can still do other apps on it because I believe it's an Android phone underneath,  but it's skinned Facebook.

But if you're looking for a phone where Facebook is thoroughly integrated,  it becomes your contact list, your Facebook  updates appear on that, the live tiles on the home screen.

Go to you know, I should have gotten Alex Lindsay in here.  His whole company now is running on GoToMeeting.  He is it's a virtual company.  He's got people working for him all over the world and uses GoToMeeting for meetings,  for training, for collaboration.  There's no better way to reduce costs, improve your efficiency, your processes.  And of course, it saves you money and every dollar saved on the it makes a difference  on the bottom line these days.  I use web conferencing and I encourage you to do so for your business.  You'll eliminate travel and necessary travel, which is good for everybody.  You'll improve communications with the folks you work with.  And you'll be smarter and more efficient and people won't moan and groan when you  say it's time for a meeting.  Now, there are other choices.  I know that for web conferencing tools, but there's nothing better than GoToMeeting.  It's the best. It's the easiest to use for product reviews, for sales  presentations, for training sessions, for collaboration and improving conference calls.  You share your screen with the people you're talking to.  So instead of playing Tetris or answering email or Facebooking during the conference  call, they're actually looking at something and engaged.  Makes a big difference. Companies of all sizes because it's very affordable.  Forty nine dollars a month, one flat rate every month.  And you've got as many meetings as you want as you long as long as you want.  But don't take my word for it.  Like like all the Citrix products, we're going to give you a 30 day free try so  you can see what GoToMeeting can do for you.  Visit GoToMeeting.com slash twit and you'll have all the meetings you want for one  low flat rate and they'll throw in phone and voice over IP conferencing.  It's part of the deal. Part of the package.  I mean, now we're now we're cooking with gas.  Does anybody cook with gas? Yes.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit. Give it a try today.

But, you know, until you actually put your hands on something  that's that different in terms of the interface, you don't know if it's really cool  or if it's a really irritating. I agree.  And I'll and I'll reserve judgment on that.  I mean, you know, if you're going to have a flip phone,  you may want to have like a real keyboard.  And I don't know that the form factor necessarily is right for that,  for a big virtual keyboard or for, you know, moving multiple things around on the screen.  I don't know that it's necessary.

Well, then is that unlimited?  Is that actually on there's just false advertising.  And I like to know why the FTC doesn't go after these guys because they keep saying,  oh, unlimited, unlimited, unlimited.  And next thing you know, it's limited.

Start time: 3442.96

Start time: 3463.78
End time: 3474.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I see what you're trying to say, Dwight, which is the problem is that  if you're doing the hot spot feature, that is limited and they never say that's unlimited.  It's only receiving data that's unlimited.

Start time: 3475.26
End time: 3505.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. If you use the data on the phone and then it's then that's unlimited.  If you turn on the hot spot, let other devices connect.  It's a two gigabyte limit, which, you know, is to me is I mean, John's confused.  It's a confusing situation for the buyer, you know.  Oh, I thought I had unlimited.  How come I'm getting an extra?  They charge you twenty dollars per gigabyte over the two gigabytes that you get for.  I think it's what, forty five dollars or something.  Twenty dollars. Yeah.  That's all rackets. That's serious.  That's you serious. I think.

Transcript:  So the question is, though, what the question I've been getting most about  the Verizon iPhone is a does it really work better than AT&T, which is probably true.  I haven't I haven't tested it out myself. I've seen it.  Well, we saw it on Teczilla, but that was just a one time use case scenario.  But the second question is, is now the time to buy it?  Should I wait until Apple makes an announcement for the next version of the iPhone?  You know, possibly potentially this spring.

Start time: 3528.58
End time: 3547.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I think people weren't lined up.  I think people were waiting.  The smart people were waiting for iPhone five.  The people with poor impulse control bought the preorders,  and that's why they ran out of them so fast.  I think most people had wised up  and decided they were going to wait for the iPhone five.  And I think that's a smart thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple fanboys went and got the iPhone four on AT&T three or four years ago.  Whenever I can't remember exactly when it came out.  But whenever the iPhone originally came out, that's when they got it.  They've been on AT&T since.  They don't want to pay an early termination fee to go from the iPhone four  they already have to another iPhone four.  So they're going to wait.  And they may pay an early termination fee in the summer to switch to Verizon,  but they're not going to do it till then.  The only people that are buying the iPhone on Verizon right now are current  Verizon's customers who don't have to pay an early termination fee  and have been on some other phone and have decided, you know what?  I don't care about waiting till June. I got to have it now.

Start time: 3586.76
End time: 3598.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 3599.56
End time: 3620.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, that could be really expensive.  You know, I don't think a lot of people are going to end up balking.  They're going to say that, you know, I've had it with AT&T.  They'll do their John DeVore acumen tation.  And then they'll say, you know, oh, I have to pay that much.  I'll wait. Thank you. Yeah.

Transcript:  What about this rumor of a mini iPhone?  Wall Street Journal now corroborating it.  Bloomberg has reported it before saying that Apple will make a well,  Wall Street Journal says it's half the size of the iPhone.  Bloomberg said it was two thirds of the size of the iPhone,  but basically a smaller iPhone that would be two hundred dollars unsubsidized.  So potentially a subsidy, a subsidy could make it free.  What would be the point of it?

Start time: 3645.76
End time: 3652.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead. I mean, what's the point?  Just because it's free, but it's too small.  I mean, isn't the iPhone at pretty much saying that the phones are too big?

End time: 3688.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm saying, OK, you got me in the corner here,  so I'm going to dig my way out of it.  iPhones, I think for people who'd like the iPhone, like Veronica,  they are optimized.  The perfect size. Everything about them is right.  I don't see it. You should shrink it.  I'm saying just generally speaking, these phones are too big.  And I don't like the big giant, you know, EVO, even though people  in the chat room seem to love the monstrous thing that it is.  And I would like to have a small phone that I could just, you know,  I don't have to worry about because I don't sit around surfing the Internet  on a phone like a lot of people do.  If you do, you need an iPhone that's that size. That's enough.

Start time: 3688.92
End time: 3700.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this this mini iPhone could be for the folks who are like,  you know what? Same thing as you.  But I would like to have a few apps.  I would like to, you know, have maybe a small game,  like a little Tetris game or something.  And I want to live in that.

Start time: 3700.76
End time: 3728.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm kind of torn on this because on one side,  I feel like Apple really has the lock on like the high end,  you know, smartphone market.  I mean, obviously, they've they've been that way for the past couple of years.  But the idea of them putting out a lower priced, you know,  phone with a few less features, maybe or maybe just features  that aren't quite as robust as what we have on this phone makes sense in a way,  because there are still people who just can't put up with the idea  of spending two hundred dollars, three hundred dollars on a cell phone at this point.

Start time: 3730.24
End time: 3753.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Veronica, they kind of already do that now when they when they sell,  you know, right now you can buy the iPhone.  The ninety nine dollar. Yeah. Yeah.  Forty nine dollars now. It's forty nine. Right.  Reduced it to forty nine.  So they kind of do that now.  To a certain extent, it doesn't make sense because they can simply take,  you know, the iPhone four when the iPhone five comes out and make that  their ninety nine slash forty nine dollar phone.

Start time: 3754.20
End time: 3755.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's also been interesting.

Start time: 3755.42
End time: 3774.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead. Well, I was going to say it's a six hundred twenty nine dollar  retail price for the iPhone.  So even if they reduce that to four or five hundred dollars,  a two hundred dollar unsubsidized price means free  on every carrier, a free Apple iPhone to compete with all of those lower end  phones like we're seeing from Sony Ericsson with the NIO.

Start time: 3776.58
End time: 3813.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it kind of the other thing I was thinking was that even though Apple  has done a lot with the iPod to make a lot of different versions  available for all different types of uses, the iPhone has always been  something they've just stayed with one one flavor at a time.  And I don't know if that's kind of their their M.O. going forward.  Like they always want it to be one unified device that everyone kind of has,  you know, the cult of cult of Apple, I guess.  But at the same time, for on a consumer point of view, it makes sense  for me at least to have different versions, you know, that that are tailored  to people who maybe don't want the top end smartphone or can't afford it.

Start time: 3814.80
End time: 3831.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's a good point to be made there.  I think I agree. I think that there's a but I kind of like the idea  that they instead of having this huge selection of skews,  you have the one and that's it.  Take it or leave it. One size fits all.  I mean, it seems to me to be the easier decision for decision points

Start time: 3831.76
End time: 3844.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in the rest of it. They differentiated with the iPod, though, and that worked out OK.  They had the iPod iPod mini and then the mini became the nano.  The argument against me.  So I could see them doing that much differentiation.

Start time: 3845.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is a form factor issue with with with having a phone.  You know, you could do do a music player down real tiny.  But by the time you're working with contacts and making phone calls  and surfing the Internet, you know, at that point, you need more screen  real estate. And, you know, John, you were talking about how much you thought  the veer would that you would like something like the veer.  It'd be interesting to see, you know, trying to actually use it.  I don't know even that Apple could do a phone with all the things  it has to do that would be comfortable to use, even if it was smaller.

Transcript:  Not the only Apple rumor out there, obviously,  but the other big one this week, iPad two in production.  Not to be outdone, we had a rumor about the iPad three right after that.  John Gruber referred to an iPad three after talking about the HB Web OS announcement.  Gruber thinks it would be more of an iPad two point five  and a seven inch version is what everybody seems to be gathering around.  As we'll get the iPad to iPad two is in production.  We know that we know it's going to have a front facing camera.  We know it's going to come out probably around everything you wanted on the iPad  is on the iPad is on the iPad to that's just the way Apple does things.  But would they come out with a fall seven inch version?  Steve Jobs has said seven inches is dead on arrival already.

Start time: 3948.20
End time: 3960.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he probably said that for a reason because he thinks it is  and they're not working on one.  I believe this is a bogus rumor.  And then it's not the way Apple does things.  Well, it would bring out a half baked in between products.

Transcript:  Um, both Steve Jobs and Tim Cook have,  you know, swatted down rumors about the seven inch. They poo poo.  They made fun of the platform.  So I don't necessarily think that they're going to be apt to put it out.  The only caveat to that would be is if things like the galaxy tab  and other seven inch tablets really take off and they see a demand for it.  But at that, this point, I don't think that's happening.  And I don't think that, you know, their public statements, I think,  have been have not been vague. They've been pretty firm about it.

Start time: 4004.34
End time: 4022.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing is somebody in the chat room just pointed out the iPhone 3GS  is kind of a half baked in between product, but it really wasn't.  It's just a different radio, right?  Yeah, I mean, it was it was it was a it's a rev faster.  It's faster. It's not like a different  whole different platform like the seven inch would tell you anybody

You didn't have to sit there and wait for stuff to load. Right.  I remember that.  Now, Steve Jobs also said Apple has no need to make a phone.  He said we'd never put video on an iPod.  And he said no one reads.  Why would we ever get into books?

End time: 4097.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And well, also, you know, the other thing is that is that Jobs said  during the one of the D conferences when he was being interviewed on stage  that at the time he was talking about at one point, he also pooped  the idea of a tablet that originally when they were working on the iOS,  they were working on a tablet and they decided, oh, this operating system  would be great on a phone.  Let's take it to a phone.  So, yeah, he everything that Jobs says has to be taken with a grain of salt.  That said, you know, you have them fairly vigorously denying anything,  you know, more than more than just jobs.  You have Tim Cook saying that.  I just I don't believe it.

Transcript:  I want to expand this conversation a little bit to the ecosystem.  We've got another rumor about mobile me.  Sony's been saying some interesting things about iTunes,  but I want to thank our final sponsor Carbonite backing up files on your PC  and Mac is what you need to be able to do.  Very safely, and I recommend redundant backups.  I back up locally on a hard drive and I back up in the cloud,  as well as considering the actual hard drive within the computer  as a third version of all of that data.  I use Carbonite for my cloud backup because it is the easiest I have ever used.  It's unobtrusive, works in the background.  You select what stuff you want to be backed up and it works.  You can actually prioritize it and say, you know what,  when I'm processor intensive, don't interrupt me.  Wait until I'm not using the computer as much and then go ahead and back it up  so it doesn't clog up the bandwidth.  It's safe. Files are encrypted before they leave your computer.  And it has an automatic and easy to use interface.  You get your files back with just a few clicks.  And as a side benefit of that, when you're not at your computer,  you can actually access all of the files through the Carbonite website  or the free BlackBerry and iPhone apps.  Unlimited backup for your PC or Mac is only fifty five dollars a year.  That's just fifteen cents a day.  And you don't have to pay a dime for it.  You don't even have to put down a credit card to try it out.  Go to carbonite.com, enter the offer code, Chwit.  Try Carbonite for free right now.  And if you decide to buy the service, we'll throw in two months free  with that same offer code.  Be sure to sign up for the free trial from the home page to get the two months free.  Like I said, no credit card required.  And it's fifty five dollars a year.  That's fifteen cents a day for the peace of mind of knowing  that you have your data safe and securely backed up.  Check it out at carbonite.com and we thank them for their support.  Now, there's a rumor along with this iPod  or iPhone nano rumor that Apple is about to make mobile me free this fall  so that anybody could access it and put all of their videos, their books,  their movies, their songs in the cloud.  We've been waiting for this since they bought Lala.  They bought Lala.com. Shut them down.  We've been waiting for iTunes in a cloud.  They say that that's going to come.  It's going to be mobile me and it's and they're not going to charge for it.

Well, Sony in a interview in Australia said  if we do get mass take up of this new Sony music service, Music Unlimited,  then does Sony Music need to provide content to iTunes?  Currently, we do. We have to provide it to iTunes as that's the format right now.  Publishers are being held ransom by Apple and they're looking for other delivery systems  and we are waiting to see what the next three to five years will hold.  So how is how's Apple going to strike a deal to have a cloud service  when you've got executives from their partners saying stuff like this in public?

Transcript:  And if you look at their books more recently, I say people have been analyzing this.  They're still not making any money.  They're still making all their money on the hardware.  From the get go, from the very beginning of the of these stores and the app,  the iTunes in particular, it's always been said that this a lot.  It was not a loss leader, but a break even, maybe make a little money.  But it's to sell more and more iPods.  And I think that they have to ask for this much money because otherwise they're just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that Sony.  I don't think it's a loss to Apple for Sony to be gone.  I think, you know, as far as they're concerned, they're doing Sony a favor.  And if Sony doesn't know that, which apparently they don't.  But Sony, what do you expect?

Start time: 4377.38
End time: 4382.96

Start time: 4388.40
End time: 4427.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But obviously, Sony reader app work differently.  Sony reader app actually you bought within the app itself.  And I think with the Kindle and the other one that you kick you out to the web  and you go to a web page and you buy there and then it downloads it.  So I think Apple's main complaint was that you would actually happened inside the app,  which is a no, no.  Newspaper publishers have been complaining about this, that we want the ability  to sell subscriptions to the print edition inside our online apps  and our iPad and iPhone apps.  And Apple so far has said no.  So that's actually consistent with the way they've been handling some of these other deals.

Start time: 4427.80
End time: 4440.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were selling from within the app without using Apple's in-app purchase structure,  which doesn't allow Apple to take the 30 percent.  That's the key difference.  Right. Right.  Well, the reason why Kindle allows it is because of the thing.

Start time: 4468.88
End time: 4482.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't the Kindle.  The problem with the Sony one, if I remember correctly,  is that the purchase was made inside the app.  You never got kicked out with the Kindle.  The reason the Kindle stays is that the app, the purchases made inside the app.

Start time: 4484.38

End time: 4521.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why can't as long as you let Apple take 30 percent of it?  And what and what Sony was doing, right?  Correct me if I'm wrong here, was saying you can buy it from within the app,  but we're not going to use Apple's system to process the transaction.  Right. Right.  Gotcha. If you don't give, you know, Caesar, it's cut.

They hit it.  There's a bunch. They have one of these things.  We have a yellow tag and it gets cheaper and cheaper and cheaper  as the week goes by.  And then you get it for like five bucks if you wait long enough.  If nobody buys it.  So they pick up the clothes and they ditch them in other parts of the store where you're  like the men's suits will be over by the women's sweaters and it'll be buried.  So so they can get these additional discounts.  It's a mess. I don't like Filene's Basement.

In your neck of the woods, or at least in the state that you're in,  Amazon is pulling out.  They say because the state is charging them  269 million dollars in back sales taxes,  that they are going to close down their Irving, Texas distribution center  and get out of Dodge or rather Irving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What physical presence does Amazon have in the distribution center?

Start time: 4896.22
End time: 4943.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But their argument is their argument is that first, that the Texas law  refers primarily to retail and they're not actually doing retail.  It's a distribution center.  And then also that it's not actually owned by Amazon.  It's owned by a subsidiary.  And thus doesn't have to and this Amazon itself doesn't have to pay the sales tax.  But because it looks like ruling rulings are going to go the other way  against them, they've decided to take their ball and go home.  And if they do that, obviously, Texas is a huge market for them.  And to be able to to to ship out of there would save them enough cash.  So apparently they would lose enough money by capitulating to the sales tax  that it would negate having the distribution center there and saving the money  because of the shorter distances to their markets.
