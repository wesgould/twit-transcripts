Transcript:  You just you know, I think I think being a product person means understanding other products, right?  So you need to kind of stay connected understand what's good what's not good and and kind of like, you know, continue forming those opinions  So I've you requested from everyone to you know, obviously it's a hobby now  But but you know to keep me in mind and they've been very generous so far good.

Start time: 216.14
End time: 239.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you know, it's this whole thing. It's very incestuous. We all know each other. We all work together and that's part of the new idea  Don't get started. No, don't start no  but but but that's one of the joys about doing this and one of the joys about new media and podcasting in general is it's  such a non competitive medium that everybody just kind of hangs out with everybody else and  It's mostly because there's no money in it. If there were money in it, then we beat each other's throats

Start time: 239.90
End time: 265.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably but you know that that's really something I appreciate it. I'm sure the listeners as well  About the world of podcasting when I fell into it a few years ago  It was so different from the world of blogging where it seems everyone was out to get everyone else  That was something that really drew me into it. So I'm glad it continues to the Zay with  Maybe a little bit more money hopefully for some people but I bet blogging started out kind of that way too

Start time: 266.00
End time: 288.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, I seem to remember it was very collegial in the early days and you know  Waxy links would hang out with you know, it was just all relaxed  but then you know, it becomes more professional and more money is involved and you get the big companies like  And gadget and getting involved and suddenly everybody's you know, trying to top everybody else  I think that's just normal and I'm sure it's gonna happen with podcasting if I'm could ever become successful

Transcript:  Hey, so you have a Nexus 5 Miriam I'm so jealous  That's a lie. I saw it. It's a lie  Yeah, you're like that person taking a picture of the of the new KitKat bar coming into the Google campus  I don't know what that is. It's a Nexus 5

Start time: 311.65
End time: 321.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a black one. I wanted a white one  but you know what I'm not gonna complain because Google was really kind enough to send me one and I've been playing with it for  About 48 hours and I'm very very delighted. It's very very great

Start time: 321.78
End time: 360.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm really interested in talking about not just the hardware but what's new in KitKat for four because apparently  Google has kind of pulled a Facebook on their launcher, but we will get to that in a minute  I'm sure I've ordered my five. I should get it  They shipped it surprised, you know, they said we'll ship November 5th or November 8th  But they shipped it almost immediately like November 1st or 2nd  Although it's still not coming until Thursday. I bet I get it a little early  I don't I paid for the two-day business shipping to business day shipping  Sucker yeah, I think I was I think I because then they're there now UPS has it  But they're just gonna sit on it until November 8th

Start time: 361.42
End time: 375.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just saying that because in the past when I've ordered stuff from Google Play has made very little difference because I think  Since we're in California, you know, it's just probably sitting in a warehouse like in Oakland right now  And we're all like, oh man  I want it

Start time: 378.14
End time: 423.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we're gonna talk about all of that in a second but  Before the show we did a little twitch special number 172 if you want to watch it  Because of course the other thing that came out this week same day iPad air  Became available in stores November 1st and there were people lined up to get one  I was lucky enough John Salinina from our office went down to the Apple Store and picked me up an iPad air  And what we did of course as always the folks at I fix it comm flew to Oceania they went to  Australia to be the first because that's where the day begins and  Did their first I fix it tear down right now at the I fix it headquarters in San Luis Obispo  Kyle Weins is there with Miro who is tearing down an air. Hi Kyle. Hi Miro

Start time: 424.70
End time: 427.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Welcome back iPad air tear down number two

Start time: 428.36
End time: 432.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I see that you have now removed the batteries that was the thing that was most concerning, right?

Start time: 433.46
End time: 442.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so we got the batteries out. We managed not to puncture them in the process  You can see we work them a little bit get them out but I can bend it back. Oh, they're soft and pliable

Start time: 442.80
End time: 447.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not so tell me from from the inside. What's different about this iPad?

Start time: 448.34
End time: 467.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so this iPad has a lot more and  Common with the iPad mini than it does with the iPad 4  And and so if I if I take a look at the inside  The process of getting components out you can see along here  These are actually glue strips where the main board sat so we just pulled this out

Start time: 467.46
End time: 473.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we had the main board sitting like this by the way for those not watching video  The main board is a tiny fraction of the total space of an iPad

Start time: 474.62
End time: 482.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're looking at the overall layout, it's almost all battery hold of the part  Yeah, you have it about like that. So that's that's most of the battery

Start time: 482.68
End time: 485.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  80% battery 20%  Circuitry, yeah  Yeah

Start time: 485.94
End time: 491.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so if they want to make it smaller a thinner at this point they have to reduce power consumption or reduce the battery

Start time: 492.08
End time: 495.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they are doing that because isn't this a smaller battery than the last generation iPad, right?

Start time: 495.92
End time: 516.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is it was a I think 44 watt-hour battery before and now this is a 33 watt-hour. That's a big difference  it's yeah, they were able to shrink the battery a lot and that's power efficiencies with the the a7 and I mean  You know more efficient graphics processor and a display that's more energy efficient it's kind of all across the board

Start time: 516.62
End time: 529.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They were able to reduce the energy consumption one thing that you always do when you do these teardowns is you give the  device a  repairability score  What is what kind of repair ability is this device?

Start time: 530.72
End time: 568.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the iPad air does not do very well  It is on par with the iPad mini also known as very very very difficult  So the first thing you have to do to get inside is remove the front glass  I've got the front glass and the display here and that the the glass is glued into the main iPad  And so to get inside you have to heat the glass up and and work guitar picks and all the way around  Cut your way through the adhesive and then use a suction cup to lift the lift the glass up  So it is possible to repair we gave it a 2 out of 10  So that means yes, you can fix it but be aware that it's going to be a process

Start time: 569.20
End time: 580.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fortunately, I fix it has the manual you can actually follow along. Although I think some experience really helps  I know this is the first time Miro's done an air, but he's done iPads before he's done iPads before yeah

Start time: 580.24
End time: 599.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, this is the sort of thing. It's absolutely possible to get going starting your own iPad repair business  You know you get in you care for the first few and then and then you should I get the feel for it if it's your iPad?  You know the thing that inspires the most confidence is when the screen is or the glass is already broken before you get going  So you don't have to worry about breaking the glass

Start time: 602.10
End time: 609.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so it's roughly been an hour that he's been taking it apart  That's it does it get quicker or is it an hour every time it will get quicker

Start time: 609.92
End time: 622.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's he's not using as much heat as we would use if we were going faster  So we wanted to show you the process  The big design difference with the air compared to the the previous iPad is that there's just a lot more glue

Start time: 622.60
End time: 627.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which means more time getting to the part and that's been a trend with iPads apples gluing it more and more and more

Start time: 627.80
End time: 637.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're gluing it more and more because the glue is thinner. It's cheaper to assemble  They don't have to pay people to turn screwdrivers when they're assembling it  But it makes life very difficult when it comes to repair and recycling

Start time: 638.10
End time: 641.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Score two out of five two out of ten two out of ten

Start time: 641.44
End time: 646.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ten in contrast with like the Nexus seven which got a seven or eight out of ten

Start time: 647.20
End time: 653.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, I've prides the back off my Nexus seven with a fingernail  You don't need any spudgers or something the tool or anything

Start time: 653.70
End time: 670.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can just pop it right off and I think replacing the battery the batteries are consumable  It's something that wears out after a year or two  Everyone should be able to replace the batteries and all of their devices and I don't think that it's it's  Environmentally responsible to make a device with a battery this hard to remove. Well, that's the other side

Start time: 670.44
End time: 677.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not merely a repairability issue  It's a recyclability issue because a recycler needs to take it apart in order to responsibly recycle it

Start time: 677.84
End time: 723.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right and there's been discussion the environment minister in Germany last year said that he thought they should ban sales of the iPad in Germany  Because of the non removable battery  So there's there's a growing backlash in the international community about device designs like is it to the worst you've ever seen  The worst tablet that we've ever seen is the surface Pro 2  So we took that apart last week and it got a one out of ten  I'm sorry. What was that? Was it glue?  It was glue and screws. I mean sort of unnecessary glue and screws  So where Apple's design we we thoroughly understand why they did what they did with Microsoft  We're still scratching our head a little bit trying to figure out why they pretty much says it all right there

Start time: 725.60
End time: 729.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They didn't what why  Oh

Start time: 734.00
End time: 764.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You I was watching the special earlier and it was very interesting and you were talking a lot about  Repairability and ever environmental friendliness, but I had a question that you didn't really answer  Straight up would they be able would Apple be able to make a device as  Thin and as compact if they were doing it more  Responsibly if they had a few more, you know screws if they had the battery more easily upgradable  Is that possible or not?

Start time: 766.13
End time: 784.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's a really good question  The the only way to know for sure would be to set up a design team and try to do it  And if you could do it, then it would be possible  So I can just speculate I think they could come very close  I don't know if they could get quite as them, but I think we're talking about fractions and millimeters  And I think Apple cares about fractions and millimeters

Start time: 785.02
End time: 815.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the original iPad  Was a bit thicker than the iPad air for sure  But I used to have these clips around the perimeter that held the front panel in place and made the opening procedure  Probably 10 times easier  The thing is those clips would still fit within this perimeter  So i'm not you know, like you like Kyle said we can't really speculate because we're not designing these things  But just from the looks of it, I don't see a reason why they couldn't do the same thing with the iPad air

Start time: 816.54
End time: 833.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Apple's design team starts with constraints  There's a management Tim Cook and Johnny say this is what the product is going to be and then the designers and engineers have to  Figure that out and if a replaceable battery was a design constraint  I think Apple's engineers could create a phenomenally elegant tablet with a removable battery

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kyle Weins, ifixit.com Miro. Thank you for joining us  It seems like you're an hour later almost done. We're almost done. So we've got I mean, I've got the cables out

Start time: 845.30
End time: 852.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is almost empty. You can see we've got the SIM card left, which is glued down  So we got unglued ash and some of the buttons around

Start time: 853.50
End time: 858.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now here's the question. Can you put that back together again? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, okay. This will go back together

Start time: 858.88
End time: 861.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This might be my new iPad. Oh awesome. You're a brave man Kyle

Start time: 863.03
End time: 891.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I fix it comm if you want to see the full tear down their philosophy  Which I completely agree with is you own it you ought to be able to fix it repair it play with it  But also even farther than that you got to consider recyclability and reusability  These things are these things could go ten years if you could replace the battery the solid-state stuff's not gonna fail  And I got a wonder about places like the LA School District where they float a 30 year bond  To buy every student an iPad that's gonna last two years  And they're gonna be paying for 30 years from now

Start time: 892.73
End time: 896.44

Transcript:  Doesn't make a lot of sense  You gotta have a long-term strategy with this technology

Start time: 897.48
End time: 916.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Two years is too short. Here's a question for you. Kyle. This is Miriam. Um, so is there you know  how Apple has a battery replacement program for like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro retina and  The iPhone correct? Mm-hmm. Um, there is no such thing for the iPad then no that they do they have a battery program

Start time: 916.34
End time: 941.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe it's a hundred twenty nine dollars  So the battery isn't  Yeah, it's it's pricey they won't do it under warranty they have a hundred and twenty nine dollar option  You have to give your device to them  You know, they take their time with it and get it back to you  the interesting thing is that Apple doesn't replace very many batteries and  Even at a hundred twenty nine dollars, you'd think there'd be a lot of people doing it  But I think their sales reps proactively try to talk people out of it

Start time: 942.46
End time: 945.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, why replace a battery when you could get the brand new iPad?

Start time: 947.59
End time: 959.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I did their battery replacement once on a MacBook Air 11 my first generation 11  That my spouse is currently using and we know it was $99  But it's definitely cheaper than buying a new Mac and he's perfect for a Mac

Start time: 960.98
End time: 1007.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What a hundred twenty nine dollars on a four hundred ninety nine dollar product. That's the different equation. That's one quarter of the total cost  I mean, it's three quarters of the insides as we just saw. So that's true in terms of volume. It's a great deal  Thank you, thank you Kyle. Thank you Mero. We really appreciate it. Thanks guys. I fix it calm. You guys are great  Really really love the work they do  You're watching twit with our great panel Miriam Juarez Ted Stevens Tim Stevens. Who's Ted Stevens? Am I thinking of?  Ted Bundy Alaska State Governor. That's right governor. That's right the senator from Alaska  Who could ever forget Ted Stevens?

Thanks to the FAA  They said you know what all this time?  No problem  But first a word from Citrix the makers of the great go to assist product if you're an IT  I know a lot of you are you do support for software or even just family members  You cut you might be the family IT guy or gal you need to know about go to assist  It lets you take control of your IT world from a simple cloud-based tool set gives you a great set of the things  You need the most of course everybody. I think knows go to assist as the leader in remote support  They've been doing it for years. They really do the best all the tools you need  unattended support up to eight sessions at the same time so you can install and start an install on one and move to the next one start  Another install move on move on move on  You get an assay of everything that's running on the system  But now they've got additional modules that I think are really really useful  Go to assist monitoring will crawl your network tell you all the hardware and software on it  You could set up a dashboard completely configurable with  Warnings alerts for different  You know problems that are coming up to you're running out of toner or the bandwidths down to the servers down  You can get an instant message a email a text message  they also have the room the  Service desk now which allows you to log incidents track the resolutions keep track of changes  Everything you need all at once I love all three and I want you to try all three  Free right now visit go to assist comm use the promo code twit  This will make you a support hero and if you look at been making a business maybe a managed services business  This would be a great way to take the next step up go to it's very affordable  I really like this go to assist comm the promo code is  twit  You know as long as you got the Nexus 5 I presume that Tim you're you're you've met you've ordered yours

Start time: 1135.74
End time: 1152.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have not because I'm on Verizon and of course that is the one cure is gonna be left out  Sadly  Although I'm kind of regretting my position on Verizon your rises got great coverage where I am  But sound that man they just seem to be lacking  Lacking the phones lately so no I have not ordered a Nexus 5

Start time: 1153.22
End time: 1164.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I am envious of those who did there was some debate over whether a Verizon had pissed off Google and you know that they had  Parted company, but supposedly they're working together on something for next year. Yeah, I don't know

Start time: 1164.74
End time: 1168.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean it definitely seems like that there must have been some some hurt feelings after the Nexus 7 LTE

Start time: 1170.40
End time: 1185.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Debacle which still doesn't work as just Jarvis  Verizon is supposed to be an open network the mandated to be open network by the FTC  So in theory they should be able to use the Nexus 7. There's no technical reason not they say we're still testing it

Start time: 1187.56
End time: 1226.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I say well so as far as I know the Nexus 7 works with any pretty pre-existing active. Yes, Tim, right?  Yes, but I've tested the Nexus 5 and there's nothing  So what that means to me is now I'm in a 700 megahertz area and the rises rolling out AWS support  So I can't test in AWS, but I have a feeling that perhaps the Nexus 5 will work on AWS  Verizon but only data right because the CDMA radio won't kick in unless they have the IMA slash ESN in their database  So that's interesting that's a non-issue because you can't activate it

Start time: 1226.72
End time: 1229.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because Verizon won't activate it, but you could at least use the data

Start time: 1230.38
End time: 1268.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in some AWS markets this needs to be tested. That's the theory right now who pays for that. I mean, how can they bill you?  Well, no, no, I mean you have an active SIM already you have an account. So you do have an account  So you have a SIM card  it's from like an existing device that works and you put it in the Nexus 5 and  potentially it might work on AWS a  Data only and on the Nexus 7 that's the same thing if you if you put it in but it supports 700 megahertz LTE  So it just works apparently I don't know I haven't tested it  So but but I can say that the Nexus 5 does work great on T-Mobile LTE on AT&T LTE  And I haven't tested sprint but reports are that yes, it will work on sprint

Start time: 1268.84
End time: 1283.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this AWS LTE this advanced wireless services  Is this the the next generation of LTE that will carry voice as well as data because I know they want is not LTE advanced  Which is a different thing altogether. So it's advanced wireless service, but it's not LTE advanced

Start time: 1284.62
End time: 1307.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So yeah  AWS is just a plate like a you know, it means that you're using the 7200 megahertz spectrum  You could be doing 3G HSPA plus on that like T-Mobile does right? So it's not necessarily an LTE thing  Vo over LTE which is voice over LTE is what we are all waiting for so that we can kind of break that dependency on  CDMA for voice on

Start time: 1308.52

Transcript:  Bitchy about storage with no removable micro SD card. I will be very well. I don't care about that  You know the s I think SD cards are overrated because  Android and most other operating systems don't really use it as it's not equal to the internal memory  Some apps can be moved there. Not if they use widgets you can store pictures there, but if you're using burst mode  It's too slow. So you have to save it to the internal memory  It's just not it's not as it's not as it's not like oh good. You're extending the memory by 64 gigs

Start time: 1421.32
End time: 1474.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's definitely the redheaded stepchild of storage on your phone for sure  But but you can set up Spotify for example to cash to your SD card  Which is what I do and you can download your music there too, which is again what I do  We have for photography and for high-access stuff  You definitely need it internally and I think it probably does slow your phone down  If you have apps running up there if you have a lot of stuff coming off of there  But still it's a nice option to have for that stuff that you don't need to access it as often and it is frustrating  It's been frustrating to see some devices be kind of gimped on rising  You know, they'll have a removal storage on other carriers or they'll even have things like, you know  I have the note 2 and on the Verizon version  They removed the widget to turn off Wi-Fi just because they want you on cellular data more often  And you only see that on the Verizon version  They remove the setting to turn off Wi-Fi you have to dig into the menu to turn on and off Wi-Fi  I hate that. It's the only carrier that you have to do that on too. If you go get the AT&T note 2 it's right there

Transcript:  I think that it you know checks all the box in terms of specs  But the software is a hassle like most of these skin phone. So this basically removes, you know, you lose the  You lose the skin in here, which is great  And you get a slightly small screen five inches of 5.2 and 8 megapixel versus 13 megapixel shooter  But you you keep the OIS the optical image stabilization  which I think is one of the most significant thing any phone should have today and  To be noted Samsung does not have yet on any other phones  interesting so the shooter is significantly better than Nexus 4  It's still there's a there's a lack of consistency in  In Android cameras and Android imaging software that is very very frustrating  If you pull out an iPhone 5 5c or 5s and you shoot a picture  You're pretty much guaranteed to great great shot every time within this limitations of the hardware  Does no is on iPhones yet, but it still works really well  You pull on an Android device and it's a crap shoot and and with the Nexus 5 you still have that  tremendously  Horrendously bad camera from from Google the default Android camera. I it's a total mess and  Yes, they've added something called HDR plus which works  fantastically well  But ultimately you're looking at you know, pretty poor, you know, pretty poor experience and that's what I see

Transcript:  Yeah, because Apple's just prioritize that they've just really put the effort into it, you know what I'm saying  It's like that's their priority is they want to make sure you get a great shot every time  Yeah, and I think somehow the Android cameras just they not good  It just don't they just don't seem to care as much and and I know that you know  Google's it's surprising to me that a company like Google that you know has Google plus and all this photography stuff and and  Vic is a big photography guy and yet the viewfinder on the Nexus 5 is still landscape and but the pictures you take are still  Four by three so you can never frame a shot properly  Like to this day they still have that bug in there. I'll show you  So you're saying?

Start time: 1664.14
End time: 1676.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1741.56
End time: 1767.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because there's no low-level access to the imaging processor. And so the camera apps that you get there some of them are very good  I'm very happy with capture Pro which I'm using  but they  They're limited because they can only access the API's that Android exposes so they can change things like white balance and  Basic the basic settings but they cannot like for example turn on HDR plus  Because that's like a baked-in feature the image processor for the Nexus 5

I wear  Google glass like I wear everybody wants to be in this  Wearable business, but nobody's kind of licked it, you know, you have a unique perspective marian moving over towards to pebble now  Which is another one of the one of the pioneer?  Wearable watches

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um, yeah, so  I think you know, I welcome why we and i'm happy to see some competition  But I think they're kind of doing it wrong in the sense that they're forgetting what a watch is all about which is simplicity  And design and colors and materials and choices  And you know people easily spend 200 on a watch that just tells the time and has maybe an alarm and a stopwatch  But but you know, so, you know  To remain competitive you have to be affordable, but you also have to remember it's going to be a watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean this I I  This depends on the people you talk to right?  I mean, I think personally I would love to have more variety in choices for pebble and colors and in shapes  But I think that um, it's not  You know, it's we're not there yet. I think that you know, if you look at the variety of watches out there  Like, you know, we need to be able to bring that to fruition and yet make it a connected device that you know  Enhances your phone experience, right?  Well, what what pebble did very well, I think this you know, hold on a second

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was just going to say what pebble did really well and which is very important in on the in this market  Is that pebble knew what it was from the beginning or what it wanted to be?  And I think that's going to be really key because these watches by sheer reason of form factor can't be everything  They can't be a mini phone  So you have to choose your battles and execute really really well on them and pebble did that it chose something that was simple  That it knew it could execute on and and it works for the people who want that

Start time: 2736.22
End time: 2784.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that's exactly the point is that we're trying not to have a phone on your wrist  We're trying to be a window into your phone that brings you tiny little moments of awesome tiny  You know tiny experiences basically that are delightful and that's really what it's about  And if you look at the specs on our watch, that's you know  Compared to like a gear or even what and what google and apple are working on  I mean  We're not even trying to be in the same league because we don't believe that's where you want to be  Where you want to be is power efficient  You know one week battery life you want to be waterproof because everybody forgets to take their watch off when they go in the shower  And you know and swimming and that brings up the whole ecosystem of apps around, you know  Playing in in in the water and then there is uh, you know  The other thing is cross-platform is a huge deal. You have to support more than you know, one device or two devices

Start time: 2785.14
End time: 2792.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 2794.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was a pebble contributor. I have a pebble. I've wore the gear for a week  I've tried a lot of these devices. None of them stay on my wrist for very long. I like real watches. I I love watches  but the real watches

Start time: 2813.98
End time: 2878.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or use the real watches have a a real, um, they're jewelry, right?  So there's something about it, but I think it's a really exciting  area right now because we're sort of at this  stage where we know what can be done currently kind of like  Before the iphone arrived or before the ipad arrived its smartphone smartphones existed but not quite  the the cool the the thing that really worked that clicked and this is the same thing with the  The tablets so I don't know if apple is going to crack that that crack the uh, the the watch thing  Maybe google will but it feels like whatever will work if it does happen is going to be something  Slightly different in a way that we can't really think of now  so it's it's  Really difficult to try and imagine what it's going to be because it's probably going to be something that  we're thinking in the within the frame of what we know today for these devices and  That's probably not what's going to be very successful to the extent that those companies want those products to be

Uh, he's the fat co-founder and vp of operations at simple bills corporation  You know what they didn't tell me is what simple bills?  Does we could guess it's maybe billing made simple. I don't know  but uh  One of the things that they end up doing is uh sending out a lot of mailings  He says we used to carry our mail to the post office and wait in line  I don't know why they would do that  Oh, that's neat. They take all the bills and they put them together and if you've got roommates they divide it up clever clever business  Now he uses stamps.com.

Let's talk about the ipad  Air the new thin ipad we took it apart at the beginning of the show, but tim stevens  You've actually spent some time. How long have you had to review it?

Start time: 3614.74
End time: 3726.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had um, let's say about a week to review the ipad. It's a fair amount of time. And yeah, I um  Found myself quite quite enamored with the thing  I mean, it's obviously nothing significantly different from a usability standpoint from the fourth generation ipad  But I always found the the older ipads to be like surprisingly heavy every time I pick it up  I think oh this thing's heavier than it should be and now you know, it feels lighter than it should be  I remember the first time I picked up an ipad mini last year and I was I was surprised at how thin and light it was  As much that that same sort of initial sensation when you pick up the new ipad air. It's very thin very light  But yet, uh impressively the battery life test that we ran and came out almost exactly the same as the fourth gen ipad  So it scored I think 13 hours on our  Our rundown test which is exactly the same as last year's  And that's despite having about one third less battery  I think if I remember correctly from from the ethics of guys were saying before  So it's quite impressive and the the benchmarks are you know off the charts compared to last year. It's roughly, you know  75 200 faster than than last year's model in most in most tests, which is which is again quite impressive considering you got less battery on board  Uh indeed in some of the benchmarks the single core performance of the the a7 was better than the dual core performance of the  A6x from last year. So that's also impressive. Um, it is running slightly faster than the a7 in the iphone 5s  I think it's 100 megahertz faster  So it's clocked up a bit and i'm actually curious to see what they clock the a7 at in the the ipad mini retina  That's coming up. I'm wondering if they'll keep that at the iphone 5s speed  Maybe to give the air a bit of an advantage on the performance side. I don't know just scheming a little bit there  But but performance was great better. Life is great. It's really thin really light  I think I like the new shape a lot better. It's more comfortable in the hand  You can find the buttons a lot more easily my only complaints were one which is kind of minor  There are stereo speakers now, which is nice, but they're both on the same side, which is unfortunate  I would have liked to see one of the speakers on the top  So when you hold it sideways, you actually get stereo sound they're about as close together as stereo speakers could get

Start time: 3726.50
End time: 3731.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's better than before but separated by the by the lightning cable for it for right?

Start time: 3731.98
End time: 3782.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and it is much louder than before too. So that's good  But uh, but it would have been nice if they put the other speaker on the top where it should be the other complaint  Of course is the lack of touch id  That's the fingerprint sensor in the iphone 5s, of course  Uh, and while you know most ipads never leave the home according to to most studies eventually  So security is not really an issue here as much but still it's more of a convenience thing for me because you know  Every time you buy something in the itunes app store download a song or something like that  You get to type in your password, which is really annoying  But on the iphone 5s, of course, you just hit the home button with your finger and you get signed in automatically  So it does spoil you doesn't it after you use that for a little while you it's just like keyless entry on a car or something  Like that, you know if you ever go to a car that doesn't have that you're like, I don't open the door again  So the first time I turned on the ipad air I I had my finger  I hit the home button held my finger there and was thinking what's wrong with this ipad?  It won't sign me in and then I had to type in my password

Start time: 3782.22
End time: 3791.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think as run with scissors does in it says in the chat room that apple is slow playing it that they could  Put a sensor on here, but that gives them something to sell next year, right?

Start time: 3791.50
End time: 3822.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm inclined to think so if you look at what they did with siri last year coming out  I think it was last year in the forest first, uh, so two years ago  I'm sorry was in the forest first and then it came out later  Uh, I think it's very similar here  We'll probably see it on the next generation ipad and it'll be something exclusive for the 5s for a little while  But then again, you know  It's possible that came late to the game and and the the ipad design is a little bit further along and maybe they couldn't fit it  In there, um, and or maybe it's the thickness thing too that the the ipad air is thinner  But yeah, i'm not i'm not sure if anything it might give them something extra throw in supply constraints

Start time: 3822.76
End time: 3828.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It could be that too for sure. Yeah, so tim do we know if the ipad mini with retina has stereo speakers as well

Start time: 3830.46
End time: 3841.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I it should yeah, the the current mini has stereo speakers. So it does look I wasn't sure it does  Yeah, but it's the same thing. They're both on the same sides and it's it's very very difficult to to tell the two channels apart

Start time: 3841.90
End time: 3849.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's that's kind of interesting too  Is that the the for the first time the mini with retina is functionally the same as the big brother ipad it is

Start time: 3849.64
End time: 3872.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, same cpu same ram same resolution  The only question again in my mind is the clock speed on that a7 which we'll have to wait and find out  We can run some benchmarks on it. But yeah, I mean  For me, I I like last year's mini better than the fourth gen ipad and this year  I mean  I'm pretty excited to see what the the new mini with retina can do if it's got similar specs and similar battery life to  To the ipad air that that to me will be the one to get

Start time: 3873.46

Transcript:  I'm curious if you had the same reaction I did i've only had it for a couple of days  I got it on friday that I was surprised almost immediately started using in portrait mode not landscape mode  Uh the older yeah because of the narrower bezels. I just felt more comfortable  I was typing with my thumbs which I can't really do  On the previous generation's ipad it just felt natural in a portrait mode  And I think just a little bit thinner a little bit lighter was enough to make that transition  I'm a big fan of as you are the mini  And I will be in line to get the mini with retina  I I think that's the one I want i'm very excited by that too

Transcript:  I can't imagine what could be wrong with especially for hundred dollars less for similar specs if not identical specs to to the ipad air  Uh, I mean if you want the bigger display, obviously, it's it's a great tablet for sure. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it  I think it's fantastic. It's a really nice update over last year  But yeah, i'm really excited to to test out the mini apple's big problem is it's

Start time: 3923.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a lot faster, etc, etc  But I mean I could tell the difference in speed  But I didn't feel I even don't even have an ipad fourth generation  I go back to the third generation and I didn't ever feel like it was slow  And I think that's going to be a problem with consumers. They're just going to say well  Okay, but it's there's no reason to trade in my old one for a little thinner a little faster

Transcript:  What isn't that the challenge for apple is to convince people to upgrade?

Start time: 3959.08
End time: 4045.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it certainly is  And I think one of the mistakes that they've been making for the past few generations is that you know  The ipads looked exactly the same especially if you go from third to fourth generation  There's really been no differentiation between them  So having a new style at least gives people some reason to to upgrade because now they can actually look and feel something  Significantly different from before so that's nice. But but ultimately, you know, the rule of thumb is typically been  You know  If you've got last generation don't bother if you have second the second generation before  Maybe think about upgrading if you're three generations old  It's probably time to get the new one and I think that more or less rings true here  But i'm also curious if apple will come out with something new because they did change the name to be ipad air  I've been wanting them to do a pro tablet and a pro phone for a long time  And I think this is a great opportunity for them in 2014 to slot in a slightly larger more powerful  And maybe something with a stylus tablet. I think that'd be fantastic. I think the market would really really like that a stylus  I mean think about it. How many  I know  That seems like it's moving a little bit backwards  Think about it  How many apple designers and graphic engineers have some sort of a wacom stylus sitting at their desktop that they spent a ridiculous amount  Of money to get um, and if you could have an ipad that would double as that functionality  But you could also pick it up and take it to a meeting and then pick it up and take it home with you  I think a lot of apple's professional users would really really dig that sort of thing  They'd pay big bucks for that sort of thing too  And it'd be an interesting product I would love to see that kind of thing  I don't know whether we'll actually see it, but I think there'd be I think that'd be pretty cool a product

He's not the only one calling for this and I understand that  Well, I'm gonna be frank if you play with a note three or the note two or even the note one you realize  There is some value to a pressure sensitive stylus  On a tablet but remember that steve jobs the big thing when he released the when they announced the iphone was no

Transcript:  Stylus your finger is the stylus. Yeah, if you see a stylus you blew it was just quote  Task manager too, but she said I think you could argue that being able to kill tasks in in ios  Is something of a task manager  but you know he was talking about the usability of  keyboards and things like that on a smartphone and ultimately, you know, there have been  Stylists on on apples for forever  And I don't think that would be breaking anything  But but ultimately he also said, you know, this is the right size for the phone and they change that too  And you know rules are meant to be broken.

I mean the look and the feel and the styling it's not recyclable  I'm we know it's not repairable, but it does it really feels good  In the hand that having been said I am a mini fan. I I wonder I don't know if they've broken down the sales figures  I feel like the mini must be the  That that's the form factor people really want right?  Most of the people definitely

Transcript:  It does seem like it's the most popular of the of the of their uh tablets  And especially now that the retina is going to be available. That's what everyone was waiting for  That's the one yeah  and but you know the thing is that the ipad air is closer in weight to the to the the  Mini than it is to the previous uh full size generation, right?  So that's also and when the menu came out everyone was puzzled by the price  But it seems that's really not that important for people who want that tablet and it's selling really well, so um  it wouldn't surprise me at all that it's selling even better than the uh,  the full-sized ipad

Yeah, whereas everybody else is really struggling to make that work  But lenovo's been doing yoga is greater on their second generation yoga's now and they've got you know  I think three different model yogas now and they're all really nice  So lenova's got that figured out. They definitely could use some help on the smartphone side of things  I think but but ultimately, you know, I don't think I mean  I think they're probably looking for more perspective on the u.s market and ashton could probably help in that regard to some degree  And it can certainly help they think anyway to to raise the the brand awareness  But um, but man, it's just this has never worked in the past and I just don't think it's going to work here

I remember 13 years  Uh, and I you know, I was about to kill somebody commuting two hours a day. It was just a nightmare  I was so tired of the commute and so tired of bad traffic and rush hour  And that's when it really changed my life because I started listening to audiobooks and all of a sudden  I don't want to get out of the car. I drive around the block a couple extra times at the gym on the treadmill  Nothing more boring, but boy, it sure is great  To listen to books from audible.com.

Transcript:  It was interesting. They said anything less than two pounds, which was an odd sort of distinction for me  So, you know you couldn't theoretically get away with I think like an 11 inch air  So just under two pounds around two  So I don't think they would let anybody with a laptop on but that was their the rule of thumb  Anyway, i'm guessing that'll get refined. The other thing to note is that if you're on a delta connection flight  Which is I think there's seven airlines included there. You will not be able to do this  It's only delta the main delta flights any delta connection  You'll still have to turn your devices off and they said it's coming soon, but they didn't know when apparently jet blue watches this show

Why do I I used to buy people magazine the only time I ever read people magazine is for air flights take off and landing  so at least I wouldn't have to look out the window and

Transcript:  I'm definitely concerned about what this means for the printing industry because I have a couple magazine subscriptions that I  I pretty much have exclusively for flights  I'll get a magazine and i'll put it in my bag and i'll try to forget about it until the flight then i'll read it  On the flight and nowhere else and now I don't really need those anymore

Start time: 5101.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's just the distraction thing  I think that they wanted people to pay attention and if you know if there is something that's going to go wrong in the flight  I think that's the time is most likely to happen and that's the time that they want to be paying attention  But ultimately, you know there's in-flight entertainment and a lot of those systems work during takeoff and landing you can listen to the radio  during takeoff and landing  So I think that's a little bit of a dubious thing  The other thing is I don't think they want these devices flying around if there's a some sort of an accident. Yeah, something goes wrong

Transcript:  Now I am glad that they and this is what i'm going to make this point that they did not approve the use of cell phones in flight  Uh the last thing you want it's such a pain in the butt when somebody's sitting next to you going yeah  And then another thing I told him you can take this job and nobody talks at a normal voice on a cell phone  They're all shouting  That would be the end of the world if you ask me now, I don't think that's an faa decision  I think that is i've been told that has to do with the fcc  And the real issue is cell carriers don't want it because of the rapid handoffs if you've got somebody flying  600 miles an hour cell site to cell site to cell site.

It's been  Probably around five years when people started having real smartphones  And of course with the administration's glacial pace, it's going to take a little bit of time, but  In this case, we all know that this is probably not something bad and probably nothing's going to happen  But don't you want them to make sure?

So so you still want I understand that it's unbearable to you know, not have your ipad to play on for 10 minutes  but  I  Understand that they wanted to make sure now did they actually use this time to make sure?  I guess there's probably a little bit of they also didn't want to be the first people to say  You know what go ahead use it and then make a mistake  But still i'm not  I'm not i'm what i'm saying is we didn't want them to just hand it, you know  Phone it in and just say oh, it's all right.

Transcript:  This is very weird  you know there  obviously brands have become very aware of uh  How important it is to interact in social media? There's a very interesting article. I think it was in the sunday times  uh  Today about gary vaynerchuk, which and I didn't even know  But gary is no longer, you know for a long time. He was doing wine library tv  He got very well known as a podcaster and it was his dad's wine business  But apparently a couple of years ago, he started  his own  social  Media  agency  So he's actually selling let me go to the front page of this article. Here's gary with his team. He's selling  You know to to big companies like general electric social media advice and one of the things gary says  His uh, his new book is called  um  Let me see it has the title here jab jab jab right hook  And the idea is that you jab somebody on twitter as as by the way jet blue is doing jab jab jab  See he what gary does for instance to say what can I do for you any of you any of my followers?  And somebody says get me a cheeseburger and a cheeseburger arrives the next day at the guy's house. That's the jab  You'll do that three times. But then the right hook is now  Hey, have you bought my book and the guy says well i'm compelled to at this point  and  And so basically the premise of apparently this company is everything that goes on in twitter is about selling  I really hate that  And I that makes me sad frankly  Um, I think that's terrible. I think that's pollution  That's noise pollution  I'll get we'll get gary. I like gary gary's a friend and I uh  Going back to his he convinced ge  To mail 314 pies in march like apple pies because it was pie day  Wow, so if you tweeted about pie on pie day at march 14th ge sent you a pie not but only the first  Get it 3.14159 only the first 314  people  Is that a great strategy for general electric?

No, he's like an ad agency counseling. Yeah  Um, they they want to get they want to get some marketing. It's it's out of the marketing budget  So they're not doing the twitter thing out of the goodness of their heart  I'm sure some of it has to do with customer satisfaction, but  a lot of it is also  you know communication and and uh marketing so  in that sense the the the the cost of  314 pies  Uh to get your name mentioned again and again, you know if what is it now six seven eight months later on this show  We're mentioning it new york times just mentioned it

I like gary. We'll have them on i'll ask him gary. What the hell?  Uh, by the way, we use his last name as a swear filter whenever a swear word appears in the chat room  We replace it with veiner chuck  Seriously  I don't know why we've done that for years because it sounds like it's it's benign, but it sounds like maybe you're swearing  You veiner chuck

He's upset  He gets mad when I start messing with a chat like this. I'm sorry dan. Don't ban me  Don't  Netflix is going to start running 4k videos  next year even though  No one has the bandwidth  People do have 4k displays. There are a lot of cheap 4k displays this  Ultra hd has not been defined yet. The color space is not defined  The only thing in fact that defined is the resolution according to scott wilkinson our home theater geek  So we're in early days of uhd. So be silly to buy a uhd tv right now  However, if you want to see what 4k looks like on your 4k display and you have the bandwidth  There are seven videos in the netflix catalog  With in 4k including el fuente  24 mp  Which is an example of 4k at 24 frames per second includes  People riding on bicycles scenes of a wholesale produce market and kids playing in a fountain  Gripping content  from netflix  I might uh, let's let's start watching  El fuente it's only eight minutes long.

Transcript:  So where do you guys pull on the uh on the 4k thing because every time I talk about it  With I have a cousin who's completely he goes berserk every time I mention 4k because he says  Anyone who's going to be watching something at a reasonable distance is not going to see the difference between hd and uhd  and and apparently he  Threw a bunch of graphs at me that prove beyond any reasonable doubt  That the the distance at which it becomes discernible  Is too uh short for anyone to be watching their tv at that distance  uh, is there any truth to that or  What do you guys think?

Start time: 5999.34
End time: 6032.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think it's like pixel them but um, you know typically it's in a uh, like a convention setting  So you're never too terribly far away from them  But you know I can definitely tell the difference especially on these larger tv's 65 inches and above  I think at that point the pixel density gets so low that you can tell the difference and I think even from you know  Slightly greater than average watching distance, you know 10 to 15 feet  I think you'd probably be able to tell difference but it's not going to be the same sort of thing that we saw  Going from you know 480 to uh to 1080p. That's a huge difference  But as we as these panels keep getting bigger, I think that that that resolution will will continue to become more important

Start time: 6035.28

Start time: 6043.88
End time: 6075.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me let miriam say something and then I was just gonna say it's like pixel density on on phones, right?  You know you benefit from higher pixel density for other things like font rendering for example  So i'm not convinced that it doesn't matter but I think tim's right you need to see it on large large devices, right?  And also the other thing that i've noticed that really makes a difference is you know  I've seen 8k tv's at cs and you can tell the difference so  It's like I don't know. I mean I think 4k is not a gimmick  I just think it's how it's set up and implemented that matters, you know

Start time: 6076.12
End time: 6149.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the the argument that your friend's making petrick is the retina  Is what retina is all about apple which is a marketing term for apple which is not any particular pixel density, but whatever  Density is required so that you don't see a pixel at the normal  Viewing distance and that a 1080p tv at 10 feet is retina  Even though its display is not super high res because it's of its distance  And when you hold a phone closer, you've got to have a higher pixel density for it to be  Retina I think though and maybe this is that same voodoo argument that you know  Vinyl advocates, you know  Use to say vinyl is better than digital, but I think there is something that may not be measurable  But you definitely your brain  Has a different experience of 4k and if you've seen a lot of 4k and we've all seen it at the trade shows  It just looks real  Uh and and even even on a on a small display I was very surprised sony had small 4k displays, you know  20 inches and  Like that that were used in video production and even there now there you're not 10 feet away  You're maybe only three or four feet away. But even there there's something about it that makes it look more real. I think your brain does  See it as reality. It looks like you're looking through a window

Start time: 6150.38
End time: 6166.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's funny. I I did see a couple of 4k displays and it didn't  Really do anything for me  But then again, I also didn't I wasn't blown away by the retina displays on the you know, the first portable devices. It was nice but  Didn't blow me away. So maybe i'm uh, i'm a special case

Start time: 6167.16
End time: 6220.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, maybe that some people don't don't notice it. I hate 3d for instance  I think that was a big gimmick but and I think 4k will probably end up being a little bit of a gimmick  Because these companies are going bankrupt. They can't sell tvs. Nobody's buying hd tvs anymore  So they've got to find a new thing to get you back, you know, you're happy damn it  You're not supposed to be happy with your tv. You gotta buy a new one  Uh, it's a tough market out there. All of these companies are struggling losing money like crazy  Um, I I personally think 4k is is where tv should go. I think 4k and high framing  You know, this is what james cameron the titanic and avatar guy has been advocating  Movies should be sat not only at a super high resolution  But also at a much higher frame rate and when you get 4k at 60 frames or more per second  It looks pretty darn good. I think it is the difference between sd and hd  It's amazing

Start time: 6221.00
End time: 6241.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think frame rate really matters and I think that um,  I think you have to combine higher res and frame rate to really get on the effect and  Even like if you'd get one of them you kind of get halfway there, you know what i'm saying like  4k but 30 frames per second or even 1080p at 60 frames a second you kind of want  Your brain does something there, right? Yep

Start time: 6242.82
End time: 6281.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now the issue of course is content and it's just for netflix to say 4k  Streaming is nuts because it's going to be compressed to hell. I mean, it's not going to look good  You can get 4k on youtube right now, but you wouldn't know the difference  Anyway, I I think it's going to come I don't know how the content is going to be delivered what sony does they give you a  Uh, is it the red ray they give you the special player  They give you a hard drive with 50 downloads movies. Yeah over time. Yeah  And then the the red folks are doing a blu-ray sequel they hope called red ray  I think it's called red ray. That'll be a higher density  And big enough presumably to accommodate uh 4k

Transcript:  It was like to be able to do both without alienating that core tech  Audience is a very difficult thing and I think you know, that's if there's some negative feedback  And we're hearing some of that now about the verge is that people don't you know  It's hard to draw the line between those two things and to draw people in especially when so much of your content is tech focused  Right, you know if you're then mixing in some some kind of non-sequitur stuff as well  It doesn't really doesn't really fly but ultimately, you know  The tech news scene is is getting more challenging because these companies can distribute their own news as effectively as any of us can  So, you know if your bread and butter is covering tech news, that's going to become a bit of a challenge  So it becomes more of how much value can you add to that news?  How much perspective can you add to that news and how much opinion can you add to that news?  And I think that I mean that's that's ultimately what we're kind of doing now. We're talking about not just what happened  But what we think about it. So, you know in that regard, I hope that we're we're safe

They were one of the the big sources, right?  but now nowadays  Mashable has become something different and that's great for them. It's a it's a good business  But it's just it becomes something different and you know, someone else took their place and if the verge diverges  Into something different as well  I'm sure someone else will come and take their place because there is  a demand for for tech news and tech only websites and there are you know, lots that are very good still but  Including in podcasting there is a demand for people who talk about tech only all the time and you do a two-hour show  On one week's news, right?
