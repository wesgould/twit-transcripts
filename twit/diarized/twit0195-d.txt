Hi this is Leo Laporte before we begin the show a  program note I had a great interview with Stephen Wolfram the creator of Wolfram Alpha on Saturday  right about when they were launching the product he talked about how Wolfram Alpha was created what  its point is how it works I think it was very interesting about a half-hour interview and I  decided to stick it at the end of this podcast so we're about to begin twit I hope you'll enjoy  it and then stick around afterwards for a special half-hour interview with Stephen Wolfram thanks.  This is twit episode 195 and we're gathered around on a very hot Petaluma afternoon in studio  everybody's sweltering sweating and I think this is going to mean a particularly interesting twit  as people try to rush through the stories and get out of here or and or take off their clothes  starting with John C. Dvorak already in a bikini in the Speedo he's doing the Borat you know the joke  of it is I am wearing Speedos underneath wow underneath your pants go ahead let's see Mayday  Wow oh there's Speedo shoes oh there's Speedo shoes that's just a blatant ripoff of what I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  wearing so you can say you saw Dvorak wearing Speedos no those are those are some set of oh my  god these are Crocs oh Crocs these are like a crock of Crocs these are phony they're phony Crocs

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's what I'm saying it's a complete and utter ripoff well Crocs are crap anyway these rubber  shoes are rubber shoes or rubber shoes Mario Batalha says you can put these in the dishwasher but you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  can say I can say I was wearing Speedos I really thought you wanted me to look down your pant leg  I was kind of well yeah you were hoping you were hoping I was pretty glad that the pant went up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that way but it's funny that this way no I'm not Steve Jobs okay you could tell the party's already

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  begun to my left Becky Warley of ABC News to my right Molly would have CBS interactive we've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a distinguished party here you know what I was thinking about this on the way up this is mixed  doubles mixed doubles you're right and not only is it mixed doubles but it's a really good pairing  because Leo and I are both sort of perky bright side of life kind of people and Molly has a great  ability to rant but stay very likable about it and Dvorak is king of curmudgeon so really you  could do perky with sort of curmudgeon either way a boy girl or a girls on boys it's so interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because in fact I have a list a notebook that I do to prepare the shows and to put together the  cast and you're listed under perky I knew that she's listed under rant but nice and John is  listed under you don't have any of that look at that binder so organized oh it's upside down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  he has an algorithm for mixing actually do combination of rage and friendliness to come in not so it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really very much of a it is a cooking show it's a recipe I I always plan the the show out very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  carefully that makes me feel actually even more guilty for how often I can't I say no so that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  how I get to know what I do I want you know what I do I build the show around you if you can't show  up I change you know I then I I know where I'm you're the starting point that's helping I feel

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like you're the starting point John is impatient already let's go yeah it is about a thousand

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  degrees in here that people do they have me on the show that these guys in this chat rooms to move

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  things along right well what's important Wolfram Alpha that's another one story they started on  Friday today's the weekend they launched I talked to Stephen Wolfram yesterday I had a good long  interview with him so what do you think of Wolfram why don't you back out because I've seen it I get

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the general gist but going into this story I had no idea what the heck this was about so can somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  do the summation thumbnail Stephen Wolfram is a physicist by training he went to Caltech got his  PhD in physics at Caltech at the age of 20 at the age of 22 when the MacArthur grant the youngest  recipient ever of the genius prize he became very interested in computational physics and really  became a computer whiz and believes that computers can be used to solve physics problems to discover  new physical theorems in fact he's gone so far now he's written a science book 1200 page kind of  manifesto about physics in which he says you know I think that computational physics is the future  you and the idea is to write every possible program and you'll find in every possible program  you'll learn all sorts of new things he created a program called mathematics it's a $2,000 program  it's used by mathematicians mathematics students very popular been around for 20 years yeah have

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you know anything about Mathematica John I was I think I may have been the first guy to plug it you  discovered it I think so this is when I was I think this was that info world or something it was very

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  innovative still is it's a notebook format you can it's freeform you write equations it'll graph  them and it's very and it has its own symbolic language yeah and that's kind of key because  what he then did was and this was five years ago did it completely stealthily he said we're gonna  try to create a computational engine for the internet based on this symbolic language in  Mathematica that will allow people to essentially compute anything solve solve any problem by taking  arbitrary data sets and and and asking questions about those data sets he's been doing this for  five years it only became public a few months ago he I asked him why you know why stealth he said  because I know if it would work or not he said it couldn't even work until very recently you didn't  have the computational power to make this happen so he went online this weekend it looks on the  surface of it I think this is a problem for him at like Google mm-hmm looks like a search engine  it ain't a search engine that's not you're supposed to you're supposed to enter in I mean I'm not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  clear on how to use it yeah there was a great headline in PC world actually about it that just  said I am NOT smart enough for Wolfram Alpha and that's kind of how I feel like for one thing I can  barely say it without saying wolf from alfra I am NOT smart enough for Wolfgang Puck like I went  there and I just tried to enter something and nothing happened me too but luckily he has a few  there are suggestions on the side like things to enter and then if you enter all those you enter

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  San Francisco and you get a whole bunch of stuff no idea I know but it's a very handy use of your

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  talk show host yes that's true it what it basically does is if you enter a query that it has the right  kind of data set for it it spits out a report I mean you get graphs and you get stats and you get

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and you can make a PDF of it and put it in somebody's binder and the next thing you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're you look like a genius yeah it's basically just homework done hmm it's you know he said I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  asked him and he said I said if do you ever get any surprising results he said oh every time I  use it I get unusual results he says for instance if you put in a first name one of the things you'll  see it plots first names against when they were used and so forth he says I can give you your life  expectancy basis your first name statistically because Molly was only used you know in these  years and the chances are you're a certain age and and and so it has life expectancy information  it has you know it's so it's combining databases information databases in unusual ways it uses  Mathematica underlying he says every query is converted to a symbolic mathematical query it's  it's very heavy anyway so people should check it out it seems just from looking at before the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's not totally non-sequitur I mean it just seems so random and you just have to wonder if  expectations being high people I think the problem is that people immediately confused with Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and they call it a search engine it's neither it's not to be it's not a competitor to Google in fact  they have a Google link on it and it's not a search engine by any means well it's very hard to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  classify something else and it's a little bit hard to determine what you're gonna get what it is is  basically just wonderful information gathering and kind of extreme geekery I don't think that you know  in terms of the rest of the world they're gonna be talking about Wolfram Alfaffa nearly as much as we  are and they're not gonna be talking about it all because it's freaking impossible to say but it but I think it is almost just like fun data mining like  it's fun I put my name in turns out there's only 124,956 people alive today named Molly isn't that cool yeah right it's just me yet another time sink

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah he said the other thing he said there's a learning curve and he said that as people use it they he's  watched even over the last 48 hours and people have been asking better and better questions he's so I think  that some of it is that he I asked him what's your goal for this in five or ten years he said eventually  I want this to be you can ask a question and it will it will come anything that's computational it will be able to solve just kind of a universal computational engine  I'm not asked Jeeves goal no no actually that's Jeeves was to do regular searches using a standard language query right but it was still a search engine so the difference is Google or ask Jeeves is only searching what somebody has already answered and put on the net

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah but in his own fact he says you have to ask something that's already known he says that in his own fact but then he draws these relational connections right he makes relationships what the engine does is make relationships between data and spit out other knowledge basically like it sort of adds to the body of knowledge about something that's already known I guess is this just worship of a guy who happens to be obscenely smart who is pandering to humanity skeptical one here I  think that's exactly that's the question though you look at something like this and either the guy is a crackpot or he's a genius and weren't and I can't figure it out I think it's the death of thought this thing because really got you think about it this is the kind of thing that that means that in the future you don't actually have to know anything yourself and you don't have to do any of your own kind of drawing of relationships between the data in your head and the data that you're trying to use it for ten minutes and the scene doesn't work like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and then boom I don't think it's going to replace thought effect I think the idea is you think most of the thought is asking the right query and then finding out interesting relationships yes I don't know you know I I like that you very seriously said I don't think this is going to replace thought I don't know hey I listen to you and I pay attention to what you say I'm full of it I have to say I just honor the guy because it takes a grandiose vision which this clearly is to make any progress unless you say  man can fly and we're going to figure out how or maybe it's possible to make a machine and a website that could solve every problem you don't try these things so I admire him I mean that's a it's a gutsy thing to do I'm sorry Dave message yeah they're really overburdened yeah of course everyone that's been listening to us is going in all honesty though I think that this is phenomenal I think that the way that search was the first great frontier in terms of breaking down all of I mean all of the world's information is accessible

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  at our fingertips and the the categorization and the discovery of that information it's a myth and then the relationships between all of those different data sets are kind of the key to to accessing any of this to have a great myth well it's all of the world's information is not at our fingertips it is now with Wolfram no it's just a bunch of some information more and more more and more and and the computer what's what's changed is that could most that's nice what's that what and what changes the computers give you the ability to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  process this you know in the past you could put everything online but who could find anything now you have the capability of finding it and then the next step is to make some sense out of it this is the next step but I think it makes perfect sense it's brilliant I hope he succeeds but meanwhile he succeeded meanwhile on Twitter  I do all the Twitter stories we have a new way of doing Twitter I do all the Twitter stories at the at the very end of the show and I tell people we're gonna do Twitter now you know somebody wrote a program to Twitter ghetto to take Twitter out of twit so it analyzes the show it's a Python program analyzes the show and if the word Twitter is in the sense it takes this it takes a sentence out and it also could be the other way where you take everything but Twitter out so you get your choice I'd like the guy who did that I wanted to hear from him he's brilliant isn't he yeah is that  great yeah I wanted I'm serious I want that guy he did it because of you you know John at DeVarock.org you created that need there's actually a lot of stories and we're gonna get through them fast netbook demand dropped 26% in the first quarter remember we were saying netbooks are the next big thing apparently not I think that sales over Christmas I'm sorry I can't think what I know you just put some bourbon in his slushy I know for God's sake man for God's sake give him something else to slurp at demand for that  slurping sound has decreased 100% in the last 10 minutes. Looking up on Wolfram. This is this is according to market watcher display search and they base this on display demand 5.9 million netbooks shipped worldwide first quarter down 26% from the 8 million in Q4 now there's two possibilities one is there to even to even a netbook is too expensive in the modern economy people  can't even afford those or people got him and realize now Molly Woods using the Vivian Tam Dell mini right now the HP mini HP I'm sorry yeah I see yeah who was free yeah but I wonder if people are discovering maybe I wonder if people are discovering that they're not powerful enough but you I don't think that it's about reacting to the netbooks themselves I mean I think that you hit a market really well they saw the price point they jumped on it and then those that had need have been saturated

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with them and I think this is good news for you guys are hardware manufacturers isn't it beautiful yeah it's gorgeous yeah absolutely love it so did you see the Acer story Acer shipments of netbooks up 300% profits down 30% well that's problem for Intel too because the atom is not a very profitable processor Intel's not so happy about all this so how come their profits are the Acer's profits are down I think there's zero margin on these netbooks and I think that they actually lost market share on some of their other books that have higher profit margin because they were selling did you see the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  seashell you're gonna want one of these Molly it's gonna replace your Vivian Tam this the new Acer EPC it's thin have you been to Della.com no let's talk about Della it's it's selling selling Dell computers to gals to the ladies the ladies see now this is the kind of thing that frequently makes me angry actually that redirected to weddingchannel.com it's actually Dell you have to go through Dell's website it's not Della.com apologies so the idea in fact I love the headline I can't remember who said it it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a using you know selling computers the 1959 style it's it's really I don't know a ladies let me see if I can find this I think this is good because Molly dig up my old micro times column I wrote a series of columns and micro times way back when discussing the likelihood of something like this actually emerging and then I got a bunch of great hate mail well at one point I went very far in terms of building out the idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of an electronic store that would appeal to women as opposed to the electronic stores we have now which make me want to die well there's lots of pictures as you walk in of women on the front of it this is really pretty pandering I'm not gonna lie where is it like as the woman who bought the HP mini Vivian Tam edition laptop this is a little too far Google Della it's the fourth one down well it's interesting because I think that the perception is this is some sort of a site that looks like a Massengill ad like you need to feel fresh here's the nice pink right sorry right it's not my computer is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so fresh yeah but it's not that and I think in some senses this is a natural to slam it because it does feel like it's pandering to women but on the other side of the coin it is kind of nice it's pretty you're the one about the frickin Vivian differently it's not right it's not saying you know because your purse is so heavy but you know what it is doing women as opposed to dudes but it has products tech tips and featured artists features artists like it's sort of like don't mix the content up right like I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  do I actually really like that this is an attractive nicely designed site that has products that are good-looking and reasonably priced or you know whatever maybe powerful enough and that's fine but why do you have to throw in this weird little lifestyle stuff like I don't what's giving like what is why is there a link that says giving and then there's a featured artist just because I'm a woman doesn't mean I want to give and doesn't mean I care about art I like computers but you know I mean okay then why did you get the Vivian

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tam edition because it's gorgeous the fact is if you do beautiful right then you don't have to pander to me you just do gorgeous and then I mean you know I just never pay more for it though I paid a lot more for it it's very embarrassing so there's a huge fashion tax on the Vivian Tam. Why don't you get a cheap ass decal and put it on there. I don't know I just fell in love. No no no no. Sometimes that happens. I think this is exactly. It looks like Leo's twit TV thing can you get a shot of that? No I can't get a shot of that. But you know dudes will pay a lot more for a Sony computer just because they respect the Sony name and it's like Gucci to them. What? Yeah not you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Planet are you from that anyone respects your Sony name? Not you. I'm talking about your average Joe who thinks Sony is some sort of a high-end electronics brand and they will buy a Sony laptop because it says Sony and it looks a little snazzier. Well I'm gonna posit this. Don't even get me started on the people who will buy a monster cable for any reason whatsoever. That's like no different than my Viv. But maybe what they're doing is they're saying well women want a more aesthetic site a less utilitarian more aesthetic site this is more aesthetic. I think that's true. It's prettier. That's okay. So just as you bought a more aesthetic computer you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  want any less power. It's the same computers. But don't mix the message with artists and giving. Well I don't understand the featured artist and giving. That's just a waste of space. So I'm looking at the featured artist Robin Moreno and I'm looking at it's like a blog entry and it's got one crummy comment. It's just marketing people gone haywire because really there's nothing to do for marketing people. They have to justify their existence by creating crazy content along with their websites where they're trying to sell crap. Somebody's eating a cheese sandwich that's appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It also seems a little odd. No I saw the cheese sandwich like what the H. What does she eat if it's not a cheese sandwich. It does seem a little odd. I don't eat a cheese sandwich as my entree into learning about a netbook. Like I'm capable of learning about a netbook without a cheese sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This show is already off the track. No it is pretty off the track. It's very newsworthy. I detect a little ambivalence on Dell's part because they didn't get Della.com. They've hidden it. They buried it. The URL is content.dell.com slash us slash em slash home slash Della dot A-S-P-X. They're a little they're a little ambivalent themselves. They're waiting to hear what we say about it. We have a website for women. Yeah we do. We have a marketing play. We have a women play. That's how they talk right. We have a women play. Totally. It's called Della. We've got Della Burke lined up to be our show. Do you think the Vivian

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tam edition sold well. No. Really. No I don't know. I've never seen another one in the wild but apparently recently I got some emails that said it showed up on Desperate Housewives which bummed me out. I think Veronica. Why. No I don't think so. Somebody I know. So why would the Desperate Housewives plug bum you out. Because you hate that show. No because that made me think like oh now it's totally mainstream. I had that moment. My favorite band just got huge. It's like showing up at a party with somebody else wearing a dress. They never buy a Macintosh. They're on every TV show. Well I.  I know or that Panasonic. She's very anti Macintosh John. You should know that. I'm the only person in the world who switched back. Switch. I'm not making that up. I did. She's an anti anti. She wants to be a smoke smoker someday. I can't stand a computer that bosses me around.  Where everything works fine as long as I do it exactly the way the computer wants me to do it. And Apple has laid out the rules for me to do it that way. And if I want to do it anything any any different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not a new situation. I will lose my ever love in mind. Well that's why I'm just saying that's why. I'm going to give Molly would a reason to hate Apple in a second. Before I do I want to mention go to meeting dot com slash twit.  Go to meeting is that product from Citrix that we talk about all the time that makes your meetings more visual more vital more effective and you could try it free right now.  At go to meeting dot com slash twit. Yeah everybody drink. This is good. Air rate drink hydrate take a walk.  Unstick from the chair. John uses these ads as an opportunity to actually leave.  We all have people we have to meet within our jobs. You know I mean then the last thing nowadays you want to do is get in the car and survive swine flu in the middle seat and taking your shoes off and all that stuff. So use go to meeting.  Go to meeting means you can have a meeting that's as effective as a real life in person meeting a sales presentation or product demos you collaborate you could train we use it on Maxwell's house. He shows his screenshots that way.  You could try it free right now. I think you're going to really like this is go to meeting dot com slash twit.  For forty nine dollars a month all the meetings you want includes unlimited voice and phone over voice over IP and phone teleconferencing.  It is such a good deal and right now free. So there's no reason not to try it go to meeting dot com slash twit. I'm a fan and I know you will be to the folks at Citrix know what they're doing. Give them a try.  So Molly would. Yes sir. Apple just released an update to OS 10. That was 493 megabytes.  493 megabytes it fixed 16000 files and here's the funniest thing it makes it run better. The hackintoshes are running better they're getting better battery life on the on the on the netbooks. I don't think Apple intended that.  But this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know the funny thing about they might have wanted people to do hackintoshes.  Well but you know the funny thing about Mac upgrades unlike Windows upgrades is that every time they do one.  Well not every time but most of the time the performance of the machine actually improves when you reboot it. It usually goes faster.  Something if they fix something and it goes better with every Windows fix the machine is visibly slower out John you got slower and slower and slower to the so slow that you have to upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to say that Windows 7 though is awesome. Have you been using Windows 7?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't use anything that's in beta anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah I don't blame you but this is not in beta. This is this is ready to ready to this is cooked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's your further beef of this Mac upgrade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The size of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what?  Well that's less than half and the point one upgrade that I get from iTunes about every other freaking day.  That's another one.  That's just how they roll with the gigantic upgrade. Seriously like a point one update to iTunes will be a hundred megs.  Yeah.  Or more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't there the presumption that Mac users are higher echelon computer users who are obviously on high level broadband?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well if you're on dial up what do you do?  Are you going to be able to download a half gigabyte update on dial up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's part of the weirdness of the Apple ethos right now actually is that they can't quite decide what they want to be because here they because in the old days right the Mac was just like it's super simple and that's what you use because it's just easy and that's the Mac is the machine that people buy for their moms right now because it's just easy.  It just works like you don't have to know that much about things.  But then on the other hand you've got the terminal thing and people getting digging into the Linux the Unix kernel and really getting command line on it.  And so it's got this bizarre I think identity crisis about whether it's like a big machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're paying two thousand bucks for a computer you got broadband.  You got monster broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess that might be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  You think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who has dial up?  The question.  Well where's Wolfram Alpha when we need it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well they might just have slow DSL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe it has the answer.  Maybe somebody out there knows of some stats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I think nowadays if somebody has there's two groups that have dial up still either people who really are out of touch and don't care anymore.  In other words they have the choice but they say I can't afford to spend fifteen dollars on high speed and I'm going to get AOL dial up.  More likely though it's people who live in rural areas who have no choice right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're contemplating that or satellite and they're just saying.  Now they may have Macs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could very legitimately have Macs.  But then they're screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so because if you're outside of the broadband world why are you going to spend big money unless it's your second home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why are you going to spend big money on a computer if you're outside of the broadband world.  You're not.  What.  What.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a crack hoe.  I'm sorry.  Dot com.  Story number five.  Crack hoe dot com.  The state of Alaska sent a cease and desist letter and made copyright claims against Houston based DJ Shulatif.  Shulatif registered crack hoe dot com some years ago 1998.  Genius.  Yeah.  And it's never really had a use for it until Sarah Palin ran for vice president.  She she changed the she changed crack.  All she did was change crack hoe dot com to redirect to the official website.  She's been this domain owner not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shulatif.  Sarah Palin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sarah Palin had nothing to do with it.  Now I don't think it's illegal to redirect a domain is it.  No.  Why would it be.  Why would it be.  Well the state of Alaska thinks it is Alaska's attorney general Michael Barnhill set a cease and desist cease and desist letter to Latif.  It also asserts that crack hoe made illegal use of the official seal of state of Alaska.  In fact the site looks just like our site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well maybe there's something there.  Can't understand it.  There is no site.  It goes to Sarah Palin site.  Oh I see what you're saying.  Oh that's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is classic.  Confusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it doesn't do it.  So it's a complete server level redirect.  So it just goes straight there.  It's no wait click here.  Well I don't know.  Let's try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the great thing about everybody go to crack hoe.  Now we can't get down because all these.  She took down the redirect apparently.  She did sort of she backed down and now she just has an image of Sarah Palin and it links to the Sarah Palin.  Well that's worse.  Which is actually potentially worse but it's not a copyrighted image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you saw the image you'd realize it's the most insult.  I mean this is ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  She doesn't have that many chins in real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just such a blunt instrument.  That seems like the safest thing to use against.  What if Palin ever wore a Palin button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's there's no way they can cease and desist this person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why are this person with legal fees.  Yeah.  I mean not necessarily.  No you just ignore it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now you do what Mark Purkell my sisop does.  He loves getting those letters.  He puts them on the wall and he just says they did.  That worked for them didn't it.  Well I mean that Pirate Bay was a real target.  Most of these seasons is this was just a bluff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you hear what Pirate Bay's the latest thing they did.  They did it kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This micro payments thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No what's that.  OK so they're fine.  What was it.  Two point four million whatever.  They said OK fine.  What we're going to do is we're going to set up a micro payment site so that you can help pay our legal fees.  But we recommend you pay such a low amount that it actually costs more for them to get the payment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so the concept here is they're depositing directly into the recipient's account so that all of the banking fees are accrued by whomever is receiving Pirate Bay's.  They're calling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah they're calling it a distributed denial of dollars attack.  So they play dirty pool.  We do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they want to overload the lawyer who's collecting the settlement with Internet traffic damaging their ability to provide services.  Oh no I'm sorry that's a DDoS attack.  What they're doing is they're OK so they're they're sending they say there's a surcharge of two Swedish Kroners for the account holder.  So they suggest you send him one Swedish Kroner so that every time he gets a Kroner it costs him to.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So he caused in a hole one.  He's in the hole one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that all the while the fee is generally speaking down by most of these systems do not do in a negative in the long time in a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They just zero out.  I mean PayPal you can give them two cents and you get nothing.  Oh really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah they zero out if it's less than less than their minimum.  Yeah that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean the great thing about this great idea that it's funny it's just deviousness.  It's messy.  Those guys are troublemakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Take my word for it.  They're going to cause problems down the road.  You heard it here first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's going to be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.  How is it that we have Somali pirates and Pirate Bay all at the same time.  Do you remember that the pirates.  Pirates is a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Somali pirates are mad at Pirate Bay.  They said they're not pirates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No way.  No stop.  I'm not kidding.  You are making that up.  I am not kidding.  That's a fact.  So good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said we are pirates.  They're just nerds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who speaks for the Somali pirates.  Apparently.  Yeah is there a spokesman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That guy in New York.  What it was.  What.  We haven't heard much about him.  The one guy that had is having the time of his life.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh right.  The happiest.  The happiest pirate in the world.  He's like 18.  They're not pirates.  I am a pirate.  They're not pirates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what the Somali accent is.  That was a Bengali's accent.  This is a Bengali's accent.  That's the Muppets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am not a pirate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jami speaking of the RIAA.  Were we.  Yeah I guess we kind of were.  Sure.  Jami Thomas.  You know that poor woman.  Jami Jamie.  Jami Jamie.  Who was ordered to pay more than almost a quarter of a million dollars to the recording industry.  Then the judge decided he made a mistake.  He had been wrong about one of his instructions to the jury.  The judge said I was listening to the recording industry.  They set me up.  It was wrong.  So he said we're going to have to do this again.  You guys go to a settlement conference because we've got to figure this out.  The conference now has failed and the entire case we start over.  It's a reset next month.  It's going to be litigated again.  Again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not really a surprise.  I mean there was no way they were going to reach a settlement because she.  Yeah well she could pay him a dollar.  Here's a dollar.  A hundred million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll give you Swedish Kronas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Because she what did she made available like nine songs and they want 18 million dollars.  Two hundred thousand dollars in damages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay so the last time I was on we talked about sort of that this is their strategy just to scare people.  It's been the strategy all along.  Obviously it doesn't seem like it's the continuing strategy.  So I have a question.  Assuming that none of you guys steal music on a regular basis.  Why don't you John.  Why don't you do you steal movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I listen to classical music mostly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't steal that they're all dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just turn it on the radio.  I have a 24 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should tell you John considers Metallica classical music just so you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the music that you listen to there's no need to steal it because you have everything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't really listen to it.  No I play the radio believe it or not.  I'm like that type of person.  I have to listen to a Sunday morning opera on the you do know you know what the one I like they used to have they change it from Sunday morning to Sunday afternoon on the local classical station.  They have this this thing where they have these young prodigies that they're like nine years old and they haven't played this ridiculous stuff.  You go wow that's cool.  These kids.  I like that.  The kids are funny they go up and they do one liners with the people.  It's really an outstanding show.  Can't think of the name of it though.  Is it.  No.  So no I don't steal music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't you still music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know I guess I don't want that not a.  Who needs music.  Most music is crap.  I don't know music is cheap now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have an open vehicle.  Leo.  What.  Why don't you steal music.  I steal music.  It's cheap and mostly.  Why do you steal it.  I mean you're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually I try.  Well here's an example Coldplay just offered their album for free downloaded immediately.  Even though I'd be willing to pay for it I buy a lot of music.  I actually don't.  I haven't stolen music.  But I stole it at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I think you're fair game because you give your content away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you I'll tell you I if I go online.  To try to buy a song and I go everywhere and that song is not for sale.  Then I'm then I'm going to download it if they're not going to be where you're going to download from.  Well that's the problem you can't do it anymore.  You know I'll tell you my secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's honestly I am too lazy to steal music.  I'll tell you my secret.  Too hard.  It's easy.  Now there's enough of a barrier of entry.  Right. I got my little credit card there.  I'm good to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so easy to buy.  I don't even use a credit card.  I just click it right.  Yeah.  iTunes.  Yeah it's already.  And I mean that's the info is already in there.  It's just like the edge of their seats.  What's your secret.  Yeah what's your secret.  News groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  News group.  And here's the problem.  BitTorrent you can be tracked.  You really can't be tracked.  You're basically making a connection with somebody.  Everybody's trying everybody knows your IP address.  News groups especially if you use a site like say Super News or easy news.  They don't keep their logs.  There's no way of tracking you.  It's a completely anonymous transaction.  So you can download anything you want.  Why don't you go to the IRC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a relative who gets all his music and movies basically from news groups.  He's shameless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I think if you're going to steal music their best bet is the IRC even  though it takes forever because you have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's dangerous because you don't know where you're getting.  Well that's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The reason why people aren't stealing music is because they fear viruses.  And they're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They just found a Trojan horse in Windows the Windows 7 beta.  So if you download it from BitTorrent many people got a Trojan horse in there.  Same thing happened with I work Apple's I work.  That's the only known Apple Trojan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well OK what Trojans are associated with an MP3 file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't put a Trojan in an MP3 file but often what they'll do is they'll make a zip  or they'll disguise it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And most people don't know to distinguish between an MP3 file and the default

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  behavior of Windows is to hide the extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you download something when you get Windows the first thing you do is you go  to the tab that turns that off immediately.  I agree.  But 99 percent of people don't know they should.  And if they don't and they get Trojans well you know what can I say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are the legal implications of the RIAA posting Trojans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft's at fault.  Yeah I know they got the wrong default setting is bad.  Yeah it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean that's come up a lot that the RIAA and other companies have essentially posted  malware in on you know I think that's illegal sites and stuff which I think is  totally illegal.  It keeps happening and I don't see that that's a problem.  This has always been the argument for not the sorry what what you were getting at a  minute ago has always been the argument for cheap available easy to download DRM  free high quality music online which it's ludicrous that it's been resisted for so  long and now it's the argument for cheap easily available available DRM free easy  to obtain video content that the movie is continuing to miss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet you piracy has completely plummeted because it's so easy to get music.  I think so.  So easy.  It's so inexpensive.  I would take that bet.  Really you think I know.  Well let's find out.  Let's ask Wolfram.  Piracy is down.  I think piracy music piracy is down and I would say that video piracy is way up  television and movie piracy is way up.  But it's so cheap and easy to get music now.  Point of access is everything.  It's still too expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's dollars too high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should we know what they apparently do because Apple start charging a buck twenty  nine you know on some songs those songs are not selling well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah because that's no way too much.  Too much to be a nickel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In my day you get an album for a buck for a nickel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only people who do that are people who have Sonos and want to keep their  music for a long time and streaming around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Most music is crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well that's and that by the way is the argument for a subscription service like  Rhapsody Napster or Zune store and I load up my Zune with music for 15 bucks a month.  Actually it's five bucks because I get 10 free songs.  So in effect it's five bucks a month and I can listen to anything and I wouldn't be  honest with you.  Most of the stuff that's on my Zune I would never buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's this Microsoft ad that's going around right now.  That's thirty thousand dollars per iPod.  Yeah.  Which is 30 K.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many of you have iPods you have thirty thousand dollars worth of music.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But how many songs have I bought seven times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I actually I am a little bit tempted by the subscription model because I do  find digital media weirdly hard to keep track of.  Yeah.  Like you lose you lose stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like on the.  Well another reason to give up on the whole thing.  By the way doesn't make it very easy to deal with your digital media.  Because you've got it trapped on one iPod.  God forbid you can't just sync it with another computer.  It's the reason why getting an N.A.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  drive is worth it because if you put all your stuff on a central drive I haven't  lost any media since I did that most people end up having it hanging around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's little fragments of music on all sorts of places and I can't get it  all synced up and I just have music.  You need you need your own crawler.  Where do the twins are a little bit older because what will happen is they buy  songs my kids buy songs I bought it's on different computers it's all over the  place if I would love to do an inventory of the music in the house and get it all  together but who has time for that.  So a central drive that's every time I install it's just a computer I do that.  It's too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know my point about the whole thing and the viruses is fear is an inhibitor  to making decisions.  So if you're afraid of getting viruses if you're afraid of getting sued you won't  download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.  I think that that's probably why they seed viruses into this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had to go back to that because I don't see what the difference is between that  and say a honey pot.  Right.  I don't get it.  Same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The only reason I suggest the IRC for one thing I don't think there's much of  that going on is because I've known a couple of IRC administrators and I asked them  point blank about the music trading that goes on in some of these channels and I  said has anybody from the IRC ever come around and ask for a log of IPs or anything  from you ever.  This is never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's too arcane for them to actually pursue anyone.  It's a little like they were getting the media for it.  They'd have to explain what IRC was and every person that they're trying to scare  off would go I don't use that.  So why.  I'm glad to say the same reason newsrooms work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's too arcane and most people aren't doing it and they're not going to go  after those.  So what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The IRC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They come after me for money every year and in my paycheck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's those the revenues.  We've got some bourbon we're cooking in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We do.  Molly Wood brought me some really good.  This is this is called bullet bourbon.  Is that how you pronounce polite polite.  I don't really know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I call it bullet but I'm not sure.  I'm sure I'll be pretty good.  Bullet bourbon.  Bullet taste it Kentucky straight bourbon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well let's open her up.  I taste it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean I don't want to force anyone.  I might have a couple of shots.  Let's bring out the shot glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do we have shot glasses.  I don't think you better get shot glasses from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can pour a little on top of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The way things are going on this show.  Do we have shot glasses.  John showing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Molly and I are scantily clad and we got the bourbon open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man there was quite a.  Oh this.  It's just drinking out of the bottle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No come on.  No come on.  Just you know.  You ruined it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my god that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Nice right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very.  You've had it.  Yeah.  It's very smooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whiskey is a thing now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well before we get to that.  No there are there's quite a few more but I do want to mention Squarespace.  Have you ever tried Squarespace.  Anybody Squarespace.  There goes there goes John.  Do you Squarespace for your websites.  He says he's developing some sites.  He's got two in the oven.  For Squarespace Squarespace is I'm going to show you some Squarespace so you can see it Squarespace.  I don't want to say a blogging engine because that's the first thing it looks like.  You know it's a it's a website.  Hosted website engine that is just state of the art.  I mean it is so gorgeous in terms of capabilities.  It's not just a blog.  You you can you can put a photo gallery on there a forum maps.  There is blogging of course but it's really it's more like a website design tool.  Incredible templates very easy to modify with drag and drop.  They use Ajax so you can redesign it.  But if you're a CSS expert you have full access to the CSS to you can do anything you want because you can put JavaScript in there.  So you can you really have complete control of this site.  And I can tell you now we have we've moved Dicty Bartolo over there we're moving our tweet blog over there.  Alec Lindsay Alex Lindsay is about to move everything from Pixelcore over there.  It's just a really easy way to do a website.  Because the hosting is using a very powerful virtual server technology they can really add capacity as necessary.  You just never run out of bandwidth.  You can't break a Squarespace site.  E-commerce everything's on there.  I want you to try it free two weeks free no credit card needed.  You're just going to go and sign up right now Squarespace dot com slash twit.  Squarespace dot com slash twit.  And if you decide to sign up use twit as the promo code and you'll be able to get 10 percent off the Squarespace already low price.  I'm very these guys are brilliant programmers.  This is kind of the next gen in web design.  Squarespace dot com slash twit try it free for 14 days no commitment no credit card.  And by the way it imports from WordPress blogger movable type and type at and exports back out too.  So you're never trapped.  I think that's really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah that's actually a good one of the good things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of neat that they do that.  I mean that a lot of companies are afraid to do that because they're afraid they want to lock in and screw you.  Yeah screw them not Squarespace Squarespace dot com slash.  What it used to be in radio you couldn't have the FCC prohibited having any booze in the studio although you have there were exceptions because for instance you know you traditionally do the thing with a CHP comes in and they breathalyze you and you drink at the disc jockey gets stronger and stronger and they're testing you and they say now you're point one now you're point two.  You don't remember that.  We used to do that every year.  It was just an excuse to get sloshed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who would remember that you get drunker and drunker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Google failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah Google this week you go and you do a search.  What happened because that didn't happen to me but the Gmail and the searches.  It was in parts of the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gmail search docs voice 14 percent of users.  Wow.  Lost connectivity with the old goog.  And why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They routed all the traffic to Asia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody you somebody made a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Once again pretty much just the cruel reminder that we shouldn't be quite as dependent on the goog as we are.  Oh yeah.  No in fact and or boozy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not the last not that I mean very recently they had a configuration issue.  What is what is going on with Google.  Remember that when you go to Google and said you're a spyware site except that it said that to everybody.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which was again that was human error.  Gmail outage not that long before that I think too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this stuff that hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well but when you have that much volume I think it's really tough to test this internally before you release your fixes.  Because how do you simulate that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google is so secretive we don't really know what how this came about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds like an engineer just story two or three times today.  Yeah as far as I can tell it was they kind of soft peddled it.  They did that last time too.  They said well we did it.  It was more like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just makes you realize again the dependency is what I said.  Cloudy redundancy cloud cloud cloud problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the cloud.  I love the cloud.  I think netbooks succeed because of the cloud.  All you really need is a is an opening to the Internet.  And that's all and you got it.  That's the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think you have to in some way mirror.  You've got to have redundancies or separate systems that are local.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know once in a while you're down it just means you should go out to get some fresh air.  Come on.  It depends on your area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean by the way by the way it's officially hotter outside now than it is in here.  See it is.  Yeah I just went out there.  Sure about that.  See you thought it was bad here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really hot outside.  Crazy hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's like a hundred.  Looking forward to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean it's 94 in here according to your thing.  In this room.  Yeah.  And it's about one hundred and one outside.  Well good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what happens and they don't have lemonade and bourbon outside.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The last time there was a big Google outage actually I know someone who works at a  company that relies on a lot of Google traffic and they had a significant monetary impact  as a result of the I guess if you're running business on the cloud.  If you're running a business on the cloud if you're relying on searches Google searches for most of  your traffic which almost everybody is at this point.  And then if you're relying on them for data analytics data I think these are pretty.  It's not just about not being able to send an email which sucks but it's about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No when Google's down the Internet's down an actual monetary impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Internet.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that a good thing.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No no it is a fact.  What do you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well but I think you should shut them down.  So their searches go up.  Yeah.  So the searches go up something like 19 percent during that time frame.  And there was a lot of interesting chatter about how I had to search on Yahoo.  So kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shoot me first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way Wolfram Alpha says it's 97 degrees outside.  I tried.  That's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a weather service.  How would Wolfram Alpha know it was 97.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It knows the weather but I tried to search it for information on music piracy rates.  Nothing.  It's because it was like it's not a search engine.  I don't know what to do with it.  It's not a search engine.  Yeah but shouldn't I be able to put in music piracy and get some data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a search engine that's a search engine metaphor.  Not a search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What what would I say to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You would say compare.  I don't know.  You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like a cute guy at a bar like I got nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are three of the smartest people I know and the three of you cannot figure out how to describe this thing and that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've described it.  It's it's the CIA fact book on steroids.  Yes.  Plus a calculator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A graphing calculator.  Well that's the best description.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a story for you John.  We talked about this when the publishers man they are just so conservative.  They didn't like the fact that the Kindle had voice transcription you know that would speak your books out loud and they complained to Amazon and Amazon really within a week of the release of the Kindle 2 said all right we'll put a switch in.  They're starting to use it.  Random House is now putting out books that 40 titles including titles from Tony Morrison and Steve Rick Stephen King that you cannot text to speech on the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They hate the blind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it.  It's an anti blind thing.  Oh the National Federation of the Blind had a huge demonstration.  Good.  A huge demonstration against the authors guild and for accessibility and said that this is.  And they should definitely pick it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Random House seems to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is just another case of a company not getting it.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's stupid.  It's ridiculous.  They also have so much control over all the flags that are on the books themselves and their connectivity to each individual Kindle that you could hypothetically say to them I'm blind.  Cut me some slack and they could open up your Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh really.  I think there's no reason I think technology standpoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if there's a flag where they could if you wanted to you're the publisher you have it flagged so it reads in Chinese.  Really really really fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think that I think it's shameful that Amazon caved on the Texas Beach feature issue and I think it's shameful the way the publishers Amazon just trying to get this thing out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they I think they have no choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's the issue is maybe once they get enough market share they'll just tell the publishers do at some point Amazon is going to be wagging the dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no doubt about it.  And then the publishers know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You heard my conspiracy theory the fact that they were able to.  Yeah that's sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I believe you're right.  Yeah.  And they were able to go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were able to flip that switch within a week.  Right.  It wasn't that hard.  They were ready for this.  They knew immediately when they put this together they said the authors guild is going to get pissed off because of their audio book rights.  Build in the switch building the capability and let's let's see what happens when this happens when Random House or somebody starts flipping this switch.  Let's see what kind of protests happen.  That's exactly what's going to happen here.  And it's very smart.  Jeff Bezos is a smart fella.  He said all right fine.  They don't like it.  We'll build in the switch.  Let's see what happens.  And I think you're to see so many protests.  It's going to hurt the publishing companies.  It's going to weaken them.  And the next time Amazon says we're going to add a feature they're going to think twice about contesting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about paying extra buck for text to speech enabled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to pay anything for it.  It sounds like crap.  Actually I know but you're not blind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you're if you're blind aren't you getting the audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You would probably be buying the audio books but there's some books that don't have audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no question in my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then that to me is a legitimately offensive accessibility issue.  Then that would be like yeah I'm not paying a dollar extra for something that ought to be like it's just an accessibility thing.  Right.  I mean I guess they already there are already so many hoops that you have to jump through if you're blind you have to buy like screen reader software and you have to do this and that and the other thing.  And it's like this is built in.  It sounds kind of crappy.  Just make it easy.  I think it would be great for basically a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And for reading blogs I would be blind and you wanted somebody to read your blogs.  This would be way better than having jaws.  Thank you.  On your door.  A light.  Exactly.  What they have to do now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fantastic solution.  Amazon knows it's in the right.  They knew that the authors guild was stupid about this.  The publishers were stupid about a lot of stuff and they said about the Google.  Yeah exactly.  The Google the Google Books service.  All Amazons did the right thing which is OK.  You don't like it.  We'll let you do that.  See what happens.  On you.  It's on you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good conspiracy theory.  I like it.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not really.  You see the problem with that.  By the way I made a point to this recently.  We have to be careful when we call something a conspiracy.  A conspiracy means there's people conspiring.  It's not a conspiracy.  It's just one guy.  It's called a strategy.  It's a strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where's the bourbon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A strategy theory.  Well who would you think.  It's by me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a story worth talking about.  Intel find one point five billion.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm surprised we didn't lead with this.  This is a monster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a better.  I'll tell you why it's not a monster.  So this is the European Union.  And for nine years or something they've been going on saying that Intel which we  all know Intel does.  I mean this is Intel's MO has been saying to companies that we'll give you a  discount as long as you don't buy any of those AMD parts or we'll give you some  marketing money but you better not have AMD on your parts list.  Dell said that they.  You notice Dell does not sell AMD computers.  Why do you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I know the real reason.  Why.  Michael Dell.  In fact I have the document at home because I was I was doing an expert  witness thing and they get sounds like a conspiracy theory.  It's not a conspiracy theory.  It was that he made testimony.  They asked him specifically in one of these cases that way back when.  What was the quid pro del came out and testified for Intel in a case.  He was on the stand.  And so the AMD guys got wind of what might have been going on.  So they grilled that Michael about what was the quid pro quo.  He says well I made a deal with Intel and they said that I'm always going to get  the first shot at all the newest chips but I can never use AMD chips.  Yeah.  That's it.  That was that.  Well it was Mr.  Dell.  Yeah that seemed like a good idea to me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well Dell has no choice.  So the EU I think they proved the case.  They AMD was bitter and for years they've been saying please Intel is shutting us  down.  Intel is using monopoly to do this.  So they find them.  But here's the deal.  It's a huge fine.  It's one point four or five billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's bigger than the Microsoft fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were allowed to find them up to 10 percent of the revenues they make per year  from the European Union.  They only find them 4 percent.  So essentially this is the cost of doing business for Intel.  This is less than a slap on the wrist.  They're saying hey we'll tax you 4 percent.  You go ahead.  You do this anti-competitive stuff.  You put AMD out of business.  We'll take 4 percent.  It's nothing.  Well it's nothing.  They didn't even take the 10 percent they could have taken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not like they're giving it to AMD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know that's the funny thing about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not like AMD gives it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I said a shot with AMD about that.  Is it just a fine?  There's no there's no sort of change in behavior.  No no they have to change their behavior.  They do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean so much of what Intel does is  on that borderline.  I mean just their advertising and marketing partners.  You know that Intel jingle.  I don't know if everybody knows this but it's two seconds in an  ad but they'll pay Dell or HP 25 35 percent of their advertising  costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's part of the deal.  We will give you the co-op money as long as we don't have any  problems with the supply chain.  And there's no AMD.  That's how they do it.  It's basically here's how we give you bags of cash.  It was the same business for the cable cable TV business.  When we would go with tech TV would go to a cable channel and  say we'd like you to carry tech TV.  They come with a little black bag with marketing dollars.  It's co-marketing money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now is that per subscriber was how we did it there.  I think it was just a flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a million and a half bucks.  Yeah it was it was bag money.  It's bag money.  Wow.  Here's a million and a half bucks.  It's marketing money.  Yeah that's the ticket.  And that's the way people do business.  I think this is what Intel does.  They say we're going to push it as far as we can when we get  caught.  We'll pay you the 4 percent.  That's the cost of doing business.  We still get to keep 96 percent.  And by the way.  What are the odds that they're actually here is that one point

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  four five a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK now it's not going to pay.  They're just going to appeal it for the next 10 years and then  they'll end up paying.  But it'll be like they will appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the reason they have to appeal is because they're also  being sued in the U.S.  or investigate in the U.S.  for the same behavior.  So they have to pursue it.  Doing business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What.  And I'm just speaking sort of devil's advocate sort of more  from the free market perspective.  What prevents AMD from doing this.  They're not a monopoly.  Big enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The key to this is only works in this.  You have to have a dominant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple engages in monopolistic power or a monopolistic behavior  all the time.  But they're so small that it doesn't matter.  Right.  They can't win.  And that's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well and that's the whole point of antitrust regulation is that  you can do this unless you have such a dominant market position  that it hurts competitiveness and innovation.  And that's what the EU is saying.  This is bad for competitive competitive position.  It's bad for innovation.  And they're right.  And Intel's going to get away with it because essentially big  deal. One and a half billion.  No problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We got it.  It's about what it costs.  Yeah.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's marketing money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Twitter.  I just said it to see what John would do.  Twitter.

When he looked up again the woman had disappeared in her  place stood an old man with rotting teeth.  The man stared down curling his lips into a lonely grimace.  Then he let out a scream of anguish that resounded across  the desert.  Robert Langdon awoke with a start.  Boy.  Boy.  Boy.  Phone beside his bed was ringing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is it is a rich of sound effects narration and you know I  think that's one thing audible is missing is those sound  effects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We probably do a whole thing and overdub sound effects.  That would be great.  It's kind of like masterpiece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a mystery science theater 3000 for audio books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That could be cool.  It's a whole new podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good audible dot com slash tweet to we thank you so much for  their support of this week in tech.  So did you.  This was actually this is actually going to be to your  point John that Twitter is a nightmare.  Somebody Twitter that Prop 8 had been overturned by the  California Supreme Court.  And if you follow the link it turned out it was a link to a  March 2008 article.  It was a year old article that was in fact the Supreme Court  decision that allowed Prop 8 to be put on the ballot.  But everybody on Twitter didn't read the didn't follow the  article.  They just retweeted and there was a storm on Twitter.  Yeah Prop 8 has been overturned.  This is the Prop 8 is the California proposition that made  it illegal for a gay marriage in California.  Very controversial in California.  It's going to be it's already been overturned in about eight  states.  It's going to be overturned in California.  There's no question about it.  But this wasn't the decision.  What it showed is that people are fairly uncritical about the  news they get on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well the scary thing is the genesis of the story looked like  it came from the L.A.  Times from the L.A.  Times.  The tweet the original tweet itself.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the L.A.  Times people admitted they screwed up.  Right.  Oh wait a minute you're telling me that professional

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  journalists.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They made a mistake.  And the L.A.  Times Twitter.  Well wait it doesn't make any sense.  You know right.  I am shocked.  They've been to journalism school John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And also upheld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So maybe this isn't a nanny Twitter story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well it's an aha.  Exactly.  If it wasn't for these trained journalists that we wouldn't be  having these issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the same story as like the blogs repeated a story over  and over.  It's a story about uncritical thinking.  It's an echo chamber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is something we really got to train people in is.  Craig's list of erotic ad concessions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Our half banked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Craig's list says yeah okay we won't have erotic ads which  I'm sorry about but they've decided what are they going to  have adult services instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well what they've said is we will totally have erotic ads.  They'll just be in a different part of the play.  They'll just have a different name.  It's not in any way a concession.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well they actually the one big concession that they made and  I'm surprised about this and interested to see how they  implement it because they have been saying for years there is  absolutely no way that we can manually review all of the ads  that we get.  There's just that's that's impossible for us.  And so the big concession that they supposedly have made we  will have a new erotic services ghetto but we'll have some  people.  I manually review every one of these ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not fun.  You manually do it manually.  Manually.  And it's a lot cheaper that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh Lord.  Wow.  Can I get a third Mayday.  Oh third Mayday.  Mayday mayday mayday.  I need a rescue.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you guys remember the website that warned John's of where  stings were happening.  Good.  And it would just be sort of a news group where they post on  a Friday night saying is that illegal.  No it shouldn't be.  Well that was the question.  And they just knew where the stakeouts were.  They posted online and people went to other corners.  Yeah.  And like the anti-flash mob legality issues but more this is  a cat and mouse issue of well if not here then where.  Why not have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's say they're going to have an adult services link that  section that looks identical to the erotic services section.  They say it's going to be manually reviewed but they're  still going to.  I mean you're just going to do what is manual review.  You're just going to see the prostitution ads.  You got a guy in the furniture section and he's going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No it has to say massage.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean if you look at the adult section they basically just  all say massage.  Yeah.  So what they said before you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd force you to disclose the erotic services.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like it's his first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I aim to please baby.  Call me 24 hours all uppercase.  You know this is like you know hot Latin mommy mammy.  You will love me.  Twenty seven.  She's in San Jose.  Wow.  Unforgettable Asian massage service.  She's in San Rafael.  Wait a minute.  Now this is turning into a whole other thing.  Sexy Latina playmate.  Charming and classy Asian CMTS.  They cost money now.  That's the interesting thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were free before.  You needed to put in a credit card number I think but you  didn't have to.  That's a pay and now they cost ten dollars and you can repost  for five dollars.  But doesn't that just make it more likely that they'll be  commercially.  They'll be commercial enterprise type links instead of just some  person who's looking for the.  John don't read it out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I think this picture is hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is under MILF special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh Lord.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Unsee.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is just total and I hate to use this phrase but  it's so appropriate lip service to.  Whoa.  To.  The Craigslist killer issue.  This is just give her a hand to the Craigslist killer issue.  They had to do something in response to the negative press  that they got.  Ninety nine percent of the people who hear this story go.  Thank God Craigslist is doing something so something like this  will never happen again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then and then they never think about it again.  It's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Business is really like do you think anybody believes that  Craigslist is actually making a fundamental change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ninety nine percent of the people who heard this story have  never been on Craigslist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes they will shortly.  I don't know about that.  Becky is saying what every mainstream person most people.  Craigslist is still not fully mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No but Becky's saying what every mainstream media person knows  which is you print the story people read it they're done.  Thank God.  And it's over.  It's over.  And it's the best way to handle this company in this situation  should do the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it says it's half baked.  MSNBC.  You know I mean I'm just wondering if that press is going  away.  I think people are I think Craigslist does not have the  benefit of the doubt of the good anymore.  Good.  And it does seem to be.  But they do have a peace peace sign favicon so I'm in.  They're so nice.  They're so nice.  They're so corny.  They're totally not murders.  They're.  Yeah they're so totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  You do have to feel for Craig though that it was.  Oh I feel so sorry for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Murderer.  That's not good.  No that really.  That's that's not.  I mean it's not his fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But again that's just the sensationalism to sort of prove  my point which is.  That's the media doing its job.  It's a new thing to most people ergo it's Craigslist.  What do they mean when they say 200 roses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does anybody know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that a special code.  200 roses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look I'm just down with 420 for the first time so just.  You didn't know about 420.  I'm so square.  I can't believe you just admitted that.  You know that we're on air right now right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so square.  That's adorable.  You and I are going out.  We've got things to talk about.  I need help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I stick exclusively with alcohol it's so great why try anything  else.  Oh I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact I don't drink at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kind of like this story from Danger Mouse where he says.  Danger Mouse which is the the guys of course who are part of  Norrell's Barkley which has been huge very successful.  But Danger Mouse is a mashup DJ who did get in a little bit of  trouble.  I thought it was brilliant.  They did something called the Gray Album.  They took the Beatles white album and they mixed together the  black album from it was a rap artist.  It's escaped me a moment ago but it was Jay Z.  That's right.  And it was a great year hip.  You're with it.  You're cool.  Two points.  And it was a really great mix.  I mean to hear the Beatles white album with Jay Z.  I mean it really was great.  This guy's brilliant.  Danger Mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like bourbon and lemonade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like bourbon lemonade.  It's something that just goes together and you might not have  expected it.  Exactly.  But when they hit they hit.  By the way it's hitting right now.  So.  Wow.  This is the new album is Dark Knight of the Soul.  It's an album length piece of music by Danger Mouse Sparkle  Horse and a co and a host of guest vocalists David Lynch  photography inspired by the music.  So you buy this.  What are you going to get.  A blank CDR because they can't publish it because for legal  reasons the CDR contains no music.  Use it as you will due to an ongoing dispute with EMI over  the Gray Album.  Danger Mouse is unable to release the recorded music for  Dark Knight of the Soul without fear of being sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you play us a clip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't.  It's blank.  Let me listen.  So I love it.  What they say is download this and put it on the blank CDR  because we can't publish it.  I think that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's kind of like prints in the symbol.  It's a symbol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the distinction being they can put it online available for  download without the same legal implications or is this just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  marketing sneakily put it online.  I guess maybe they're just saying like if anybody's going

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to get in trouble it's going to be you not us which frankly I  think it's kind of stocky.  I don't appreciate that.  So did we do the burden of breaking the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Would you like to hear a little bit of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you can bring it up.  All right.  Let me find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So did you talk last week about the Duke Nukem story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No I didn't.  This is the story for this week.  Let's talk about it.  Duke Nukem for never.  Duke Nukem is gone.  Remember Duke Nukem forever was going to be for the last eight  or nine years the next version of Duke Nukem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They could have let this slide for another 10 years.  I don't understand why they had to shut it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were paying people to work on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What were John what were the classic vaporware products  because there were a few of these.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Quite a few.  You know that's actually something worth revisiting.  I think you have to do a little research but there's a lot of  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't think of off the top of my head too much bourbon but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  think the movie phone that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now there's some classic software Lotus didn't Lotus  have something that was never came out.  There are quite a few of these programs that were promised  never released classic vaporware.  But I think Duke Nukem forever partly because it was named  forever.  Yeah it's taken forever.  Is the classic nine or 10 years since they promised it.  A couple of years ago they started releasing trailers  again.  It was like oh it's still alive.  3D realms has finally said it's gone.  But here's the interesting conspiracy theory.  Two sites have been registered to domain names Save Duke and  Save Duke Nukem registered before the announcement.  And all of a sudden these sites are starting to release.  Artwork video collateral that was created.  The whole thing could be a marketing ploy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know the studio was like a sub studio right.  It was 3D realms and then there's always these deals you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have 3D realms makes it and then you have a deal with take  to to release it.  Take two says we didn't have any deal to give them money.  We just had the distribution rights so it wasn't our fault.  Wasn't something we had to deal with.  3D realms basically said you know 10 years it's time to pull  the plug on this thing.  We're not going to get a product out.  But I wonder and it's not I can't take credit for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well you know people inside probably knew people inside 3D  realms knew this was coming and they probably were trying to  prepare a little grassroots campaign.  Counter theory.  I like it.  For when it happened.  So they're like OK well this is going to happen but maybe we  can you know everybody's got that idea now like if I just go  to the Internet the Internet will save me.  So they probably thought we'll just get our grassroots  movement going now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got two mommies here.  Mommy and a mother to mommies and a mother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see that cute baby out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a cute baby.  Oh Malachi was out there isn't he the sweetest baby.  He's one year old.  How old is he.  One and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's like 18 months.  So they're the same age.  No Eli is two years and two months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two years old.  So he's walking talking.  Oh he's crazy man.  Smoking dope.  He's ready.  For sure.  He knows all about 420.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's so much cooler than Aunt Becky.  I'm a super good mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me introduce you to my 14 year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway you were saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Facebook for a long time has pulled.  Pictures of lactating breastfeeding mothers.  I mean these aren't sexy pictures.  These are pictures moms put up on their own Facebook page.  Here's my baby I'm breastfeeding isn't that cute.  And Facebook's pulling them.  I think for a while for a long time for a couple of years now.  I love tech crunch.  I think they finally sat down and said wait a minute.  You're pulling pictures of breastfeeding moms but you're  leaving sites up that say the Holocaust didn't happen.  That Jews are evil.  You're leaving these hate sites up.  Facebook says well they're not hate sites.  This is a political point of view.  There's no justification.  Their own terms of service say no hate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't get it.  This is just so obvious.  I think we should boycott Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you.  I'm glad to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here comes the plug.  My whole buzz report this week actually was about these  companies who are just engaged in this bizarro hypocrisy around  censorship because it turns out censorship is kind of hard to  pull off without looking like an a-hole.  Because you find yourself backed into these weird double standards.  It opens a can of worms.  And they basically have said well okay breast naked breasts are  obscene which bite me but OK.  And also we have to respect free speech.  So then pretty soon you have right like breastfeeding banned  and you can't have it both pro Holocaust sites.  You can't have it both ways.  Holocaust and Nazis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if they would allow breastfeeding Nazis.  That's OK.  It must be.  As long as they don't believe the Holocaust.  As long as there are no pictures of nipple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh God nipple.  It's going to ruin America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it nipple or areola that they're concerned about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hard to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Depends.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean if there was a you could.  What is it that they're pulling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm not getting into the logistics.  If you're breastfeeding and you're fully locked on it's OK.  If you can see the nipple.  That's what they'll pull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK so I was doing a story about hot moms clubs and I found this  site on Facebook.  Oh dear.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's on Facebook.  That's on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That girl's got a fake front end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this site is not about breastfeeding.  And that's allowed.  That's obviously there's no nipple.  No that's why there's no that's not ruining America because of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the no nipple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Got a nice smile that girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's large.  Her smile.  Um.  Waxing.  You know personally if people.  I don't see the need to do the pictures on the breastfeeding.  But that's just me.  So of course.  You know wait a minute though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is I think you I think it's I look at this is my private  page right.  Only my friends see this page.  And I have a new baby and I want to share a picture a great  picture of me with the baby.  I'm a you guys both have babies.  People get very serious about breastfeeding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that's there could be actually a picture that's like  here's how to latch right like your I am.  It could be a tutorial and Facebook would be like oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the kids can figure that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd be surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no.  In fact you know who we called for advice when we were having  latching issues.  Mimi your wife.  And Mimi was very helpful.  My wife called my wife called John's wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus a little John DeVar Trivia right there.  Yeah.  Wife named Mimi.  Mimi.  Oh was that a secret.  No that no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know I think Mimi's great.  But John's is a secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John's wife is fantastic and she had she was great.  Jennifer talked to her for a long time.  She said eventually you'll be able to walk on concrete with  your nipples.  My wife does that.  It won't.  It won't hurt at all.  Okay.  No she was really.  It's a whole other thing.  Bring it.  Now Facebook would ban this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They would the whole conversation.  But if I said the Holocaust never happened and all Jews  deserve to die then that would be OK.  But that's on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see some of.  And this is a Facebook fan page is a public page as opposed to a  private page of my friends saying and my family saying look  here's my beautiful baby.  I think this is appalling.  I think Facebook is really overstepped.  Here's the question right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because censorship is extremely tricky and you will find  yourself in these scenarios because it's a really hard line  to walk.  So should Facebook go all the way censoring or should they not  at all.  Then they become MySpace and they're totally terrible.  And one of the things people like about Facebook is it's a  nicer neighborhood than MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't they face a larger legal issue where you're deciding  whether you're a carrier or a publisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's that.  But the other thing is I think they should just back off.  I mean what is the point of the nipple controversy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's say it's been years now it's two years in the coming  that they still keep.  Ridiculous.  No no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like to know who specifically is responsible because there is  a person.  Though there's a team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact they've seen it.  We've seen this pictures of this team.  There's there I don't know it's a large number of employees whose  sole responsibility is combing through this material on  Facebook and deciding what not to put there.  A lot of the stuff on Facebook is drunk teenagers.  And frankly as a parent of a teenager I think it's not a bad  idea for Facebook to say well you know we don't want this  stuff here.  This is stuff that your employers might see you know.  But although again it's private it's on your private page.  But I can understand why they want to prevent that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take the whole Malcolm Gladwell approach and just say  if you had to look at the page for 10 seconds wouldn't you  know what was really bad and what was really good and what  was marginal and you don't want to make it.  It's not that hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know what that's the thing right.  Facebook OK for one thing the Internet is global.  Facebook is available all over the world and the blink approach  to obscenity is very different in very different countries.  I mean I think it becomes I think the lesson is that  censorship is way harder than you would think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah Frenchmen would think the same way as a Southern Baptist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I mean but right in France or Germany there's a distinctly  different response to a nipple and to a Holocaust denial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But look I work for a big company that has to make these  decisions every day about what's appropriate for the bell curve.  What's appropriate.  And that's what you're being paid for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're not as stupid as Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you have to make some tough calls and you have to have a  pair of stones and sometimes do it.  Just make the right calls and then let the gray area stuff  live in the gray area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are we in agreement that they made the wrong call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Leave the breastfeeders alone and get rid of the Nazis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is some level of immaturity.  I mean I'm almost getting the sense it's like a 14 year old  making this decision.  Oh I don't know that the Jewish thing is if the whole story is  not in yet.  Oh God no there's a there's a breast.  Oh that they're making the decision while digging in their  nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's that they're making the decisions for the 14 year old.  Like the whole thing I think is a 14 year old is the terror.  That's the thing that is so scary.  So anything that might appear porny to a child has to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I bring up this whole cybersecurity you put it in the  in the links I thought it was interesting that you know sexting  all of the initiatives that have been started about cyber  security.  And I think that the point here aside from getting into the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  obvious let's just let's just say what the story is.  So there there are two bills in front of the House of  Representatives right now.  One is against cyber bill bullying.  It's the Megan Meyer Act that is inspired by the fact that this  teenage girl was kind of coerced into killing herself by an  adult that lived next door.  Cyber bullying no question about it.  And this the second bill which has just recently been  announced which is more let's support.  Let's fund education about sexting.  So it's it's kind of a namby pamby bill.  Right.  So there are two bills.  I mean one clearly is a is misguided.  The idea of having something special about cyber built  bullying.  It's a very nebulous thing.  I'm of the I don't want to shut you guys down.  If you have a different opinion please tell me.  But I'm of the opinion this is bogus.  There's no reason Congress should be legislating somehow  against bullying that is online is different from bullying in  public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you need to step up to the 10,000 foot view and just  see what it's like for parents today.  If you go online and search I was researching a story about  four months ago before the text sexting story really hit and  you searched cyber security for parents the rules that were out  there everywhere I looked were from the days when we all had  AOL accounts.  It was so inappropriate it was all about stranger danger.  What a surprise.  To do with social network.  What a surprise.  Texting with totally networked teens.  And so I think what you have to recognize from the 10,000 foot  view is that parents are having a major paradigm shift about  what's at stake.  And they have no idea what's going on.  It's not stranger danger.  That is a minimal concern and your kids know about that way  more than you do.  They know a Nigerian scam from any other.  I never worried about my kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never worried about my kids.  It's not stranger danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The issue at hand is all about the people you know and how the  medium makes meanness so exaggerated and makes sexuality  so exaggerated and so we're in a hyper sexualized environment and  meet the the medium only exacerbates that.  So I think what you have to recognize is all these little  attempts to legislate things are really just stabs as parents  try and grasp the change.  And so I try not to get too mired down in the little stuff  and just recognize parents.  I think you're right.  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But should Congress be involved in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Congress can't stop itself really from taking out its tiny  little knives every time they find out about something.  It's good for folks.  It's literally like they find out about it.  Legislating stupidity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No that's Leo's right.  It's a this is a this is just a showboating.  It's all letter.  And they're writing they're essentially writing dead dead  letter laws.  And they know it.  These laws are going to be just go there's the same like the laws  against kissing a donkey in Omaha.  I mean there's laws in the books that are crazy and they've never  been taken off the books and they're still they still illegally  kiss a donkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vestigial appendages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know one last story and then we're going to go home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No you get no one last story and then we talk about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow the tables have turned.  This is what he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is actually a wonderful story.  It's a victory story.  How many of you received calls saying your warranty is about to  expire.  I always ask for the supervisor.  You know I did the same thing.  I said please put me on your do not call list.  That didn't stop them.  Partly because it's coming from a bunch.  Now Becky you get a bunch of different people.  You do this for ABC.  You're the consumer reporter.  Have you been covering this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've just been looking into it recently because the calls have  just gotten so so intense.  I get four or five a week now.  Oh yeah.  No I'm coming from Canada.  What are these area codes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  The area is probably spoofed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then the robo calls.  They're not humans.  They say your warranty is about to expire.  This is the second call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These factory warranty on your vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is always the second call.  It's about to expire.  We have made multiple attempts to reach you.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And my understanding is that the idea that you sign up for these  aftermarket warranties.  It has nothing to do with anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Has nothing to do with anything.  It's just to harvest credit card numbers apparently.  It is.  There is no warranty involved.  People get these even if they don't have a car.  This is merely to get your credit card number.  Now some of them may be legit.  No.  But I don't think most of them are not.  It's merely to get your credit card number.  You will be charged.  You will not receive anything.  It's a ripoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh.  Apparently the seller has taken in more than 10 million dollars as a  result of the calls.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's Dane's call list.  Dane just brought his phone in to me.  This is his call list.  Are these all from the same.  He's been saving these.  818-416.  That's Toronto.  810-800-815-262-708-801.  You've been saving these.  Good for you.  He's been saving.  This is dozens.  Send those to Congress.  Well, the good news.  Here's the good news.  The FTC filed complaints on Thursday against two companies.  I'm sure there's more, but two companies engaged in this.  Of course, it didn't.  It didn't.  Nobody did anything until somebody called Charles Schumer.  Right.  I love Chuck Schumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He is awesome.  He was in a.  I love that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was on Capitol Hill when they called his cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This doesn't anybody but me find it disgusting that these guys, unless it  actually affects them directly, that they don't do anything.  Why do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure some, some, some member of Congress had a sexting incident too.  I mean, this is all about literally what comes into their consciousness at any given.  How do you think stories get on TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why don't we just take and if there was no Congress, we'd be just as well off.  Well, that's true.  Just let the president do everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's why.  Here's why it's an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chuck's getting her done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's why it's an issue.  Cause these guys are so out of touch.  So they're finally learning about stuff years after their constituency has  been bitching and moaning about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why hasn't the FTC done anything?  Why hasn't any of the people who enforce the do not call registry done anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good point because aren't you legally, if you say, please, I tried it.  Please place me on your do not call list.  The guy said, oh, yes, sir.  Fine.  And I immediately got another call the next day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that they actually, some of these guys do actually provide these weak  warranties that don't work, but they provide you paperwork.  We don't know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're guessing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I read one article from the New York Times, which said the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I love it when John calls into question the New York Times.  Yeah.  Wow.  Talk about a conspiracy theorist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  FTC says one as many as 1.8 million calls a day.  They dial every number in a given area code, which is why you're getting on your  cell phone and you know, normally cell phones not listed and doesn't get marketing  calls, but they're just random calling.  Has nothing to do with the fact that you have a car or not, but a loan, a  warranty, including many numbers on the national do not call registry.  Once on the line, recipients were misled into believing they were extending  their original vehicle warranty.  The seller took more than $10 million as a result of these calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These guys have got a great scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a drop in the bucket too, because it's car warranties now and it'll  be something else tomorrow.  It'll be home insurance warranties because these are companies, but anybody  can robo dial, right?  It's coming from 416.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Toronto.  I can't, what do I do?  Am I supposed to pursue them in Canada now?  I mean, it's very difficult to pursue these guys internationally.  Anyway, thank goodness they're finally filing a complaint against two companies,  but I think you're right.  I don't think we've seen the end of this by any means.  So I proclaimed victory, but only a temporary victory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no victory involved.  There's no victory.  I think we should just connect, disconnect all phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we should just have more bourbon and lemonade and say the hell with it.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.  Another twit is in the can.  All right.  Now that we've gotten rid of Dvorak and Worley and Wood, I want to give you the  full interview that we had with Stephen Rulfram.  This interview was conducted on Saturday, May 16th.  It was right in the middle of the launch of Wolfram Alpha.  We were very grateful to Stephen for giving us half an hour to talk to him.  I think a fascinating interview, but I'll let you be the judge of that.  So we're just going to stick this at the end.  If you're not interested in Stephen Wolfram and the story behind Wolfram Alpha,  just you could stop your player now.  Otherwise there's a little extra, it's about a half an hour interview with Stephen Wolfram.  Hello, this is Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, Stephen Wolfram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stephen, thank you so much for taking some time to talk to us.  I'm sure there's a crazy day for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A little bit, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A celebratory day as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's always exciting to see a new project launched out into the wild.  Yes, and many things have gone very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How long have you been working on Wolfram Alpha?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, let's see.  I mean, the foundations I've sort of been laying for maybe 23 years or so,  but the actual final project is the last four or five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a long time.  And most of that in stealth mode.  I mean, the first we heard about it was just a few months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, yes, indeed.  I wasn't sure it was going to work until quite recently.  So I wasn't going to start talking about it until I was really sure this was actually  something that wasn't completely crazy.  I've been thinking about this for a long time and have been concluding several times  that no, it's too early.  It's the wrong decade to try and do this project.  And I finally, four or five years ago, I thought, OK, I'm finally to the point  where this project is not completely crazy to try doing.  And then for a while, that kept on being these issues that were like,  there's this particular problem and there's not going to be any way to solve this problem.  And then we finally found some way to solve it.  And it's only probably in the last year or so that I've become convinced that,  yes, it's actually possible to sort of take a reasonable shot at sort of making  all the world's knowledge computable.  And that's so I wasn't about to tell people about it at the point where it was still  appeared to be sort of completely crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what happened that made it possible?  Was it computational power?  Was it the Internet?  I mean, what is it that was when what hit critical mass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I mean, there's several things.  The computational power is one thing.  I mean, you have to be able to sort of in web type time actually sort of do  interesting computations and get back the results.  Another thing was sort of that there is the web and that there's a way to deliver  something like this to people as sort of a medium for doing that.  Another is that sort of it becomes more obvious kind of just how much information  there is in the world and what kind of thing it is by just looking around the web.  I mean, that ends up not being in the case of what we do that, you know,  the raw web is not the primary sort of source of information and data that we have.  But it tells one a lot about sort of what is out there, what kinds of things are  sort of available. But for me, the the actually the biggest things,  there were two really big things which happened to be sort of my other two big life  projects. One of them is Mathematica.  The other one is my new kind of science.  You know, Mathematica is this, you know, broad language that gets used by lots of  the sort of world's leading R&D folk and so on and lots of others.  It's the language that we've been developing for the last 23 years.  It's sort of is a general symbolic language that lets one represent all kinds of  knowledge and sort of implement sort of it contains sort of a huge collection of  the world's possible algorithms. And that's that's kind of the that was kind of  the layer that had to exist in order to make Wolfram Alpha possible.  I mean, if without that layer, you know, if I've been kind of trying to write it in  some low level language or something like that, it just it would have been a  completely inconceivable project.  And the other big thing was my work in science where both some content of sort of  understanding the world in computational terms, but probably more important was the  fact that I sort of discovered from studying kind of things out in the  computational universe and so on, I discovered this sort of paradigmatic fact  that even though there may be a great deal of sort of richness and complexity  in the phenomena you see, that can be sort of simple programs, simple frameworks  that lie underneath those phenomena.  And that that sort of realization is what brought me to the idea that, OK, even  though there's a huge amount of different kinds of knowledge and so on in the world,  it's conceivable that there are sort of frameworks underneath it that are simple  enough that it's conceivable and sort of with finite resources to actually build  something that sort of captures a decent part of what might be computable about the  world. I think actually over time, I'm probably going to understand that I kind of  have this meta theory about people, which is that people people have at most one big  idea, so to speak. And I've worked my way through my third big project and I kind of  think there are more connections even than I yet realize between these projects,  because as I say, people have at most one big idea.  So for me, all these three projects have to be have to be the same idea at some  level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In some way, yeah. Well, but what it strikes me that looking at your history and  your biography, that what has been key to this is your interdisciplinary approach.  You started with physics, realized that computation was important, combined the  two knowledge the two knowledge bases together and you've produced Mathematica.  And as a result, I think maybe you could say it's all one idea, but you've had to  take these different approaches into it that maybe hadn't synthesized before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right. No, it's certainly true.  I mean, one of the things that's made both of my first sort of both possible and fun  for me in a sense is that, you know, I happen to have worked on lots of different  areas of, you know, science and analysis of things and all sorts of all sorts of  other kinds of things. And so kind of this idea of sort of collect the world's  computable knowledge and kind of sort of put it together into something that  becomes, you know, I kind of had some perspective on sort of what's out there.  Yeah.  The fact that I've, you know, ended up for quite fortuitous reasons sometimes  working in lots of different areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see, you've said that one of the most important things that came out of this  computational approach to science is this notion of exploring the universe of  possible programs.  Yes.  Can you can you explain what that means?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So, I mean, you know, what we're used to when we like create software or  something is we say, OK, we want to achieve some particular objective with the  software we write. You know, let's sit down as software engineers and kind of  start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's purpose built.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Right.  And I mean, what what I kind of got into realizing that it was worth worth doing  is to to to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hear Windows complaining.  I'll let you.  Yes, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's good to know that even a brilliant person like you can have trouble with  Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The misbehaving computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you fix that first, Steven?  And then we can worry about solving the problems of the world.  Just get the computers working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So so I mean, but back to sort of the computational.  Yes.  That's that's a that's a.  So, you know, the typical program we build is something we specifically engineer  for a particular purpose.  Right.  But so one question is, if you think about all possible programs, just from  programs that are just the shortest programs, you just write down, you know,  sort of one line of code or, you know, it's something you represent by just  saying a typical kind of thing.  I looked at for these things called cellular automata where you just have a  line of black and white cells.  Just have a rule that says, you know, a particular cell will be a color that's  determined by the configuration of cells on the line above it and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Conway's game of life, for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's an example.  So that's actually a bit more complicated and a lot of things that I  looked at.  But one of the things that's interesting about some programs that are that  simple is that you can say, let me look at all possible programs with a  particular kind.  And so then there's the question, what do all possible programs do?  You know, are they all are most of them just completely stupid, uninteresting or  do some of them behave in really interesting ways?  And, and the sort of a big thing that I discovered now, I don't know, 25 years  ago or something now is a little bit more actually, is that the if you look at  sort of all possible programs, yes, there are ones that are really uninteresting.  Like, you know, you start off with one black cell at the top and it just keeps  on going, you know, all the way down the page and nothing changes.  But then, you know, a decent fraction of the time, some decent percentage of the  time, what you get is some incredibly elaborate pattern.  And so, you know, what's interesting, what's interesting about that?  Well, first thing that I got really interested in was the elaborate patterns  that you get look an awful lot like elaborate patterns that you see in nature.  And so it's kind of like, you know, we know that nature kind of has the secret  that lets it make all this complicated stuff that we don't seem to be able to  emulate when we sort of do things with engineering.  But what this is kind of suggesting is that if nature is just sort of sampling  the computational universe kind of arbitrarily, it's easily going to run  into these kind of programs that have this property that even though you may  start them off in a simple way and the programs may be very simple, the patterns  they produce are really complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you've got to natural selection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, kind of.  Actually, we sort of see a different twist on natural selection because one of  the things natural selection suggests is, you know, when we see all the  complexity of organisms that exist today, maybe what we're really seeing is kind  of a frozen version of a giant history book.  You know, we're seeing all the details of the organisms that exist today  were the result of this thing that happened, you know, sometime in the  Cretaceous period, this other thing that happened, and so on, and so on, and so on.  All these kind of seemingly arbitrary choices.  It seems like, you know, we're kind of freezing a lot of work that sort of was  done making all these arbitrary choices.  That's kind of the typical view of natural selection.  There's an alternative view, which says maybe the sort of a lot of the complexity  that we see in today's organisms doesn't come from that kind of, you know, frozen  historical accident at all.  Instead, maybe what it comes from, it's just this fundamental fact about the ways  that things get generated that says that even many simple programs produce really  complicated behavior, and the point being that if natural systems actually pick  happen to pick programs that have this feature that they produce really  complicated behavior, you'll see really complicated behavior in the organisms.  Even though there was no sort of detailed historical accident or detailed kind of  molding by the environments that went on.  And, you know, one of the things I've noticed is that if you look at different  kinds of organisms, there's the question of, do you get, if you sample, I don't  know, one of my favorite examples is the mollusk shells of the world.  But you look at the patterns on the mollusk shells of the world, and some of them  are very simple, you know, you could imagine that they were produced by a simple  program that just all striped the spots or something.  And then there are these really elaborate ones.  Another example would be dinosaurs, you know, you have a lot of simple shapes and  then you have the stegosaurus and so on.  And the question is, you know, did the stegosaurus or did the complicated mollusk  pattern get sort of molded by some elaborate series of events in the history  of natural selection?  Or is it just that out of the space, the possible programs for making these  organisms, it just so happens that there are a few that sort of spontaneously  produce this kind of complexity.  And I kind of suspect that it's much more on the side of there just happened to be  programs that produce this great complexity rather than it's sort of  carefully molded by natural selection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How is it different from an infinite number of monkeys and an infinite  number of typewriters?  I mean, are we able to express all the possibilities, all the possible  computational programs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, this is the interesting thing that if you start from  the very simplest ones, you can basically just go through that, you know, I, with  cellular automata, you know, I kind of numbered them from, you know, there's a  big block from zero to 255, then there's a bunch of other ones and, you know,  every one of these kind of numbered programs, you can just go through and  enumerate possible programs.  And so, for example, you could ask the question, oh, you can do this kind of  enumeration for lots of kinds of things.  I don't know, you can enumerate possible axiom systems and mathematics, you  could enumerate possible laws of physics, you can do all kinds of enumerations.  The reason people generally hadn't thought that that was worth doing is  because, you know, when you do an enumeration, you might, with a computer,  you might be able to study the first billion or the first trillion of  something.  Right, right.  But unless something interesting happens in the really small, really simple  ones, you're not, it's sort of not worthwhile to do this enumeration.  So kind of one of the big sort of discoveries of my science adventure has  been that even among the really simple ones that you sort of get to quickly in  one of these enumerations, there's a lot of rich, interesting stuff that maybe  just might be just like what we see in nature and so on.  So one of the consequences for technology is that means that you can sort of find  technology by just sort of enumerating possible programs and so on.  I mean, the analogy I like to use is, you know, there's this computational  universe out there of possible programs, possible algorithms and so on.  And it's kind of like when we go out into the material world and we're interested in  finding, you know, we look at different materials, we discover, you know,  magnetite, we discover liquid crystals, we discover, I don't know, some type of  resin or something.  And at first it just seems like, well, this is a fun thing, you know, it has some  weird property.  And then later we realize, no, actually, there's a human purpose, there's a  technological purpose for which this is really important.  So then, you know, we go and, you know, pick up all the gallium on the world or  something, and we discover that it's useful for, you know, some kind of display  or something like that.  And so similarly in the computational universe, we've got all these possible  simple programs out there.  And sort of one of the questions is, so given one of these simple programs, which  has some very elaborate behavior, perhaps, you know, is it useful for something?  And, you know, that's where we kind of go out and, you know, in fact, in the  development of Mathematica and in the development of Wolfram Alpha, this is a  pretty common thing that we do, sometimes call it algorithm discovery.  You know, you just go out into the computational universe and you go  searching through lots and lots of different possible algorithms to find one  that satisfies some particular objective that you're trying to reach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So through human history, it's really been serendipity.  You're saying you can do this in an intentional way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.  I mean, so you might say, I mean, it's always interesting to look at things that  have emerged in human history in different areas and say why this one and  not another one, like, for example, in chemistry, you know, there are particular  chemicals people have studied.  In mathematics, there are particular underlying axiom systems that people  have studied, you know, what's special about these things?  Are they special because they have some particular properties or are they simply  special because of the sort of the course of history?  Actually, one of the things I find most sort of ironic is, you know, you were  asking about, talking about natural selection earlier, you know, people think  of biology as the very accidental science, the one where, you know, what we have today  is the result of a whole series of accidents, but they think of mathematics,  for example, as the exact opposite of the very non-accidental, completely sort of  determined by higher principles kind of science.  I actually think it's the opposite way around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How interesting.  So our understanding of the physical laws of the mathematical theory really is,  it's just, this is what happened to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think so, but I mean, for example, in mathematics, you know, you can just,  you know, mathematics gets based on these axiom systems, you know, from people  like Euclid and so on, on.  And the question is, you know, why do the particular axiom systems, which are the  basis of our arithmetic or our logic or something like that, why did we look at  these axiom systems and not other ones?  And, you know, we gave them names like arithmetic or logic or whatever else.  And I think it's basically purely historical.  In other words, I think that there are zillions of other axiom systems out there  that we could have studied, but, you know, the Babylonians happened to start studying,  you know, arithmetic and geometry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  So Wolfram Alpha is then an engine to kind of start making these connections,  uh, in, in a different way to, to maybe open us up to different ways of looking  at things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think that, that in a sense, I view Wolfram Alpha as being, uh, uh,  Or is it just a historical engine?  Well, uh, okay.  So I think it's sort of the, at some level I view it almost at this, at the  stage it's at today, which is sort of, I view as its beginning stage, um, as being  almost a prosaic kind of application of these types of ideas.  Um, I mean, I'm, I'm, I view, um, uh, the, um, uh, um, uh, I kind of think about it  like, um, uh, you know, when one discovered universal computing, you know,  in 1936 or whatever, you know, what would the, um, one might have imagined that  there will be all sorts of very sort of, uh, high minded consequences for  mathematics, for, you know, artificial intelligence, whatever else.  But in actuality, the first applications of, you know, the idea of universal  computing were things like databases and later word processes and so on.  And so similarly now I view Wolfram Alpha as being sort of a, an application  of a paradigm of this kind of science that you can make a lot from fairly  small principles, um, but I think there's a lot more that one can do in the future.  And I mean, right now Wolfram Alpha is mostly making use of kind of old kind  of science fact, it's making use of, you know, the models and methods and so on  that have been developed in science and physics and financial analysis and lots  of other areas over the course of the last few hundred years.  What this kind of, what the ultimate sort of direction that, that, um, one can go  in is, is not just to say, uh, here's a question we have to ask, which can be  answered by existing science and now Wolfram Alpha can actually, you know, answer  it quickly for you on the web type thing, but say, here's a question that I have  for which I have to sort of invent a new model, something that science has never  produced for us to go out and discover sort of a new algorithm.  Now can we do this thing of going out and sort of, uh, uh, going and sampling  with mining the computational universe to find something that's sort of invent  on the fly, something that's never been created before.  And that's, you know, that's, that's a future direction for Wolfram Alpha.  One of, one of the challenges, one of the things I don't yet know is, you know,  our computers of today, fast enough to make that particular direction, you know,  how far can we go in that direction, you know, in the next year or two years  or something like that.  And to what extent do we have to wait for, um, you know, the next, uh, next  wave of speed of computers to really be able to do exciting things with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This isn't artificial intelligence though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's well, it's, I don't know what to, you know, it depends what you mean by  that. I mean, you know, the tradition of artificial intelligence has tended to be,  you know, let's see what humans do and let's make it bigger, faster, stronger.  And, um, what Wolfram Alpha is doing.  And so typically what that turns into is to say, you know,  let's take processes of human reasoning and things like this. Um, and let's,  uh, uh, let's see whether we can sort of automate, um, those,  those processes and so on. And so, you know,  like when you're solving a physics problem, you can say, you know,  what happens in the physics situation? Well, let me reason through it.  Let me say, you know, this pushes that and that pushes this and so on and so on  and so on. And that's what people used to do in the middle ages. For example,  that was kind of,  that was the mode of doing natural philosophy is people would debate it and  have sort of arguments about it and so on. And then what happened in science was,  you know, along same Newton and his friends and they said, no,  you can forget about all this human reasoning stuff for figuring out physics.  Let's just blast our way through it using, using mathematical principles,  um, and just get to the answer. And in a sense,  Wolfram Alpha is sort of continuing that tradition of let's just use  mathematical computational algorithmic methods to just sort of blast through the  answer. And so what we're doing is essentially a very non-human approach to,  to blasting through to the answering of questions. We're not, we're not doing,  we're not doing something that's, you know,  if you think of other kinds of technological things like, I don't know,  flying or something, you know, you can fly like a bird or you can fly like an  airplane. Um,  and airplanes have fairly little relation in detail to the, to the operation of  birds. Um, and we're, you know, we're taking more of the, the airplane,  sort of let's just blast through to the results kind of approach, um,  which is sort of a, you know,  a different branch from the kind of traditional thinking about artificial  intelligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Walk me through the process of, uh, I'll enter a query into a Wolfram Alpha.  What happens then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. So the first thing is we have to figure out what you're talking about.  Um, so there's sort of a linguistic analysis space.  So maybe there are words that you use and those words may be very ambiguous.  Um, so we have to have known,  we have sort of an a priori probability distribution for, you know,  given that we know where you are from geo IP data, um, you know,  if you're asking about a city,  we can say there's a certain weighting based on how far the city is from where  you are, what the population of the city is, what the kind of, uh,  fame index as we call it for the city based on sort of, uh,  crawls of the web that we've done and so on is that sort of tells us what, uh,  you know, what's that entity that you're talking about.  And then there's sort of a question of,  of trying to understand this kind of often very, uh, uh, very shortened.  In fact,  it's sometimes easier for us when it's a very shortened input that doesn't have  too many extra irrelevant words in it. Um, you know, we just want, you know,  just, just ask us the concept, so to speak. And then the, you know,  the first problem is to sort of, uh, figure out what, what the input was,  what, what is this, you know, let's, let's do the analysis of the input.  And we turn that input into a sort of precise symbolic representation where,  every kind of relation,  every aspect of the computation is represented in a precise way. Um,  then what we do is basically say, okay,  this is a precise representation of what a person was talking about.  Now we have these things, we call them internally scanners, which are just these,  these different, uh,  sort of types of computations that can be run on different inputs.  And then we say, okay, uh, there's this whole sort of bag of possible scanners,  which ones of you have something interesting to say about that input. Um,  and, uh, that sort of precise representation of the input.  And then you'll get a bunch of results in what we call pods. Um, and, uh, those,  those different pods, um,  will be the results from, um, uh, these different, um, scanners and so on.  Um, and they represent, uh, uh, and what,  what's happening there is where we're taking, well, as a practical matter,  you know, a request comes in and, um, uh,  it immediately gets parallelized across a bunch of different machines and these  different pods are being returned by different machines. Of course,  if you ask about it today, there's a,  there's a load balancing issue to do with all of our multiple compute clusters  and so on that's messing up some queries that have certain kinds of  parallelization. We just figured out just before this call, I figured out, uh,  um, uh, well, my team figured out basically how to fix this. So this will be,  this will be fixed before our official launch here. Um, but, uh,  ignoring that little micro footnote, um, the,  the basic idea is you're kind of parallelizing the question and, um, uh,  then you, you're, you're, um, uh, okay. So that,  then then what has to happen is these computations get done.  How do the computations get, well, I should say the,  the output from all these computations is a presentation.  And so then sort of there's the question of given all these computations that got  done, how do we prioritize which things are important about the answers that are  given and how do we then present those answers?  And we have all sorts of algorithms and heuristics for deciding sort of what,  what are the right visual representations? What are the right tabular forms?  What are the important pieces?  What are the less important pieces to try and give people sort of a good,  quick cognitive sense of what the, what the important result is.  It's a huge amount of computation.  Another part of this is when the computations are getting done inside,  there's sort of two big pieces to that. Um, one is, uh,  what to compute and the other is sort of where to get the data from,  to, uh, to, to sort of ground that computation. And so one,  one big thing that we've, we've done a lot of is, is data curation.  We kind of take all these different sources of data and try and sort of combine  them and correlate them and validate them and sort of put them through this,  this largely automated pipeline, but it isn't completely automated.  It has a sort of human domain experts also kind of in the loop,  um, trying to,  trying to make sure that the data that we get from all these different domains,  um, is, is actually as good as it can be and consistent and so on. So,  so we have this sort of a big, big, uh,  big amounts of data that are both, um, uh, static or,  or kind of a real time feeds and so on of data.  Then we have to combine that with the computations that you can do.  And essentially these computations are kind of the fruits of the achievements of  science and all these other areas of systematic knowledge. They're kind of the,  um, uh,  we're kind of trying to encapsulate in what's ultimately Mathematica programs  inside, um, uh, sort of all of these different things that we've learned,  how to compute in science and engineering and other areas. So, I mean,  and you know, inside Wolfram Alpha, what is it?  It's it's 5 million lines of Mathematica code and God knows how many terabytes  of data and all kinds of real time feeds and these types of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have a proprietary database? How is it structured?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, so I mean the, the, the kind of the symbolic representation, um,  inside is that's all Mathematica code. Um,  and so it's using sort of Mathematica's, uh, handling of, of data and so on.  You know, at the, at the underlying level,  we have some sort of traditional databases.  We've got a lot of MySQL databases and a bunch of other kinds of things,  but that's sort of the, that's the,  that's the underpinning of what we're doing.  And then sort of above that is where we use this Mathematica database link and  then then build up from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you in your own use of it, seen any results that surprised you?  Any insights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh hell yes. I mean all the time. I mean it's, it's, um, uh, uh, gosh,  I mean the, you know, basically every domain we, we put in and, you know,  I'm trying to figure out how it should all work and so on and so on, you know,  I'll be typing stuff in and I will always be surprised.  I mean one particular area is just fun. It's, um, uh, you know,  looking at people's names like first names and so on.  I had no idea how much structure there was in the,  in the popularity of a name as a function of time. Here's a,  here's a fun thing that I just was really surprised by, you know, given, you know,  you can know like from a birth records, you can know, you know,  how many people named, uh, you know, I don't know,  Steven or something were born in each year for the last hundred years or so,  but then you can use some kind of, uh, mortality data to figure out.  So just how many will be surviving at this time and so on.  And from that you can get kind of a distribution of what the expected ages of  people will be. And it's really bizarre because an awful lot of people, uh,  particularly with slightly more unusual names, you'll, uh, you know,  you can basically predict from their name, roughly how old they are.  That really surprised me. I was not expecting that.  I just didn't realize there was that, um,  that kind of quantitativeness in that area, but that's,  that's just one tiny example. I mean, I'm, I'm,  I'm continually surprised by, uh, you know, I've,  I've just never seen a lot of this, uh, uh, you know, I, I would, I'm sure,  you know, at some level the data exists because after all we're getting it from  somewhere. Um, but the, the issue is, um, uh,  to what extent can we, um, uh, can we get, um, uh, you know,  when you actually see it presented, um, in kind of a, a clear, you know,  graphical or whatever way, um, I'm often really struck by, you know, I sort of,  um, the sort of, you,  you see a lot of things that you just would never have, uh,  have never noticed any other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That must be gratifying. I mean, in a way that proves that this is, uh, meaningful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think so to me, at least, I mean, I've said to use it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. How, you know, I think one problem of course,  is that people are going to say, well, it's Google and it's not,  it's not a search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, I mean, it's a, it's a really different idea. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's never existed before. So it's, it's difficult to explain to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Right. Well, I mean, the kind of the way that, that I view it as, you know,  you have a specific question. It's something you might ask an expert,  a scientist, an engineer, a medical person, something like that. Um,  and it's a specific question and it's a question you can ask without having a  whole essay to describe the question. Um,  then that's something that the serious candidates will,  will from alpha to do something with.  And I think what will actually happen in practice is people will kind of, um,  they'll, they'll come up with particular patterns of questions that, uh, that they,  you know, that come up in their lives for whatever reason,  whether it's things to do with dates or whether it's things to do with, uh,  you know, computing tensile strength, the beams, or whether it's to do with, uh,  you know, historical weather or, you know, who knows what? Um, and they'll,  they'll sort of remember these are patterns of things that I can readily do in  all of them. Alpha just like, you know, with search and with the web,  we remember there are particular kinds of things like you can look up a person's  name. That's the thing people do. Or, you know,  I remember the first time it's probably years ago when I realized that, uh,  when I saw some obscure error message from my computer that I could type in a  fragment of that error message and that will be a useful thing to do. I kind of,  maybe I just blow,  but I hadn't sort of realized immediately that that was the thing I could do.  And I remember, you know,  there's a definite moment when I realized yes, the thing is going to work.  But you know, the difference in a sense between what's happening in the web and  web search and so on is there's kind of, uh, you know,  if somebody already asked a question and they wrote down the answer explicitly on  the web, you know,  somebody else's question that sort of they, they,  they gave an explicit form of the answer somewhere on the web,  then you can go search for it with a search engine and a search engine will  then give you a bunch of links that say, okay,  go read this page and that page and the other page to learn about the, uh,  sort of the answer that was given here.  What we're trying to do is to say, you know,  given the sort of corpus of knowledge that's been accumulated by our  civilizations,  is there a way to compute the answer to some specific questions that you  immediately, you know, that you yourself have?  And if we can compute the answer,  let's generate a report that shows what the answer is. We're not saying, you know,  here's a bunch of links to pages where people have written about this answer,  but sort of just here's the answer, you know,  hopefully presented in a clear way to the specific question that you have.  So that's kind of the, that's kind of the thing we're doing. And, you know,  I think what will happen is that people will evolve from, you know,  I was looking just yesterday, I was well,  and today I was looking at the query stream for Wolfram Alpha.  And yeah, there are,  there are a bunch of kind of search engine like queries which for which Wolfram  Alpha is not especially suitable. But then they're starting to be,  and I suspect there's going to develop even over the next few days in a week,  there are starting to be these very specific,  very sort of computational kinds of questions coming in that that are really,  you know, that's something Wolfram Alpha can do.  And you're not going to do that by just sort of searching the web.  And I suspect that, you know,  as people kind of get used to these kinds of patterns of usage,  that we'll see this sort of increasing divergence between what people expect to  type into Wolfram Alpha and what they've become conditioned to type into a  search engine, for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. We're out of time, but I want to ask one last question.  You kind of touched on this,  but what are your hopes for Wolfram Alpha in the future, a year from now,  five years from now, 10 years from now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so I mean,  our big goal is sort of to see how much of the knowledge that's been accumulated  in the world can really be made computable,  can really be set up in such a way that anybody anywhere can just type in a  question and get a report of their answer produced. I think that the,  you know, that's a big project and we're sort of,  I'm trying to sort of ramp up the effort. We're trying to figure out, you know,  the right kind of ways to build a sort of appropriate business ecosystem around  this so that we can ramp up this effort and sort of set it up and,  you know, get the,  we've had just tremendous amounts of help and an input from lots of experts and  lots of people interested in lots of different fields, you know,  figuring out how to sort of structure that,  that kind of network of that sort of community around the systems.  And then there are also much more kind of,  in a sense, yet different intellectual ideas, like, you know,  being able to sort of invent on the fly by searching the computational  universe, these kinds of things. So I think my objective is sort of to  get the existing corpus of human knowledge kind of committed to this  computational form and then to sort of automate the process of discovering,  you know, fundamentally new kinds of knowledge using these kinds of approaches  to science and so on. So that's the modest project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't wait. It sounds amazing. Thanks, Stephen.  Thank you so much for taking some time and explaining this. I really,  really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. Good question. Thanks a lot.
