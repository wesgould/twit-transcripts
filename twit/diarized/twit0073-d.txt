Transcript:  From people you trust.  This is Twitter.  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is Twitter.  This Week in Tech, episode 73 for October 15th, 2006.  Hello Armenia.  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Dell.  Visit Leo's Picks for some great deals on Dell desktops and laptops at twit.tv slash  Dell.  It's time to begin another twit.  A Sunday afternoon and gathered around to talk about the latest tech news are some of  my favorite twits.  Starting off of course with the star of the show, ladies and gentlemen, John C. Dvorak  at Dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, visit often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, visit twice.  Why not?  Hello Leo.  Hello John.  Alex Lindsay from the Pixelcore is here.  Of course our cohort and many other projects.  And Alex has been working hard on something we'll talk about a little later on that might  excite some people.  Neil Harris from England and bit-tech.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And also from Engadget as of this week.  Well congratulations.  I'm doing a legal column for Engadget so you can catch that every couple of weeks I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Many don't know that you actually studied law at university.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely for my sins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the elder statesman of the group and I'm really glad to get him back, Jerry Pornell.  Dr. Pornell of course, very well known science fiction author but from the tech community  best known for his columns.  I didn't realize this since 1970.  1979 in Byte Magazine, Chaos Manor and now at ChaosManorReviews.com.  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dot com?  That's it.  ChaosManorReviews.com, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's learning from Dvorak.  You say it a couple of times as people remember.  Jerry, it's great to have you.  Go early and often.  John's learned.  He knows how to plug it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm also still the lead columnist for Nikkei Business Publications.  I'm still well known in Japan and oddly enough, Byte Istanbul still exists.  So I am over there in Byte in Turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the last print edition of Byte?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there are three others and I'm in them all.  There's Riyadh and Brazil.  Brazil's a big country.  They're not big but yeah, but they pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aren't you in a magazine in Brazil too, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm in Info, which is the magazine published by Abril, which is the big publisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do they translate it into Portuguese?  You write it in English?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they do and it goes to Portugal too.  I have a translator there that's a genius and so it's, because I know a lot of Brazilians  that I see them and they say they're fluent in English and Brazilian Portuguese and they  say that the guy captures my humor, just you know, he does it right, which is a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do have a distinctive voice, as does Jerry and I would imagine that would be a  tough thing for a translator to get that voice to come across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's quite interesting because if you know the Enquirer.net recently launched a  bunch of foreign language versions and all the people in all the countries they launched  into went absolutely mental at the publishers because they'd taken all the Enquirer stories  and just written them in sort of flat prose and just stripped all the English humor out.  How do you be snarky in Portuguese?  Well, exactly, it's very difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think a couple of stories that are very big this week, one that's really a developing  story broken by Ed Bott at ZDNet.  Ed is an old friend of ours, John, we used to have him on the radio show all the time.  He used to write for PC Computing as I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was the editor for a while I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has in Ed Bott's Microsoft Report at ZDNet.com taken a look at the Windows Vista Team blog  and now at the license terms for Windows Vista and come up with some pretty kind of stunning  things.  I think the one that is most annoying is that you can only move it once.  If you buy a new computer you can move it to that new computer once but the second time,  no.  And you also can only sell it once.  It can't be resold after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And also it's going to cause some major problems if you are a heavy upgrader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because you can only reinstall once.  Yeah.  Most people buy computers with Windows installed but for those who build their own this is  a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, my experience with Microsoft, I'm not going to, I hate to take this, I'm not  a big fan of this concept either but my experience with Microsoft over the years with these upgrades  or moving the operating system or putting in a new hard disk or whatever is, you know,  you do get the error message and they give you an 800 number to call and if...  I think it's going to change, John, because of this new Windows Genuine Advantage thing,  you know?  Maybe, but in the past you used to be able to call them up and explain what you were  doing and they'd say, okay, whatever and they'd give you a code.  Yeah, I don't think that's going to happen this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was certainly my experience and Eric has had the same experience and he is forever  tearing them apart but whether or not it's going to change is what we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, one thing that is going to change is if you aren't validated with whatever the  equivalent, they're not going to call it Windows Genuine Advantage but whatever the equivalent  is of this authentication process in Vista...  Obviously it is called Windows Genuine Advantage in Vista.  Is it WGA still?  Yeah, absolutely.  So if you don't validate all of a sudden, the only thing you can do is surf for one  hour and that's it.  Vista suddenly loses all its capabilities and it sounds to me like they're getting pretty  serious about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think that's not quite right.  It's not that drastic.  That I think is what happens to you if you never activated it at all.  There are degrees of what happens but if you have activated it successfully the first  time, it doesn't just shut down and die on you that way.  It shuts down somewhat more gracefully than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm confused then and I guess we're just going to have to wait and see what happens.  There was some talk also about it not running or not being allowed to run virtual machines  unless you had the ultimate edition but that's been pulled out of all the articles, the TechWay  article and Ed's article.  So I'm thinking that maybe that changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I tried to call Microsoft and get them to comment on this last week, last Friday  and there was nobody available to comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't appear that there is going to be because I know quite a few people at Microsoft  and usually somebody will at least say something to me and there seems to be either confusion  or they've been told be quiet because the Wag Ed girls are not talking about it either.  Thank you for calling Microsoft.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're all busy trying to get Windows out before October 25th but we'll call you back next  year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what that says to me?  That whole thing says that the policy is not set in stone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They may be testing the waters.  This is a trial balloon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, they're probably getting bad feedback.  You know, they don't need this kind of agony.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the question though is that they're getting all this bad feedback but does it  really matter?  I mean, are people really going to leave?  Are they going to lose more than 5% of the users?  Well, 5% is a lot.  It'd be a lot for Apple but it's not, I mean, it's the same as it is for Linux.  It's enough for Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Their problem is that well over 50% of the versions of Windows running in much of Asia  and all of the former USSR are bogus and they want some of that money.  But herring after that Asian gold, if it cost you 10% of the hard currency from Europe and  the United States would be a disaster and I don't think anybody at Microsoft is so dumb  that they don't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's the risk though.  I mean, especially since we're seeing so many false positives with the current Windows genuine  advantage.  The new anti-piracy technologies I'm reading from TechWeb are dubbed software protection  platform under the new program.  This is what TechWeb says, a copy of Vista that's judged to be in violation of its license  counterfeit or counterfeit and the problem is with WGA you frequently even if you're  honest and it's authenticated, eventually at some point WGA decides your counterfeit.  That's when after a set period the only thing you do is browse for an hour.  And imagine the heat you're going to get from some company where 10% of its system suddenly  can only browse for an hour because WGA is broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure there's a long warning before that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that's the question.  Not necessarily but you know this will be cracked by some hackers in 10 minutes.  That's what gets me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not the hackers get around this stuff.  It's the honest people who are, you know, I hear from on the radio show who say, well  I don't know, I bought a copy of Windows but it says it's not legit anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going to make life a complete nightmare for corporate system admins because Windows  XP had this sort of whole corporate key where you didn't have to activate every machine.  Are they abandoning that?  Well they're abandoning it in favor of, you don't have to phone up for every sort of activation  of your 10,000 machines or whatever.  But as far as I know what they're doing is that you have to set up a license server so  that Microsoft gives you say X thousand keys and you have like a license server that handles  all those keys and distributes them to clients that request them on the fly basically.  And so you have got a dedicated key I think for each machine but it's not handled from  Microsoft it's like via a proxy server that you set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it possible guys that you could make this so draconian that people would turn away?  I mean what would it take to get people to turn to Linux or Mac or something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Will people turn away or will they just not upgrade?  Well that's totally.  They just won't move from XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  You have both alternatives.  If you want a new machine you're going to get Vista on it and it will certainly be lit.  This really only affects upgrades doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unless there's this false positive issue.  I mean that's really the question.  Paul Therotte who does our Windows Weekly column has had yet another false positive.  This time he knows it's a legitimate copy and he says he talks to people all the time  who have false positives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah Leo is it false positive from a machine he bought with it pre-installed or is it false  positive from a copy of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know I'd have to ask him but he's I believe it's a machine he bought from Dell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think Vista is installed on anything yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No no no but this is Windows genuine advantage on XP.  The point is that it works so poorly on XP that some fairly large percentage of people  are getting maybe it's a false negative.  They're getting dinged for having pirated software when they clearly don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I think that one of the things that regardless of whether it works or not I think the calculation  may be that it is if I lose let's say 5% of the market but I get 20% more revenue from  the people who because there's a lot of people who for instance get one copy of Windows and  you know upgrade it and then they you know they might have it on three machines or four  machines or something like that and if some percentage of those actually buy for every  machine you know that would that would make a big difference that would make more of a  difference than having a losing that let's say 5% of the market which I think is all  really is at play it's kind of like gerrymandering in politics.  We're talking about 5 or 10 percent of the market that's in play.  I don't think that I think that the rest of it's pretty well locked up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're talking a lot of money from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're talking a lot of money no but we're talking a lot of money if they lose that percentage  but what if it's offset by more people who are kind of in this gray area where they're  using more copies than they than they own.  Who would those people be?  Who would those people be?  It'd be a lot of little companies that have it'd be people with three computers in their  house it'd be a lot of little companies that have maybe you know 10 employees and or or  five employees that they're they're spreading it around a little bit.  It'd be those types of people and it wouldn't take very much to get work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know Alex I guess there's a few companies that do that but I don't think too many companies  that actually make money for a living are running bootleg copies of Microsoft products.  I would say that in a home environment where you have you know a kid and a couple of kids  and your wife and you have all have a machine maybe one or two of them even a hand me down  that that could be the case but I don't think Microsoft's you know they don't care about  that so much.  It's business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you're right.  But I think that we're talking about small businesses I know a lot of small businesses  who don't buy any software.  You know that they have 10 or less employees and these guys you know they don't buy anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know they must really have good employee relations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah because one disgruntled employee.  Yeah yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy you're out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's that bounty system.  I mean the Software Publishers Association pays thousands of dollars in a percentage  basis and what they can what they can collect they'll give it to somebody who turns in their  boss and to have like 10 people in the company with one of them getting irked like Jerry  said with you know within a couple of years and getting mad and then turning turning into  a company to ruin them.  It seems like an unlikely situation.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean I've seen entire game.  I'm not going to get too much into detail but I've seen I've seen companies.  I think it's nuts.  I don't I don't think that's a good idea but I do I do know that there's a lot of companies  that are like that and what there might be a calculation.  There are a lot of those companies a lot of those people out there and then you have the  entire you know all of Asia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe if they're like disposable companies where the guy says you know so what you know  we got to get this thing done and we're going to shut down anyway.  So what you know sue me after the fact after I'm bankrupt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would have thought your typical pirate situation was a guy who's got three machines and one  of them came with me on it and he put his copy of XP on that machine as well as on his  main machine.  Right.  I don't think you're going to get a dime out of that guy.  He's just going to say the hell with you.  I'm Linux.  I you know I'll put Linux on that machine and be done with it.  I just don't see where there's small all that revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think small shops should be switching the Linux anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you just think it just drives Bill Gates crazy.  It's always just driven him crazy.  It's always been a hot button for him and it's just you know I'm sure I know that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  can recall when he was down here he must have been 18 years old and he was selling copies  of Altair Vista at Southern California Computer Society.  Basic.  Yeah.  Southern California Computer Society meetings over at Harvard School.  It met over there and people would buy one paper tapes and he would they would take the  tape home and make a copy and come back and sell it for five bucks and he's getting 20  on his and I will tell you you could see smoke coming out of his ears when he would hear  about it.  It really got to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a famous incident of him chewing out the homebrew computer club over stealing  his set tapes his basic tapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well he did with Southern California Computer Society too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I wonder if anybody from the Digital Equipment Corporation in their deck 10 basic ever complained  to Bill about him stealing their basic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think he stole it.  Oh wait a minute now.  That's gonna be a good story.  You think he didn't write that sucker from scratch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was Paul.  Paul wrote it.  Paul wrote it but everybody if you talk to anybody back east you know they had a copy  of the deck 10 basic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They probably looked at it huh.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I can tell you.  Source code was available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I can tell you I saw Gary Kildall take a copy of DOS 1.1 or 1.2 and I could I have written  down what he did to get it and it brings up copyright digital research corporation Gary  Kildall program.  Oh you're kidding.  I am not kidding.  They left it in the code.  It was in the code.  Yeah that's the story.  I mean this is not this is not this is not somebody told me this.  Gary showed it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah well Patterson when he developed the Seattle DOS.  Yeah.  He apparently there was I've heard this story too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it wasn't it wasn't Microsoft it might have been Patterson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not telling you what I've heard.  This I saw I was up there at Pebble Beach and he said Bill Godbout said you got to come  up here Gary will show you something but he's only going to show it to you in person when  I go and talk about it on the phone and I come up there and by God there it was and  it really popped it up which is why DOS 2 is so different from DOS 1.  DOS 2 was written in a clean room.  Yeah.  And it's also why if you if you own old digital research DOS the ER DOS.  Yeah.  You will never be sued for look and feel.  I guarantee you you won't be.  I don't know all the terms of the settlement with Kildall but I know that was in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ancient history now Disney says we understand piracy now as a business model.  The president of Disney ABC television group and Sweeney and according to Fortune one of  the 50 most powerful women in business speaking at an event she says we understand piracy  now as a business model actually was an analyst call.  It exists to serve this is really interesting ABC Disney.  It exists to serve a need in the marketplace specifically for consumers who want TV content  on demand and it competes for consumers the same way we do through high quality price  and availability and we get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where's the story Leo.  This is Mars Technica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't like the model.  It's in the it's in the list a little bit farther down but we realize it's effective  enough to make piracy a key competitor going forward and we've created a strategy to address  this threat with attractive easy to use ways for us to for viewers to get the content they  want from us legally.  In other words keeping honest people honest a very interesting admission out of Disney  pirates piracy is a competitor.  I think that's a good way to view it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought it was fascinating that they they finally had the the cojones to stand up and  say you know there's another answer than just suing people right.  Oblivion.  Well it's a recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The reason the reason people pirate is because it fills a need that something people want.  And that's a big recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think they have a big opportunity with you know piracy is is rife but it's not you  know for TV certainly it's not really mainstream yet in the same way that music trading always  was.  And so they have an opportunity to really get these online services going which make  it easy as well as you know cheap slash free.  Right.  And fast for people to get the content that they really want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that I think that they if there's a big difference between writing a press release  that says that you really see piracy as another option and you and you respect it and  everything else and actually doing anything about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I like what she says.  I mean what it's what she says is the best way to fight piracy is to give people attractive  easy in other words the carrot not the stick.  It's easy ways to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I barely compare the ABC way of doing that right now as attractive.  I mean you're still stuck on the web you still can't put it on.  They're doing stuff on iTunes aren't they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey you guys missed a story here and Sweeney it's just ran and Sweeney fired as president  of the Disney Agency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Over our dead bodies and how dare you admit that.  I think this is the most enlightened thing I've seen and it seems like the only way to  go forward if you're doing business as a creator of content you've got to recognize that  that's who you're competing against.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder who in her family got the letter from the RIAA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She says while it's hard to compete with free it's not impossible.  And I think this is kind of the recording industry is kind of coming to this point of  view too even if they haven't made a statement quite like this by its carrot and stick  isn't it. The recording industry says we'll sue and we want to make the experience good  enough so that you're likely to buy instead of steal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about lowering the price.  Hey there's a thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She says the idea is the idea is to make it honest.  Keep honest people honest make it easy enough to do legally and palatable enough that  people who do feel bad about stealing will actually start to buy.  I think that's sensible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are a lot of people that will not download anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well especially especially if you're a little afraid that you might get sued you add that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  slight fear.  It's not even that my wife for example she has opportunities.  I mean you know but she refuses she buys CD she will listen to something maybe but then  she'll buy it. She refuses to.  She can't even want to if you totally a burner a disc she won't take it.  Good for her.  It's got nothing to do with anything other than she thinks it's she just doesn't like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She knows a lot of content people and she wants to she believes in what they do and she  wants them to be compensated.  She's an ethical person.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's got to be some limits she's married to John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh that's a good point.  Yeah.  Creative did an interesting thing with the firmware on the Zen.  Did you see this. They just shipped a firmware update.  Didn't say what. In fact the only thing it said is in the notes section is ads language  support for Czech Hungarian Polish and Turkish then down way down way down below in the  notes there it says oh and by the way disables all FM recording capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is definitely a great way to to get people to stop doing firmware upgrades.  I mean I know that man there was there was some point where iTunes I think turned off  our ability to.  It was there was a there was a very early on with iTunes.  You know you could you could share with people in the office and they could actually grab  your files you know between between each one and Apple turned on turn that off you  know in in one upgrade to another.  And I know that nowadays it takes me I probably don't upgrade my my firmware for my  iPod or iTunes probably for six months at a time unless there's something really a  really good reason to like things won't work anymore just because of that.  You know so it's a it's a great way to develop a great relationship with your with your  customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know it's the long arm of the of the I just hate to see somebody disable a feature  through through an update like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have great faith in the ability of American corporations to batter themselves in  sensibility just about the time they are able to compete with Bill Gates if there's a  theme.  Gates isn't brilliant but he very seldom makes terrible mistakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I think that also if I was if I was an FM broadcaster I would I would want that  feature to be there because apparently that's why they're taking it out though right  because I know you think that but I if I was an FM broadcaster I would want that to be  there because because that means people actually listening to my show instead of  downloading podcasts and music off of iTunes and everything else and listening to them  over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know it's well listening once to record everything and then never again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well maybe but but if I'm recording on my portable unless I'm really committed I you  know the chances of editing everything out of it is probably I probably I try to fast  forward through it but I am I doubt I would go through the process of editing a radio  show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you guys make of this stock options thing now more and more CEOs disappearing  McAfee CNET Shelby Bonnie resigning over the.  That was a shocker to me.  Post dating to.  I was shot at CFO as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is this is starting to really draw some blood here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why were you surprised that Shelby Bonnie resigned from.  Well I mean for one thing I don't understand why he even was involved in this kind of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  deal because he had most of the stock initially.  I mean he was like the founder of the company.  And the other thing is why did he have to resign.  Why did you say look I'm sticking around.  I'm sorry this happened.  I don't understand what what was the reason for the resignation.  I mean somebody's got to run that company.  It seems to me a guy like that's better than I mean just because he made some mistake  that might be a reason for him to resign.  He made some mistake that might be a legal issue.  I still don't see why can't run the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does seem like a rather guilty admission doesn't it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it was besides being guilty.  Why can't he run the company under this circumstance.  I mean he's not the only guy in the world that's caught in this mess and it hasn't been  fully resolved.  Well let it get resolved.  And so he bails out from the company.  So they got like who's running it.  Now I mean does Shelby is one of the two guys and then it was Halls.  He's the other guy.  Those are the guys who started the company.  Now they're gone.  Weird to me that they would just leave.  Well look at look at McAfee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They lost both their chairman their CEO and their president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean I mean what is it required that they quit because they have they have their tit in  a ringer.  It doesn't make sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well you know I think that the even the prosecution of this stuff doesn't make you know a lot  of sense other than telling everyone we're going to start enforcing it and you need to  you need to own up to whatever happened and then and then move forward because I think  that most companies want to stay inside of the legal realm.  I mean I look at the particular case that people keep on bringing up which is of course  Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is all more advice by one law firm.  I understand.  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's the thing.  And everyone was living in kind of this gray area.  And of course now we've decided that this gray area is now black and white.  But I think that that if you look at who are who are the real victims here I mean the  victims are usually the stockholders after people have been prosecuted and everything  else not.  I mean if they just owned up to it and paid some fines and called it a day that'd be  fine.  You know for most of the stockholders who are holding stock options or stock in those  companies because now like for instance as someone who has some stock in Apple you know  along with everybody else.  I don't.  OK.  I don't have a stock.  I don't either.  Well there you go.  You're nuts.  You're the only one.  All I know is that my stock has gone up twelve hundred percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah well it would certainly make you feel good if they forced jobs to resign  wouldn't it.  No I'd be I'd be I'd be I'd be mailing death threats.  There was an Apple notice that who benefits out of all of this.  Yeah the stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who.  Who Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who Jerry.  Who benefits.  You talked about it paying fines.  It's the bloody government.  The purpose of the government is to collect money and spend it on government employees.  That's what it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe here's a insight into why all these CEOs are resigning the CEO of Monster.com  Andrew McKelvey resigned saying he could no longer dedicate the number of hours  required for the stock option review.  It was just taken so long.  He said I give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I was about to say.  I would have thought that most of these guys look at it and say look I've got my  pile.  If they find me it is not going to be that much.  The heck with you.  You guys out there you little stockholders.  I was making money for you.  And look what they are doing to me for doing that.  And it ain't worth it because I'm not making enough to make this worthwhile.  I'm going to buy a yacht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Goodbye.  And I think that's exactly the point.  I mean I think that the government needs to fit in.  People need to really start complaining to their to their officials to their to their  representative that we should not be going down this path.  I mean this is the government should not be going down this path.  They should figure they should not be threatening people with going to jail chasing  them around to Africa doing all that stuff because it's you know it's let them let  them pay their fines but don't make it make it a capital offense.  How about how about this.  That's the silliness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is this is raising eyebrows.  CEO of H.P.  Mark Hurd just about a week before the H.P.  spy scandal became public.  Oh God.  He sold a one point four million dollars in stock options actually sold many more but  he made one point four million dollars in stock options one week before the  investigation got the lid blew blown off of it.  What do you think.  That would be a more controversial if H.P.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  share price actually moved.  But the market is so known it went down a little bit didn't it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It went down.  It didn't amount to a hill much.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well and I think also the you have to put into context that H.P.  evidently for their for their management only has a three week window every  quarter.  So he had to do it.  And he he sold it inside of that window.  So it's not necessarily you know you know I'm just trying to stir the pot.  I'm just trying to stir the pot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you think H.P.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  has been beaten about the head and shoulders.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know my favorite thing if anybody got to see Carly Fiorina on 60 Minutes.  Oh that was a trap.  And she came up after Patricia Dunn came out to wine and moan and groan about you  know Tom Perkins and his pal and then then then Carly comes up moaning and  groaning about the same two guys.  And it's like the whole thing and Carly was really defensive and she went on and  on in such a way that you know one thing that these guys never brought.  What was her golden parachute.  You know she's complaining about huge.  Didn't she get a huge.  It was huge.  And then now she's never get hired anywhere after writing that tell all book.  It's like you know somebody in Hollywood going to bed with everyone.  Why does she care.  Yes she made enough money.  Why does she care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean well at this point it sounds like she's trying to save her legacy right.  She wants to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's an egomaniac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never saw a CEO get that much publicity for being CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting there in many ways the celebrities of the.  They're not supposed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not Jerry they're supposed to be CEOs and stars.  I mean Jack Welch was the only guy who ever made a big stink about being the CEO  and look what had poor guys like you know he had all kinds of perks torn away from  him and he didn't help him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I knew Dave Packard he didn't seem to want to run out and show everybody how  he was in charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He had the name talking of talking of controversies.  We should have the John C.  Devorak I was wrong edition.  Oh yeah.  People's never going to buy you about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys are mean to me.  So OK let me defend myself.  What was it John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With the last week or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No way that Google is going to buy YouTube and I had a good laundry list of reasons  and 12 hours later.  12 hours later they got bought.  Of course I got a bunch of notes from various people who think you know are still  irked about the 16 reasons the Macintosh may fail column I wrote in 1982.  So anyway or there's a 1984 let's be correct.  But anyway so what happened was and I wrote I tried so I started to think about it and  I started to do the numbers and because you know obviously I was dead wrong on the on  the prediction and I wrote a pretty good column I think in Market Watch which ran last  Wednesday that describing what I you know why they did it and why it may or may not  work out.  I mean I still think it's that you know there's no there's no proof of concept that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just because they just because they did it didn't mean it's a good idea.  I think you made some really good points.  One thing we didn't know at the time and I think it was key to the sale was that  YouTube would make these deals with the record companies settling you know the  lawsuits and making right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Looking in hindsight everyone now believes that that was actually part of the deal  itself.  Must have been.  Yeah.  And maybe Google was involved in those deals to get to the liability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was absolutely I mean hilarious in some ways was that on Friday the rumors  were kicking off you know that Google was going to buy YouTube.  The stock the market cap of the company went up by four billion because of all the  stock rises on that news.  And then of course they made more money.  Sent it up four billion.  They bought it for one point six and made a net two point four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a very interesting point you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is very well.  Yeah.  Well done.  It's a profit deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it fell through it could have gone up four or two.  I mean come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think I mean Paul Allen had a great quote which was no sorry Paul Allen Steve  Steve Bulmer which was if you believe YouTube is the future of TV then it's  totally worth all that money.  If you if you don't believe it's the future of TV then what are you doing.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think it's a gamble on Google's part and I think they felt they could  afford to gamble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I think that it's a I don't think it has to be the future of TV for it to be a  good investment.  I think that you're you're looking at you know Google can definitely make money on  the number of page views there that are going on and on those page views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did the calculation on a page you value of a page like a YouTube page which if it  was done on just an old ten dollars per thousand cost per thousand basis it would  be a penny a page and they do 100 million pages a day.  So you can figure out that they can make you know it's a million dollars  essentially a day which over a year is 300 and then you know it doesn't take long  to pay for this entire investment.  But they've never proven they can make a penny a page from this and they're going  to have so much inventory.  I mean it's not that you know it's not as though it's like magazines at some point  when they get to be so large the cost to advertise in them is it prohibitive and  you don't they don't do well.  Well there's another.  So I think about that one.  Yeah there's another issue getting.  I'm sorry but Google's getting so big that I don't see how it's going to you know  it's going to be like Yahoo there's going to be a lot of page with no  advertising just giving it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's another issue at stake which is that in order to do this deal YouTube had  to also agree to implement technology that would make it very easy for copyright  holders to find copyright violations pull the stuff off almost instantly using some  sort of watermarking technique.  And an analyst raised a very good point if you take all the good juicy copyrighted  stuff off YouTube does anybody go visit it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh most of the stuff I think most of the good stuff is not copyrighted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I think when it started I got another question technologically can the net  support that much upload.  There's lots of download capacity but I don't know that many people who have all  that upload capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well don't start talking about tubes now Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have that's not sure I upload that thing all the time.  It doesn't take that long.  The only thing I think they have a you know they only will take X 100 megabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so it's not for 10 minutes 10 minutes of playtime and 100 if you have a pro  account I think 100 megabytes is the top upload.  So these are all short clips.  I don't think that's really the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think they'll have to take all the copyrighted stuff off because if they strike  enough of this deal of these deals then they won't have to worry about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well that's part of the technology could in fact instead of pull the stuff down  implement some sort of pay scheme.  I think that's what they're trying to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  They have to monetize in the first place to pay the royalties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think these guys should be paying to be on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think one of the mistakes YouTube might have made it's certainly what made it  popular but it makes it hard to advertise it.  It's many of these YouTube page views are not really YouTube page views they're  embedded YouTube videos on other people's pages.  Nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't have a handle on the number either.  I'm almost guessing it could be as much as 50 percent.  I bet it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet it is.  And how do they monetize that.  Are they going to start putting pre-roll video ads in there or what are they  going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  They said that that was a possibility.  Chad.  Is it Chad Hurley came out for the first time saying that they might do that.  That'll be a disaster.  Kill him.  Previously.  Well he's always said that it was a bad idea and on the day of the deal he said  maybe that's one of the things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean the problem now is that there's at least 10 competitors with YouTube.  If I want to for example I do it with the blog.  I upload a lot of stuff and then I'll put it on the blog as an embedded and even  though it has a YouTube logo on there I just people can run it from why is it  Reverend.  But I can do that with put file.  I would not put file but photo but there's a lot of places.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they do the same thing.  So if they start putting ads in there I'll just go to photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do people not use Reverend where there's an actual you know you shared  revenue and there's a chance to make money.  Why do much work.  It's hard too hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's too much work.  It's so easy to do the YouTube thing.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People aren't trying to make money.  They just want to put their videos up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  They may.  I mean like on the blog for example if you want to make money you can make money  on the blog but you don't have to make money related to the video except the  fact that it's a video post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hard to believe though that the website that specializes in guys getting kicked  in the groin is actually worth three times my space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well the guy has gone to court hasn't he to say that my space wasn't valued  highly enough.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that looking in hindsight I think I think it was conservatively valid  it was valued about ten dollars a subscriber which is you know kind of an old  number but the Facebook stuff is more like a hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well nobody realized how much it would grow either after the acquisition.  I mean even Murdoch has said that I had no idea what I was buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there was a story that ran last week about how they somebody did some research  and determined that the typical my space user the average median age was 35.  Yeah you know my producer I just don't want to do the whole story but my  producer came up with this theory the cranky geeks producer and Elisa Savage  and when she said it to me I said this has got to be the reason because this is  something I do.  If you look around on my space and you look at what people's ages are the  typical teenager will will max it out.  I do the same thing to 100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah most of them are 100 but that's not where they got the number it's not  you know it's not metrics they're not they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where else would they get the easiest place to get all they do surveys they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  surveys.  No I'm not buying.  I don't think that if they look if they're stupid enough to get it from the  profile information then then forget them.  Well how else are you going to get to 35.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The average age is 35 means there must be a bunch of 70 year olds on there not  buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked about it last week and you're right it's a little bit suspicious.  I don't know.  Once we talked about last week I got a lot of emails.  Annalise is not the only person to point out.  Well they're just you know everybody lies on there.  But I just don't.  What kind.  That's not any way to do any metrics is to look at the read the read the profiles  of the users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do magazines do when they send out their surveys.  And then they go to their advertisers and say look we're all our guys are CEOs.  What do they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not calling me.  And they do eight million dollars a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know I never was able to get that free copy of the magazines by by lying in  there.  They have.  You don't know how to do it.  You told me that there's some way to fill out that for now doesn't matter.  Nobody wants a week anymore anyway but it seemed like.  Hey.  Where is Spencer the cat now anyway is he drunk somewhere.  I don't know.  What was it was PC.  What was the name of that magazine giveaway was.  PC week.  PC week.  Yeah.  Used to be dominant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I think things change when they have different managers come in and change  names and things never could get a free copy.  They had one guy came through and he changed the name of PC computing to smart  business and it folded like six months later.  Bad idea that was like the stupidest thing I've ever seen.  Bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now he's at Forbes.  Speaking of bad ideas the US government is banning gambling.  Let's let's talk to our friend from over the pond.  How do they feel in England about all of this.  Are they laughing at us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You mean banning all for the numerous other things that the US does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's many other things too but let's talk about online gambling for a moment.  The US Congress said it's illegal for companies to accept Internet wagers or for  banks to process payments for online gaming companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the reason did you see they sneaked in basically in a terror bill.  Yeah well it's which which seemed amazing and they basically lumping in people who  were spending money on online gambling with people who are spending money funding  terrorism.  Well no we've gone for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This has always been the case.  That and cigarettes without cigarette tax.  It's all the fun terrorism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think it was.  It's almost unbelievable that the entire Internet you know gaming system is going  to get shut down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of these companies are British companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So well I think a couple of them are but I think like the party will party poker is  I think isn't it.  Yeah I think a lot.  Now one one British company.  Depends on American revenue.  Right.  They'll end the American revenue if they can't accept new American subscribers when  they're stuffed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One British company poker stars says we're not going out of business because we don't  think poker is gambling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a skill game.  It's a game of skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say that's the California that it's stud poker is a game of skill but draw is  not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would that be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's just legally in California.  At least until recently you could have stud poker poker parlors and that was games of  skill.  But if you had a lot draw poker that was considered to be a game of chance and you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  have one of those places over in Emeryville.  That's right.  That's right.  That's a great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We got them in city of industry and places like that around L.A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seven billion dollars of value wiped out last week by this law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I have a question.  Now no and maybe maybe we'll know the answer.  Now if I opened if I opened a an account in London and then transferred money to London  and then use that credit card for that account would I be able to gamble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you'd have a hard time opening the account in London because so open an account  you need proof of residence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh you have to be.  That's not true.  People do this in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a common employee in Canada to buy US goods at a lower cost like consumer  electronics because they're hugely marked up in Canada for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can get a checking account in Britain without being a resident of Britain.  Really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK.  Then you can maybe you can.  Besides you always get a Swiss bank account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's easy to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean you look at I mean I saw an article that said that the CEO for Ryan Air which  is this airline out of Ireland right.  Yeah right.  Well he said that they're getting to a point where they think that they're going to be  able to actually let people fly for free.  Now they're already pretty pretty cheap but when they people asked he said they think  they can make enough gambling revenue while you're in the air you know while you're in  the air to average it out.  Literally you're sitting there on your little your little LCD plane online poker and  there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now here's the question is do you do you have to gamble if you're going to fly or can  you just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No it's a percentage thing if you know 2 percent or 4 5 percent or 10 percent of the  people play and they all lose and they all lose enough during the flight.  I guess short flights are harder than long flights probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'd be great for like the long haul to Asia and especially all those Chinese aboard who  love to gamble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm betting they're going to take they're going to take a note from Las Vegas and make  sure that everybody gets free drinks at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What an interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a blog that it'll be on the Dvark dot org slash blog look up Ryan Air.  We've just lost John for the next five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So one of the one of the great old email programs Qualcomm's Eudora is going is going  to release its last commercial version and then go open source.  They're going to donate it to the open source community.  I guess Mozilla Foundation will be the caretaker and it'll be kind of part of  Thunderbird I guess.  First half of 2007 we'll see the first open source Eudora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey this Ryan Air story goes back to the last year in November.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well hey it's OK.  It was just a reference.  I didn't say it was new I just said it was relative to what we were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know you blog something like this and you get nothing but grief from the readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't say you should blog it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just said I just gave a fact.  We're setting traps for Dvorak.  Yeah.  Setting traps.  You know I hear Windows XP is going to be out soon John.  Here's a story that I like.  According to research sponsored by Apple.  OK we admit it.  A French consultant hired by Apple did a research and found that employees are much  more productive on 30 inch monitors than they are on 17 or 19 inch monitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh please.  It's like a Microsoft research report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's not even credible.  I mean I literally I tried I had a 30 inch monitor on my desk this week and I almost  died of eye strain because not only you know you're sitting so so close to such a  massive panel you literally have to pan your head.  You do.  Tilt your head to look left and right.  Yeah.  And you end up just thinking oh my you know give me a smaller monitor please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll put this link in the show notes if you want to get your boss to buy you a 30 inch  display.  I think it's actually true because you can have these windows all open at once and it's  very easy to copy and paste and move stuff around.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No I've done for video work.  You know they'll say you got to have a two but for two monitors is really a pain in the  neck you know and and literally literally a pain as you swim.  Yeah yeah you're swimming back and forth and then and I really think the 30 inch lets  you have a lot of things open at one time.  I think that's the I don't have I have a 24 inch but I have a but the 30 inch who a lot  of my friends have it.  I feel like sounds like we're comparing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I have to say that I had one for a test for a couple of weeks and it was it was great.  I just couldn't quite justify spending two thousand dollars on it you know and which  now I think is much less.  I think you can get not apples but you can get one for like eight hundred dollars.  That one is pretty cheap.  Yeah.  Eighteen hundred bucks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it's so but I call that cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that 30 inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah I do think it's I think it's better than having two monitors.  I don't think it's I don't think it'll add productivity as much as cutting everybody  off from the Internet about three or four hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would work.  That would work.  But you'll never see an Apple study saying that.  I could tell you that right now.  Get off the net.  Well might as well use this as a moment to recommend those Dell 24 inch monitors this  podcast brought to you by the good folks at Dell.  What are you laughing at.  I got to sneak this in here somewhere.  I like it.  I like it.  But I do have to say this is a commercial because you know it's it's the Brits will  who get mad at me for sneaking the commercials in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well you're a sellout.  They don't even like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what you have to slipstream commercials in nowadays is the only way I  believe that this can happen with television because because of the 30 second jump  button you have to.  But if you look at television back in the 50s and Jerry's probably the only one here  besides myself that remembers this.  But remember the old Jack Benny show where they would be in the middle of a skit and  they would start talking about some cigarettes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah well drag that to used to take out his camels and hand them around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well we don't have Laura Lard as a sponsor here after that.  We do invite people to go to the Leo's pick page at twit dot TV slash Dell.  And I you know I do like those Dell 24s.  I think they're really nice monitors and the Dell 30 is very affordable and  everybody agrees you know they have a built in memory card slots and stuff.  Anyway we've got some great prices and great deals.  Twit dot TV slash Dell when you buy something from that page or click through  that page to buy something on the Dell site we get credit.  So we appreciate it if you do that.  Twit dot TV slash Dell.  This concludes you may you may now release the fast forward button.  This concludes the commercial portion of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And actually the Dell 30 is far far nicer than the Apple 30 because you can adjust  the height.  Oh yeah see that's that's something that you can't do on the which is so important.  I don't want to that side.  I agree.  It is very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now let's go back to this comment that the Brits don't like slipstream  commercials.  What's the deal.  But they don't like commercials at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is it is absolutely the case that the sort of stalwart of the industry over  here both the sort of publishing and TV and things is that you have this this  really really really strong divide between your editorial and your sort of  commercial and advertising arms.  And so you always have you know if a publisher goes with a journalist to go and  see a client or something you know that's that's that's strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah but I get we've never had casting for God's I get more complaints from the  Brits than anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah I think the thing is that we've never had in radio and we've never had on  TV the whole announcer says the advert which I think is quite common on the radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very common.  The only reason I do it on the podcast is because that's how I do it on my radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah as far as I know certainly nothing I've ever listened to has that over here.  So it's just a different culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I sometimes you know I think it doesn't work a lot with radio.  I think if you slipstream something where it's part of the conversation I think  it's kind of cool but there is something kind of peculiar when you're listening  to some talk radio shows and the guy starts talking about some kind of vitamin  pill or how he loses weight while he sleeps because he takes some whack job  pill.  I mean this I think you lose all kinds of credibility or the or the what's it  what does one gay locally is that he's been sponsored by some gold trading  company.  Now he's going on and on about how great gold is as an investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The ultimate the ultimate one was was not that chance that was working for the big  American broadcast corporate who was to who's paid as the sort of technology  room.  He was getting all these back handers from Apple and guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean hey Jerry you're breathing again into the thing.  I think it's Jerry somebody's breathing and I think that breath is cutting off  will say that say what you just said again because I'll I'll edit the break up  out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was saying isn't it the case that someone that I can't remember which one it  was one of the big American broadcasts know it's had a technology reporter and  it turned out he'd been taking all these back handers from from Apple and various  people to mention their products on air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah that was a while ago.  Who was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well yeah our good friend Robin Raskin did a bunch of video news reports in  which he said the iPod was dangerous for kids and the one they were being she  was being paid by a number of other MP3 company manufacturers player  manufacturers so pretty sketchy.  That's pretty sketch.  The problem is that these VNRs get produced and then run as news by a lot of  local stations in the states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway you know Jerry and I have a philosophy we don't plug junk right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah we've turned down a lot of advertising from people I don't believe  in.  I like Dell and we've always used Dell computers.  I thought that would be OK.  But you know I also tell people look you think John or Jerry or anybody is not  going to say something nasty about Dell just because we have a Dell ad on here.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On that score can I say that monitors mine are the HP 2105 and a Lisee 20 inch  and I love them both.  I didn't know Lisee.  You get much bigger than that and I get eye strain because I can't swing my head  back and forth.  I like six or eight inch lines when I'm writing.  I don't want longer lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Writers say that they don't want big wide screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No you could have a you know you want to you want the word processor in a window  that's only a certain width.  But you can have a big wide screen for other things.  I mean sometimes you might want it.  For example I would have like I have a couple screens and I use that HP too.  It's a very good monitor.  But anyway I have like the word processor then kind of an eight and a half by 11  votes sitting there and on the next screen over there'll be the Dvorak dot  org slash blog.  You're kind of just sitting there.  So it reminds me to blog once in a while.  I'm going to have to start charging you for the plugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jerryprinnell.com is the only profit I make from this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd plug my website but it's down right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I have a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah what not only what happened but I thought you used DSL Extreme.  How in the world do you get enough bandwidth to support.  No no no no.  DSL Stream is my internet service provider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  DSL Stream is my internet service provider.  But we have a hosting service.  I used to have a hosting company called The Planet out of Dallas and they've  actually been very good for a long time.  We have dedicated servers.  I have three dedicated servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And how are they connected.  What's their internet connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh they get they had appeared through four or five different people.  They have big fat pipes.  That's that's just a lot of tubes.  I think ultimately level three is there is there big pipe.  But in any event it was just a hard drive died.  They didn't fix it.  They screwed up.  Six hours later I'm calling him saying what's going on.  I you know my servers down.  I don't know what it hurt and I apologize to everybody.  It hurt the feeds because the feeds were coming off of one of those servers.  And as a result when it went down you start getting the yellow exclamation  marks in your iTunes because they can't get windows.  It TV's up and it's fine and the podcasts are there.  But if you subscribe to a feed those feeds were down for it.  They should be back up any minute.  You know it's funny that I went to a new hosting company.  We've got the servers up.  Everything's fine.  But the feeds are through Leo dot a.m.  Which probably is a mistake.  That's the Armenian registry.  And so I've gone to go daddy and they've updated the.  All the other stuff is up to date but it's taking the Armenians a little longer to get Leo dot a.m.  To point to the new server.  So the feeds will be down until that happens and at that point everything will magically appear again.  Oh OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you have you own the servers that are at somebody else's low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No it's not a colo.  They own the hardware but I rent in effect rent the servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see.  I don't know why but I got the impression from your radio show  that you actually were running servers in your back room at your house.  Oh that's crazy.  You'd have to be out of your mind to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's crazy talk Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad to know you're not insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm probably stupid.  I probably should be paying more for managed servers and somebody sitting there with a you  know watching them carefully.  I just I just am cheap.  So I was responsible for keeping the servers running.  The hard drive died.  Nobody was paying attention.  When it did you know it actually been kind of flaky for a while and finally died.  And it just took a long time.  And then you know I put in a ticket and they canceled the ticket and it was just a snafu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I've got the best situation in the world.  Brian and Greg run this big server outfit for for a lot of big customers but they're big fans of mine.  And yes that's the way they're nice enough to to to host mine and I have their home phone.  They take care of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually sent a note to the planet saying you know that the world's largest podcast  network is now down and they went huh.  What's a podcast.  For some reason when you and John you've got so much clout when I try to when I try to throw my  weight around people just you know slap me back down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We just have to we have to put out the request that if anyone who is listening to twit  has their own hosting company they should email Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No no actually I've already well in fact I've got it's really been great.  I've got many many offers from a lot of different great hosting companies.  But it was such an emergency I didn't have time to wait for those offers to flood in.  And I and I found out somebody sent me a note saying you know about a year ago the COO and  a number of other high level people and engineers from the planet saw this saw that the planet was  going downhill.  This is my old company and left and started a new company called Soft player.  And I thought well I'll leave with them.  So I moved over to the soft player and they're doing the hosting right now.  So far so good.  But you know I've received so many good offers I don't know what to do.  I I kind of wish I'd had the luxury to wait.  Anyway everything should be by the time you hear this if you're hearing it at all everything's fine.  And if not well hey it'll it'll it'll be working sometime soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I got a really interesting story last night by complete coincidence which was I went to a party  and it turns out that an old friend of mine that I hadn't seen for ages is now  working in Apple's legal department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh are they the people suing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah so he is working on the iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you ask him about about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah absolutely.  I was like what the what the hell is going on.  So he gave me so he gave me the lowdown.  So what's the story.  Well they're saying that they've got a trademark though that they know they're trying to trademark  iPod right.  And that's their main thing.  So anybody that tries to any company that tries to do anything that sounds like iPod  or incorporates iPod they're going to go after.  And we know hence the my part of thing.  So they also try to trademark iPod cast.  Right.  Right.  That's that's the thing.  And they think that podcast.  Oh iPod cast.  iPod cast.  They think that podcast comes under it's close enough to iPod cast that nobody could use  it if they got this trademark.  Right.  They'll never get any judge or jury to agree to that.  The problem is that the podcast is now become such a generic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Generic.  So they're not going to get iPod cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They can't that they can't get it.  So what they're trying to now do is go after anybody that tries to use podcast for themselves  because they're like well we can't have it.  It's public domain but we don't want other people to have it because then that starts  to get too close to iPod.  So they're basically trying to stop anybody else from having a name that will incorporate  a trademarked version of podcast to stop other people having a claim over the word podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if I tried to assert a trademark to the twit podcast network they'd go after me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They might.  Good luck with that.  They seem to be they seem to be over.  They seem to be looking at people with with products or initiatives over actual podcast.  No they've actually.  That was what I was being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've actually gone after podcasters too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't there.  As long as you keep podcast out of your name or if you know there was a podcast network  but you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a podcast called the pod fit cast or something like that and they went after them.  The thing is the point is it's a it's a meritless pursuit but they're but podcasters are small and  aren't going to they're just going to cave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interestingly there's it's been a if you guys are fairly avid gamers but it's been a bumper  week on Xbox Live for for new stuff.  If you've got an Xbox 360 you can now get the demos of a FIFA 7 which is pretty nice.  Tiger Woods which looks spectacular and the new Need for Speed and the new Splinter Cell  all come out this week.  So if you're into any of those it's definitely worth firing up 360.  Is this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry but does anybody but me find playing golf on a computer the epitome of dull.  Well that and bass fishing.  And yet both are very popular.  Actually curiously enough the bass fishing game that used to be on the Sega Dreamcast  that had a little fishing pole that came with that used to shake when you catch the fish  would fascinated my daughter for we played that thing for for six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think girls like the fishing games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At what age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think she was like when did that dream came out.  She's got eight or nine.  Yeah something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah my son my son still is nostalgic about his dream cast he wants to take it back.  We gave it to somebody wants to cook it's a great it was one of the greatest boxes ever built.  I agree but not a lot of that's literally true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah there's a lot of good games though that crazy taxi was worth the price of crazy taxi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can still get that on the Xbox and it looks exactly the same as on the Dreamcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just playing I was playing Aztec today this this week on I guess on here's the here's  the weird thing they just posted a and I don't have it in front of me what the URL is but they  just posted a way to play Apple to games on on Internet Explorer on Windows only.  I don't get that that home to the active control.  Yes they figured it all out so literally every game ever played when you were and I had an  Apple to shop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean crush crumble and stomp is now available.  It's now available.  It's now available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it and I spent a day in missile commands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this will come in Chopper command that was the best game on the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah no no no crumble and stomp where you got to be a monster and run around and burn down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  cities where is this Alex wonder I want to play I want to play let me let me find it real quick.  Hold on while you're looking what do you guys think of the fact that Transmeta is suing Intel  over the entire x86.  Oh wait a minute hold on a second.  No it's a panium stuff I think close that tab.  What do you think of the fact that Transmeta is suing Intel over the entire x86 line saying it  infringes on Transmeta's patents.  Transmeta has gone from being a great little company making low power chips to basically  a patent company right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah well that's what they all end up you can't compete in this business anymore you just become  an IP company and you sue everybody and that's what you have to do it's the way you make money.  Is there merit to the lawsuit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably.  Transmeta alleges that Intel has made over 100 billion dollars on the processors it issues in  this case.  They must have acquired I mean Transmeta is not that old they must have acquired a patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No they had they're not a young company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I think what they had was they had some specific technology for low power chips.  I think they're saying that some Intel's sort of the last couple of lines that have integrated  power switching technology to minimize the power draw for laptops and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say Intel's speed step is an infringing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know about what I know about Transmeta is that they really hurt the tablet.  Really?  PCs yeah they they fooled a bunch of people into thinking that they could use their  emulation chip and it would work and tablets can't be that slow.  As a result a lot of people tried tablets and said they didn't like them.  I love tablets but you have to have a fast machine to make them useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Transmeta got into too many tablets.  Is it the hand right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Transmeta got into too many tablets and it was just it was incredibly slow and everybody'd say  if that's what tablet PCs are like I don't want them.  And it's taken years for the tablets to recover from what Transmeta did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think the tablets ever were going to take off Jerry.  I mean this has been a dead product since it was first invented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah a lot of people say that and you may even be right but I love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are people who are tablet advocates and I meet them all the time.  I bought one one of them convinced me.  I was sitting in a plane next to a guy and I got off the plane I bought an HP tablet and I have  to say it's just I guess it's some people love it and some people don't.  It doesn't do much for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can edit on an airplane which I can't do with the goon in front of me as a seat.  Oh that's true.  You can't open the thing up.  That's true.  And I can carry mine into a coffee shop and set it down and sit there and work on it without  having to have a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you use the handwriting recognition Jerry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you got to understand it recognizes my handwriting.  Right.  You know why?  Why?  Oh back in 1989 when I was in Moscow there's a guy named Stepan Panovich who was writing  a who had a company called Paragraph and they were writing a handwriting recognition program  and he had absolutely no samples of American handwriting.  So I let him Xerox about 50 pages of my notebook and Xeroxing under the communist regime was an  interesting thing in itself.  It took permits.  So he did that and he got 50 pages of my log book and so if it's going to recognize anybody's  handwriting it'll recognize mine because Microsoft bought them and that's the initial engine  and handwriting engine in Microsoft.  Well no wonder you love tablet PC.  I love tablets.  It recognizes my handwriting just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I'd be more likely to blame you than Transmeta for the failure of these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so.  It may be.  It may be.  For now it's all my fault.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How is your handwriting?  Awful.  Awful.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Awful.  I can't even read it.  My tablet reads my handwriting better than I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh there's some advantages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I found it.  Yes.  It is virtualapple.org.  All right.  And it actually works although I can't remember any of the keys and I don't know whether it's  you know I was having trouble getting some of the keystrokes to work but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm surprised you even have a PC to play it Alex Lindsay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I ran it on my on boot camp.  So I am that's what that's what boot camp's for is to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are there any dots or dashes in virtualapple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No it's virtualapplealloneword.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not getting anything here but preserving a generation of Apple II discs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah yeah yeah but see all those little discs at the top just click on like A.  You just click on A you'll see down below you'll see at the very bottom you'll see the most  important one which is Aztec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what about crush crumble and.  Oh let's look we'll just look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't see Aztec on here.  At the very bottom.  It's Arkanoid II.  Oh at the very bottom of the A.  Oh Apple II.  Not the G.S.  Go to the.  There is crush crush crumble and chomp is there.  Yes I see it.  It's there but I'm on my Mac side right now so I could.  Well this is kind of.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I find it.  Nuts this is crazy these people are clinically insane.  It's awesome.  Why is that?  Look at the number of games that they've done.  They've done all of them.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well once you get it working it's just doing all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All you have to do is one emulator and then you just take the discs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's amazing.  This is bloggable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little it's a little odd.  How long ago did this come out Alex before before John.  I found out about it this week so I don't know how long it's been there but I found

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  out about this week it was on like.  I think I can get away with it.  Dig or something like that this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But John where are you going to blog it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm blogging on Dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he owes you some money now Will Harris.  I think he owes you ten dollars for that little softball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good man Will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As a note it does require Internet Explorer on Windows.  Yeah it's active.  It doesn't run under.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is like the only reason to run Internet Explorer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one of the things you're going to see in the next couple of weeks.  In fact there was a little bit of a brouhaha.  It looks like Microsoft's going to push IE7 out to everybody by a Windows update and there was  one article that said it was going to force you to install it but it turns out not to be true.  According to Paul Thurotte you'll wake up one morning sometime in the next few weeks and your  PC will say would you like to install IE7.  And you'll be given it'll automatically download it but it won't automatically install it.  So it's IE7 and Firefox 2 will all be coming out roughly at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All I find was really interesting if you're using IE7.  If you go to download Firefox it says it's blocked the download.  Because it can't prove that it's not malicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It won't download Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well it will you have to specifically go and say yes actually you're allowed to download  because this isn't a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well Apple does that on everything.  Safari does that.  Any application that you're downloading from Safari will say are you sure you want to download this.  Yeah that was a big problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was automatically running applications.  They had to change that behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But do you guys use Internet Explorer?  I mean all I use is Firefox.  Tell them.  Nobody does.  But 85% of the people who are online according to most of these surveys say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't buy those numbers.  And the numbers I keep seeing are 50% people use Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Among the technically literate it's much closer to 35 or 40% Internet Explorer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Among the technically literate 70% of them use Firefox.  Yeah I agree.  Yeah I agree.  I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  You remember when Amanda went out to the park there in New York and  asked everybody Firefox or Explorer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're talking about Rocket Boom?  I...  Yes.  And what did she...  What was the result?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody watches that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well no it was when Amanda was on.  I liked it then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You liked Amanda.  She's doing...  Yeah of course I did.  She's doing...  She's got a new podcast where she's going across the country.  Maybe she'll come to Jerry's house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think Roberta would go for that.  Hey Amanda!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I'm not sure Roberta would go for that exactly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I'll just...  I'll send her a note.  Drop her a line.  One thing you sure not going to have is Andrew Barron and  Joanne Conlin will not be visiting your house in the near future.  The new Rocket Boom.  Anything else anybody wants to talk about?  Any plugs anybody wants to get in before we wrap this up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How long have we got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As long as you need Jerry.  I think we're done aren't we?  ChaosMatterReviews.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I think we're done and maybe another time for this but  I do think we ought to be talking about net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah Jerry has done some research and wants to talk a little bit about it.  You know we could we can talk about it now or we could save it for another time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd save it for another time.  It's not going anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's sure gone off the front burner though hasn't it?  I mean people aren't really talking about it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But lobbyists are still out there pushing it and that's one of the things that bothers me  is that we're dealing with legislation here and it's going to be shaped by lobbyists and  the user community isn't going to have much to say about it  because we don't have any spokespeople in that big heavy lobby game.  And the players are all on strange sides.  The libertarians think they want to give the government more power over the net and  it's just goofy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We need to put together a pressure group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah we could probably do it with this broadcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the twit army is pretty strong.  Yeah work something up.  So what should we be saying?  Should we be saying we want legislation to protect net neutrality or we want to fight  legislation to enforce something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me just say this.  Any legislation will have to be come out of a committee headed by Mr. Stevens.  Talked about clogged tubes as the model for the internet.  Do you really want a man who believes that the internet has a bunch of tubes that get  clogged to be writing legislation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what you're saying is no legislation should be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think none is better than anything we're likely to get.  I understand the goal of the people.  I understand the people who think that there are things worth protecting but I think the  cure is far worse than a disease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I have to say I'm kind of in agreement with you Jerry.  After going back and forth on this it seems that anything the government does is going  to be a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not in agreement with either one of you guys.  You think they should legislate net neutrality?  Well you used the word they and the point of Ted Stevens but you know if you could put  something together and then hand it to them on a silver platter that was written by the  users that was written as good law instead of something that Stevens would dream up and  get it to go through somehow or other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure and if you could give everybody a core two dual machine in the country and 10 gigabit  bandwidth it would be a good thing too.  And a couple of hookers while we're at it.  I'm not sure that that's not as easy as getting legislation out of Washington that hasn't  been worked up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's probably as easy as getting the core twos that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John why don't we do a triangulation on this?  Maybe that might work.  Why don't we do a triangulation on this because I think it might be time to do something in  a little bit more depth.  We'll do a special edition on net neutrality.  Jerry we'd love to have you on it and maybe we can get some congressional types, EFF that  kind of people and figure out the real solution to this because I have to say I'm puzzled by  it.  I'm obviously in favor of net neutrality.  I'm a feared of any government legislation like you Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm afraid of any government legislation period.  Well that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you could write the perfect law John what would it say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't do it off the top of my head.  That's the problem with writing the perfect law.  It takes a little while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John while you're doing it think very hard about what powers you're going to have to  give them in order to enforce compliance.  Yeah and who's going to get them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm taking all the power for myself Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you start telling Tom Warner exactly what instructions they can write into their routers  which is what basically you're talking about with this legislation are you not then going  to have to be able to read those instructions?  I don't think that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you really want to give a government agency?  I think you're taking it.  You're coming from some really weird angle on this Jerry.  Oh no.  I'm not in any sort of agreement with you but unfortunately the show is over for today.  Yep.  I'm not buying this kind of approach to the argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good.  We've just gotten a taste of what this will be about and I think that would be a  worthwhile show to do so we will pursue that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Specious arguments is what it's going to be about from the sound.  Specious arguments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mine are not specious.  Mine are based on technology which I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't wait.  Specious argument where you're talking about we're getting a court to duo to everybody in  the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
