Transcript:  your panel, the Dias cast. Let's get right into it. We've got I think I think  we can all agree the biggest story of the past week was the busting of Silk  Road. Now this was a website in the in sort of the dark net, the gray CD area of  the Internet that you could only access through the Tor network. For those who  don't know what the Tor network is, think of it as well, an onion. That's what  the Tor is, the onion router that allows you to grain anonymity because as your  packets pass from one router to the next, they only know the next router that  they're going to. It's a nice way to sort of guarantee that someone can't  track back your actual IP address. Well, we covered a little bit about the Tor  network not too long ago and how it had been compromised by the federal  government, so I guess it was only a matter of time before they busted the  biggest website in this dark net and that was the Silk Road. Now Silk Road, for  those who again maybe haven't been jumping around on the Tor network, was  sort of a clearinghouse for things illegal on the Internet. You could buy  narcotics, you could buy card swipes, you could pretty much sell and trade anything

End time: 344.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so it doesn't all have to be illegal. In fact, I will also admit I've  dabbled a little bit in Tor, a little bit in the Silk Road, just to see what you  could have sent to your house. Patrick or Schwud, have either of you ever played

Start time: 344.50
End time: 409.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  with Silk Road at all? I thought you were going to say Bitcoin, but then you go straight to Silk Road, the answer is hell's no.  I'm fascinated by, like Silk Road sort of rose to prominence by having a  best practices for anonymity to protect everyone and in many ways the shutting  down, and of course there's horrific stuff on Silk Road, you know everything  from, you know, you could buy pornography, you could contract killings, you  could have drugs, people were selling fraudulent IDs that they would ship over.  Nobody's defending what was sold on Silk Road, but I wonder if one of the things  that's happening is there's a lot of talk about how the federal government  was able to take down Silk Road, and I wonder if all that's going to  generate is another layer of best practices for underground transfer of  materials. In many ways, isn't us reading about the takedown of this just setting  the stage for the next thing to take its place, not unlike the Dread Pirate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Roberts itself. Right, well let's talk a little bit about that. Oh sorry, first  Patrick, you, not Patrick, I'm sorry, we've got two Patrick's in the show, so you  have to be not Patrick. You wanted to say something? Yeah, it's by Twitter handle, so

Start time: 421.18
End time: 517.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah, fair enough, but yeah, you know, there are two really interesting  things I think that we heard in this story. First of all, you mentioned that  the government sort of broke into the Tor network, and in the case of Silk Road  at least, they didn't actually use any, you know, they didn't break into that to  get the identity of the guy. They actually used pretty standard, if you  want to boil it down to what it comes to, it's web search. They found the  guy through a forums, it was on Stack Overflow I think, where he made a rookie  mistake posting with his name for one minute and then changing it to his  nickname. So the anonymity of Tor from what I understand, and Silk Road, is  kind of still intact. And the other thing is, you were talking about the fact that  we can use, we could buy really trivial things on Silk Road as well. Now I  personally never went there, but a lot of what we're hearing from, I'm sorry, I  forgot the name, Ulbridge. Right, Ross. He has, exactly, yeah. So he has some  ideological, at least the excuses he's giving are somewhat ideological. He wants  to create an anarchist experiment slash utopia with this tool. Now of course,  there are things that contradict this ideology in the way he acts, but  from what he's saying, it isn't intrinsically destined to be used for

Start time: 520.08
End time: 569.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  illegal activities. Right. I think there's actually a really good comparison  here between Tor and Torrance. By the way, the two are not the same for anyone who  might be wondering about that. In that people just associate Torrance with  illegal stuff, with movies, but there are perfectly legitimate uses for a very  good technology like Torrance. Same thing goes for the Onion Router, for that  anonymity network. It could be used for many good things, protecting dissidents  in countries that are monitoring the internet, for making sure that your  transactions aren't being monitored by a third party. In fact, you know, the same  sort of security that's baked into Tor has been emulated by several  perfectly legitimate security vendors. So, you know, I hope that this is not that  moment when people just assume anyone running Tor must be a criminal. Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not. And what's funny about this is not to get anything started about the NSA,  but the NSA hates Tor because Tor is a wicked, ripping pain in the ass to crack,  and they don't have much success with it. So there's some of the documents that  have been released recently point out that the sort of the irritation that Tor

Start time: 586.80
End time: 600.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  brings to the NSA. Even though, ironically, the federal government finances,  what is it, like 60% of Tor because they want to have a protected way for  dissidents and for journalists to be able to report from within regimes

Start time: 605.18
End time: 657.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't even get that conversation started with this crew. But what's funny, though,  is, you know, the Ars Technica had a really good article on this, and  one of the things they do is this was plain old-fashioned police work on a  large scale with the FBI, with a lot of subpoenas, where they basically found, you  know, one of the first mentions and who, you know, one of the first mentions  was from Altoid on a site about mushrooms, and they referred a WordPress  blog, and that had been created, and they worked their way, they worked the case.  This wasn't a case of, this is like classic hard police work, and it's kind  of funny that this guy, the Dread Private Roberts, you know, Oldrich, who was like  very peace, love, and understanding, and against force, was like somebody's trying  to blackmail my clients, I'm going to call a hit-out on them. Which is really,  that's old school, North Jersey, lower Manhattan death. He paid $80,000 to hire a

Start time: 658.34
End time: 730.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hitman to take out a former associate, and you know, and the FBI did an  old-fashioned sting. They had someone pose as a hitman, he transferred $80,000  in bitcoins, boom, they had their proof, and they went in to make the bust. So  you're absolutely right. This story, unfortunately, will be seen by some as,  well, the Tor network is now insecure, the Tor network is forever doomed. I  don't think so. They didn't break the Tor network to make this work. In fact,  there was a bust not too long ago, dealing with Freedom Hosting ISP, where  people assumed that the government had taken over a layer of the Tor network  to find the identities of people who were trading in kiddie porn. That wasn't  the case. What they had done was, they had hacked the servers that they were  accessing, and they installed malware which infected the people who were  visiting. It's not quite old-fashioned police work, but it's the same sort of  thing. They didn't bust the mechanism, they busted the person on the other side  of the screen. Now, my question to Patrick, to not Patrick, is, you know, does  that mean anything? Is that that fine line? I mean, to say, look, the government  did their job, they didn't violate what we think is the inalienable right to be  anonymous on the internet, but they did get some bad people. Well, it's

Start time: 731.06
End time: 817.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  definitely good that they got the guys they were looking for, and I think it's  also very good that they didn't either manage or need to crack Tor as a network,  because first of all, it would have validated probably, you know, more  surveillance somehow, you know, with everything we've been talking about for  a few months. The ability to crack something, defeat some anonymization  system, would have put more strength in the fact that they would need more of  these kinds of tools. Thankfully, they didn't manage to do that, or they didn't  need to do it. It's also interesting that they're being, maybe not quiet, but I  mean, we're not hearing so much that, look, this is just good police work, and I  think that should be pointed out a little bit more. Now, to come back to what  you were saying earlier, you're saying that Tor is being viewed in a, you know,  with this suspect kind of people who use Tor must be doing something bad. I  personally haven't seen that all that much. Silk Road, definitely, but Tor is  still sort of in that neutral gray area of this is a tool, and some people will  use it for good stuff, some people for bad stuff. Is that something that you  guys are seeing in the US that Tor is now suspect? Man, I got to be honest, like

Start time: 817.28
End time: 923.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tor is so sort of underground. I mean, even here among the Twitter audience,  we're having to explain what Tor is to a lot of people. That's how  fringe and underground it is. I don't know that it really has a reputation that  can be affected one way or the other, but one parallel that I'd like to  explore is in the days of, you know, using air quotes here, stealing music,  Napster ran supreme and was the central hub by which everybody, you know, dealt  with their music or got their illegal downloads. And then once Napster went  away, you saw an increase in the anonymity side of thing. You saw  distributed hosting with BitTorrent, and that became the way people started to  share all their stuff. Right now, if there's one person you don't want to be  right now, it's a client of Silk Road because all the servers have been nabbed  by the federal government. They have all kinds of information that they're going  to use to track down people, whether it's, you know, people offering fraudulent  whatever's or drugs or whatever, like all this crap is going to roll downhill.  The head has been cut off for this beast, and now they're going to feast on the  innards of all these lower level criminals. Are we going to see the same  thing again where now all of a sudden the next structure will induce or create  some kind of double blindness to where because that's probably right now, if  you're somebody who wants to sell meth or cocaine or whatever, and you go to  Silk Road, you trust the reputation of Silk Road to be this repository that's  above reproach, and now you've seen that's not the case. I would imagine that  that future clients of whatever takes its place will want some kind of some  kind of security on their end that they won't be able to even if they get taken  down that they're not going to be found out. You know, interesting security note

Start time: 923.32
End time: 947.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  here. We have been so focused on the transport layer, the pipe that takes data  from one point to another. That has to be encrypted. That has to be protected.  How dare the NSA spy on that? That we kind of forget that eventually that data  ends up stored on a physical hard drive somewhere, and if that physical  hard drive gets confiscated and if it hasn't been encrypted, that it doesn't  matter how well you encrypt your transport layer, your data is there for

Start time: 947.52
End time: 1003.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the taking. Well, it also helps like one of the reasons servers are located in  certain countries and they get routed access to a server. You might have three  or four jumps between the public and that server so that if someone does  come after you legally then they have to go through some of the most  privacy sensitive courts or countries and fight their way through that to get  the location of the actual servers and then get to that server. They have to  fight with that country that the server is located in and then hopefully you've  been smart enough to encrypt all of that data. But you know there's a reason  why there's a reason why say Twitter and not a Tor network was  used during the Egyptian revolutions because it's easily  accessible. You know you can dump accounts, you can dump cell phones,  but mostly because it was just it was not really complicated to set up and  setting up Tor and servers and encryption and doing all of this is  really hard. In fact the guy that set up the Silk Road basically didn't follow  his own advice and left too much information around. Actually did you

Start time: 1003.64
End time: 1026.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  did you hear apparently the the guy who got arrested might not be the original  Dread Pirate Roberts. It seems like well what he's saying at least is I'm not the  one who set this up. The guy did it and then bestowed upon me the title and you  know that title will be bestowed upon someone else. Yeah I heard that the guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the morning and then one day. You know Patrick all I can say is as you wish.  Oh man. Okay there is another angle to the story that I would like to take and  it does more look at law enforcement because no matter how we feel yes there  there is a level of law enforcement that we want to see on the internet we want  to see with ventures like this because obviously Silk Road was not above board  obviously they were using Tor to hide some pretty shady dealings but then  there are those who will point to this and say see this is why the NSA needs to  have backdoors into encryption. This is why the FBI needs to be able to have  backdoors into our data centers and so I think I want to start this off with  Schwud. Schwud I mean if I'm not doing anything wrong I shouldn't fear right? I

Start time: 1081.42
End time: 1144.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  should be totally fine with this. What is what you are fishing with the stinkiest bait of  all time what is this? Look here's the thing and I almost wonder if if the you  know the timing of this stuff who is to say if it was just the right time to  take someone down but but I would imagine if I was on the outside looking in I  would imagine that in the last say two or three months the popularity and the  interest in browsers like Tor has gone through the roof because we're hearing  story after story of every kind of compromise thing the NSA poking their  face all over the place I would imagine that now would be a very good time and I  would imagine that internally there would be a lot of pressure to show a win  for defeating the bad guys by taking down somebody from behind a an otherwise  secure thing. No there's no case to be made that the NSA needs a backdoor if  anything this is in every way of validation for as you put it traditional  police work where you have people who know somebody who somebody makes a  mistake and you take them down and it was all done without breaking encryption  so if anything this is the evidence that that we don't need any backdoors.

Transcript:  Breathe, breathe, cleanse, cleanse, let it go. Fine, fine we're all good here. Okay now  not Patrick you can give us the the non US centric look at this what do you  think about a government agency coming to you as a citizen and saying look we  need help old-fashioned police work isn't gonna cut it in this century we  need a way to look at these supposedly secure communications but we promise we

Start time: 1172.58
End time: 1305.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  only gonna look at the bad guys. Yeah so that's the trick question isn't it I  mean if you want to go really first layer then this is exactly what what  what Schwartz said you actually didn't need it in this case so bad example if  you want to go really deep and philosophical I think we've discussed  this a million times but I've never heard anyone actually explain why that  question that you're asking is invalid why people saying you know we're just  gonna use it to catch the bad guys or we just need to observe everything and the  reason is everyone says you know it has to do with freedom it has to but we  don't have the actual explanation the reason is if you are being observed and  think of think of your home if you know that you're being observed in your home  then you are going to be acting differently when you're being observed  you're not being completely free to act as you want that means that your freedom  is restricted when you're being observed when you don't have somewhere some space  of privacy for yourself so your freedom is actually being I can't believe I'm  saying this but is actually being attacked when you don't have a space to  be completely private to be completely your own and it doesn't matter that it's  in the physical space or that it is in the virtual you know internet space now  if you want me to tell you about the outside of the US perspective it's that  you guys act in the US I say you know I generalize you guys don't really care  about people outside of the US the whole debate that you guys have been having is  are we allowed to spy on American citizens or not the the outside of the  US question is kind of settled so we're not so happy about that and personally I  would like to you know I would like the the the question to be are you allowed  to spy on everyone in general not just people in the US oh I'm sorry I wasn't

Transcript:  the idea like the whole thing that made my entire youth growing up you know we  knew about the NSA we knew they listened to phone calls but it was always  international phone calls we had this this bizarre fig leaf that like as long  it was always the other and not us right correct and it's it's it's it's  astonishing to me that it's suddenly an issue because because we know that  they're watching us they were always watching us it was it was it was a false  dichotomy to begin with and I am hoping that if anything good can come of the  horrific realizations that we have is that maybe maybe in an age where we are  seeing the twilight of true privacy we can establish robust methods to to bring  that back the idea that you could say something or be someone in one place and  be someone someone totally different in another place you know there's all kinds  of extraordinarily legitimate reasons for this because as as many people have  said before me you don't need freedom to say something smart and you certainly  don't need freedom to say something popular you need freedom and you need  the protections of freedom in order to say something unpopular outrageous  ridiculous or crazy which time and time again we see that many of the most  important ideas of the human race come from the fringes who say outrageous  stupid things from the outside otherwise they couldn't say in polite society the

Transcript:  in a modern network so and that is that is that is correct today but there is no  reason father that we can't create structures that are robust that that  anonymized traffic we can create privacy only if we as a society decide that it's  okay for us to live thrive and survive in a world where somebody cannot know  something and that's something right now we're at the dawn of this era of  sharing and we all are fascinated with the fact that we could tweet out photos  of our breakfasts but but we are we're losing something and I think stories  like this make us realize that that that maybe there's a value to to a  segregation of different parts of our lives these firewalls between our  public and private lives I think is important and I'm hoping that that that  we will decide as a society to create more structures that make that possible

Transcript:  Padres Jays question which was how does this tie in with the the movement  towards real identity identities on YouTube using Google plus for the  comments in no way does that shift actually reveal true identities instead  what it does is it creates an environment where your reputation  matters if your reputation is this particular identity you can have five  different identities you can have five different names and you can create  backstories for all of them and histories and you can comment on each  of them but it will but the ability to hide behind an anonymous brand new name  and be given the exact same weight as somebody who has commented and been  upvoted hundreds of times beforehand the fact that that false equality is no  longer under the new system that is significant you can still nobody will  ever know who you are you can live your life as a banker and then and and you  know leave comments as a as a you know a transsexual prostitute or whatever and  but as long as you create that reality again

I want my bitcoins back and they're not going to think about the fact that they want their bitcoins back but now the federal government now has the entire list of trades they did where they were shipping you know meth or shrooms or weed or whatever they were selling that was not a legal thing and at some point there's going to be this rush of stories where stoned idiots asked the FBI to give them back the money they made for selling shrooms right it's sad but it's going to happen yeah of course that's that's why I was saying you know probably no one is going to actually go in and request their bitcoins but.

I ask a in the game but it's shrugged off as being part of the game experience what is the difference between bitcoin and I ask a they both have exchange rates they're both manipulated they're both traded who is to say is the US government the one in charge of deciding nobody's real currency nobody's nobody least of all me is saying the US government is in charge of deciding what's real or legitimate security cute emails with somebody in the US government explaining to me why I don't know what I'm talking about but this is also like you know speaking of.

Transcript:  now let's get on to a different kind of story because I think we've had enough of all this hacking and not me boring and drugs and bitcoins and drugs and virtual currencies and all this exploit stuff so let's talk about a new story yeah let's talk about hacking of IE that's right there's a brand new story about you can see what I'm going with this. I thought you said a new story I'm not sure what you mean oh no but this is new we've actually got video this is an interesting story about a new  exploit called CV 2013 3893 which allows people to access a DLL in Internet Explorer that essentially lets them control everything that you're logged into it's we called it a browser pivot and we actually covered it two weeks ago on this week at enterprise tech when we had Raphael Mudge who is one of these program Uber programmers who works a lot with Metasploit who showed us exactly how an exploit like this can work here's a tool I've

Start time: 3465.22
End time: 3513.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  been working on and it's called browser pivoting and I'm going to inject myself as the attacker into the targets Internet Explorer and what this is going to do it's going to create a proxy server the I the attacker can go through tunneled through my remote administration tool and this is going to allow me to access anything that the users logged into so far I go to for example Yahoo mail in my browser is the attacker oh look I'm in the user's email.  Now this is making clear this is not an RDP exploit you're actually using the browser process yeah I'm in their browse I'm in my browser on my attacker system now I'm able to go through this web application that the user authenticated to without them knowing.

Start time: 3514.58
End time: 3530.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is an I'm I'm sorry you know normally I totally respect you in all regards Padres Jay but the fact that you allowed him to get away with calling this a browser pivot when clearly it's a much budge on this defies me.

Start time: 3531.52
End time: 3581.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will bring it up with them we're going to have them on the show on a regular basis so I'm going to have to have you and him you know so you can express your displeasure no but I mean this is one of these exploits that it's probably the most impressive one I've seen in years and he was literally able to do this as we were on the show he ran metasploit he was able to find the vulnerability insert himself and start surfing as the user now this isn't this is one of these exploits that sends information back to a computer it doesn't report  to a botnet it actually lets an attacker access any site on your browser that you're logged into as you I mean think about how many times you go to a website and it knows who you are or you your email server it's already logged in your financial information your your username and password have been stored so that you don't have to remember each and every single time they get access to that if they browser pivot on you.

Start time: 3582.48
End time: 3599.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But so what do they need to actually do this perform this exploit do they need your IP address they need you to run Internet and target you they need to run it you need to run Internet Explorer and go to a website and they run their that loads their JavaScript on your system right and then all hell breaks loose.

Start time: 3599.52
End time: 3605.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you go if you go to the to the offending website to one of the yeah okay I get it.

Start time: 3606.04
End time: 3672.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh but it's terrifying this this is not this is not one of these exploits where you have to visit a site to download the malware onto your computer.  Oh no sure yeah it's yeah it's yeah okay so it's built into the metasploit framework now which means that anyone with a finger oh no let me to use metasploit properly does take a little bit of skill it's not a total script kitty tool.  But anyone running the latest version of metasploit can could conceivably walk into a campus network which is typically not the most protected system on the planet plug in scan all the ports and all the IP's that are currently on the network find the computers that have this vulnerability drop the vulnerability on top of the icon from that computer and boom they now have complete access to everything that person has been doing in IE.  Here's the really scary part there are some people who think well I would know if someone's remote controlling my computer that really doesn't work that way unless you are paying incredibly close attention almost superhuman attention to the amount of resources being used by your computer you would have no idea that someone is doing this and it would leave no signs that you could pick up later.

Start time: 3672.24
End time: 3706.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it just looks like you it just looks like you computer thinks you're using your browser and basically so somebody logged into I don't have to go to a website it's a JavaScript injection but somebody running metasploit on my network would be able to squirt this onto my machine correct.  So should we should we explain this a fix it be one why isn't Microsoft issued a security update for this yet because there's a there's a Microsoft fix it and I love Microsoft fix it because it's a strange little remote thing where it fixes your machine but as long as it's secure but why hasn't Microsoft implemented this patch yet.

Start time: 3707.20
End time: 3723.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's because most people at Microsoft use Firefox.  Wham sorry no that's yeah this should this is a critical vulnerability and I mean this scared me more than anything a lot of vulnerabilities look scary but you know they're so hard to pull off.

Start time: 3724.74
End time: 3737.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Robert what what is it that's special about Internet Explorer that makes this vulnerability uniquely possible on and I understand there you know there's is there anything theoretically that says that a similar type of attack couldn't happen on other browsers.

Start time: 3738.80
End time: 3771.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well technically I guess it could but they don't use the same DLLs the problem here was the way that IE is written and the the the dynamic linking libraries that it uses aren't really locked down not that well I mean because remember you're always balancing accessibility flexibility the ability to use a platform with the ability to keep it secure.  This is one of those oopsies they never thought that someone would be injecting themselves in this way and and now they're getting burned that's that's basically the history of security vulnerabilities in windows or any other platform.

Okay somebody open an unlocked door okay they can open a locked door if it's a bad lock okay though you know I mean it's like it's it's it's layer of crazy but it's I love the the the CVE miter.org entry on this use after free vulnerability in the set mouse capture implementation and.  MS HTML dot DLL Microsoft Internet Explorer six through eleven allows remote trackers to execute arbitrary code it's just obscure and it's in the IE DLLs you know there will be other horrible security problems in the other browsers that just don't happen to be this particular one Brian.  Yeah sure sure.

Transcript:  But you know I see the tie into our previous discussion because again people are always concerned about the transport layer that that pipe I have to the Internet being spied on it when honestly it's a lot easier to compromise either the end user's computer or the end user himself or.  The server that the user is accessing at so you know really this is this is the stuff we should be worried about this is the stuff that we should be concerned about my computer could be owned right now if I had ever actually used a computer.  And I wouldn't have a clue that someone had just accessed all the sites that I had access on my browser.

My brother ran metasploit.  We should mention that there is a fix right now hopefully we'll drop it into the show notes Microsoft did issue a fix it in the mid September or so so if you are using IE if you stuck with IE if you love IE please please don't serve to another site until you have run that tool.

Transcript:  If you thought your Adobe reader was insecure before now that the bad guys have the actual source code.  No this yeah this is they're they're really trying to downplay it and they're doing one of these things where I don't think they know how to respond to it.  So they said yeah we've been breached and but it's not that bad and as details keep trickling out it's turning out how bad it was.  First it was there's a there's been a breach we're not sure what was taken.  Then there was there was a breach and we think some credit cards have been exposed but it was all the encrypted stuff.  Then it became well there's 2.9 million credit cards and accounts that have been exposed.  And now it's and they may have walked away with source code for some of our most popular products.  All right.

Transcript:  So keeping in theme with my predisposition to be counterintuitive here.  Is this a weird time to remind people that in cases of fraud your liability is zero with your credit cards.  Your liability is $50.  Look it was but I believe even that's gone.  I mean I'm no expert but I believe for years it was it was $50 was the maximum liability but I believe it's zero now.  But essentially your liability is zero.  And and there it's easy and fun for us to say you know oh look you know I hate to be one of those credit cards or whatever.  But the truth is if you look at your bill I got signed up once for a nine dollar free trial for some you know a Sahi Berry crap or whatever.  And I went ballistic changed my credit card number called and got it rejected on there.  It's it's astonishingly easy to deal with fraud in this digital age as long as you pay attention to your bill.  And the penalties are astonishingly low if somebody tries to be fraudulent with it.

Start time: 4094.45
End time: 4107.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First of all that's why I don't do I don't do debit cards.  But second of all I believe again I believe that's been updated recently to where the liability is zero for debit cards as well theoretically now the liability may be zero but it can still be taken away.

Transcript:  In Bitcoin I was lying before.  No I mean I'm with Brian I mean it's obviously a big deal.  I think the bigger deal might be the source code for you know all the PDF tools we use could be potential time bombs now.  So that's I think a bigger deal than the credit card.  Obviously it's a problem but the credit card thing the liability.  Yes you could be in a situation where your account is emptied and then your your checks bounce and that's that's absolutely true.  But overall it's it's something that we kind of it's an inconvenience that we agree everyone collectively as a society to live with in order to get the convenience of having a credit card or a debit card.  The source code issues might be something that are actually making the whole environment a lot less safe.  Right.

Start time: 4184.70
End time: 4269.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See that's the thing for me credit cards are one thing and it makes for a good story.  You can always say oh it's 15 million credit cards and it sounds like it's a bad thing.  But honestly that system pretty much polices itself.  If you've got a lot of credit card breaches the end user you you're not going to be financially affected all that much even though it can be a major annoyance inconvenience so on so forth.  I don't want to minimize that.  The the the source code part of this story is what scares me because imagine this imagine how many times we've heard of a vulnerability with Adobe with Adobe Reader with with Adobe products.  Now the way that vulnerabilities were exposed was they kept hammering at the executables they kept hanging at the services until they found holes and then they would exploit those holes.  They don't have to do that anymore.  If they have the source code they can actually go line by line and find out from inside where the weaknesses are going to be which means they can find weaknesses that they would never have been able to find just by hammering on the executables.  This this is actually horrible.  I mean imagine how much of the world depends on Adobe products specifically on Adobe Reader.  Now imagine what would happen if all those computers were suddenly owned.  Let's go back to the exploit.  Let's say that now that that same exploit works in Firefox.  It works in Chrome.  It works just you sitting at your desktop.  That's the kind of access that we're talking about.  If someone actually has the source code of software you're running on your system.

Start time: 4270.16
End time: 4337.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's also I mean it's pretty brutal like OK 2.9 million customer credit cards.  Those were encrypted.  You know assuming it's quality encryption that data is probably pretty safe.  But it's crazy right.  This appears to be a group of hackers that have broken into LexisNexis done in Bradstreet a whole bunch of other interesting places.  And that what what happened was I'm reading Krebs on security Alex Holden CSI CISO Hold Security LLC discovered a massive 40 gigabyte source code trove stashed on a server used by these these cyber criminals.  And what's interesting is not so much that they had the source code but they cracked into the credit card the credit card servers and then use that to get access to the rest of Adobe system.  So there's some really bad lack of firewall going on there or some really sophisticated hacking.  But then if I'm reading correctly Adobe's response Adobe is still in the process of determining what source code for other products may have been accessed by the attackers.  Which basically means the attackers could have been planting things in the source code to do nefarious stuff later on which is really frightening for something that is.

Start time: 4337.96
End time: 4345.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 4346.00
End time: 4362.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This isn't this isn't one attack.  This was something that they just discovered.  And the reason they discovered is because the security officer working on something else stumbled across 40 gigabytes of code took some screenshots and went to Adobe and said hey does this look familiar in Adobe went.  Yes that looks familiar.

The thing is not being a security expert I'm kind of in the in the shoes of the guy who sees it on on you know the eight o'clock news and he's being told.  Oh holy poop.  It's really horrible and the world is going to end and I'm like wait what.  What should I what should I do.  Like what's happening.  Can I can I be safer by doing something.  So it's yes.

Start time: 4497.54
End time: 4505.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

End time: 4533.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is honestly this is one of those things where you cannot you cannot patch this if they have the source code unless you're rewriting the entire software.  Well unless they found something in the source code that they need to fix.  Oh wait unless they're saying OK so we finally started going through our source code and we found all those holes so we're going to fix them before they get to them.  I don't know.

Transcript:  Yeah well it's it's it's funny like the Adobe Secure Software Engineering team the assets are going to be there.  The Secure Software Engineering team the asset blog they also say it's kind of funny like at the same time they're saying on October 2nd we are not aware of any zero day exploits targeting any Adobe products.  Adobe announces that they will be doing security patches for their products so you could go Adobe.  So clean that code.

Transcript:  How is it different from other zero day exploits.

Start time: 4565.54
End time: 4608.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.  It's a great question.  How is this different from other zero day exploits.  The way that this is different is because when we're talking about a zero day exploit it's typically it's been created by a couple of I'll call them security researchers who have been hammering at a service until they find a hole they find a way either to overload the stack so they can inject their own code or they've just found some sort of weakness in the way that data is transferred to and from the service.  This is different because they are not attacking they're not hammering at it.  They actually have the blueprints.  It would be like the difference between someone breaking into a building by going and checking all the windows if they're open and someone actually having the blueprints from the building so they know oh there's an access shaft down there I can get through.  That's sure that's what we're looking at.

Start time: 4609.12
End time: 4616.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Once you see they're in the building you can go and lock that access shaft in the same way that you would you know closing the window that was open couldn't you.

Start time: 4617.14
End time: 4626.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well yeah but I mean they don't know which of the thousand different ways to approach this building are going to be used by the attackers.  That's what we're looking at.

Start time: 4626.54
End time: 4644.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you mean the quantity and the ease with which people who want to exploit these issues in the software is what makes this dangerous.  Correct.  There's got to be more and possibly better hidden attacks.

Start time: 4645.03
End time: 4674.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Oh put it how about this.  Here's a better way to think about it.  If I'm going to run a standard exploit against the service I have to try 10,000 different things before I get the one thing that works.  Right.  And so if I'm a good security person I'm actually looking at all those attempts and I realize OK something's brewing something's someone's trying to get in.  If I have the source code my attack works the first time and you have no time to prepare because I've never attacked your system except for the one time that it worked.  Right.  That's how.

And of course the stock dropped immediately and people were saying oh my God we told you this was going to be horrible.  As it turns out this was a single accident where some driver drove over something and ripped the heck out of the bottom of his car.  The car caught on fire.  Everyone took pictures of it and now it's the Tesla Roadster is a death trap.  This you know this this is one of the things I want to bring this up because I do believe this is the lighter side of tech because is this not Fudd in all its glory.  Right. I mean this this is oh my God we were right about the electric car.  Whereas how many times do we see gas cars burst into flames.  How many times do we see accidents destroy cars.  But because it's the Tesla it almost makes me feel that if there was ever ever an accident with a Tesla Roadster people would just assume that it's going to kill you.

Transcript:  Well it's it's I mean it's interesting to read this right because something I didn't realize about the Model S.  So earlier this week a model is traveling at highway speeds struck a large metal object apparently a piece of a tractor trailer that had fallen off.  The geometry of the object caused a powerful lever actions that went under the car punching upward and impaling the model less with a peak force on the order of 25 tons.  Only a force of this magnitude would be strong enough to punch a three inch diameter hole through the quarter inch armor plate protecting the base of the vehicle.  So I didn't you know like I knew there was like stuff protecting the batteries and there's a lot of batteries in a Tesla S quarter inch plate.  That's huge. That's twice the thickness of the typical like safe use to store you know things in the in a home in the United States like that's that's an incredible amount of steel to wrap around the batteries.  That's also an incredible amount of force to act on that steel.

Transcript:  That's the weird part which is so many news agencies that ran with the story last week.  They were making it out as if oh well you know they just hit something on the road you know a broom you know bucket and this is like no this was a this is a shard of this was a tank killing shard of steel that got pivoted under the car and ripped into the battery pack.  And yeah in that instance that battery pack is going to catch fire.

Transcript:  But I think and and while we're on this subject Padre like what do you think of the fact that Elon Musk personally responds to all of these things earlier we saw Elon Musk respond to a bad review that somebody gave of the of the Model S saying that it died mid travel and of course he dissected the data to go back and essentially call the guy a liar.  And the fact that the that that Elon is personally responding to you know with explanations over Twitter and of course press releases explaining exactly what happened and pointing out quite correctly that he said look if we're going to compare apples to apples you know I forget the number I'm probably wrong here.  But he said that the gas cars are you know 20 times more likely to explode in a collision or whatever.  Right right.

Start time: 4924.54
End time: 4979.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know here's the thing there's there are those who are saying wait a minute Elon Musk is he's acting like the irresponsible CEO five times more likely.  Right.  So they say oh he should just shut up he should let us PR people handle this it's not the job of the CEO to go out there and jump on every negative story about about his product.  But and I'm only going to speak for myself right now because previously I've been speaking for the entire Catholic Church but now it's just it's just me.  But I love seeing this.  I love seeing this kind of engagement he is obviously a geek he is obviously passionate about this.  And so I like it when he actually mixes it up with people and says wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute back off for a second.  I know it's fun to point fingers but before you do that let me give you the real data either about the review let me let me show you what the computer said about his battery use or this.  Let me show you what actually penetrated the car.  And it's it's surprisingly refreshing to see a CEO do that.  That's just me.  I don't know if anyone shares that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh absolutely.  I mean I mean I agree.  Look I mean Elon Musk is our real life Tony Stark and I love the fact that we live in a world where he feels appropriate to jump in and call stuff out on that.  You know and he's right by the numbers.  I mean he gave the numbers was he said over one hundred fifty thousand car fires per year one vehicle for every 20 million miles and one fire and over one hundred.  You know basically he lays it out.  It's like you know his cars by the numbers and granted the sample size is smaller is five times safer as far if you're worried about explosions than gas vehicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably not.  If anything it's probably going to make me more likely to actually go and buy it because I think what you were saying earlier Brian is very true.  He's not letting his PR people do the talking and instead what's happening is that he's saying he's he's talking normal.  He's saying what all of us would like people to say in these situations.  Sometimes it's it comes off as a little rough but usually overall he's just you know saying what everyone thinks and that buys him a lot of sympathy I think.  And he is now I can't remember you know I can't count how many times he's been compared to Tony Stark but that's a pretty good place to be in.  So I'm sure he's rubbing some people the wrong way but overall I think it's a very much a net positive for him.  I think he's going to be the reverse Tony Stark.

Transcript:  I don't know.  There's a really I got to say there's a really interesting article in this on the MIT technology review that one of the things they talk about is how the one thing that came out of this that wasn't particularly positive news is it's a reminder of how hard it is to put out lithium ion battery  fires because apparently that they thought they had the fire at the firefighters thought they had the fire out and then it lit sort of reignited itself again so I think it'll be interesting to see that.

Start time: 5211.54
End time: 5283.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it's okay so National Fire Protection Association 17 automobile fires reported every hour kill an average of four people every week automobile fires are 10% of reported US fire so obviously there's a lot of gas fires catching on fire we could talk about the Crown Victoria having the gas tank behind the axle it's been the result of the death or or or disfigurement of a lot of police officers or state judges.  Police officers or state troopers in the United States.  There are flaws there are flaws with gasoline as a fuel, because it does do that thing where it goes.  But it's interesting at the idea like okay if there is a lot of Tesla's in between the San Francisco Fire Department and the Petaluma Fire Department or the Santa Rosa Fire Department.  Maybe that means all the fire departments have to put together a better school for putting out lithium ion battery fires or maybe Elon Musk probably already has a crew of engineers at some isolated place lighting lithium ion batteries on fire not that they have a lot of spare ones to burn to figure out the best way to put the fire out because of what they're saying is if these things heat up and more electrolyte leaks out as a response to the heat and electrolyte reignites that's problematic right.  So it's a matter of how unlikely it is to happen.

A fantastic all in one platform that allows you to make amazing high quality blogs, portfolios or any kind of website.  And you don't need to have any kind of background or skill because their templates look so good.  Whether you're a CSS wizard or somebody who doesn't know the difference between an H a T and M and RL, then Squarespace has got you covered.  If you need an exceptional looking website and you need it right now and you need it to look good, whether it's on an iPhone, on an Android, on an iPad, whether any kind of tablet or a desktop computer, they're going to make you look fantastic.  Yeah, they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are.  And one of the things that I love about Squarespace is that they allow me to channel my inner Leo and what my inner Leo is telling me about Squarespace is that you're going to like them because they're always improving their platform.  You see, every time we advertise Squarespace on the network, they've got new features with new designs, even better support than before, which I didn't think was possible.  They've also got beautiful designs.  They have more than 20 new templates for you to start with and all the style options that you need to create a unique website for you or your business.  And Brian knows about this.  You know, you don't want to buy into one of these packages and find a beautiful website that looks just like a thousand other beautiful websites.  They let you customize.

Start time: 5423.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should get a Squarespace website.  Your inner Leo commands you.  You know, there's something wrong with your inner Leo.  You may need to get that looked at.  But my inner Leo reminds me that Squarespace has actually won several awards, including from the FWA, the Webby's from Forbes.  That's right.  They get awards just like NSFW show one that big chat room thing thing thing that we buy.

Transcript:  By the way, one of my favorite stories, and it's a true story, formerly of Totally Rad Show, Jeff Kanata had his personal website on Squarespace and he used one of the default templates  and was surprised to find himself on the list of 50 website was it designs to be inspired by like he was on a curated list of like this is an exceptional site.  And they didn't know that he had just used the default template from Squarespace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And you know, one of the other things I like about Squarespace is you don't have to be a programmer.  It's really that easy to use.  And they're inexpensive.  They're inexpensive.  In fact, I think they're only about eight dollars a month, which which puts them right in that that realm of possibility for even the most novice, the most simple, the most basic user of Web Services.  It's incredibly easy to use.  But you know what? If you want some help, Squarespace has a support team that will work with you 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  And that eight dollar plan I talked about that includes a free domain name if you sign up for a year.  So basically, it's a wash with trying to do it yourself.  Why would you do it yourself if you could get an entire team of experienced professionals behind you?

Start time: 5525.06
End time: 5546.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, keep in mind, here's the best part about Squarespace is they use distributed hosting.  So if your site suddenly becomes super popular or better yet, if somebody tries to like DDoS you, they're going to find that they just walked into a club made of diamonds.  They're going to be in some kind of diamond club and they won't be able to permeate the walls.  They can't take them down.  That's the strength of the diamond club.

Start time: 5546.56
End time: 5575.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And you know what else that diamond club does?  It does search engine optimization automatically.  You may know that that SEO thing.  Yeah. Yeah.  It's how you get out on the Internet.  And with Squarespace, they advertise for you.  They ensure that your site's content can be found under the search terms that it needs to be found.  So if you are part of that club, that's kind of diamondy.  You don't have to go and pay another service to do your search engine optimization.  It's built into the package.

End time: 5630.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let me tell you that first part.  The first part is it's even better than free.  You see, they let you start it with no credit card required.  That's not one of those annoying sites that says, yeah, we'll give you a month free.  But first, give us all the information about you.  No, no, that's not Squarespace thing.  They want you to try the service, see if you like it, see if you're comfortable with it.  Then if you like it, you go ahead and buy it.  So when you decide to sign up for Squarespace and this ad should have convinced you to sign up for Squarespace,  make sure to use our offer code TWIT10 and you'll get 10% off and you'll show your support to This Week in Tech.  Now, we thank Squarespace for This Week in Tech, but we also thank them for everything they do for the TWIT TV network.  Brian, is there really anything better than Squarespace?

Transcript:  What's this thing about the swarm bots?

Start time: 5656.21
End time: 5752.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, all right.  So MIT made these individual cubes.  Each one is about the size of a child's building block.  You picture the ABC blocks that you have in your hand.  And inside, they figured out that most robots are built for stability.  They're built for mobility with legs or some kind of treads or whatever.  And to run those things, you require all kinds of gears.  They built these little bots that are self-organizing.  They're autonomous, and they move purely by a little flywheel inside that spins up to 20,000 RPM.  And then by doing it, they realized they could spin it real fast and then stop it.  And the block would jump forward.  And they discovered this quite by accident.  But then they realized that putting magnets on the outside of it would allow them to essentially create, you know, when you watch Transformers  and you see, you know, basically a boombox melt into all of a sudden a 20-foot-tall robot or whatever.  And you're like, nothing can move that way.  Or you watch the T-1000 melt into liquid metal and you're like, nothing can move that way.  Essentially, they've created a framework that really can do that.  These cubes, self-organized, they look like Tetris pieces right now.  But in fact, we just talked about this on the Weird Things podcast.  It is astonishing to watch these things in action.  I know Chad's going to bring it up on screen right now.  Now, jump to about, yeah, about two-thirds of the way in right now.  And you'll be at there. You go right about there.  You'll be able to see these things moving around.  And for the first time, you can see how these things could essentially do the stuff that we've only seen in science fiction until now.

Transcript:  Actually, I feel like I am trapped in a spinning box.  So it wouldn't be that much of a difference.  I always love I love stories like this because, you know, especially when you've got students who are who are just messing around.  They've come up with these concepts that someone is going to use this this idea of a self assembling robot of robots that can create structures with very simple mechanisms.  This is going to make its way into some product that eventually will click and someone say, oh, that's right.  Why didn't we think of that before?

Start time: 5810.41

Start time: 5812.75
End time: 5887.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And maybe not.  Yeah, maybe not.  I mean, it is astonishing.  It is definitely something that is super interesting.  I mean, to look at it, they look alive.  And I guess that's what makes it especially enticing for us.  It's technology that really looks it's not a robot.  It's just a box.  But it does look somewhat alive.  There's a really, really, really, really, really, really long way from this to something actually useful.  This is fundamental research almost.  And it could be I'm playing devil's advocate here.  Sorry, but it could be that this just remains jumping boxes and it turns into a children's toy and nothing more.  I don't really see how these boxes could become something you would need to have mechanisms and like for them to do something else.  They would need to have a lot more on board or like to assemble into different geometric forms that could move in unison.  It's very, very early on.  And I don't want to be the grout here, but I could see this become awesome.  I could also see this become just, you know, nothing.

And that is guess what they're selling at IKEA now.  Solar panels.  Wait, you bots.  Well, yes.  So Q bots that put themselves into solar panels.  Now, this is only happening across the pond.  It's in 17 British stores.  They're talking about a couple of Chinese made systems that will sell for roughly ninety two hundred dollars.  The idea is now that you can walk into IKEA and in the same aisle that you buy your usk, which is some sort of desk, you get to buy a system that will go up on the roof and provide at least partial power to your house.  Now, this is something that people predicted about solar in the United States so long ago that you would be able to buy and walk into a Best Buy and buy something that will help to remove yourself from the grid.  But it never materialized for any number of reasons, including a lot of regulation.  Why is this now possible in British stores?

Start time: 5962.31
End time: 5978.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, to be honest, there's only one thing I care about.  Like, do they actually do anything?  Are you spending a hundred dollars so you can save nine dollars and thirty five cents on your overall electric bill?  This is conspicuous consumerism.  And obviously, no, no, no.

Start time: 5980.93
End time: 5993.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lay it on me.  Okay.  First of all, first of all, they're talking about with the with the what's available in terms of purchasing subsidies in in the UK.  You're talking about a seven year payoff on a product that should have a 30 year lifespan.

Start time: 5995.17
End time: 5998.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  No, no, no.  You said you said subsidies, though, right?

Start time: 5998.82
End time: 6079.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, OK, even if it's not, even its full nine thousand dollars, I think it takes it up to ten year payoff for a product with a 30 year lifespan.  It's like on one hand, I get what you're saying.  Like, oh, God, just we need somebody else spending one hundred thousand dollars on electric car to prove how green they are because they're using coal generated electricity and their giant lithium ion packed vehicle to move without fossil fuels through the highways.  Don't give me you got to remember something.  I live in northern California.  I drive a seven thousand pound three quarter ton diesel truck, but I'm running biodiesel, which is actually domestically produced from recycled fricking Frito lay potato chip oil, which means I have a lower footprint in terms of actual carbon energy consumption than a fricking Prius because my fuel has pulled the carbon out of the air recently.  Take that back off, lady.  Just I'm going to go hug a tree.  I'm doing it in my own way.  And my way is in the Prius.  My way can pull an airstream.  Now that I've had my northern California rant out of the way, I do believe in solar cells.  I do believe in solar energy.  I do believe in the million roof initiative here in California, because the idea anytime you take digging stuff out of the ground to produce energy, you've done something positive.  It may take a while to pay off.  You should do the math.  You should investigate the company that's offering to do this.  But I like the idea of actually self containing energy inside of a home.  This is a good thing, Brian.  Don't be all negative about it, please.

Start time: 6079.70
End time: 6095.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But here's what I'm saying is there's the gap, right?  There's what you pay up front.  There's the environmental cost of the manufacturer of the product.  It's easy to look at this kind of story and just say this thing be good.  Why is America bad?  Because it's Ikea.  How can Ikea?

Transcript:  So your problem is I feel like we're in therapy group.  Let's all approach Brian with positive energy and bring Brian love.  Brian, your issue really isn't with Ikea or conspicuous consumerism.  It's the fact that you want to buy some obscure, bizarrely named thing and you can't find it in the big giant ass store.  Is that right, Brian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what is interesting, though, is the idea that if it's if it wasn't you know, you can kind of do a version of this with Costco in the United States where they have a partnership with a solar cell supplier and you spend twelve grand and you get a box full of solar panels and inverters.  And you can put that on the top of your house or better yet, have an electrician with a clue put it on top of your house.  You know, it's just it's just I think the only reason this is news because it's Ikea.  So it means it's probably what is its name?  I mean, did they talk about its goofy Swedish name?  A juice juice.

End time: 6210.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think that's the idea.  The idea is if it's made it into Ikea, then yes, it is it is consumer consumer consumable.  But I think that's a good thing.  I'm with Patrick here.  You know, if you bring it into the realm of the consumer, of the person who's just making that buy because they think it's going to make their house better, it means it's no longer up in the stratosphere where only those who are either really rich or just really want to show off the solar system on top of their house can buy into this.  Now, someone who says, wait a minute.  OK, let me do the math here.  Ten years, three years, whatever it's going to be.  After that, I get free power.  I like that idea.  I mean, how can you not like that?

Start time: 6211.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, mainly because we oftentimes and keep in mind, this is a long running thing.  We're looking at 15 years now that we've had subsidies propping up the solar industry.  And keep in mind, I would love it.  Nothing would make me happier than for solar to say, screw you.  We don't need the subsidies anymore.  We are, you know, for every dollar you spend on a solar panel, you get two dollars worth of energy out of it.  That's where we want to be.  We all agree on that.  But but it's it's difficult and it's very easy to come up with excuses why with why solar isn't here.  And the real reason is is because it's hard.  It's hard to come up with something that's energy efficient, that's clean to create for the environment that people can buy affordably.  And if we could, somebody would just make it overnight and then we would all buy it.  And of course, there's a messy process as we get here.  And when I read a story like this that says, how come Europe can have magic solar panels that make everything rainbows and we can't?  It's very easy to say, you know, because big oil and something about Dick Cheney.  I hate that argument.  It's a false dichotomy.  But it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, OK, right, right.  Wait a second.  Did anyone say because big oil and Dick Cheney?  I think the story is just, hey, there are solar solar panels at IKEA.  That's kind of no, that's just it, Patrick.

Transcript:  Or the Nokia thing was already hitting us pretty hard in my couple.  So I really think I shouldn't say anything bad about IKEA.  So save a marriage, change the subject.  I mean, honestly, I think IKEA, what the fact that it's arriving at IKEA, it's obviously a test.  You know, I don't think it has anything to do with big oil or, you know, with Dick Cheney's evil plans to ruin the planet.  It's just that they're testing it in that market first, as many companies often do.  And if it's super successful, I'm fairly sure they're going to, you know, bring it over to other places.  You know why? Because they like money.  And if they sell, they're going to sell it to other people.  So it's I don't think there's anything nefarious there.  And I didn't read the article, but if they're saying there's something nefarious, they're probably misguided.  And I don't think either that these panels are, you know, magically becoming better because they're at IKEA.  It's just that they're a little bit more readily accessible.  And that's probably a good thing for those who want to use them.

Transcript:  OK. Well, while Brian is taking care of his solar problem, I want to take some time to talk about GoToMeeting because they are a supporter of This Week in Tech.  Now, if you've watched any of my shows, you know that I love GoToMeeting because we all understand that we need to meet.  We need to talk to our colleagues, to our coworkers, to our customers.  We need to have that face to face eye to eye contact in order to get things done.  But when you work in different offices in different cities in different countries, sometimes it's just difficult to get that face to face time, which is why we love GoToMeeting with HD faces.  It's the incredibly easy way to meet online and see each other in HD.  Now, you see, with GoToMeeting, you can share screens.  It makes it easier for your team to be on the same page.  And if you turn on your webcam, it makes it that simple for your meeting to become an HD video conference.  Imagine the kind of data that you get when you can actually see the person that you're talking to.  It's not just a voice coming over a speaker.  It's not a disembodied stream of words coming at you.  You can see that small frown or that raised eyebrow or that slightly quizzical look on someone's face that tells them you don't understand or I don't understand you and therefore you need to continue.  That's what you get with GoToMeeting.  You get that extra dimension of communication.  One of the things I love about GoToMeeting is that it works from anywhere.  I've used it on my laptop. I've used it on my desktop. I've used it on my phone.  They make it easy for me to meet and share from anywhere, even from my iPad.  You can present from your iPad how much coolness is that to be that mobile and that connected at the same time.  I love GoToMeeting and you know I mean it because I'm not just an endorser of the product.  I use it on a daily basis.  I use this product to talk with the dozens of people that I need to talk to in my real job around the country, around the world.  I use GoToMeeting and I love it and I know that you will too.  So here's what I want you to do. I want you to try GoToMeeting.  I want to see if you're going to find it to be as valuable as I do.  So to try GoToMeeting free for 30 days, visit GoToMeeting.com, click the Try It Free button and use the promo code TWIT.  That's GoToMeeting.com, promo code TWIT.  GoToMeeting, meeting is believing and we thank Citrix for their support of this week in tech.  Guys, I want to bring it home with one more story here.  Praise yourselves.  And Brian's totally going to love this.  I mean I know he's right on board with the fact that the FAA panel has suggested that they sort of relax the standards on turning off devices on airplanes.  Because I know Brian was a big proponent of having those devices off in the first place because he believes it's the government's place to make sure that we're all safe.  So that cell phone, which could potentially down your 747 on its approach, well it was right that it was off.  Brian, you're lamenting this decision, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not quite.  The FAA received the report and recommendations today on the expanded use of personal electronic devices.  FAA spokesman Les Dorr told Mashable in a mail on Monday the administrator will review the report and determine next steps.

Start time: 6691.20
End time: 6707.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So essentially they've said, you know what, maybe we were a bit too strict.  We should look at the policies again.  So there's no recommendation saying, hey, you know what, if they want to start up a fax machine in the middle of takeoff, go ahead.  But at least this is a step in the right direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the thing though.  Okay, go ahead.  Oh, the report does not recommend changing rules restricting activities that require a network connection such as voice calls or data transfer.  Those will likely remain off limits as rules for cell phone use on planes have been governed by the FCC since 1991.  The advisory committee did suggest the FAA should work with the FCC to regress or, excuse me, reassess those restrictions as well.  The Wall Street Journal reported.

Start time: 6749.98
End time: 6788.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I like to read this story in concert with I believe it was three or four months ago.  There was a researcher who showed that he could overpower the navigation computer inside of a computer.  If inside of a plane, if he had a transmitter in first class that was aimed towards that computer with enough power, he could actually send it false signals and take the plane off course.  Now, I think we would all notice if someone had a big old satellite dish looking thing pointed towards the cockpit.  But you know what the FAA is essentially saying is, look, unless it's unless unless you're that guy.  Yeah, the device you bring on the planet's got no ability to cause any sort of crash or incident or accident.

Start time: 6789.24
End time: 6798.54

And yes, I want to be using my iPad for the 10 minutes and take off and landing that I can't use it.  But I mean, come on, the proportion of coverage that this issue using air quotes has been getting on tech shows is ridiculous.  Yes, mention it here and there.

And let me tell you for the record, I do not approve of people leaving their iPads on inside their backpacks underneath the seat in front of them on 3G networks.  I do not approve of people who leave their iPhones on in their pockets and then only put on one earbud as they pretend to be asleep so they could continue listening to their audio book during takeoff and landing.  That's not OK, because it's against the law.  And we should no longer have to stand for that illegal behavior.

Transcript:  Let me let me find another story really quickly.  Awkward.  All right.  Here's here's one story.  It's actually semi-serious.  Let's take it back.  Take it down a notch.  We've had our fun with exploding cars and death rays on planes.  You know, Twitter's going IPO, right?  And so as Twitter goes IPO, there are some obvious comparisons between it and Facebook.  One of the interesting things that just came out this last week is the CEO of Twitter saying, and I quote, We are we are the anti Facebook.  And he points out several several reasons why Twitter is not going to be like the Facebook IPO because they're already focused on mobile, because they have a strategy for making money, because they're not going to do that weird thing that Facebook did with their PR agency.  You know, they have a clear idea of where they want the company to be with this IPO money versus what they say was Facebook's problem of just feeling that they needed to go IPO without actually knowing what they were going to do with that cash.  I bring this up at the end of the show because I don't like all the speculation.  We know Facebook.  I mean, we know that Twitter is going to go IPO.  We know that they're going to make a ton of cash.  I just want to open up to the panel and say if they open at their target price, which I actually can't call up right now.  Let's call it 20 bucks.  They open at 20 bucks.  Is this a stock that you would actually invest your hard earned cash in?  Do you see enough of a business model there?  Regardless of how important you think Twitter is, do you see it making money enough to justify an investment?

Start time: 7037.51
End time: 7142.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that answering that question?  Isn't that the reason why we could get in trouble?  I mean, I'm not a journalist, so I could answer it.  But I don't know.  I mean, look at the lower thirds on this show.  We have the website name for most of us.  We have the website name and the Twitter handle.  And that's something that ultimately everyone keeps coming back to Twitter all the time.  I say everyone, the people who are interested in these sorts of things.  And Twitter has, what is it, 200, 250 million users.  A chunk of those might be fake users that's, you know, to be expected.  But I have a hard time imagining that a mode of communication that has that many users that is so ubiquitous now in every aspect of the media on TV and everywhere you see hashtags.  I have a hard time thinking that this thing is not going to end up making money at some point.  It's already making money, but it's not going to end up going up.  And it is already seeing nice trends in every metric.  It's not Facebook.  And some people are failing it, you know, are saying that this is a bad thing because it doesn't have the Facebook numbers.  Facebook numbers are unbelievable.  You know, one point two, six million users.  That is not something that you compare your service to because that doesn't it's unreal.  250 million users is not something to scoff at.

Start time: 7142.74
End time: 7189.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, but you can compare the fact that when Twitter had its IPO, it was profitable.  And more importantly, it had figured out how to crack, how to sell to its audience.  Twitter, I'm sorry, Facebook.  Facebook has figured out how to sell and make money.  Twitter has never done that.  Twitter has and it has a big problem.  For example, that that article that you put it in the doc pod.  But the Twitter's fire hose problem, the fact that the more people join Twitter and the more people you follow, the less valuable Twitter becomes and the harder it is to sell targeted ads.  It is a real problem.  And the fact that last quarter they lost what was it like?  I forget what the number is, but they lost money.  These are big problems going into an IPO.
