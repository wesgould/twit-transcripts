End time: 1217.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 1219.60
End time: 1230.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

End time: 1298.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't go on Google News unless you upgrade to the 199  $199 package right and then it just automatically goes on Google News  But the thing is with these their PR web is one of them that the other one you mentioned  There's there's like half a dozen of these things and if you just scan through their daily press releases each of these companies  Sends out somewhere between 10 and 150 press releases a day  And you know half of them are just garbage like somebody will you know do a vanity?  Book or something like that and just write their own press release put it on there pay  $149 and out it goes and it's just  The fact that it's showing up anywhere other than the news is that it's just it's just it's just it's just it's just  The other thing that's more than on these sites is just an example of the shoddiness of journalism and the sort of abandonment of any sort of editorial filter on anything well but it's a problem because I get a lot of email from

Transcript:  We have a variety of tools for tracking different outlets and PR web we follow I believe is through our SS actually so we were seeing the PR through that we were doing the investigation we saw pop up on a few other sites and we made the erroneous assumption  That those other sites had done the verification. I don't know what happens when one makes an assumption of course we will never make such an assumption in fact there was another acquisition that came out on pure web later that week that we of course ignored until we were able to verify it ourselves this time  Yeah, that's exactly what happened when I'm here web a few people went ahead and pulled the trigger without making the right phone calls and then that ultimately led to the steamroll of everybody else doing the same thing. Sadly ourselves included. Yeah, and a lot.

Start time: 1370.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, if only I knew where to go ahead and press that press release. Yeah, put it on the house. It's 199 bucks, that's all.

Transcript:  So for 199 bucks. But that's cheap if you hired a publicist. Oh yeah, no. How much is a publicist a month? You must have had that. I had publicist from time to time. I've never had a publicist.

Transcript:  You don't need a publicist. You're a self promoting maniac. A lot of companies will pay between. I think it's like 1500 bucks a month, something like that. No, it's a lot more than that. More than that. Yeah, you can, generally about five grand a month for starters.  And do they make any guarantees? They say we're going to get you on regis. If they start doing that then you got a phony usually. Right. They can't promise anything. No. There are actually, there's one guy in Marin County I still think he's up there who used to do it on a fee base.  So you hire him and then he had his little fee list. So if he got you in the Wall Street Journal then you owed him 10 grand. That's worth it. If you get on live with Kelly, that's four million people will see your product. That's huge. Yeah.  What product were you selling there? I never sell products. See, this is a mistake. You should have the mugs for sale. You know, they told me when I started doing that in 2001, Tech TV set that up, right?

Start time: 1444.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And I've been doing it since then. So I would go on and show gadgets and I was going to wear, Tech TV actually had made for me a bunch of sleeveless sweater vests with the Tech TV logo on it. Like I would wear that crap.  But I did. I brought it out there and I asked, and Gelman said, you can't wear that. What do you mean I can't? I'm the Tech TV, he's, no, no, sorry. No, they're really freaky about it. They won't let you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't want you to do that. Anyway, so this PRWeb thing, PRWeb in theory vets these, right? I mean, because otherwise this really would be a cesspool because anybody who wants to pump and dump a sock could just put it out of press room.

Start time: 1501.70
End time: 1513.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think this is a new idea for pump and dump. It is a cesspool. And it is already, he's right, it's already a cesspool. And this was some clever guy, new idea for pump and dump and it was genius.

Start time: 1513.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And it worked. It won't work again probably, but it worked once. No, it won't work again. PRWeb issued a press release in which they said, we have since learned that that was a fraudulent press release from ICOA. The release was not issued or authorized by ICOA.  ICOA, VOCUS, which is the parent company of PRWeb, reviews all press releases and follows an internal process designed to maintain the integrity of the releases we send out each day. Apparently internal process that doesn't in fact involve calling the company, issuing the press release.  Even with reasonable safeguards, identity theft occurs. Oh, maybe, okay, so maybe it came from an address, you know, at ICOA.com or something like that. Maybe that was what they...  There's some phishing. That's easy to do. You can do that. I can do that. I can send out an address from any email from any address I want. We have removed the fraudulent release, turned the matter over to the proper authorities. The police.  Another investigation. Danny Sullivan has a great analysis on search engine land, in which he effectively implies that PRWeb not only doesn't have a check, but in fact does this all the time.  For instance, he points out a press release that comes out monthly from yourbestpillsonline.com. It's a press release titled How to Buy Drugs, Lowest Price Viagra, by Levitra Viagra, online pill store.  And it has a completely bogus text. And the reason they do this is because this is the PRWeb. Oh, the places you'll go. Want to see where your news is going? Look no further. Major search engines, Associated Press.  And what happens is if you now do a Google search on this particular press release, you'll see, for instance, the Houston Chronicle is republishing press releases. Now they have a special page. It's the Houston Chronicle PRWeb page. But this now gets published.  Yeah, this is ridiculous. This is going on too much. On a newspaper website. It also shows up in Google News. It's just a great advertising inventory.

Start time: 1635.40
End time: 1659.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and of course that's quite a few legitimate companies use PRWeb as well. NPD, for example, sends out their releases through PRWeb. And of course, you know, that's a well-known company and those are legitimate. So, you know, that just means the onus is, of course, on us now as it should be to be verifying these things to make sure that they're correct.  But hopefully, you know, we'll be seeing some companies maybe shifting away from PRWeb and maybe we'll see the other options that we mentioned before being a little bit more stringent and PRWeb as well.

Start time: 1659.76
End time: 1716.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And it also led me to do a little digging. And in fact, you can turn off press releases in Google News, which you might want to do. Nice. If you're in news.google.com, which I use, I like Google News. Yeah, there's a settings button by the sources. And look at this. There's apparently a setting personalized Google News reflect your taste in publishers. Do you want press releases? And it's it's normally normal. You could turn that off. You can also and it's too bad more. You can put more.  Can I get only press releases? Yes. Yeah, you could. You could turn off turn off blogs and turn on press releases. And that's going to be a great feed for you. You're going to find lots of stocks you might want to invest in. What's what's sad is that they include blogs as well as press releases in that setting. You can't you can't add sources, but you cannot I don't think you can remove sources. So you couldn't manually say no more PRWeb. But at least you could say no more press releases. And I immediately did that to Michael Lewis.

Start time: 1717.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't want to get any more of those. There's a there's a there's a virtue in there somewhere with Google. They're trying not to be to exert editorial control over what's legitimate and what isn't. And they're giving you the tools if you're savvy enough to go in there and make that decision.  But it's really there's no good answer to this kind of thing. When you talk about blogs like I actually wanted to get a blog my blog to post on Google News years ago. And their criteria for what's news and what's not a newsworthy blog is how many people are involved. So apparently, if you have one person doing the  It's not legit. If you have two, then they'll post it on Google News. At least that was the case a few years ago. I don't know what it is now. But and I thought that's kind of a weird criteria. But what else are you going to use if you're Google and you want to you want to sort of have a hands on hands off approach on what's news and what isn't?

Transcript:  Well, we're on the topic. I usually don't talk about no agenda stuff on this show. But we I did discuss this because it was a news item that I thought was interesting. If you go to Google and type in give frozen peas, PAS a chance, you get two articles. One was because my wife called me and she's moaning about this. Dr. Oz wrote an op ed for time calm. And the op ed is word for word the same as this as the top hit, which is this give frozen peas a chance.  And it's a question that Johnson cares to with the same art from this Dr. Newell. Oh, yeah, you can see who's stealing from whom I don't think that was stealing. I think these are both planted articles from some PR company that were given exclusives. And one guy said I thought I had the exclusive right. You know about this mic.  These companies will say I got it. We wrote a piece for you. You can run it. You can use your own byline if you want to. And they don't even change a word of it. And you just run it under your own byline and it goes out there and everybody thinks that you wrote this thing. But in this case, two guys did it the same time.

Start time: 1832.48
End time: 1836.64

Start time: 1836.98
End time: 1879.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's frozen foods, frozen because this is about frozen foods. I think it's about the frozen fruit food and they make it sound like some some article that you know sounds like somebody's did write it. But both of these doctors live in a vegetarian household with that.  I mean, it's unbelievable that the Time magazine talking about you guys possible that the other article stole Dr. Oz's. They both came around was simultaneously. And I don't think so. That's interesting because I've seen this sort of thing happen. It's always by accident.  But it's because of the exclusive thing. This is I got this. I used when I was editor in for world we always solicit stuff. I used to have a bunch of PR people say what can we do? And I said, well, you can write an article. I didn't never put anybody else's name.  You know, it's changed. Everything is demand media.

Start time: 1882.98
End time: 1946.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Demand media is the big ones. In fact, yeah, that's fascinating because basically somebody said, hey, you know, instead of us writing, like as we do on Twitter, we say editorially, oh, these are the stories. Let's talk about them. What if we just looked at what the search terms were and wrote stories that matched the most popular search terms?  And then we'll get high search rankings and we can put an ad on there and it's going to be a valuable product. So if it turns out people are searching for Harley Davidson belt buckles, which apparently they are, they're going to find a demand media article about Harley Davidson belt buckles.  It'll have some nice. They pay writers next to nothing. They pay the writer five bucks because the writer didn't have to put much work into it. Yeah, no, there's a lot. I think that's changed this a lot. The entire media is just rank with corruption is terrible.  But Tim, I know. I mean, look, and a gadget is a serious journalistic enterprise. I like in gadget. I love it. And there's no question about that. That's got to be a constant challenge. Yeah, it absolutely is. Especially with with properties like, you know, everybody basically trying to be first and you're trying to basically get the recognition.

Start time: 1946.70
End time: 2011.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. That way on Twitter and there's such a huge amount of traffic to be gained by being first. So, you know, especially when these stories break early, this one broke, I think, before eight a.m. And of course, Google PR wasn't even awake at that time. So, you know, so you don't have time. You cannot wait and say, let's sit on this. Let's call ICOA. Let's call Google. There's a real urgency to getting this out. But there's the there's the blood. There's the risk nowadays. There's the risk. Yeah, that's tough. I think especially in your field in the gadget.  Field. It really is cutthroat. It is definitely very cutthroat. And, you know, these things happen very quickly. But ultimately, you know, there were a few warning signs which all things digital did a very good job of pointing out within this press release.  There were no quotes from Google, for example, talking about the acquisition. There was, I think, a spelling mistake in there as well. So there are a few little things that are red flags. So ultimately, you know, even without the confirmation, there were a few things that that might have jumped out to us if we hadn't been in such a rush show.  But again, there were a few other instances later that week of other press releases from Pira Web, and we make sure to verify those and we will continue to do so.

Transcript:  Pump and dump is where you take a position in some worthless stock and then you dream up a bunch of bull crap and you and you pump it into the market to get the stock pumped up.  So you drop all this phony information as fast as you can on blogs and all these things. Oh, it's a rumor that they're going to do this. They're going to do that. And to get to get it. Usually, it's a penny stock.  That way and get the thing to skyrocket to go to a few bucks and you you slowly unload it in the price. You can't unload it all at once. You slowly unload as it goes up.  And then you so you dump, you pump and then you dump and then you're out and then everybody else finds out the stock goes back down to one penny.  And you're you made a bunch of money. You can make 10 X in one of these schemes. It's kind of amazing. And it still happens. Much of it is done by the mob.  What? Well, you know, actually, they do it with phone solicitations. They'll pump and dump on that with the call.

Everybody fell for it because, you know, you you you that's the kind of thing you want to happen. You expect to happen. And so you believe it when it happens.  The India's thirty five dollar tablet. Remember that. Yeah. Everybody was talking about the okay never happened. And everybody believes it happened because in this case, it was actually the  A government minister in India who is propagating this hoax because he's trying to you know, it's all politics. He's trying to get everybody to think that India is on the forefront. Turns out they ended up coming out with a device. It wasn't made in India. It didn't cost thirty five dollars. It was piece of junk. Nobody could use it. They didn't distribute to millions of students like they said they were going to. But there's still even today has been going on for a year and a half. They're still trying to get credit for it. And the media is still lapping it up. You can still find all these thirty five dollar tablet.  Stories are pretty legit things. And so this is you know, there's just one organization and one individual after another duping the media and the blogosphere. Everybody is too busy to really track things down.

If you want to take a break, smoke them if you got them.  The smoking lamp is lit, John.  John likes to go out and have a stogium during these commercials.  Stamps.com is a way to turn yourself into a mailing pro.  I have to say, this is not for somebody who's just doing your Christmas card list.  This is for somebody who does a lot of mailing.  It's part of your business, whether you're sending out invoices,  and you use QuickBooks, if you're an eBay seller, an Amazon seller, a PayPal seller.  You don't want to have to go to the post office, buy stamps, and put them on an envelope.  No, that's for the amateurs.  Especially this time of year, you don't want to get in line there.  Crazy at the post office.  Stamps.com is a solution that lets you print your own U.S. postage.  Legally, from your own computer, your own printer, you don't need a postage meter.  Look at that new scale, Chad. We've got to get the new scale.  I know. We have to get another account so we can get that new scale.  I already got two scales. I want a third.  I want the brushed aluminum scale that matches my iPad.  That is pretty. Looks thin.  That is amazing.  It is. It's kind of the scale air.  And you just get that?  Stamps free.  So here's the deal. Go to stamps.com.  If you do mailing, this does all the things you want.  You send an email to the recipient saying,  we just shipped the mail carrier.  It comes and gets. You can schedule free pickups.  So you don't have to worry about even mailing this stuff.  They come and get it.  It'll print a postage on an envelope.  It'll print packages.  It pulls out all the forms automatically.  It takes the data from the Amazon or eBay or PayPal or Etsy site or whatever.  Or from your QuickBooks.  I mean this really streamlines your mailing.  It is the way to get more done faster.  More affordably because there's discounts you can't get at the post office.  Now if you go to stamps.com, you'll see that $80 offer.  But I don't want you to do that because if you click the upper right hand corner,  you'll find out why.  Two billion letters and packages have been sent with stamps.com.  Put twit in the offer code.  And now that $80 value comes out.  Now by the way, I think you get the new scale.  I don't think you get the old scale.  We just have to update that picture.  I would hope so.  I think so.  I think you get the new scale.  The same old host, but you get the new scale.  The host hasn't changed.  The host is still going to look old.  $55 in postage coupons.  You get the digital scale.  That's a $50 value. By the way, yours to keep.  If you cancel at any time, you get to keep the scale.  $5 supply kit and 4 week trial of stamps.com.  All you have to do is click the radio microphone.  And enter in our offer code.  Never go to the post office again.  This is what the pros do.  Stamps.com.  Thank them for their support.

Transcript:  They definitely do look and feel like netbooks for sure.  But they're thinner.  The battery life is quite good on that Samsung at least.  Google is making a new push right now.  We were a little bit curious on what exactly Google is going to do.  We were a little bit curious on what exactly Google is going to do.  We were a little bit curious on what exactly Google is going to do with Chrome OS.  Because for a while there, they were quite quiet on that front.  But then we get the new Samsung a few months ago.  And then the new just dropped from Acer.  The Acer is kind of cheesy.

Almost crossing into the regular laptop territory.  But there's also rumors of a touch screen Chrome OS laptop coming sometime in the new year.  But there's also rumors of a touch screen Chrome OS laptop coming sometime in the new year.  Perhaps in the next few months.  Perhaps directly made by Google itself.  With no partner at all.  Which would be very interesting.  So we'll see what exactly Google is up to.  It's a little bit confusing still with Android and Google TV.  And Chrome OS as well.  We're trying to figure out exactly where Google is going with all these things.  We're trying to figure out exactly where Google is going with all these things.  But Google did make a big push into small businesses.  And to the education market as well.  With leasing programs for these.  Which we thought was a great idea.  And so I'm hoping that Google finds some success on that front.  Because I think that could be a really big win for them.  And I think that we can get these into schools.  Low cost laptops that are very effortlessly connected to the internet.  That could be a great thing.

Transcript:  You know, somebody asked me about this.  Oh, this Google Chromebook is really cheap.  Should I get one?  And I said, well, you know, it's not really, it doesn't do anything.  It's a netbook.  It's a browser.  And you have to be on the internet.  So you have to be on the internet all the time to use it?  I mean, is it useless?  I said, yes, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can answer that question.  The Chromebook is the computer for the rest of them.  It's the computer you give to somebody else.  According to the ad, it's for dogs and babies.  Dogs, babies, grandma, students, employees.  Anybody you want to lock into a cage.  Employees.  Excellent.  You don't want to do tech support.  You don't want to worry about anything.  You don't want to let them install anything.  Nothing.  You give them a Chromebook and everybody's happy.  You don't want to do web and do email and do all that kind of stuff.  And you don't have to worry about anything.  They advertise it by showing that you can destroy it.  And if you destroy it, you just get another one.  Open it up, log in, and all your stuff is still there.  That's really the benefit.  But nobody, besides Jeff Jarvis, I don't know of anybody who's actually chosen one for himself.

Transcript:  Go ahead, Tim.  We use Google Docs or Google Drive now, excuse me, for quite a few tools internally.  And you know, our CMS is of course all online.  And we use an online wiki for sharing information.  And of course, almost all of us at Engadget use Gmail for our email tools.  So because of that, I think it's very possible to actually do, you know, and be very productive with these machines.  You can work with them offline.  You can edit docs offline and do some things offline with them, which does make them usable for long flights that don't have Google Internet, for example.  But ultimately, they are very restrictive.  But really, you can do so much online these days that it'd be a very good machine for somebody who's, like Mike was just saying,  somebody who, you know, you don't want to worry about them getting a virus or downloading some toolbar for Firefox or something like that  that's going to screw up their entire machine.  It's a very easy machine to use and very hard to destroy.

Start time: 2875.34
End time: 2922.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's the big difference between the two that just came out.  The Samsung one is running on ARM, which is the first actually.  And so it's got pretty good battery life.  It's very thin, very efficient.  The other one, the $200 one from Acer is actually running on a, I believe, a Celeron processor.  It's an x86 chip.  And it's got half that of the Samsung, which is, you know, very, very disappointing.  And also it doesn't have the 3G wireless connection built in that most of the Chromebooks do, which is, you know, a big advantage.  You can get usually it's 100 megs of data per month with those devices or some small amount of data anyway, just enough to check your email and to download some docs and to do some simple web surfing.  But you can do it from anywhere, which is a great advantage from these machines.  They sort of doesn't have that.  So it's just a netbook that happens to be running Chrome OS, whereas the Samsung feels like a nice Chrome OS Chromebook laptop.

Transcript:  Even in the Engadget review, Miriam, is it Jwar?  How do you pronounce Miriam's last name?  Miriam Jwar, yes.  Jwar says this will always be a polarizing class of product.  And I think that's accurate.  The geeks like us are going, wah!  But I think maybe you're right.  Maybe some people, that's all they need.  It's always backed up because you're always in the cloud.  Do you?  They're prisoners.  Slaves.  Employees.  What's interesting is, so you use Google Docs, we use Google Docs here.  The one thing that concerns me a little bit about all of this is I've just recently learned about the Electronic Communications Protection Act, which Senator Leahy is trying to amend to be a little bit more up to date.  It was passed in the 80s, 1986, and one of the things it says is it assumes that anything that's stored in the cloud that hasn't been accessed in six months is public.

Transcript:  Did you talk about this before?  Yeah, no, it's abandoned.

Start time: 2989.26
End time: 3001.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's abandoned, which means you don't need a search warrant to get it.  All the government or law enforcement has to do is get an administrative subpoena.  They don't even have to prove illegality.  They just have to say, yeah, this would be useful in an investigation.

Transcript:  Six months was just a crack up because that's not nothing.  If you look at your own email six months ago, there's still email I haven't answered.  It's still active.  Right.

Start time: 3015.72
End time: 3073.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Mostly email I haven't answered.  Leahy is trying to amend this, and we'll see what happens.  They just came out with an amendment that passed the Senate Judiciary Committee.  We did talk about this last week, but we got it reversed because some of the amendments were worse.  What Leahy's amendments are going to do is to amend that 180-day rule to say, yes, you still need a warrant.  However, law enforcement, and we have talked about this before, I just think it's worth saying again,  can still get things like your name, address, credit card, bank information, the date and times of email,  the recipients of the email, the devices you used when conducting electronic communications,  all that without any warrant.  It can all be done just with a pen register.  So do you worry, Tim, is there, corporately, do they worry at all about the idea that everything that's in those Google Docs  is basically available to the feds any time after six months?

Start time: 3074.68
End time: 3112.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You cannot actually get internet provided instances of Google Docs, basically hosted instances of Google Docs.  Not actually hosted, but kind of walled off from the internet as a whole, which actually AOL has done.  Interestingly, we don't actually use those. We're using the public Google Docs internally,  adding gadgets so that we don't have to worry about the internet and VPN and all that fun stuff.  So there are ways for corporations to protect themselves from that sort of thing.  And I presume that content that was protected like that would not be included in that, but perhaps not.  But I personally don't tend to worry about that sort of thing.  But then again, I try to do good on the internet, so maybe that means I shouldn't have to worry.

Transcript:  Are you doing that?  Look at the mega uploads case.  That's the example. That's a perfect example.  Exactly. Because all of these innocent, there were thousands, millions of innocent people, just users.  And they decided that the physical servers were evidence.  And so they took them and oh, gosh, there's data on the servers.  We get to do anything we want with that data.  You could even imagine a case in which you're using a legitimate service.  Hackers steal all of the personal data.  The feds go in and grab the servers from the hackers.  And now the stuff that has been stolen by the hackers is now in the hands of who knows who in the government doing who knows what.  And it's really the larger, the biggest picture about this whole thing is something I've talked about on this show before, which is every time there's an advancement in technology,  if you assume that the cloud is an advancement, there's this balance between the public's rights and the government's desires.  Exactly. And they take advantage of all new technologies to seize more power as it relates to the public.  Every cell phone thing, now the cloud, they're trying to get around the Constitution.  They're trying to say, hey, here's an opportunity for us just to have no rules about who's going to be the next president.  We don't have rules about searches, basically. This is a constitutional issue.  And it's like, you know, it's yet another case and people are not sufficiently up in arms about it.  It's the principle of the thing. We can't let governments seize additional power over the population every time there's an advancement in technology because there's going to be a million more.  Hear, hear.  Hear, hear.

Transcript:  Of course, you can't bring that through. What are you, crazy?  This was at the beginning. Who knew?  Who knew?  There's also software tools, not just hardware tools.  This is the multi-tool for the IT pro online.  It's called GoToAssist.  If you use this, number one in remote support.  But let me tell you, Citrix is making this better and better all the time.  It is the number one remote support tool for IT.  Ten years in business, but they've added new features.  Two new features that I think are fantastic.  So there's GoToAssist Remote Access.  They've just added GoToAssist Service Desk.  And they've added a new feature.  So there's a new feature.  So there's a new feature.  So there's a new feature.  That's an improved service desk.  Which is a tracking system.  You need this, right?  To track and resolve issues.  So it's cloud-based, service management tools.  Easy to deploy. Easy to use.  Tickets and incident management. Problem management.  Changes.  Releases all of that stuff.  Available.  And now, they also have remote monitoring.  They've really beefed this up.  If you haven't looked at GoToAssist lately,  you've got to give it a try.  Monitoring is awesome.  You put the crawler on your client's network.  This is great if you want to be a managed service provider.  You want to grow as an IT professional.  Or, if you get the boss to pay for this,  this is going to save your life if you're in a company  doing hardware or software support.  You run the crawler on the network.  It finds every bit of hardware, all the computers,  but also the network-attached devices.  And, I really like this, all the software.  You get an assay of everything on your network.  You'll have this whole database of this stuff.  And then, they've got a dashboard.  And you can set up trackers.  They have some standardized dashboards,  but you can also custom trackers.  All kinds of stats.  Everything from how is the Wi-Fi performance  to what is the average disk utilization.  What is the toner cartridge doing?  And the reason you do this is because  you can have proactive alerts.  Text messages, email messages,  instant messages that let you know  if there's a problem.  As you set up the alerts, you can set up the alerts  and let you know if there's a problem.  As you set up the alert yourself, if you want,  using customized thresholds,  or you can have the preset thresholds.  And if disk space falls below 5% on a computer,  you will get an alert.  And you can be proactive.  You can fix that problem before it becomes a big problem.  This really is the way to do support.  So, they've got the ticket management.  They've got the remote support.  And they've got the monitoring now.  And you could try all of it free for 30 days.  If you visit gotoassist.com  We actually use it here.  I have it on all the servers.  So, I don't have to come in if I want to fix something.  I use the remote support a lot.  But I know that Russell Tammany, our IT guy,  is very interested in the monitoring module.  Visit gotoassist.com.  Click the try it free button.  And the promo code for this is twit.  You have to click that extra link to make that in there.  Please put that in there so we get credit.  And you can try this for 30 days.  You get to try all three, the remote support,  the service desk, and the monitoring.  Free for 30 days.  Please give it a try.  I think you're going to like this.  Go to assist.com from those great folks at Citrix.  Oh, look.  Here's all the jewelry.  I just found the inventory.  Let's see if there's something you like.  I like this.

So this poor woman,  she's clearly worried about what  Google might be doing  with their Google shopping.  Microsoft says  Google shopping, which used to be just a search engine.  I like the look on her face.  Wait a minute. There's another guy. He's even more worried.  Let's scroll down.  He just looks mad.  He just, and I don't know what the  four fingers are, but I think in Italian that means  to the devil with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I did some back to back comparisons  after this. Did you say something wrong?  And so I searched for things on  Bing shopping and on Google shopping as well.  And by and large,  the results were far better on  Google than on Bing.  I searched for a 64 gig micro SD  card, for example.  The top results on Google  was a Kensington option, which  was reasonably priced. I think it was from  Amazon. The other one at Bing was  the price was low. And so I clicked  through and it was a $50 shipping charge  from this one vendor I'd never heard  of that was selling it through Bing  for a $40 micro SD card. The $50  shipping charge and they were out of stock.  So it really shouldn't have even shown up anyway.  But ultimately, my experiences  have been that Google shopping, even if they are  a little bit skewed, are still  better results than Bing's, unfortunately.

And  so Microsoft's Bing actually  has exactly this sort of thing, paid  placements for the holidays.  And so that was a project that no doubt  was happening over here and then the Scroogled  project was happening over there. And they  didn't talk to each other. So now Microsoft  is slamming Google for something that Microsoft  is doing. It's hilarious.  It's hilarious.  Never a dull moment.  Microsoft

Unfortunately, they haven't actually  clarified what exactly this 40 million number  means, but it is significantly higher than they  said is comparable to Windows 7, which was 60  million over two months versus 40  million in one month. But I was trying to remember,  do you guys remember what the upgrade prices were for  Windows 7 at launch? Well, that's the difference.  Yeah, it was like $130.

They're running an older  version. And  they can actually compare that to Windows  7, which was 83 percent.

Microsoft did announce that  they're going to sell their Surface Pro.  So this is the one we were talking about was the RT.  It's the ARM-based.  It's a tablet. Yeah, I like it.

But,  battery life will be  one-half the RT.  So we're talking, what, four hours?  Four to four and a half, yep.  Is that enough  to make that a compelling product?  What's interesting is, I would have said no  initially because I thought,  well, all of these other companies are going to be  putting out their Windows 8 Pro  computers. There's some beautiful ones.  I just saw one from Acer. But, boy, if you  go to Best Buy or even a  Microsoft store, there's a dearth  of Windows 8 Pro computers.  They just came out.

Start time: 4231.79
End time: 4344.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The weight is all in the  very back.  And if that slips off the edge, down it goes.  The bigger story  here, I think, is that, I mean, let's  just call a spade a spade here.  Windows 8, the Surface  Pro, and Windows RT are flops.  They're disappointing  fail. Yeah, they are. I've heard  that RT, they  cut in half the number they expected  to sell. It's a flop,  but it's actually  not a terrible thing. Microsoft's trying to do something  very tricky and difficult here. They know we're  heading for a post PC world.  They know we're heading for a world where everything  is touch. And  they're the legacy company. They can't be like Apple  and just cut everybody off at the knees and just go  onto the next thing and sorry if you've invested a lot  of money in this other stuff, we'll go into the new thing.  Microsoft is the company that  tries not to do that. So they're trying to backward  compatible support everything, all that kind  of stuff. So how do they get all these  reluctant global people to move  into the post PC world  or more to the point, how do they avoid getting  left behind and represent the  past, the GUI interface, while  Microsoft owns the future, which is the  touch interface. So they're  playing a funky game. And in hindsight,  it appears that the better strategy  would have been to have a Windows  8 that doesn't have the Metro UI  and then have devices that do have  the Metro UI and let consumers pick  and just not force it down  people's throats. I think the biggest problem is  this touch interface when people use it  on a device that is not being used for touch.  If you're using a mouse and a keyboard  with something with an interface designed  for touch, you're going to be disappointed,  confused, annoyed, etc.  And that's exactly what I think is happening with a lot  of people. So you know, I think  the longer game, I think  three, four years from now, five years  from now, this is all going to be cool stuff.  Microsoft, which I think is actually  really good at making hardware. I think they're better  at making hardware than they are at making  software, ironically. That's ironic,

Start time: 4344.92

Transcript:  Exactly. And if you think about  prototypes.  Right. But they've been making  Xbox, which is a PC, really.  I mean, they've been making  peripheral device for a long time. But they, you know,  if you look at  the Windows RT,  this device was not perfect at all.  But wow, for a 1.0 release,  a hardware product  by a software company, that's pretty darn good.  So I think by the time they get  to version three or something like that,  it's probably going to be pretty good.  So Windows Blue.  The next, the upgrade, Windows

Transcript:  My argument is always  that we have to understand Microsoft  by understanding the retail strategy,  which is where they're headed. They're following  Apple's strategy because of the great  margins Apple, or the great per square  foot sales that Apple has  at their stores, the highest that any  retail outlets ever achieve, much  higher than Tiffany. And Microsoft  saw this, and even if they get half the sales of  an Apple store, they're still going to make more money  than the Tiffany store. And  they are going to push  this as far as they can, because, but  they have to have hardware in the stores. That's where  they're going to bring out hardware, whether people like it or not.  We've been on this show years ago, and said,  oh, Microsoft will never do hardware.  And I've always said they will do hardware,  because they've always been toying with it, and the Xbox  is a good example of hardware. You're the one, though, and I

You must have known.

Transcript:  I saw them, no, I didn't  know, all I knew is that when they started  doing the retail stores, you had to say, why are they doing this,  and what's the structure of the  future based on these stores?  And then once you get the numbers from  Apple, you go, oh my God,  would Microsoft be crazy not to do these stores?  But you can't do the stores the way they did  with their experimental store in San Francisco,  which would just sell software. You have to have  stuff in there for people to play with. That was a terrible story,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt you, John,  but I just want to agree with you. That's exactly right.  Everybody's going into these Microsoft stores  today, it's almost all Xbox  people, or at least the people who are buying stuff.  They're buying Xbox stuff. Exactly, right now.  And this is Apple's magic  strategy with retail. The thing that's  great about it is that it's a gateway drug.  Originally, you had an iPod,  and you'd go in there to see if there was a case for  your iPod, and you'd see the other stuff.  Now you have an iPhone, all these Windows  users have an iPhone, they go in there and they see the iMac,  and they're like, wow. And they go in there  20 times, and at the 21st time, they're like,  you know what? Screw it, I'm going to get an iMac.  That's the real  power of the Apple store, and that's what  Microsoft needs to do. They need to convert all these  Xbox freaks,  and all the... whatever fans  they have, and convert them over to  their other stuff. Is there an Xbox

They're trying  to kind of ooze that  Xbox experience over to their other  devices, and I think that that could be successful for them,  but to kind of take the coolness  of the brand Xbox and to displace  the rather uncoolness of Windows  is a big ask.

Transcript:  Well, but they will have... This Surface  is one of these things that I've seen people do.  They played with it at the airport, and they talked about it  on the airplane. They really liked it.  And I think once Microsoft...  They're spending the extra money to make these things  cooler than a normal Microsoft product.  And I think once they get  a couple more machines and a phone,  they'll have to have a phone company that  they're going to either buy Nokia or somebody else  so they can have a phone you can buy there,  and all the rest of it, people can walk into a Microsoft  store and have  almost an Apple experience.  And it's cheaper. It's going to be cheaper  than the Apple stuff, and it's going to...  But it's going to be... The stores are  clones. They're a little bigger.

Transcript:  My experience with Windows RT  was exactly that, which is  when you first start playing with it, it's like, oh, this is  cool, this is nice, this is great.  But it's when you live with it for a while,  as I did... You tried.  It doesn't satisfy...  What's wrong with it? It's rough-edged.  It's hard to discover some of the  ways to get to control panels  and stuff. When you...  When you're using a real application, like Office,  you end up going to desktop, and then  touch doesn't work quite as well. For instance,  you can... Let's say you're using Excel  on a Surface RT. Yeah, you can open up  the cells to make them bigger, but  the menus and all the touch targets on the  menus and the ribbon are all still  dinky, and you can't hit them.  And it's just little things like that  where you go, on the Surface,  so to speak, this looks great, it feels  great. You go, this is innovative, this is  exciting, and it's when you live  with it for a little bit. And now maybe that's not a bad thing,  because maybe some people will buy it.  And, you know, Paul Therotte, who is  certainly an expert on Windows, the host of our Windows  Weekly, wrote the article on his  windsupersite.com, that  uncertainty could turn Windows 8  into the next Vista.

They're blaming, though,  lackluster PC maker  designs and lack of  availability, which is what I was talking about.  Which may be one reason why  Surface is more important even than  than we realized.  He says, one of my trusted  sources at Microsoft confirmed Windows 8  weak start, and with all  the drama surrounding Windows 8 and the recent  unexpected departure of Stephen Sinovsky, the  Windows chief, rumors are sure to swirl.  One, Microsoft's  blaming the PC makers.  Two, people are worried  about Sinovsky and  the handoff to Julie Larson Green.  The ribbon girl. Yeah.  Also, it's a bad economic  times, and that could hurt sales  for anything, right? If you're  happy, if you're a business,  I don't feel any urge or

Start time: 4741.10
End time: 4796.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it? Well, I think it was  ill-conceived.  I mean, Microsoft has this history  of having various  devices trying to all look and feel  the same, and they began by taking  the Windows desktop as  a complete system, and  trying to take it down  a few notches. And so the early  smartphones, the original smartphone  as a matter of fact, and some of these other  pocket computers, you had Windows  shrunk onto that  platform with a pen,  and you had the same icons you had on your  Windows OS, and it was like it ran  Word and things,  and it was a  downscale. And so somewhere,  but it never worked out. So somewhere along the line, someone  said, why don't we do the opposite, and go  upscale, we start with a phone OS,  and then move it upscale,  which they believed Apple was  going to do, because they had suggested they  might, but they never did.  Move iOS to the desktop. Or back to the

Start time: 4799.18
End time: 4822.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  did, yet, and I don't know  if they will. So Microsoft jumped  the gun on this, and they upscaled from  a phone OS to a PC  OS. It's ridiculous.  It was idiotic, and it's not what anybody  wants. I don't want a phone OS on  a 27 inch monitor, so when I click on  something, I get full screen,  that's on a 27 inch monitor,  one app. Apple is kind of moving that way, though.  Yeah, well you haven't seen it yet, though.

Transcript:  The irony is that Microsoft  owns the large  touch screen market.  They have the original. They're the big giant ones.  Right, and they also  purchased Perceptive Pixel,  which was the other company.  Between the two of them, that's a  lot of intellectual property,  a lot of brilliant research that's been done,  and they're kind of doing nothing with it.  I mean, Balmer, three years ago,  promised that there would be a consumer version of Surface,  again, the big  retail touch screen thing that they have.  I didn't know it was going to be  what they now call Surface. I thought we were going to  have the big consumer  touch screen, and that would be  absolutely awesome. But the other  point I want to make about the stores  and Windows 8, and about the thing  you talked about, Leo, where it doesn't  feel right, things are hidden, it's not intuitive,  and so on, all completely  true. They're so busy copying Apple  that I think they need to get  their act together and start copying  Google. So what would Google do, to  paraphrase Jeff Jarvis,  Google would use the stores  as a laboratory, as an  ongoing focus group,  to see what people are confused about when they're  poking around on these machines. They would have a camera above  every single device, and they would  see, look, everybody's always confused about  this, that, and the other thing, and have that  be like, you literally  have millions of users  telling you exactly what's wrong  with your user interface.  And they really should use stores like that.  They should use them as  data gathering  engines. For all we know, they are.

I think  Microsoft's much more about  chest-beating and saying, no, it's selling great,  it's selling great.  Paul wraps up his article saying,  the net effect of all of these concerns  is it contributes to a wait-and-see  approach with Windows 8.  I think that's definitely what people are saying. He says  this is exactly the opposite of what Microsoft  should want at this time. In this way,  Windows 8 is much like that,  the launch is much like that of Vista,  where a nagging, and in that case,  tech blogger-led cabal of  disappointed voices, I love this,  he's a good writer. Yeah, he's funny.  A nagging cabal  of disappointed voices dominated the discussion  at launch and torpedoed the product  before it had a chance. You agree? Yeah.  It's kind of what's happening.

I think what they should do, I don't think they should fire Steve Ballmer,  I think they should divide the company into four separate  operations, spin out the stock,  I say it all the time.  It used to be three companies, now I think  they can do four.  Consumer,  Xbox, gaming,  enterprise,  with the mail and all the rest of it.  People love that  exchange server, and I think  the fourth one was maybe  now, retail  would be one of them, but I mean, there's different ways  to divide it up, but the company's too big  in it, and as you said earlier in the show,  when we went on the screw-gold thing,  it's like they're complaining about  what Google's doing, and they're doing it at the same time  because they can't communicate. The company is  too unwieldy.  And Ballmer can take the one company he likes.

Rock, it's called Rock Center.  Rock Center, yeah.  He apparently was,  they did a little tour of the  Grand Central store, the Apple store in Grand Central.  Another new one.  And Brian Williams said that unlike  Steve Jobs,  Tim Cook was able to walk across Grand Central  station completely unrecognized.  Of course he was.  Who knows who Tim Cook is?  Once we got to the Apple store, he said that all  changed as devoted fans approached him  and treated him  like a rock star. There he is, if you look at  the video, walking across, completely unrecognized.  No flash mobs to greet him.  No happy fans.  And nobody throwing a pie at him.  Nobody hit him with a pie either.

And it's  a 1,500 pound  gun safe  that you could buy. Wow.  On Amazon.com.  And the shipping would be free on this.  Costs Amazon, I think,  several hundred dollars.

So the point is that Amazon's  losing almost half a billion dollars  a year on shipping costs.  According to their own... So  I mean, where do you make that  up? How do you make that up? It's not...  Do you think that they're making so much money  from the people who are shipping toilet paper?

Transcript:  is that they... And this is  kind of mirrored in their book  publishing industry. The worst case scenario,  the darkest or most negative spin  on this is that they're trying to  run everybody else out of business.  And that's where you make it up.  When you're the last guy standing, then you make  it up. When you're the last source  of books and the last source of  stuff that can be shipped,  then you can charge anything you want.  That's probably  unfair, but...  It's illegal in some cases.

If you take a bath  on shipping, it sounds like they're selling  that safe below cost.  By the way...  If you're willing... It's only for international stuff. It doesn't  account domestically. It's not just for

Start time: 5867.20
End time: 5880.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  recently said that Amazon's losing up to a billion  dollars a year from the streaming video.  So that's basically them trying to go after Netflix  in the same way that Mike was saying, trying  to run them out of business by being cheaper than them  and offering the same service. But  ultimately, they're losing a lot of money on that, too, I think.

Start time: 5881.51
End time: 5915.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So here's the...  I misstated the loss.  Amazon reported $636  million  in shipping losses  in the quarter  ending September 30th.  $2.8 billion  in shipping losses in the past year.  $2.8 billion  in shipping losses.  That's 4.6% of its sales.  They reported a net  loss  in that quarter of $274 million  had they not had the shipping costs, they would have had a profit  of a half a billion.  Non-shipping.

End time: 5936.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their entire business model appears to be  to take all the money they make from selling all this  stuff and books and everything  and to take that money and squeeze  the hell out of all their competitors  by having  impossibly low  prices on everything and free shipping.  That seems to be their whole business model.  What is their business model?

Start time: 5937.40
End time: 5948.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, revenue, $57 billion.  Gross profit, $10 billion.  So how are they losing money?  I'm looking at the income statement here.  They're not losing money.  They're losing money on shipping.

Start time: 5948.92
End time: 5952.15

Start time: 5953.08
End time: 5978.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They take the profit that they make  and then they use that cash  instead of doing what Apple does, which has what?  Must be $150 billion  in cash by now.  Not quite, but almost I think.  They're massively profitable like Apple.  They take that money and they have free shipping  and take a bath on shipping.  They subsidize their tablets with their losing money on.  They subsidize books with their losing money on.  They subsidize all these other things that lose money on  because nobody else can compete with that.

You got to strike while the iron's hot  and sell those gadgets  now, so you can buy new gadgets.  And that's where Gazelle.com is so great.  I love Gazelle.com.  Visit Gazelle.com.  They've simplified the interface. It's very straightforward.  You got an iPhone, a cell phone, an iPad,  an iPod, a Macbook, or a Mac.  Let's say, okay, you got  in your drawer, you got a  blackberry rim.  Maybe it's time to get rid of that.  I actually have a torch in my  drawer. Good sh- it's in flawless  condition. I never use the damn thing.  And free of water damage.  Let's see what Gazelle will give me.  I bet you have 80 bucks.  $85. You've done this before.

Yeah, I bet you have like, because you were  really into that E71, right?  How about a Lumia?  Oh, I know. Let's say I did this.  I bought an N9.  Because I- and then now I want the Lumia  because it's much nicer.  Let's see if I can sell that N9 for  anything. Free of water damage, yeah.  Look at that. I wonder if that's worth  more or less than the Blackberry. $124

But that's not- that's me  and that's Tim because we're- but  a normal person, you got an iPhone 4S  and you're ready to get an iPhone 5.  Let's go see what that AT&T iPhone  4S is worth.  215 bucks.  That's going to get you the iPhone 5 right there. Boom.  Bada bing bada boom. Now here's the beauty part.  You throw all this stuff in a box. They send you  the box. They send you the shipping label.  These quotes are good for 30 days.  So if you wanted to buy the new iPad,  but you don't want to  send your old iPad until the new one  comes, keep it- you got 30 days  to get the data off of it,  get the new iPad,  and then you send it to Gazelle. And that offer  is guaranteed for 30 days. By the way, they do  wipe the data for you. They check it.  They take care of all of that stuff so you don't have to worry about it.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.  They pay shipping on anything  worth more than a buck. And they'll pay you  top dollar. They're really a good  company. They have paid  almost 50 million dollars now  over 400,000 customers. I know.

And I went with the  Note 2, though, because of the battery life.  The Droid DNA, unfortunately, the battery life  is not exemplary on that. And it's  not replaceable battery, so  once it dies, you know- Why did I do that?  The Note 2 is much better battery  life. It's not as nice looking. It doesn't feel as  the hand, the display isn't as nice.  But for me, that was the one that I went with because I was  looking for, you know, a big  phone with a stylus. Jason's got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You did? Yes, I did.  I'm on Verizon. I'm actually grandfathered into  their old, unlimited data plan, so I'm pretty well  stuck on Verizon at this point. But up here in Albany,  we have really great LTE speeds, so  I'm quite happy with Verizon.  I'm pretty happy with the Note 2 so far.  I used it all day yesterday. Love it.  Started at 6 a.m. and finally plugged in  the charger at 11 p.m. and it  still had 20% charge left. Can you do  tethering? Yes, you can.  You can do tethering. You have to pay extra for it, though.

Start time: 6744.16

Start time: 6781.92
End time: 6791.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  why I had to pay full retail price, which  was a little bit painful to do. But at least  I did get, you know, if I'm looking at  cubic inches, I got a large phone for  my money. So I guess I can look at it that way.

Start time: 6792.02
End time: 6794.81

Start time: 6806.49
End time: 6843.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you're forced to go into one of their  new plans, which are all  tiered. They also have their family sharing plans,  which are, you know,  for some people, they can work out pretty well. But ultimately,  you know, all the offerings are tiered at  this point, which to me doesn't work  because I do a lot of streaming through Spotify  or Netflix on the road.  So I definitely am one of the few who  actually would go over their data caps and  would be paying quite a bit more. So for me,  it makes sense to pay  full retail price for the phone and then keep my own  data plan, which is, you know,  just the way it's going to be, at least until they're  finally come up with some way, I'm sure, to force all of us  who are grandfathered in to get out there.  Oh, they'll get you eventually. Of course.

And there are,  it's available nationwide, but they're not really making a big deal  out of it simply because, you know, it's  more expensive than your average cable or  files connection if indeed you can get files.  I am in a place where I can't get  cable or files. So  it was either that or get like a T3 run  to my house. And this is quite a bit  cheaper than that and the speeds are quite good.
