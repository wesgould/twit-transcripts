Transcript:  I always want to say moussensquiddle when I do Boris Batonov.  Moussensquiddle.  It is Super Bowl Sunday so we're starting the show a little early if you're just joining  us.  I apologize.  I hope I made that clear last week that we were going to start early because we want to  get everybody out of here before kickoff, which may not happen because that's only an  hour off.  But there's so much stuff to talk about and I really want to, I want to talk about it  starting with I think Twitter.  Because there was a big kerfuffle and you're all social media mavens.  You especially Liberty I think.  You represent the kind of the young millennial generation and how they use social media.  Is among among your buddies and friends and your group, is Twitter widely used?

Start time: 341.44
End time: 343.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would definitely say so.  Okay.

Start time: 344.16
End time: 355.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Definitely without a doubt.  I have some impression that Twitter is more, yeah I do, but more influential among the  tech literati, the tech norati than it is among the general population.

Start time: 356.02
End time: 364.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could possibly see that because people ask me, it's really interesting.  How do I have so many Twitter followers?  I'll tell you my secret right here right now.  I personally sign them up.

Start time: 366.40
End time: 368.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get your friends and your family, you say come over here.

Start time: 368.84
End time: 382.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh no, no, no, no, no.  Not friends and family, strangers, people off the streets.  So you're an evangelist.  You know Twitter doesn't know that until now.  So Twitter, if you're listening, I can turn this ship around for you and get you some  more users.  So feel free to tweet me.  So we can make that happen.

Start time: 382.00
End time: 383.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Philip, are you a Twitter user?

Start time: 384.21
End time: 392.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do.  I love Twitter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because you can, you know, if you want to find out what people are saying about any  particular topic, you type it in and there it is.

Start time: 392.78
End time: 394.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like the live aspect of it, right?  Yeah.

Start time: 396.13
End time: 398.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Philip.  And Georgia, you're a Twitter, I would guess you're a Twitter user as well.

Start time: 399.20
End time: 430.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use Twitter, but I use Twitter in spurts.  I stay away from Twitter for as long as possible.  And then like in eight hours, I'll like take a look at Twitter and then I'll respond to  like 30 people and then I'll be gone for another eight hours.  So I like Twitter spam people.  And then most of my Twitter stuff is strange or funny.  And I use it for work, but I probably would stay away from most social media if I could,  unfortunately, with my job.  I'm somewhat forced to.  So I use Twitter because it's short, sweet, it's done.  Agreed Georgia.

Start time: 431.40
End time: 457.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we last week, we talked about Twitter as well because of Joshua Topolski, formerly  of Engadget, who wrote an article in The New Yorker that Twitter was dying.  And then this week, the New Republic, a response from Navneet Alang, who says, you can't kill  Twitter even if it dies.  And I think this is an important point that he makes.  And he says, Twitter is still the best answer to the question.  What is happening in the world right now?

Start time: 458.00
End time: 464.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely. Absolutely.  I can't watch TV, Netflix or literally make a decision without Twitter.

Start time: 465.36
End time: 483.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says, it's not that there's something inherently great about the product, Twitter, but the  company pioneered a new cultural form, which now has its place in our society.  Even if there weren't a Twitter, we would have to have something like it.  There was the kind of the dial tone of the Internet or the ticker, the news ticker of  the Internet.

Start time: 484.38
End time: 496.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You'd think that CNN would be, would tell you what's happening now.  But it's so bad that you do better just dipping your net into Twitter and see what's swimming by.

Start time: 496.62
End time: 512.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's true.  You might have watched the Republican debates, for instance, yesterday on ABC, but much more  likely, at least among our crowd.  And that's why partly I asked you that question, Liberty.  You would also have Twitter fired up and if possible, tweet deck or something that would  let you watch multiple screams strolling by.

Start time: 513.00
End time: 529.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it brings up a point from the last show we did when you're using Twitter and focusing  on a conversation such as the debate, you want to circulate around a hashtag and that  allows you the opportunities to connect with people directly who are talking about something  live, talking about a topic and using a particular hashtag.

Start time: 530.34
End time: 609.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the reason it comes up this week is, of course, this continued Twitter stock continues  to go down and puts it in play for a hostile takeover.  We found out right after the show last week, Jason Callahan was here and kind of hinted.  There are people looking at it.  And I said, is it going to be a company like Google or Facebook or somebody who could take  Twitter and integrate it into existing services or is it an investment company who wants to  kind of turn Twitter around, make money?  He said both.  He said, I know for a fact there is an investment company who's looking very hard at Twitter.  Turns out the next day we saw the news that Mark Andreessen had considered purchasing  Twitter and he's a big Twitter user.  He loves he invented the tweet storm for all intents and purposes.  That did not happen, but it does feel like it's in play.  The Business Insider said that he and Silver Lake Partners thought about buying Twitter,  but declined, decided not to.  Twitter meanwhile has admitted that, well, at first Buzzfeed News said is going to this  week announce or to launch the algorithmic timeline.  Now Jack Dorsey responding said, yes, we are looking at it.  No, we're not going to do it right away.  What is the algorithmic timeline?  Why are people so upset that Twitter might be doing this?  What does it mean?  Philip, can you talk about that?

Start time: 610.64
End time: 626.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it would mean that a computer would be rather than getting the stuff that people  said on the topic you're interested in, in the order they said it, there'd be a computer  that would be making some decisions about what they think you would like.  Like Facebook.  Like Facebook.

Start time: 627.21
End time: 630.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  Facebook's done very well with their cultivated feed.

Start time: 631.12
End time: 642.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  However, that is exactly why people go to Twitter.  Because Twitter is in order.  Because they don't want that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So if you do that, it's kind of like, hey, I'm going to use the same algorithm as Facebook.  It might as well be the same thing.  And people really appreciate that.

Start time: 643.86
End time: 687.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that what they're mistaking is they think that Facebook's popularity is because  of their algorithm, whereas they're completely different ecosystems.  People go to Twitter because I've chosen the people that I'm going to follow.  It's short.  It's not a tweet.  It's like chewable little bites of information that I can choose to.  And it's kind of effortless.  And Facebook has a different population with a different group of people that have different  needs and wants to it.  And in many ways, it's, you know, the techier people are probably on Twitter because it's  just fast and effortless.  And that's what people want for it.  So changing something that we're comfortable with is probably not the best of choices for  Twitter to make because it makes people a little bit more upset than happy because they  already like what they're using.

Start time: 687.02
End time: 770.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yet I've heard people say, oh, you just don't know what's good for you.  Face nobody ever wanted Facebook.  Everybody criticizes Facebook for parsing its feed, massaging its feed.  And nevertheless, it continues to grow and grow and grow by doing so.  And the folks at Twitter may be having the same thought, look, because they're in a huge  storm of protest against this idea of an algorithmic feed.  But they may be saying, just be patient.  In fact, an engineer who was working on it, who's no longer at Twitter said, be patient  because you will like it.  Now, Twitter has been doing something similar for a while while you were away.  Do you guys get the while you're away?  Yes.  So I just I went to my Twitter page and it says while you're away, these are tweets from  people. I'm not sure how this is algorithmic.  Somehow they're choosing people that I care about stuff that I might have missed.  And then I can see what's by the way, I'm glad that they include Megan Maroney, my  colleague here at Twitter, the Wirecutter, a blog I pay a lot of attention to, and Tommy  Chong of Cheech and Chong.  So those are the big three.  You may laugh, but Tommy thinks I'm cool.  He actually he said Leo's cool.  Don't know if he's saying that.  It's true.  I'll take it. And then I could see the new tweets by clicking that.  So they're saying this is not so very different from what we're already doing.  And you may think you want a chronological feed.  You may pay lip service to that, but you don't.

Start time: 771.96
End time: 816.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ben Thompson made an interesting distinction.  He said Facebook was built on an existing network, your network of friends, whereas  Twitter was based on a network of strangers interested in a particular topic.  You end up tuning it.  You have to tune it to make it useful for yourself so that you know who to follow and  you get that tight list of people who are plugged into what you want to know about.  But it's different than Facebook and that Facebook, it's instantly useful because you  find out what your friends are doing.  Twitter takes that learning.  It's got a steep learning curve.  And that's.

Start time: 818.66
End time: 847.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the problem they're trying to solve is that if you don't know Twitter, if you  sign up somebody, Liberty, and they go there, they go, what the hell is this?  I don't. What am I seeing?  What is the because it's a culture and a language all of its own with the hashtags and  the 140 characters.  And I think Jack Dorsey, the new CEO, has also said we're going to expand from 140 to  10,000 characters. That's also in response to that.  So the idea is.  But as he describes these changes, it sounds more and more like Facebook.

Start time: 847.92
End time: 886.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. I think they're just reaching for straws at this point.  At this point, they're just trying to see what can we do to acquire users?  And I think having the 140 characters is indigenous to Twitter and should stick.  I think that should stick and they should agree with you on that.  We should give them the opportunity.  I don't want to see. I don't want to see that medium.  I don't. That's why I go to the Twitter platform so that I can stick to that.  Like like Georgia mentioned, it's short and sweet and that's what we want.  But I think we should definitely give the algorithm a chance because me personally, I  wanted to start a campaign over at Change.org when they changed the UX UI for  Facebook. You guys remember that a couple of years ago, I was upset and really I was  ready to march in the street.

Start time: 886.46
End time: 887.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but now you're fine.

Start time: 887.76
End time: 899.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now I'm fine. I'm completely fine.  I wouldn't want it any other way.  I think that's the point. We all hate change.  Exactly. So I want to give them the opportunity to really show us what they can do  because like you said, we may enjoy it a bit more.

Start time: 899.50
End time: 900.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't know.

Start time: 901.82
End time: 920.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we can turn it off.  That's what Jackson, that is actually important that you will have the option to watch a  chrono, just as you do, by the way, on Facebook, you can look at a chronological feed,  but Facebook switches it back after a while.  Right. You switch it.  I noticed this because I there's a lot of things they turn it off again.  I don't know whether Twitter will do that or not.

Start time: 921.32
End time: 955.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's I think that Twitter's biggest issue is not going to be the algorithm to their  newsfeed. It's going to be signing up new members and how do they find other people  that they would enjoy in their circles?  I think that that's one of the biggest issues that Twitter has, because whenever I sign  up someone that's new, that doesn't know how to use Twitter, it's like, well, now how  do I find people?  And with Facebook, that's so much easier.  And so I think that it's really hard to find what you know, like you search for me,  you're not going to find my name because I have to use an underscore.  And so that makes it really difficult for people.  And, you know, so I think that that's one of the things that Twitter is going to have  to work on as well.

Start time: 955.66
End time: 968.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no question, though, that the modern era, when you talk about technology, is  very much defined by Twitter and Facebook.  Those are definitely those are a lot of what makes modern life modern life.

Start time: 968.54
End time: 983.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Definitely. I really enjoyed it.  Jim said earlier is that people go to the platforms for two different reasons.  And for me personally, that's one reason that I love Twitter is you can meet new people.  And on Facebook, that typically isn't the interaction.  It's literally a place for friends.

Start time: 983.78
End time: 992.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So did you meet any new people at the Super Bowl party?  Because that looked pretty cool.  What?  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  I'm just distracted by the fact that I'm sitting next to a superstar.

Start time: 993.16

Start time: 999.32
End time: 1023.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My people didn't tell me about that.  Twitter does say that they have banned, I think, was one hundred seventy five or  one hundred twenty five thousand accounts for terrorist like activity.  Oh, problem is, and Twitter knows this.  Apparently, the journalists who repeated that story don't.  So they made a new account.  So they kill one hundred seventy five thousand accounts and one hundred  seventy five thousand new ones were created.  It's impossible.  Stop it. How do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we loved it, didn't we?  Yeah. Yeah.  I missed the well.  But that's what happened to the well, by the way, the well was this amazing  cultivated discussion group.  The whole earth electronic link, it was based out of Sausalito and a lot of  the Bay Area's most technically literate, interesting people were on there.  And then it descended as used net did into flame wars.  You were probably PED in the well.  That's probably where you got that in that handle.

Start time: 1078.94
End time: 1090.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. Yeah.  But, you know, the great thing about the well is that there was no anonymity.  It's one of the things I want to do with my site.  You log on with your real name and you own your words.

Transcript:  I want to hear about this.  We're going to take a break.  When we come back, I'm also going to talk about the debut.  Very exciting. The brand new debut of the Amazon Echo.  Oh, wow. Because of course, the Echo has been out for a long time.  We all in the tech community love it.  But but get ready, because this afternoon on the Super Bowl,  Amazon's first Echo ads.  And I think that the onslaught is about to begin.  And clearly, they're pretty good.  They're pretty good. Yeah. With Alec Baldwin, right?  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, I haven't.  Don't tell you. No spoilers.  You know how some people don't want to hear anything about Star Wars  before it came out?  I don't want to hear anything about Super Bowl commercials.  I'm I'm Tivoing it.  I don't care about the score.  But but please don't.  Hmm. No spoilers for the Super Bowl commercials.  No, I've actually.  I'm a huge Echo fan.  And it's clear because these ads are five million bucks for 30 seconds this year.  That's up something like 67 percent from a few years ago.  And so when a company, it's a statement when a company buys Super Bowl ads,  it's a statement.  One of the reasons they buy Super Bowl ads is to say, we got the money  and we're committed.

Transcript:  We came to play and we came to win the play and win.  And and I think so.  I think Amazon buying ads for the Echo is a statement.  We'll talk about that more in just a little bit.  Georgia, Dows here from I'm more dot com.  Philip Elmer Dewitt from Fortune dot com.  Liberty Madison from Liberty Madison dot com.  And I'm Leo Laporte from Leo Laporte, not anything else.  I don't have Leo Laporte dot com.  You don't. I should get it.  Somebody else has it.  Do I? No, I don't.  Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront dot com.  You know, we're all saving for the future, I hope. Right.  You're putting money aside, at least for your retirement.  If you've got kids for the college fund, maybe you're saving for a down payment.  We you should have long term investments, long term savings.  And the reason I say investments is probably not best to put in a bank.  Savings accounts make almost nothing.  You'd be better off putting in the mattress, frankly.  You've got to invest it.  Problem is, the investment is, well, you kind of have two choices.  Either you're going to take the time to learn about investing, to do it right,  and to more importantly, pay attention to your investments.  Log in frequently, check how it's doing, rebalance,  or you're going to pay somebody to do that.  And when I say pay, I mean pay.  Traditional investment advisors, they will charge you one to three percent  of what you have under investment per year.  That means you have to make one to three percent more every year just to break even.  I got a better way, better advice, full time  maintenance of your account, constantly rebalancing it, paying attention to it.  It's Wealthfront.  Now, Wealthfront doesn't charge one, two or three percent.  They charge one quarter of one percent a year.  There are no hidden fees, no transaction costs. That's it.  And they're what they're it's software.  And they're basing the software on the really brilliant  insights of their advisory board.  Two hundred years combined investment experience.  People like Burton Malkiel, who wrote the book,  you know, The Random Walk Down Wall Street and Charles D.  Ellis, the king of investment advisors.  They took their brains and they put them in this software.  And the thing is, because it's software, it constantly monitors your account,  is constantly managing it to optimize return after taxes.  And this is key. They do tax lost harvesting.  They do. You ask your invested investment advisor,  are you doing tax lost harvesting?  It's fun to watch them pretend they understand what you just ask them.  They have no idea. And no, they're not doing it.  Direct indexing, all sorts of sophisticated stuff.  We've heard from many Twitter fans now because we've been doing these ads for a while  who've gone to Wealthfront are very happy.  And they say they love how they can diversify their portfolio.  They can kind of feel like they're participating in the economy,  buying stock in Apple and Amazon and Facebook.  And they pay no commissions. It's transparent.  You see what's happening at all times on your dashboard, on the desktop or on the mobile app.  You could have whether it's a personal account, a joint account, a retirement account.  You know everything Wealthfront's doing on your behalf.  And all of this for one quarter, one percent per year with no additional charges.  Actually, I'm going to do even better for you.  Now, it's five hundred dollars to start. I want you to go to the site, frankly.  I want you to read up on this.  Seriously, this is it's important that you know what you're doing before you do it.  But I think when you read up on it, you'll see why I'm so bullish on this.  And when you go to Wealthfront.com slash twit, they can they will actually generate a  portfolio for you, the customized allocation they recommend for you so you can see what they would be doing with your money.  And they base that on some questions they'll ask you, like your time frame,  how comfortable you are with risk, things like that.  That's that's free at Wealthfront.com slash twit.  You can get started for as little as five hundred dollars.  That's the minimum amount to open an account.  And and I love this.  Your first fifteen thousand dollars will be managed free of charge, not a quarter of one percent, nothing forever.  So this is a really great way to get a leg up.  Your first fifteen thousand dollars managed for free.  Wealthfront.com slash twit.  This is a real this is technology put to one of the most important things in your life, your investments.  Wealthfront.com slash twit.  I think it's really interesting. I haven't seen the ad.  So are they good? Tell me how it's I kind of read some stuff.  I haven't seen like Alec Baldwin's looking for a great idea or something.  How does that how does it go?  You could talk to me, Philip, I don't mind. I won't yell at you.

Amazon's Echo is a sleeper hit, writes Dan Fromer, who I love,  and the rest of America is about to find out for it for the first time.  He points out something we've known for a long time.  The people who have echoes like are always talking about that.  That's a good sign in tech.  The people have it going, oh, you have you tried the Echo. It's so amazing.

In fact, this is the biggest problem they face is complexity.  So it's a black tube with a speaker and a ray mic so it can hear you anywhere in the room.  So I don't really think I'm talking to the tube.  I think I'm talking to the house. Right.  That's the first thing you want.  Like how 9000 you could talk.

Start time: 1644.38
End time: 1656.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an innate ability.  I I'm very intrigued by this.  The fact that Amazon is putting money into Super Bowl commercials tells me  they see a market here, right?

Start time: 1656.18
End time: 1663.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Definitely. I think this is a easy way to get everyone on board  for Internet of Things, just an easy way to introduce it.  It works with that because you can say turn on my lights.

Start time: 1663.98
End time: 1671.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because while you're while you're watching the Super Bowl,  you don't want to get up for anything.  And so here it's saying is that, listen, you wouldn't have to.  You wanted pizza.  You could get pizza right now with crappy pizza, but you can still get.

End time: 1718.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's exactly right.  In fact, if you're a prime customer and echo really makes most sense,  if you're a prime customer and you've ordered a product before,  let's say I've ordered adult diapers before, I could say, get me more of those.  And the echo, because it knows that you order those before,  would get you some more.

You know, that's good.  Affirmations are OK.  Yeah, I am. I am smarter.  I am better.  And people like me.  Like rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spot.  Some of this stuff is really weird because anybody can do it.  And I was saying this is their big problem is there are too many things it can do.  It's like you have to remember, as with all voice commands,  you have to kind of remember the syntax and the command.

Start time: 1813.76

Transcript:  No, I have nothing to complain about.  But but but they were they're working on the website.  And apparently, inadvertently, they put so you have a page where it shows you your status.  And, you know, it's really it's interesting to watch these people, crazy people like me,  because we are buying a car sight unseen, never having test drive it.  I wasn't even sure what the colors were, you know, what they were going to look like.  But I just ordered it anyway.  And it's an expensive car. It's not a cheap car.  And because but you're we're fanatics because we want to drive electric vehicles  that are as fast as a Porsche, you know, turbo Carrera.  And not that I want to drive it like an old lady, but  but I could go fast if I wanted to.  Lisa will drive it fast.  So you go onto this page and then little bits of information about the process  emerge on the page like I just got my vehicle identification number.  That's a good sign. That means they're they're getting a little closer.  And then next to it, they put should be available.  And I went crazy. This is where I tweeted February, early March.  I went, what?  I wasn't expecting this till next year. What?  Apparently, that was an error  because it's gone now.  But I'm not complaining.  I just want you to. This is not a complaint.  I'll take it.

Transcript:  There it is. This is so this this feature.  This guy actually wrote an app.  This is not part of the official Tesla app, but he wrote an Apple watch app.  The Tesla app lets you do the summon on the iPhone or Android phone.  And what Summon does, as you're going to see here, is the car opens the garage door.  This is all without user intervention, opens the garage door and very gradually,  very carefully, very carefully backs out  and then opens the door and lets you get in.  And it will do the opposite once you arrive.  And they say this is for garages that are so tightly packed  that you can't actually get out of the car once you park it.  Oh, wow. But it's got sensors all over it, so it will avoid.  But don't you feel like great?

She has a Tesla X and she says, I'm driving down the highway,  but I don't have my feet on the pedals and my hands just hovering over the wheels.  And the Tesla is doing it all for me.  I wish she'd said something like don't have a cow man in the parts for us,  but probably she's not allowed to, you know, copyright.  Yeah, I think she can probably I bet you they don't allow her to.  Yeah, that's weird.  Ah, so enough.  We've done Twitter. We've done the echo.  OK, let's go home. I think the Super Bowl is no, no, we should probably do  a little bit more.

He's for the third year for cycle in a row covering the New Hampshire primary.  He's going to be covering the campaign again, as he did in 2008 and 2012.  And as Dan pointed out,  one of the things that's going to distinguish candidates  is their mastery of social media.  Hillary Clinton has a Snapchat story channel where she's feeding videos.  Well, she or her senior Snapchat, Snapchat, Snapchat, Snapchat,  Snapchat officer.  And, you know, it'll be interesting to see, I think, when we get down to two candidates,  almost the war of social media between the two of them.  Clinton uses Twitter quite effectively,  but not authentically, whereas Donald Trump uses.  It's clearly his voice.  Yeah, a senior Twitter officer.

And I guess we probably need a little bit of both.  But I think that's two different, very different kinds of presidents,  very different kinds of executives.  But I think historically.  You need to do both, although Kennedy was probably a crappy administrator,  but it was a but it was a great speaker.

And of course, they keep they the whole  meme thread is that you will show what she's texting.  So there's Biden to showing the president his phone.  She's going to love this new Justin Bieber video.  And then she texts back to them.  Back to work, boys.  And Huffington Post, Hillary, Hillary Post dot com.

Transcript:  It's such a hard thing because you're always wanting to be authentic.  But then if you say something off the cuff and it comes out off color,  people are going to run with it.  And it's so hard to be constantly under a barrage of questions  and people hoping to get you with something.  And you're just doing your best to try not to say something silly,  but then you don't want to seem robotic and stiff at the same time.  So my hat's off to being able to deal with that 24 7.

Start time: 2893.36
End time: 2918.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you can also see when people are overly reactive.  And I think that that's really important to be more non reactive as a president.  You don't want to be really upset and quick to temper and quick to get offended  when you're dealing with international issues and many different people  with different cultural needs and wants.  And so I think that things that might garner a lot of attention  in some ways are a way of seeing who can be common to all of this pressure.

Start time: 2918.84
End time: 2927.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

But, you know, when you're representing a whole country of people,  you want someone that's going to be even tempered, be able to handle it.  Think before they do something.  They're not going to press the red button just out of anger.

Start time: 2963.90
End time: 3007.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But don't you I mean, I have to I have to really say that.  By being the only guy who's speaking in his own voice on Twitter,  Trump's getting a huge value out of that.  I mean, that's one of the reasons he has such support.  Not I doubt very much that the people who support him agree with the notion  that he should go down Fifth Avenue shooting people.  But the fact that he has some of the chutzpah to say that  is, I think, invigorating to people.  It's fresh.  The guy speaks his mind.  I may not always agree with him, but the man is not a mealy  mouthed politician. He says what he thinks.  Yeah, it's the anti-politician.  He's authentic.  The anti-politician.

You can't see him really raising his voice very much.  He shed a little tear, but that's about it.  I can see I could see that after a while, you'd say, hey,  I want somebody who speaks in his own voice on Twitter and tells it like it is.  And and I think the Twitter is the perfect platform for Donald Trump.

But I wish I had a space right now.  Yeah. Yeah.  The plan is to is to do is the model that a lot of guys like me are doing.  Ten bucks a month,  one hundred bucks a year.  You get the daily post in your inbox.  You click on the link and you get to be part of the conversation  and see the data and so forth.  That's what Ben Thompson does. So affect. Right. Exactly.  The problem with that model is that once you go behind the firewall,  you're invisible on the Internet.  So Ben gets around that by writing a public post once a week.  There are other ways of doing that.  My my twist on it is that I'll put a window on it.  It's it's behind the paywall for it's adjustable,  but behind the paywall for three days and then it's free.  Oh, I like that.

The thing that scares me about paywalls,  particularly with our audience, our audience is technically very literate.  Dignation had this problem.  Dignation for a while thought, we'll charge for early access.  Remember, Kevin Rose's and Alex Albrecht's book.  We'll charge for early access.  And then a few days later, whatever it was, we'll make it public.  Oh, they did that. Yeah.  And the problem was that they have a very technically literate audience  that as soon as they got it, put it out publicly and there was no way to stop it.  So suddenly, if you're going to make money in that model, you're playing whack a mole.  And I think Kevin and Alex abandoned it.  I don't think that lasted very long.  But that's the problem.

Transcript:  Right.  The other thing is the market is really betting on what the next guy is  going to be willing to pay for this stock.  So it really has very little to do with fundamentals.  They're saying, okay, what's the next sucker going to pay?  And then the other thing is they disappointed the analysts.  And that's the other part of the stock market.  You set expectations and if you can beat them, the stock goes up.  And if you don't beat them, the stock goes down.  Except with Apple, the rule is no matter what they do, the stock goes down.

Apple doesn't need the capital and they just, they're getting, they're  getting killed by algorithms, I think.  You know, these machines that, that say which way things are trending and they  just accelerate the trend all the way down until it's going to go the other way.  And then they accelerate it all the way up.  Eventually, if things are rational, Oh, it's Lady Gaga singing.  I can't talk to you.

We believe in it.  Apple got a fairly large legal decision against them.  Company called Vernet X sued Apple and over infringement.  Vernet X interesting.  Only has 14 employees, has a little office in Zephyr Cove, Nevada.  They don't really make anything.  They filed suit in Tyler, Texas.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  That's a, that's a, that's where we were going to go if the podcast lawsuit had  gone through Tyler, Texas.  Uh, the, it was a patent infringement suit and I think Vernet X qualifies as a  non-practicing entity, AKA a patent troll.  They said that the, they, Apple infringed on patents in iMessage, communications  patents, protocols in iMessage, FaceTime, VPN on demand, as well as Apple devices  using the software, the jury found Apple guilty on all claims and ordered Apple  to pay Vernet X and its 14 employees $625.6 million.

Transcript:  Uh, the reason, the justification for, um, uh, mistrial is in the closing arguments.  Apparently they, uh, used arguments outside the evidence in, you know, they  broke the rules, uh, and, uh, misrepresented the testimony of Apple's witnesses.  You know, I think that's probably, uh, you know, once you lose a $625 million  lawsuit, all you can, all you're trying to figure out is, well, how can we keep  this thing going?  How can we avoid writing the check?  That's not an insignificant check.  As much money as Apple has, it's a lot of money.  Yeah.  Sam Sonnux.  And, uh, you know, I think that the word patent troll, I think it maligns trolls.

Transcript:  Trolls at least give nice riddles and their, their work in the bridge.  I think that that's something we can talk about.  Yeah.  But, um, no, I think that the entire, this, this trial goes all the way back to, to  2010, where when they first sued them and then it was, uh, they, they won on that  one, then it was overturned and now they're going back and it's, it's one of  these things of that, you know, we blame the patent trolls, but really US patent  law is quite broken and when you have, um, you know, the patent office, you know,  has this habit of issuing patents for things that they really do not understand  and they're not really, they're really, really vague.  And then we have these non practicing patent trolls that are not using anything.  They're just really there to win litigations.  And, you know, Vernet X has been really successful in that regard.  You know, Vernet X has been really successful.  They've sued many big companies, but they won a 20 million.  They were settled a 20, 200 million lawsuit against Microsoft.  And so this encourages them to keep at it.  And unfortunately, um, Tyler, Texas and Marshall, Texas, they win.  You just, they're there for a reason because they're, they're very  biased towards patent holders.  Right.  Maybe biased.  We were told.

Start time: 4821.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we, as, as some of you know, uh, there was a podcast patent troll, uh, since,  since, uh, uh, defunct.  Um, but they sued, um, a number of well-known podcasts, including Adam  Corolla, uh, saying that they had invented podcasting, they were quoting a  particular clause of a patent that they got many years ago, like 95, I think.  And, uh, it would have been held, I think in Tyler, Texas, we hired a  firm, I didn't talk about it at the time.  Cause we, on the advice of council, we said, they said, don't talk about it.  You don't want to attract attention, but, uh, they didn't sue us.  We got a demand letter for a ridiculous amount of money.  I can't remember what it was, like two and a half million dollars.  And, uh, since I knew that even in worst case scenario, defending it would  cost about a million and a half.  I thought, well, why would I pay you two and a half if I could defend  it for a million and a half?  So we were actually prepared.  We hired a law firm.  Uh, I gave money to the EFF.  The EFF actually was, I think, part instrumental in, uh, in dismantling  the case because there are two ways you can pursue a patent case.  You can of course go to court.  The problem with Tyler, Texas and Marshall, Texas is, as you say, um, these  are, uh, juries that tend to be in favor of the little guy, right?  And, uh, it's very often portrayed that the big company came along and  ripped off the little guy's invention.  And, uh, justice needs to be done here.  And the juries go along with it.  Uh, there's also, I was told the, the judge, there's a particular judge in  one of the jurisdictions who just loves these cases and, uh, and really kind  of embraces them and all, and does feel that very strongly that this is a case  of, you know, the little guy standing up to the big guy was a little harder.  Revenue for the town too.  Oh, absolutely.  Cause all of these companies have little offices in the town.

Start time: 4958.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, well, so the other way you could fight it, if you don't want to fight it  in court is to go to the U S patent and trademark organizations, uh, uh, office.  I mean, um, they, it turns out that there are so many patents filed in the U S  and there's so few experts and so little expertise that in general, the way the  patent office works is they'll approve the patent and say, let the court set up,  settle it.  If it's not a good patent, they kind of expect there to be a certain amount of  litigation around many of these patents.  So it's not, it's not quite rubber stamped, but they don't spend a lot of  time looking for prior art, things like that.  So another way you can pursue it, and this is what the electronic frontier  foundation elected to do is something called an interpartes suit, where you go  to the patent and trademark office and you say, we want to contest the patent.  Right now, our attorney told us this is a very risky move.  If you win, it's only a hundred thousand dollars.  You know, it's not expensive compared to a trial, but if you lose, it becomes  very hard to win against a jury because then the opposing attorney says, well,  you know, we, uh, they tried to get this patent overturned.  They went back to the U S patent and trademark office and they did everything  they could, and you know what the U S patent and trademark office said?  They said our patent is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, no, in fact, the attorney, uh, that was representing the podcast  troll was from New York and our attorney said that's actually tactically a  mistake on the pat on the part of the non-practicing entity because generally  you want a good old boy lawyer down there.  You don't want anybody from New York with those New York values coming down here.  So, uh, they, there were other technical mistakes, uh, that this company pursued.  They, in other words, they weren't very good at being a patent troll.  For instance, the demand letter, you're not supposed to ask for so much money  because that incents people to fight you.  You, what you want to do is ask for less than it would cost to fight.  You know, we'll look, we will settle this for a hundred thousand dollars.  You, you know, you, but apparently they didn't know much.  And, um, so the good news is the, the EFF took the risk, a risk that had it been up  to me, I probably wouldn't have taken.  I would have followed Adam Corolla's, uh, plan, which was to meet him in court.  Corolla was said, we're going to fight this and right away.  And he raised money.  He'd had a crowdfunding campaign and everything.  Uh, but fortunately the EFF prevailed in the patent trademark office did  in fact overturn the patent.  So the whole thing just went away.  Not that it will go away forever, uh, because, uh, there's lots of companies  like this, non-practicing entities who, uh, it's a business model.  In fact, shamefully, I think one of Microsoft's smartest people, Nathan  Mervold actually has a business kind of essentially doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, they, uh, most of them were not created by them, but were acquired by them.  And then the question is, well, what is happening with these patents?  And it seems to be the case, if you listen, there was a really good, uh,  podcast put together by this American life on this subject.  And I think the planet money guys also did a good podcast on this.  Um, but it turns out that there are a lot of shell companies that seem to  have been started by intellectual ventures that are doing the actual suing.  I don't know if the intellectual ventures was founded to sue.  You see right on the front page, license our patents, buy our patents, sell your  patents.  So their business really is as a patent marketplace.  I imagine that's what Miravolt, who is, I don't think, I mean, this  guy's got a lot going for him.  Uh, he was chief strategist and chief technology officer at Microsoft.  He's quite a brilliant guy.  My guess is he wanted to create a patent marketplace, but, um, you know, they  have $3 billion in licensing revenue.  So clearly there is a business in this.  Uh, and yes, they haven't gone to court, but the evidence is apparently that  they've, they've, uh, created some shell companies to pursue these patents in

This comes from a mall CEO.  A guy who, uh, runs a mall company, the chief executive of general growth  properties, he was on an earnings call and probably somewhat inopportunely said,  well, you've got Amazon opening brick and mortar bookstores.  Their goal is to open, as I understand, three to 400.  I can't imagine Amazon was too happy about that news leaking out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only reason that I could think for them to do that would be to, um, you  know, directly compete against, you know, other brick and mortar stores, man,  force them to close down because it's so much more expensive to carry stock and  to deal with, you know, building and people and issues that that comes up with.  Whereas they're so successful with the business model that they have now.

And it, you know, after the 80th time I heard hit me baby one more time, I  decided I should listen to something more edifying than Brittany Spears on the radio.  So I started listening to audio books and Audible in those days, it was very early.  You know, I had a diamond Rio MP3 player and you had to, it was complicated to  get the book on there.

But what we, what we knew is what from the allies side, what we didn't know is  from the Russians side.  So a lot of that rush after the fall of the Soviet unit, a lot of the Russian  documentary information about world war two, uh, has emerged and there was a new  book written on world war two, new history, which incorporates much of the new  information.  Uh, oh, I wish I could find this.  I'll find it for you.  I read it on audible.  Listen to it on audible.  People get mad when I say I read it on audible.  It's like reading.  I got every word.

That makes him number four on the list of the richest people on earth and the  world's richest tech CEO, eclipsing Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry  Page, Sergey Brin, $57 billion.  And that's what the kind of artificially reduced stock price.  I mean, if it really is this Forbes list?  No, this is, so business insiders doing it with WealthX.  And I don't know how this compares to the famous Forbes list.  It should be fairly close.  I would think Bezos has eight has 18% stake in Amazon.

Transcript:  Did you all read the article?  I thought this was really interesting.  Actually was a, it was a study called Going Dark coming out of the  Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard.  It was a study of the, of the landscape of government surveillance,  for a want of a better word.  Don't panic, making progress on the Going Dark debate.  And the debate is really kind of formulated by, on the one hand, the  director of the FBI, James Comey, who says we're going dark.  We can't, we can't read the bad guys communications anymore because they're  using modern encryption and we need a way to read modern encryption.  And on the other hand, company, believe it or not, places like the NSA,  who's saying, oh no, no, no, encryption.  Everybody needs that.  Which is weird.  We talked on Monday, I did a triangulation.  It was a great episode of triangulation with a guy who was a former advisor to  Hillary Clinton for four years as secretary of state.  So we worked in government.  Alec Ross.  Yeah.  His, his new book was about new industries that are springing up thanks  to technological innovation, but he said, the government is not monolithic on this.  There is an active split in government between those like Comey who think we  got to have back doors and those like, believe it or not, he says the NSA who  says, no, no, you can't have a back door.  That makes everything insecure.

Start time: 6241.38
End time: 6312.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yes, Congress, which doesn't and Comey, which doesn't.  Um, but anyway, this Berkman, uh, study maybe should help them understand a  little bit better because they say more than the resources for law enforcement  today are more than adequate to tracking suspects, thanks to the internet of things.  Technologies, everything packed with sensors and wireless technology.  Doesn't matter if they can't read the messages.  They know everything else.  So this is an interesting response.  Everybody should, if, if not, if you don't want to download and read the  PDF, which is available from the Berkman center, you can read, uh, articles like  this from the New York Times, David Eastanger, new technologies give government  ample means to track suspects, study fines.  And I hope members of Congress at least read this and state legislators, because  that's the other thing that's happening.  Uh, okay.  I want to be careful here because I'm sure there's some intelligence state  legislators, but if there's anybody dumber than a member of Congress, it's  a member of the state assembly.  That's a guy who couldn't get to Congress.  Am I, is that wrong to say, is that a bad thing to say?

Transcript:  Yeah.  I wouldn't say it in person.  If you're listening and you're a member of the state assembly, it's not you I'm  talking about, but, but it turns out in a number of states, of course, including  California members of the local legislatures are proposing really bad idea.  Backdoor stuff.  Maybe they could read this as well.  Uh,

Start time: 6334.26
End time: 6358.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, they're not really saying that they want the, like, they're saying they  want the back doors to track terrorists, but really they want to snoop on other  members so that they can use that as leveraging tools in order to change  people's votes, deal with what they're saying, find out which way people lean.  It's, it's more about information than it is actually to track people.  Cause you can see that the statistics show that they really haven't used  this to catch terrorists.

The, uh, California assemblyman, Jim Cooper, uh, submitted a bill, which is very  similar to one also submitted in New York state that would require device manager  manufacturers and operating system vendors who want to sell devices in  California after January 1st of next year to provide a crypto back door.  Oh geez.  You want to do business in California?  You better hobble your system fine of $2,500 for every device that doesn't comply.  And of course, if California passed such a bill, it wouldn't matter that the rest  of the country didn't because you know, Apple's going to want to sell iPhones  in California, I think, um, in it, you know, just in crime.  And by the way, uh, they never say it's, uh, you know, they always say it's for  things like, uh, we got to stop trafficking.  That's what, that's the excuse he used.  We got to stop trafficking.

Transcript:  He says you can get a warrant for pretty much anything and everything.  Not quite true, but you can get a warrant for pretty much anything and  everything, but not for an iPhone or an iPad.  That's mind boggling.  There is a point to be made there.  In fact, Steve Gibson, our own security guys pointed that out.  He says, you know, you can, if I have a locked box in my house with my  plans for taking over the, you know, U S government law enforcement, if they  have reasonable cause, you can go to a judge, can get a warrant, can come in,  can, can open that box.  But I can put it on my iPhone and they could still get a warrant, but they don't  have the technological means to unlock the iPhone.  So Gibson says there is, there's, you know, there's reason to say, you know,  there's precedent for saying there, there, there should be some way to, to  issue a search warrant for this.  The problem is the back door.  What he says Apple should just go back to the way they used to do it, which  is just don't encrypt the iPhone.

And if you're going to be doing that, if you're going to be banking through your  phone, you want it to be safe.  You don't want it to have a back door.  Um, and it won't work if there's a back door, because then if you know there's a  back door, then, then people are just going to spend the rest of their lives  trying to open it.

I forget what it was.  Something like a strategy advantage.  Um, you know, they it's, it's, it's free for them.  Right.  Uh, and it costs their, uh, it would cost Google a fortune to give up, uh,  what Apple doesn't sell, you know, I'm not saying that quite right, but yeah.

Transcript:  I know what you're saying in a way, you know, one of the reasons I like Android  and I like Google now is because Google does know more about me.

Transcript:  I think that it changes those.  So that Google's model is the more the information they know, the better they  can sell you ads and that makes Google more money versus Apple.  It's selling you products.  And so it doesn't need to have that information to make more money.  And so it, since we are their main customers, they want to keep us safe  first versus Google.  And so I don't want to give up my privacy for safety when the data does not  support that we would actually be any more safe by me giving up my privacy.

Transcript:  They use stingrays.  You know, these are phony cell sites that intercept your phone traffic.  Earlier this week, Brian Frosh challenged a Baltimore's court decision  in the case of Karen Andrews.  Frosh is the attorney general of the state of Maryland.  Andrews was tagged targeted by a sting ray.  He faces multiple, I mean, look at this is an interesting case because this guy  is charged with multiple murders, attempted murders.  He told the court, you must dismiss these charges.  This is unreasonable search and seizure.  This is a fourth amendment, right?  The state said, well, cell phones are constantly revealing their location.  So because Andrews uses a cell phone, he volunteered this information with third  parties, including the police, just by keeping his phone on.  The state brief says, well, quote, while cell phones are ubiquitous, they all come  with off switches because Andrews chose to keep his cell phone on.  He was voluntarily sharing the location of his cell phone with third parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see, I think that's like a little bit of like a solipsism though, right?  Like I don't think that people mostly think that they're going to be tracked.  I think that people first start from the feeling of like people, one, don't really  understand the technology that they use.  They assume that things are private that are not.  And I think that because cell phones are so ubiquitous to our society and the  manner in which we go through our daily, day to day lives, it is, it should be up  to the government to make sure that we are safe and that our privacy and, you  know, the constitution is upheld first, not that that would be, you know, a  necessary means to an end.  I think that if they, you know, they're tracking someone that's dangerous and  they file to be able to subpoena to have the right, I think that that sounds fair,  but I don't think that just by using your cell phone, you should expect that, you  know, well, there's a microphone on the cell phone and there's a camera.  We could choose to turn that on at any point in time if we want.  And that should be, I should give up my rights to thinking that my life is private.

What is, what kind of fiend?  So apparently there are, there's case law in this.  In 2014, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that requiring a cell phone user to turn  off their cell phone places an unreasonable burden on the user to forgo necessary use  of his phone, a device now considered essential by most of the populace.  On the other hand, in 2013, a New York judge in a DEA case said, given the  ubiquity and celebrity of geolocation technologies, celebrity?  Strange.  Famousness.  Famousness.  That's a better word.  Famousness.  An individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in the prospective location of  a cellular telephone where that individual has failed to protect his privacy by taking  the simple expedient of powering it off.  That was in 2013.  So we'll see.  I mean, this is yet to be decided in the state of Maryland, but keep in mind you're  giving the government permission to track you if you use a cell phone.

Apple says that's because there is a tight connection between the fingerprint reader  and a secure store on the phone that we need to keep secure.  When you bring it to Apple to get it fixed, we will reassociate.  But these these third party guys don't do it.  So we have to break your phone.  They the Guardian broke this story and they and they broke it because one of their own  freelancers, Antonio Olmos, was covering the refugee crisis in Macedonia, dropped his  phone. There are no Apple stores in Macedonia.  So he went to a local shop.  They repaired the screen and home button.  It worked perfectly.  He thought no more about it until he got offered iOS 9.

Transcript:  You do what Samsung does.  You know, Samsung has a similar secure store and they call it Knox, like Fort Knox.  And if you violate it by, say, changing the firmware on your phone,  Knox stops working and Samsung won't allow, you know, says you can't use this for Samsung  Pay because it's not secure anymore.  And some programs like, I don't know, Netflix, some programs where there's  Hollywood content will stop working because Hollywood says, well, you're not secure  anymore. You might be pirating.  But your phone still works.

Transcript:  Right. The nature of that error message suggests to me that Apple didn't know about  this. If they knew that it was going to happen, they would have had an error message  that said, hey, your phone doesn't work.  Screw up, man.  They would have used English.  You would have had an Apple logo.

Transcript:  So Friday, according to Apple Insider, Apple acknowledged it.  And this is what Apple explained to The Guardian after their story.  We protect fingerprint data using a secure enclave, which is uniquely paired to the  Touch ID sensor.  When an iPhone is serviced by an authorized Apple service provider or Apple retail store  for changes that affect the Touch ID sensor, the pairing is revalidated.  The representative warned with an unofficial repair that pairing can go  unvalidated and lead to error 53 once iOS is updated or even restored.  People who contact the glitch should contact Apple support.

Start time: 7142.50
End time: 7178.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And here's an additional statement that came now to Apple Insider.  We take customer security very seriously.  Error 53 is the result of security checks designed to protect our customers.  iOS checks the Touch ID sensor in your phone or iPad correctly matches your device's other  components. If they find a mismatch, the check fails and Touch ID, including for Apple Pay  use, is disabled.  The security measure is necessary to protect your device and prevent a fraudulent Touch ID  sensor from being used. That's fine.  If that's all they do is disable it, fine.  If they break the phone, that's not fine.  So maybe you're right, Philip.  Maybe that's an unintended consequence.  They meant just to we didn't mean to break your phone, just disable the Touch ID.

They they will actually they have an app that will track time and hours.  You could take pictures of receipts and expenses,  and it goes right in the invoice.  They've just announced their card reader.  Now, this is cool.  There are a lot of people who go to homes to do things,  you know, contractors, inspectors.  And so you might, for instance, go make an estimate.  So with the FreshBooks app, you can show the estimate,  get the customer approval, do the work.  Customers standing there, you say, here's your invoice.  I'll have this email to you.  And here's my card reader.  It's a EMV enabled so they can dip the chip or swipe the stripe  and pay you right there and talk about getting paid fast.  So awesome.
