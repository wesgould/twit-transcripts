Transcript:  Do you play games at all? I play Overcooked. It's I don't know I mean I'm sure Jeff and Shane have  heard about it but it's really simple. Is that one of those games where like you're a chef and the people come in and  you have to make hamburgers? Yeah but it's not as simple as that. Overcooked is a little bit more  challenging and it's more like a multiplayer game but you know I play a few other games to like League  of Legends but I wouldn't consider myself like the most hardcore gamer. Do you play Overcooked on the  Xbox? Is that what you play? You can play I play on Steam but the first time I played it and someone  I play with my friends is on PlayStation. Now I have another game to play. There you go Overcooked

Transcript:  because you're down there right? Yes yes I think this is my 16th or 17th E3. This year was weird  a little odd especially for me I think I spent less time there than I have in any of the previous  16 or 17 years. I have a big new project I'm doing Dungeons and Dragons show now which is really a  lot of fun. Tell me about that. Dungeon Run? Oh my gosh what's that? What's it called? It's called  the Dungeon Run and I don't want to get sidetracked too much but it's like the thing  I'm most proud of maybe in my entire career. It is so much fun. We're creating a television  quality live play Dungeons and Dragons show. I'm the dungeon master which means I make up everything.  It is crazy we have a fully animatronic mind flayer that hosts the show kind of like the  old crypt keeper from the Tales of the Crypt and the production value is insane. It's a lot of

Transcript:  living playing video games? Oh I think yes. I think everybody's mom did. I was just having  this conversation at E3 with somebody where you know when we were doing the Totally Rad Show back  in 2007 we sold t-shirts that said nerd is the new cool and we it was like tongue in cheek back  then. We didn't think that that was actually true. We just kind of it was like our mantra  and it has actually become true. It is crazy. Geek culture and nerddom and all video games and stuff  like that is taking over the mainstream in a way that's almost a little scary to be quite honest

Start time: 433.80
End time: 446.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  for my generation. Oh yeah it's as valuable as all of Hollywood put together. Actually Shane,  one of the reasons E3 was weird this year was there was no Sony. Yeah big deal. No PlayStation

Start time: 446.46
End time: 539.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  at all and it wasn't just Sony either. Electronic Arts left the show floor a couple years ago.  Activision was not on the show floor this year. Microsoft used to have a limited presence on the  show floor but most of its operations are now across the street at LA Live. So yeah it was a  big deal. I think there's a lot of concern about the future of E3 right now. The former ESA  president Michael Gallagher he just stepped down and according to my inside sources the industry  in general was not happy with the direction he was taking it and the ESA is the lobbying  faction in Washington for the games industry and they just hired a brand new president  and one of his goals is to try to get people back on board for E3. The next year you're going to  have the launch of or probably the launch of the PlayStation 5, launch of Xbox Scarlett. So chances  are good that I think by the time this new ESA president starts working with the publishers and  the publishers start to realize hey we need to launch these platforms next year. I have a feeling  they'll probably be back for E3 2020. It did feel empty though. It really was striking.  Tuesday was really bad. Usually the way E3 goes is Tuesday is the busiest day and then it slowly  tapers off by Thursday. This year Tuesday was the worst day and then Wednesday was okay. Thursday  was strong in the morning but by the afternoon it was like a ghost town. So attendance was down  about 2,000 people this year which isn't a huge slide but you're starting to see the trend now  we're starting to go down so something has to be done. And Shane I'm sure you remember many years

Start time: 540.32
End time: 550.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  barely being able to walk through the aisles and being bombarded on all sides by cacophony and  spectacle of all kinds. And that was before they let the public in. Keep in mind that was

Start time: 550.50
End time: 555.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  still just industry and now they're letting the public into the show and it's smaller than it

Start time: 555.38
End time: 580.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  used to be. There's two halls two main halls used to be three now there's two and even those I feel  like they could have gotten by with one. There's easily 30 to 40 feet up of perimeter now that's  just not used and it was easy to walk through the the the walkways and there was a lot less to see  in each hall. It really felt markedly different to me this year. The ESA is incentivized to fix it

Start time: 581.06
End time: 639.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because it generates over 80 percent of its annual revenue from E3 alone and that's part of the rub  is that the ESA relies on that money to operate all year long and so it ends up gouging the  publishers for floor space. Like I've heard that you know just for the floor space for a medium-sized  booth there it's like five million dollars for the three days. But the problem is it's hard for the  ESA to lower that entrance fee because that's where all its money comes from. So it's kind of a catch  22 but the bottom line is the ESA is going to have to work with the industry like it or not this is  the biggest game show of the year worldwide as far as importance and where people tune in to see  things. It also has the farthest reach as far as more commercial outlets because stuff happens in  gaming every day of the year but it's only E3 where you get the USA Today's and the YAHOOs and  everything reporting on it. So something has to be done to save it and I just hope that the publishers  are willing to work with the ESA to try to find a better alternative going forward. I mean I think

Start time: 639.82
End time: 707.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the publishers are finding that they don't need a show. That they can disintermediate their message,  they can do things like what Nintendo has been doing with Nintendo Direct. Now Sony is doing  the same thing where they're just instead of standing on a stage in front of a bunch of media  they just package things together put it out on YouTube or on any other streaming site  anytime they want rather than conforming to a schedule of when a show is. I think you make  a good point about the mainstream media taking note during these time periods but there certainly  doesn't need to be a show floor or the millions of dollars these companies spend to to do that.  We've already seen companies like Apple and Samsung you know not have to rely on things like CES to  get their message out. I think that's the trend and where all of these things are going is the  companies go we don't we don't need the media and we don't need a show to package everybody  together. In fact we'd prefer to have the spotlight solely on us and make our own event that we can  make perfect and not have to do it live in front of an audience anyway. Yeah I think if you look

Start time: 707.68
End time: 755.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  at it though Sony announced the initial specs for PlayStation 5 about a month before E3 got no  mainstream coverage whatsoever. Xbox announces the first specs for Scarlett on stage at E3.  It's on the front page of CNN so there's a lot of weight behind that and you know you talk about  particular games there are some games that don't need mainstream exposure because even if they get  it it's not going to really make a difference but if you think about taking a game that sells  six million copies into the realm of selling 12 million you do need that more casual audience  to be informed about the game. So it's not a perfect science but I think it'll be better  for the industry overall if it unites and they all come back to E3 and we create that spectacle  again that you and I are both familiar with. Some conferences are surviving I mean that's what

Start time: 755.24
End time: 766.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  happened to Comdex the old PC conference nobody needed to go to that anymore but CES thrives.  Was Computex pretty busy Sherlyn? Were there a lot of companies and people there? Computex was certainly

Start time: 766.28
End time: 933.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  more interesting than years past actually so I'm surprised that this is kind of going against the  trend that you guys have rightly pointed out. I mean you know just look at last year what happened  was in October every company did their own thing and so people who were in the consumer tech industry  like myself and some of my peers we were just stressed to death in October because we had  Google we had Apple we had Samsung everyone just announced thing after thing after thing then we  had the review season then we had the like it's just a bit much. I mean like yes the companies  will have the luxury of doing everything on their own schedule and they stay away from shows  but for us as a lean team or if you're someone that's trying to do all of this on your own it's  nearly it will drive you to your near grave. As for Computex it was it was really pretty cool to see  actually there was a lot of chip news I think that chip news dominated Computex and chip news is  important because that drives a lot of the rest of the news for the rest of the year in PCs and  PC gaming in console gaming even you talk about ray tracing that Nvidia pushed out I think it was  you know I can't remember if it was a Computex but one one similar show like that that Nvidia  first showed off something like that and then ray tracing is now making its way to Project Scarlett  and also I mean yes the PS5 you know specs didn't get a lot of mainstream media coverage but we got  a lot of coverage in tech right so we covered it Wired I think you know had that full interview  all of our other publications in the space also covered it people went wild for it the the PlayStation  spec stuff and so yes ray tracing is also in the PlayStation 5. To you guys's point though I agree  that there's so much more benefit for us as journalists or as you know people working in media  for everything to be concentrated around a fixed period of time just because it gives us  the opportunity to focus all of our resources on that event during that one period of time  because otherwise if it's spread out across like the rest of the year I am torn in a million  directions all the time and not everything is going to get the focus or the attention it deserves  whereas like a smaller company or like a mid-range company say like a MediaTek for example I don't  want to like call out anyone to whatever but in chip in the chip industry MediaTek isn't like an  Intel or an ARM or an AMD right so but their news gets covered at Computex because we have people  you know on hand to handle Computex related news whereas somewhere else like at some other part of  the year they might not have gotten the attention perhaps that we you know that they could have been  afforded so I think there's benefits for like the not so big players to still come to the shows and  maybe those are the companies that need to rally yeah I think they don't have any money

Start time: 934.80
End time: 975.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's what yeah it's expensive yeah you can those with the in the game space those smaller games can  draft behind the larger games and get a lot of that attention I think you make a great point  Sherlyn it's it is and Shane was saying this earlier as well it by having your resources because  you're going to draw eyeballs on your coverage of the big splashy games you also get to cover a  whole bunch of games and all of our inboxes are you know full of all of these PR companies trying  to get you to notice the smaller stuff and I I always make a point to try to you know surface a  lot of that at these at these shows as well because that is a time for those games to get noticed

Start time: 976.10
End time: 1019.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and shine alongside the heavy hitters it feels like gaming is something unique sui generous it's  not like any other business we've seen in technology before and it's kind of ironic  because Computex is all about what some might even say is a dying industry certainly not a  growing industry the pc industry and gaming is about a growing industry but nobody seems to care  to go to the trade show there's one thing for sure though the gaming fan conferences are bigger than  ever and they're more of them than ever and PAX West is already sold out and the comic cons are  going huge it seems like for for the fans those shows are very successful yes they're getting

Start time: 1020.06
End time: 1039.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  more access than ever I mean it kind of started with gamescom in Germany which is the biggest  game show in Europe they started letting fans in almost immediately when they started that show  and it's I mean as far as size is concerned it's the biggest game show in the world it's  dwarfs e3 as far as general attendance is concerned is it similar it's I mean one of

Start time: 1039.50
End time: 1043.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the other problems I have with e3 is it just seems to be mostly game trailers for games that

Start time: 1043.84
End time: 1064.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  won't be coming out for a year you brought you bring up a really good point and this is something  that changed at e3 2019 is that there aren't many games being played at e3 anymore and a lot of that  is the result of fans scrutinizing live gameplay demos and and skewering publishers on social media

Start time: 1065.58
End time: 1076.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  basically intimidating them out of the there's no upside to showing gameplay early and then they get  criticized for not showing any gameplay it's it's a damned if you do damned if you don't kind of

Transcript:  like there are a lot of there are a lot of middle-aged trolls out there but I don't know I mean  one thing we do know is that the image people have of gamers as being 14 year old boys is  completely wrong right it's a bunch of middle-aged guys like like you guys and you know even even

Start time: 1157.18
End time: 1194.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the label is unimportant I hate that label personally I try to never say the word gamer  I hate it because it is this stereotype that I've lived my whole life with that I've fought to like  get rid of so when I'll be on a three-hour podcast I'll never say the word gamer once  I go on podcast all the time I'm just saying like it is a negative stereotype and I feel like it's  people who are serious about games it's something we've been trying to shed for a really long time  so I don't want to say I ignore it but well but I'm not going to see Pokemon Go coverage on sifted  oh yeah you will really oh yeah Pokemon Go page on sifted there's like 8 000 pieces of content for

Start time: 1224.96
End time: 1268.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the people who play Call of Duty when they're out and about they pull out their phone  and they play games and it wasn't always that way there was a lot of pushback initially from  quote unquote hardcore gamers on mobile gaming but as the games have gotten better the technology  has gotten better people absolutely core gamers play mobile games and you're starting to see  publishers who typically play in the console space making really good mobile games Nintendo  and Bethesda and I will say that those tend to be the games and from the publishers that hardcore  gamers gravitate towards like they're more likely to play a Bethesda mobile game than a mobile game  from King say but the fact is they're playing mobile games they're contributing to that ecosystem  and they're helping generate revenue for mobile gaming King makes and the big just for just an

End time: 1339.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right one of the I think one of the biggest takeaways for me from this E3 is how those  lines are going to disappear because if you had a I had to define what E3 2019 was about for me  it was this the beginning of the streaming revolution in games I mean we've already seen  it start this is really where it's coming into its own with Stadia with what Xbox is doing with  Game Pass and how the barrier to entry on being a quote unquote gamer or hardcore gamer or whatever  silly label we have to use that is going to completely disappear and we're going to you're  going to be able to play any game on any device at any time all the time and you won't have to buy a  box to put under your television and you won't have to invest 400 to start it'll be instantaneous  on devices you already have with things you already own and it will be like just loading candy crush  on your phone but it will be these bigger more quote unquote hardcore experiences and all of I  think all of those labels will start to just morph into one another and it won't make any difference

Start time: 1339.96
End time: 1359.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and I think it'll eliminate the tribalism that's in gaming like fanboys you know when you don't  have a piece of hardware to cheer for and everyone's just playing on this thing that they don't even see  and it's just beaming to their cell phone or their tablet or their tv I think it'll take away a lot  of the negative elements that have been a part of the games industry for a long time well all I know

Transcript:  along yeah sure sure that was our plan yeah so there's no question gaming is huge there's also  no question it's a very unusual business because I guess it's kind of like Hollywood a little bit  Hollywood has fans in a bunch of different genres and it serves those fans it's very expensive to  make a major motion picture it's very expensive to make a game it's a little longer to make a game  takes more people maybe but there's there is that the closest industry is the is the is the movie

Transcript:  well the dollar signs are so big you know it's it's hard you have to ensure that there is an  audience for this thing because you're spending so much money on it as the thing is taking shape  and that's the the real tough thing to square you know it is it is difficult for this industry  to figure out ways to promise things when the people making the game aren't sure that they're  going to pull off those promises and it's just a fact of game design well Duke Nukem forever is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you have to buy the game there's no well they're they're they're messaging at the event was  perplexing to me because the thing about stadia is you don't have to buy anything oh you don't  need the 130 dollar founders back yes you don't need the 9.99 monthly fee they have a free none  of that is required to yeah none of that is required to use stadia in fact you probably  already have everything you need to just buy a game and play it if you want to play it in 4k  at 60 frames per second yeah you need that 9.99 fee and if you want to stream it on your television  you're going to need a chromecast so they're going to sell you that and if you want to use  their controller you got to buy their controller but it supports all the controllers you probably  already own and it and if you have anything that can load chrome onto it you can probably  already do it so what they should have said how they should have led that event in my opinion  is hey this is a way for anybody to play triple a games right now with the stuff you already own  all you got to do is buy the game and you can play it but if you want to play it in all these  other ways if you want a rotating selections of games that will be free if you want to do it at  4k we offer these other options that will sell you as part of this founders pack as part of a  monthly subscription that does sort of compete with game pass on a certain level although the  details remain to be revealed but all those things are additive to what the core selling point in my  opinion of what stadia is which is no barrier of entry no need for a console you can just play it  in chrome on the stuff you already have yeah and that's where i think they fumbled the ball because  like you most people didn't come away understanding that you know did does it play well

Transcript:  gaming on every device everywhere all the time yes i think it's going to take a while though before  streaming takes over um i agree with everything jeff said he's right it's inevitable it's going  to happen is it going to happen the next three or four years i don't know there's a lot of gamers  most people would call core gamers who have already rejected streaming and stadia because it's so in a  lot of cases just because it's not a nintendo console or it's not a playstation console and then  and again jeff was also right that the messaging coming out was not great because a lot of people  looked at that announcement and did the math and was like wait a minute so i could pay for my  playstation 5 or my xbox 2 or whatever they ended up calling it and have something and that would  within two years of playing for stadia i could actually own the console instead of owning  nothing so console players are stubborn it's hard to get them to move in a direction and get the  whole herd going but i think more casual players are probably going to be there going to be enough  of them to keep it afloat hopefully until the more hardcore players start migrating over and i'm in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but there was no vr at e3 this year there was no vr at c.e.s either well no there was an oculus had  a booth but let me explain because i know jeff is a huge proponent of vr so let me state my point  first and then you can follow up i've been going to e3 for 20 some years i've gone the last six  or seven years for the last four or five years every booth you went to had this little roped  off area outside it where that publisher would be showing its token vr game in a lot of ways that  was to try to get people into the booth to check out their other stuff all that is gone now like  we just did our best of e3 awards yesterday and finding like a really good vr game wasn't that  tough but finding one that anyone has actually heard of was almost impossible in fact the game  that i picked a game called pistol whip my co-host had never even heard of the game like just got  announced at e3 it was announced just announced but i mean look we're we're hardcore like we follow  games i mean we use sifted and if you don't if you're not hardcore you would look at sifted and  be like this is insane but we've both been proponents of vr but i don't think there's  any denying jeff that at the show this year it was the least represented ever since it kind of

Transcript:  things about it my colleague davin dur review did and he is really bullish about it i my biggest  experience with vr is at you know film festivals try back up because they're all so big on vr there  and the sense i'm getting is that really for for the for the near future for the short term  vr is going to be good as like a location-based experience and so like when i went to vegas for  example i oh like they had like vr experiences vr arcades that you could go and visit while you're  i guess not losing your money at the slots and you know people are drawn to some of these experiences  for now just to kind of check it out but as technology progresses and as these headsets  get better like the oculus quest and i'm hoping it's future generations you know i don't think  every household will have a vr headset but i i think it'll be start becoming more common and  yeah perhaps now is in the time we're seeing a lot of hope and excitement for vr but i think i'm with  jeff here in that like i am still hopeful that vr gaming is going to be so like the future because

Transcript:  no loading times yeah well that's true it bumps up the speed quite a lot right the interstitial time  i think for the the spider-man game that they demoed on the ps5 was just 10 times faster or  something which for a gamer could be like a huge difference um one point about amd by the way i  don't know that it's just deals i think yes there's a lot of them i think that amd has made a lot of  improvements in his graphics cards lately and you know that might be i mean not that  not that like it's it's the only i mean the rtx stuff is in there if i'm not wrong right i'm  not like fully caught up on what else yeah that's the idea is that there will be rtx and ray tracing

End time: 3336.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's an amazing thing right it's a it's a it's a little bit deeper than that this was explained  to me by somebody who said that you know their games are very expensive to make and they're very  time consuming to make and one of the things that's expensive and time consuming is building  out these scenes where you have to fake all of the lighting you have to tell the engine to put  lighting here and here and here to make it look realistic and what ray tracing will let you do  is not have to fake it right is just make a scene and then say here's where light comes from and it  does all the rest for you it computes it instead of you having to you know say formulate all that  and trick the the systems into creating something that's realistic it's just behaving like actual  light which could conceivably make the production of games easier production easier it's a resource

Transcript:  mean you could have a virtual concert in fortnight actually oh and probably make more money make more  money than you would if you did a real concert at a stadium so it's just opening up all kinds  of avenues to bring other pop culture into the industry and i think it's good overall because  it's if someone just downloads fortnight to go watch a concert of some pop star and then maybe  they start playing fortnight and then they're like hey i kind of like this and then maybe they  buy a console and then they start buying other games so you know when stuff like that acts as  a trojan horse a lot of hardcore gamers are reluctant i think it's great because it's always

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  happened already has it we're seeing we're seeing that that there was a time when video games started  where it was a bunch of technical people who created video games yeah because you had to be  technical to program a video game and interface with a computer and make it do what you wanted  it to do in those days one person wrote a whole game right or a couple of people in the garage  right but it was technical people and with technical people that were trying to create  art and i what you're seeing is happening now with unity being ostensibly free and incredibly  powerful and very easy to use that these tools are being put in the hands of artists who aren't  technical people writers designers yes and they're able to to use this medium to express their art  without having the technical know how to do it because the tools are so intuitive and easy to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  in the idea of controlled leaks i think that people believe it and power to you if you think  that is the case i think we've been accused of being controlled leaks before and because that's  not the case i am like against that very notion like people think that you know apple has reporters  in his pocket maybe it does i don't know i don't know everything that goes on in this world but a  lot of us are not in any company's pocket and like it is actually borderline offensive when  people say that but i agree with you yeah but when people say controlled leaks i mean yeah if you're  talking about pr stud if you're talking about marketing stunt that comes through its own  channels that's different when you're accusing a publication of being a mouthpiece for a site you  got to be very careful about like what you're saying here i think because i don't know again  maybe some sites do do it but there are legitimate publications that refuse to and  you know that's just that's not what we do and having but if but but i mean sometimes people

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that's a good source that doesn't mean you're yeah and we're still but the thing is here's the  difference of a controlled leak versus a publication that's covering something that a source came to you  with right if it's a controlled leak you're not gonna like you're gonna say whatever the company  told you to say maybe but if it you got a good source from the apple and like assembly line you  get the case you get whatever the news is and then you make your own judgment about a whether  it's newsworthy even if enough to publish b what your take on it is is it verify your like your  source with your source really credible like there's a lot of steps journalistically to prove  these things and that's not a controlled leak i don't believe in that so but certainly there

End time: 4897.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's not sure i agree with you no i mean i have a no repudely i mean you look at a lot of magazines  they get a cover story even in gaming they'll get a cover story on a game and they're the first ones  who get to play it they're the first ones who get access to it and now that most magazines have a  digital element of their business all that stuff goes on youtube and they get the exclusive on all  that information before anyone else so it's not out of the ordinary you wouldn't do that though  who me they would never give it to us our publication isn't big enough yeah

Start time: 4899.24
End time: 4904.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 4910.86
End time: 4931.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  i mean it's a conflict basically if you're still no if you're still exercising your journalistic  like integrity in what your reporting is like if something is bad call it out for being bad  you're exclusive if it's all sunshine and roses then there's suspicion of like is this really a  journalistic piece or is a pr and that's kind of where the line is right i never have to worry

Start time: 4931.90
End time: 4944.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  i mean i guess politics does it so maybe maybe tech does it beltway journalism that's the phrase  yeah it just seems odd to me that someone sitting in a room trying to promote a product would go  here's what we do we don't point people to our channels right we point them to other people's  channels and give those other people's channels this cool tidbit of new i just don't i don't i

Start time: 4966.54
End time: 4983.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  mean i feel like it worked out they're not going to report it the way you want it i mean yeah yeah  you can say you have a deal or whatever but ultimately the journalist is the one who has  to type up that that article in that report and publish it so there's there's some wiggle room  in there for you to not get for things to not work out exactly how you hope for them to do that's

Start time: 4983.48
End time: 5056.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  right that's why there's like things like briefings and embargo briefings and stuff like that before  launch because you know a company like say samsung or google or whoever wants to  make sure the messaging gets out correctly and like you know reporting from a live event is  very different from having been briefed about it a few days ago because there you have time to  process you have time to be like all right let's fact check let's check out what the predecessor  specs were let's do all these comparison things that i can use to make my article much more like  reliable and much more useful for my reader whereas like live from the event and the bustle  of like a hands-on show floor yeah i can do all those things but am i going to get every single  piece of like information right from like a convention floor it's harder to do that it  would take longer so then the end result is not as nice and so for the company sometimes they see  that benefit it's i don't like i mean like i get how it can come off shady and it can come off like  a collusion sometimes especially when like a company just hand picks who the hell they want to  like brief and that frustrates me a lot because we don't always get briefed so it is it is something  that i've had to like work out my personal struggle it is it's very challenging and i

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  feel fortunate that i i don't have to deal with that and i've always kept pr at arms length as  much as possible i don't accept review units generally and stuff like that just because  i don't want not only the appearance of collusion i just don't want the pressure from these guys i  don't want to i don't they don't know my number i don't want to hear from them if we you know and  i basically uh free ride on you charlaine and i i let and gadget do all the work and then i just  read your stories out loud he gives them your number i call charlaine and then i'll do the  commentary that's why i get all the pr call it's commentary that's it uh well you mentioned okay so  you said how good the pixel three phone camera is um and then the chat room some of the people in  chat are saying well what about the huawei what about the mate 20 pro which is an excellent camera

End time: 5146.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  i'm gonna ask everybody but let's start with you charlaine what's your take on what's going on with  huawei is it really a national security threat or is this a trade war against huawei i they just  announced they're not going to ship the uh matebook now at all yeah yeah which is a little bit of a

Start time: 5161.48
End time: 5191.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  probably be number one they're number two without the u.s yes which is like huge um so where i stand  in terms of whether it's a national security ban or whether it's a national security threat  versus a trade war thing i think it's a bit of both i think that there are things about huawei  that are suspicious um and they have done sneaky stuff in the past like steal stuff from t-mobile  and just not been very upfront and and things that i hear off the grapevine yes but there's a

Start time: 5191.14
End time: 5213.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  difference between lousy slimy industry practices which are is fairly widespread and you know i mean  yeah father robert told me that he'd see huawei guys go around at the end of the conference taking  pictures of other people's logic boards and things like that okay but there's a big difference  seeing that and national security national security and chinese government spying and things like that

Start time: 5214.58
End time: 5234.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  i think that i i honestly don't know if they have actually installed backdoors on their chips or  modems or processors and there's any evidence that they have there's no evidence yeah if there was we  wouldn't be in the situation we are in if there was evidence we would be done with this situation  right we would be in court like all these going yeah yeah and then of course there's always the

Transcript:  potential because they are a chinese company and any company that's operating out of china  is legally bound if the chinese government asks them to do things like that although i i think  the chinese government might think twice about submarining one of its most successful companies

Start time: 5251.86
End time: 5280.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you know i have very little that you know knowledge of what's going on in their chinese  operations just i just know that it's suspicious i do think that a lot of this is unwarranted  but you know i know that there's a lot of people out there watching or listening to this that are  going to have their own doubts and they can't be dissuaded in any way so i honestly don't think  that huawei's claims of being able to sell their phones in the u.s making them the world's number  one is that valid because there's people whose confidence is shot already and they're just not

Start time: 5315.30
End time: 5349.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  sad thing yeah that's what happens to credibility yeah when you make stuff up pretty soon even if  you're telling the truth nobody knows whether to believe it or not crying wolf yep yep crying wolf  i feel bad because i do feel like huawei's phones and huawei's laptops are very very good and i think  i would i have a p20 i would have loved to but i had somebody call me said well i have a huawei  phone should i get rid of it and i said well i guess so because unless google changes its policy  in three months you won't get security patches and no one should use an android phone that's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  getting security patches i i mean again i was like out of i was on vacation for like a week but i  thought they flip-flopped that decision and then i said three months so now it's three months okay  so but what my cousin has a huawei friend he asked me about it he was like well am i okay and i said  you're gonna be fine because a well you're all your apps are gonna be able to run your third  party apps anyway if you rely on google's apps you're gonna be in a difficult situation  huawei's gonna push out his own mobile os what by like fall or sooner than we expected i remember  and you know even though huawei's not the best software player they're you know they've surprised  me so far with their hardware so i wouldn't be like too you know harsh on them or or or expecting  too little from them at this point i think i am bullish on them i think they'll do  better than i expected i do think there's some form there is a turnaround somewhere like i  i don't see that this is it for for huawei in the u.s and it would be a shame if for the like  you're to your point the mate 20 pro to back to that chat room conversation seriously the imaging  on that phone is really great the reason the pixel 3.1 in the end was it was just a much simpler  interface to use in addition to being like great at processing images nowadays phones are so good

Transcript:  right yeah it is interesting to see i just saw an apple ad yesterday i guess it was  maybe it was day before on the playoffs uh where the apple had a padlock on it that locked and then  it turned into the apple logo and apple's really doubling down on this notion that while we make a  safe private secure phone those other guys may not was this an evidence supports that i mean
