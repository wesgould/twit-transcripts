Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well we've could fortunately come a long way and maybe it's time to reelect  Brianna Wu in the message I'm just saying I'm just saying yeah yeah we  actually we were talking before the show because we dance kind of jokingly said I  don't you know I don't want to state anything about my politics but you do in  fact I think all three of you are not hiding your political slant one way or  the other but the New York Times published what has become a somewhat  controversial letter this is from Dean Basquette their executive actually I  don't know if they published it well they did it's in the New York Times so  they did new social media guidelines we believe that to remain the world's best  news organization we have to maintain a vibrant presence on social media but we  also need make sure we're engaging responsibly in social media in line with  the values of our newsroom so they've updated their guidelines is this  something every media outlet should adopt for instance our journalists must  not express partisan opinions promote political views endorse candidates make  offensive comments or do anything that undercuts the Giants Times  journalistic reputation I guess if you're tweeting as a Times reporter

Start time: 467.46
End time: 491.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's not unreasonable that's why they have columnist though and that's why  they keep their columnist separate from their journalists the columnist can  express all kinds of opinions and that's their job and I think that line gets  blurred a lot in people's minds because a lot of digital writers are columnist or  they express opinions and then they also do reporting they're kind of like in  this hybrid rule but at old-school places like the Times the line is very

Start time: 491.94
End time: 519.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  clear and new-school places like ESPN but we'll get to that in a second we  could we consider this is the one that I think some people bridle that we  consider all social media activity by our journalists to come under this  policy you may think your Facebook page Twitter feed Instagram snapchat or other  social media accounts are private zones and separate from your role at the Times  but everything we post are like is to some degree public what do you think Dan

Start time: 519.80
End time: 590.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is that an appropriate concern? Yeah whether you know whether Bacay needs to  to write this and articulate it or not although maybe it is important for for  the reasons Aaron's just mentioned that often particularly in this age of social  media it's easy to conflate opinion with fact and a place like the Times is often  under attack for being liberal or leaning left and for him to say these are  what our policies are maybe that helps create a little more transparency and in  their operations I would say just as a journalist I love CBSI and nobody tells  me what to think or what to write but I don't express opinions like we we've just  talked about in the pre-show I don't express opinions publicly because it  undermines my work I can't report on politics it's like it like writing about  the iPhone and Android and saying you have a preference you know it undermines  the faith and confidence readers have and whether somebody wants to believe in  me it's not about me and the story is not about me the story is about the story  and if I make it about my political opinions it undermines not just faith in  me but faith and confidence in the story and we need that now more than ever.

Start time: 590.78
End time: 628.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Boy that is so old school. One thing I noticed that Mike Isaac who I think  everyone you know knows his Twitter presence, very opinionated and like and just like kind of  silly and jokey and extremely active on Twitter and he tweeted something that I  thought was I think pretty smart which is that everyone at the Times was are  pretty much already acting this way but now this is just kind of codifying it and  so people at the Times doesn't even the most outrageous tweeters aren't upset  about it they they kind of know what what Dan just articulated which is that  like if they want to be taken seriously they have to be careful about what they

Start time: 628.64
End time: 667.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  put out there. It's not at all inappropriate but what's interesting is  how important social media has become and how difficult this is because you  know presumably Times journalists have Facebook accounts for the same reason  other people do to keep track of family and friends and if you have a you might  assume your snapchat posts are not part of your public persona but I but that  that's how Dean wants to treat I guess it makes sense Mike Mike I don't know if  this is a response to this or not but he did tweet on Friday I am gonna tweet  some great stuff tonight. Can you see how he spelt tweet?

Start time: 669.74
End time: 756.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's great that's great that's the most Mike Isaac tweet of all. Something I found a lot of people  don't know this about me before I went into engineering I actually majored in  journalism I worked as an investigative journalism journalist for many years I  think it's a great background for a politician something I found when I was  trying to write stories I'll give the example I was writing a story in  Mississippi about a landlord that didn't want to pay to clean up a toxic waste  spill in the middle of their apartment complex and you had literal residents  they're sitting there like all camped around green goo and like they've got  hives on their bodies and I remember like trying to write this story and my  editor going well you're not being objective to the landlord you're not  being objective and it was you know for me personally I I think this is why I  make a better politician than a journalist because I do have a point of  view and I can't hide that so I think like I I like that the New York Times is  holding their reporters to the highest standard possible I just privately I'm  not convinced that you know journalistic objectivity really really  exists you know we called it the view from nowhere in school like kind of  pretending like there is no objective truth here and you don't have a  perspective as you're gathering facts I am I just not convinced it's really there

Start time: 756.26
End time: 785.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  privately but I don't think that that is the pretense here I think that that's a  pretense that's foisted on a lot of reporters I think the the pretense is  exactly what the K articulated which is I as a reporter will approach stories  fairly and honestly and I will do my best in that just like anybody who goes  to their job your job is to do the best job you possibly can so I don't think  it's that everything is gonna be black and white objective I think it is that I  will do my best to be as fair as possible to the story and the subjects

Start time: 785.26
End time: 826.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in the story I think one one thing people were criticizing was that this  is gonna force reporters to do this kind of false equivalency thing that is  yeah a lot of news stories like many varieties of and also the other thing is  I don't know you follow many people from the Wall Street Journal but they have  the strictest social media policy of any place that I've that I've heard where  they can't even tweet stories that aren't from the Wall Street Journal and  as a result their Twitter feeds are at least I'm not totally sure on this but  I'm pretty sure that's still the policy and a lot of their feeds are pretty  boring because they don't really get to comment on stuff that isn't that isn't

Start time: 827.00
End time: 943.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in the journal yeah it's a Twitter is such a challenge for everybody in so  many ways I know Brianna you've been attacked viciously on Twitter yeah  during Gamergate our president uses Twitter in all sorts of interesting and  unusual ways Rose McGowan you know of course this the big the most recent  kerfuffle on Twitter immediately eclipsing the Times was that Rose McGowan  the actress Rose McGowan who was doing a tweet storm about men in Hollywood got  kicked off Twitter her whole account was banned because according to Twitter she  doxed somebody she put out a private phone number in a tweet but they don't  have the capability of blocking a tweet or deleting a tweet so they had to  delete her account and then as a result on Friday there was a boycott women are  supposed to boycott Twitter and then there's it Twitter just seems to be a  natural place for upset outrage it's it's difficult and now Jack Dorsey says  we're gonna have new rules on late Friday said we're gonna have new rules  on how many times this headline it could run every six months new rules on hate  harassment in response to the boycott which at least he responded to he says  we're gonna have a crackdown on unwanted sexual advances hate symbols  non-consensual nudity violent groups tweets that glorify violence starting in  just a few weeks which means I guess all of that stuff is currently unblocked and  and on Twitter what so let me ask Brianna because Brianna you I'm sure  you have a strong opinion about how Twitter is often misused to attack  people is it well sure what is Twitter to do well I think I'd like to back up

Start time: 943.96
End time: 1056.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for a second here and say you know I've never been suspended from Twitter  because I don't find it hard to not threaten people or dox people or use  violent language and you know I I'm very disappointed that a lot of people  on the left were kind of boxed into defending you know this private doxing I  mean it really put me in what felt like an unfair situation I don't think you  boycotted on Friday I I thought about it at first I said no and I had some people  come to me privately and say please boycott and I said okay fine I will do  it I can use 24 hours off of Twitter it's actually a great feeling yeah I  was great I got a lot of stuff done professionally that day I I have said  this a thousand times Leo and I want to say it again Twitter has never gotten  the credit it deserves for what they've done on their platform they have  largely gotten rid of their harassment bot problem as recently as a year ago  there were harassment bots that were targeting me and other journalists they  would just tweet the same doxing thing a hundred a thousand times then it would  tweet it everyone you interacted with they finally got that problem solved I  do see the number of the responsiveness they have to death threats I do see that  going down but I think overall the trajectory of the company is addressing  this like look at the feature where you know at the bottom of a tweet it will  say show additional replies some of which may be offensive you know this is  a really good feature because it blocks most of the garbage and I have never  seen Twitter get the credit it deserves for that there's a lot more work to go  but I really wish we could change the conversation a bit more to Facebook or  Reddit both of which dox people much more freely than Twitter does here's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jack's tweet storm we see voices being silenced on Twitter every day we've been  working to counteract this for the past two years it sounds like you agree  Brianna yeah others don't but we prioritize this in 2016 we updated our  policies increased the size of our teams it wasn't enough others might agree oh  okay you're right you've been doing it but it hasn't been enough in 2017 we made  it our top priority and made it a lot of progress today we saw voices silencing  themselves and voices speaking out because we're still not doing enough  we've been working intensely over the past few months of focus today on making  some critical decisions where you've decided to take a more aggressive stance  on our rules and how we enforce them these changes will start rolling out in  the next few weeks more to share next week that seems like actually the best  response I've heard from Twitter in some time at least public response I mean I

Start time: 1104.60
End time: 1109.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wish you didn't say at least he didn't say we have to do better that's the

Start time: 1110.28
End time: 1154.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  stock phrase yeah got tired yeah biz used to serve every say that all the  time I have famously apologized how long ago was that I mean that's exactly what  he said we've got to do better and then but it's also a challenge I was  sympathetic because as Alex Stamos the CSO of Facebook said you guys this is  hard stuff if you want to have you want to have a free platform people could  freely express themselves somebody I read an article that said it was the  Arab Spring that really spoiled Twitter because that's when they got in their  minds look we can be used to change the world if we let people have free  speech on Twitter there's a real social value to that and and at least and they

Start time: 1154.88
End time: 1173.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  were so naive that they never considered that there's also people out there who  are going to exploit that in a negative way they never like I mean it's just  sort of that Silicon Valley magical thinking where they never even occurred  to them they just like you only see good coming out of their creation and it's

Start time: 1173.90
End time: 1247.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  very very convenient that all of the social companies including Google  figured out Russian hampering tampering and bots after the 2016  election not while it was going on in fact we reached out to Twitter about  some of these harassment bots and about the growth of their bots and they said  oh we have a we're a public company we have an incentive to kill all bots in  the platform in fact at Tech Republic we covered the rise of bots and just we  just covered each presidential candidate and downloaded the Twitter API and put  it in Excel and you can see an inflation of bots through the campaign so if  Twitter wants us to believe this nonsense now yeah you guys can be sorry  but you had a huge profit incentive not to be sorry when it mattered would you  include Google and Facebook in that yes absolutely I mean I I believe that these  companies say they have a moral core but these are for-profit public companies I  don't believe that they're inherently evil but I do believe that they expect  us that we're either stupid or naive that we didn't see this happening a long  time ago or that they didn't see this happening a long time ago yes exactly

Start time: 1250.22
End time: 1253.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well they didn't care because they had strict that's strong financial incentives

Start time: 1253.92
End time: 1320.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  not to care yes precisely so something we did my studios I spent a lot of time  picking apart these bots and doing a lot of independent research on Twitter and  harassment bots and please understand when talking about harassment bots I am  differentiating a bot that is written to target and Doc somebody like me versus  like the political propaganda bot that's a different problem I can say from my  looking at the data which could be incomplete but this is just a partial  look at it what I see is like you say a stat like in nine-tenths of all  political opinions came from bots and that sounds really scary but then you  start looking at the reach of the bots and who's following these bots and it's  it's not as great like there's a really big difference if I tweet something you  know with 70,000 followers versus somebody tweets it with like 10  followers who's also a robot so you know I'm not saying one way or the other I'm  saying I'm unconvinced about what the impact is of that and I'd like to look

Start time: 1320.28
End time: 1341.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  into it deeper yeah one of the tactical things that the bots intended to do was  knowing precisely that and of course on Facebook and Google the echo is  significantly larger on Twitter of course right who's gonna follow the  account with three tweets and no profile picture but what they tried to do  tactically was raise trends in that left-hand column and you can see that

Start time: 1341.96
End time: 1451.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  repeatedly so yeah it's controversial but I'll let you guys yell at me and  talk me out of it of course I think it's I think you can acknowledge that the  Russians probably directly or indirectly at the instruction of Vladimir Putin  decided to not necessarily throw the election perhaps throw the election  perhaps just sow seeds of discord but decided to really kind of roil the  waters in the United States and they did that using social media it's easy  particularly easy to do that with Twitter Facebook and buying ads on Google  since it's an automated process I think we could stipulate that that happened we  now we know that that happened what I'm not sure I'm willing to stipulate is its  effect is how strong and effect it had I'm not convinced that for instance that  got Donald Trump elected I think there were many factors that got him elected  and it delegitimizes some of the legitimate reasons he got elected it's  a it's a it's you know it's it's a fun thing for people who aren't happy with  the results of the election to and by the way I include myself in that group  but I'm gonna try to be objective here it's a fun thing people who aren't  happy with results the election to say oh well it's it's all Russia's fault but  I'm not convinced that that's the case and I think if it delegitimizes what may  have been real reasons for that to have happened so talk me out of that tell me  why tell me it's a it's illegal and it's and it's something that the even the  founding fathers were concerned about for a foreign nation to interfere with  our elections that's that's a fact I think that I do I say this is somebody

Start time: 1451.40
End time: 1487.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  go ahead Brianna and then Erin yeah sorry I didn't I didn't mean to what I  would say is somebody that's actually making like ads and putting them out  there if you saw the list of FEC requirements I have to follow it is  bananas like it is down to the font you put in the bottom of the you know they're  like I'm Brianna Wu and I approve this ad I do think that we need to have a  serious talk about you know if I put a television ad on that is regulated in so  many different ways wire ads on Twitter and Facebook and Google not regulated in  the same way I think they should be and face bobbing long and hard year for

End time: 1540.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  got we let us grow I think it's also important to differentiate that yes we  we need to make sure that we don't marginalize or undermine the other  causes of any particular election or the previous one but that we do say you know  we're having a conversation about the role technology played and will continue  to play and this is a significant one it's really important to make sure we  understand the mechanics of this so that we don't overshoot it with over  regulation or undershoot it and and not take it serious is it solvable can you

Start time: 1540.22
End time: 1558.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  know we got a social media solvable well that's my exactly so 2020 we've got  another presidential election by 2020 that's a pretty long time frame that's  three years next year and this does well next year is 2018 and Brianna is gonna  be in that election but let's give you three years is it possible to say there

Transcript:  will be no Russian interference oh no well the the ad problem is easy to solve  like with disclosures and more transparency no more dark ads and like  you said that maybe didn't have the same size of impact as the fake news problem  which is much I think harder to solve and a lot bigger and probably had a

Start time: 1580.32
End time: 1602.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  outsize effect on the election my my feeling again talk me out of it is that  fake news only worked with people who had already made up their minds people  chose the news they wanted to believe you can say well that's factually untrue  the Pope did not endorse Donald Trump that isn't really germane I don't think  that convinced anybody it only reinforced what people already believe

Transcript:  Access Hollywood tape comes out okay okay and and it's it's pretty easy to  correlate this you can go to L2 political they scrape I've never seen a  company that has better data than L2 does and you can see I don't think the  2016 election is in their database yet but you can see correlate where there  were news items in Facebook and particular counties and how they voted  and their demographics and and so it's not like it's not impossible to answer

Start time: 1635.56
End time: 1671.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this question it's also the case that due to the electoral college in the way  our president's elections work you didn't have to sway many votes you  nearly had to sway 77,000 votes in key districts and I agree that there are  lots of questions about how that was done where how they knew which  districts to sway there's a lot there's a lot more about this but hmm I also I  also think you could make the case that I mean it was very complicated there  were many reasons why the election happened the way it did and I hate for  a number of reasons for Twitter Facebook and Google to become the scapegoats for

Start time: 1671.46
End time: 1695.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that here's my cynical response to that which is that because they are so  aggressively arguing that it was very small it was it was like it was it was  just a blip compared to the amount of content that's on Facebook it makes it  makes me not believe them and it makes me want to look into the impact a lot  more that just because that is their response it makes me think like there's

Transcript:  I could have one more thing onto this something we did is we went through all  my mentions that happened during the Democratic primary and I don't think  this is talking about it talked about enough so we're seeing a really big  division the Democratic Party between the Bernie wing and the Hillary wing we  went back through that and looked at you know this phenomenon of Bernie Bros and  where it came from and when we really studied in my mentions the the you know  mentions that were the most hostile or you know had personal attacks or even  doxed me a lot of those were coming from bots and you know I personally believe  they were coming from Russian bots so I think that this is a bigger problem with  the like voting for one candidate I think that Russia is very artificially  trying to keep us at each other's threats I mean it's it's so easy to get  us so angry at each other and attacking each other like they win when we're  divided it's not even a Republican versus Democrat thing it's about keeping

Transcript:  update and there's also you know stingrays are less common here although  they will become more common as hardware goes the hardware costs go down  and you know stingrays you don't think about this but it's hardware that can  pull encryption keys right off of your phone so explain explain what a stingray  is before you yeah so a stingray is a is a a it's a device that transmits fake  signals and you can connect so a fake T-Mobile fake AT&T fake Verizon and your  phone is configured to just connect to a network so especially when you go  overseas and you kind of have different or weird networks you may be getting on  a stingray is designed and they have these at the White House they have these  at large sporting events but it's designed because they'll also fill the  air with noise and make it harder to connect but you can when you're  connected to a stingray the amount of data that a hacker that an attacker has  access to is significantly more zero-day would be the only way they could get  more data than connecting using a stingray and with iOS even with iOS many  of your encryption keys are exposed to a stingray through the cellular network  and with with Android there are simply more threat vectors there are more ways  that an attacker can get into your phone for all the reasons you guys and Leo  just enumerated there's just more threat vectors and people take security less  seriously on those devices so a stingray will just slurp that up federal agencies

Transcript:  data is just open Wow so here according to the ACLU are US law enforcement  agencies that use stingrays including the IRS FBI NSA Special Ops National  Guard US Army and local law enforcement as well in California for instance local  and state police have cell site simulators or stingrays let's see  Massachusetts local police have cell site stimulators you guys are in New  York State yes local and state police have cell site simulators so just just  to be aware now I'm less worried about frankly about law enforcement obviously  and much more worried about hackers but the whole thing it underscores the  insecurity of cell phones and here's a great post from Philip PN who's the co  founder Shotwell Labs he says want to see something crazy open this link on  your phone with Wi-Fi turned off I'm not gonna give it out but it is  essentially all the information that your carrier knows about you including  your home address phone number cell phone contract details and latitude and  longitude describing the current location of your cell phone and this is  information not only that they call AT&T calls it mobile identity API this is  there is an is on your cell phone an API that can be used to look up all of this  information telco providers offer this  cell phones are horrifically insecure US telcos appear according to this article  appear to be selling direct non-anonymized real-time access to  consumer telephone data to third-party services not just federal law  enforcement officials who are they'll then selling access to that data hey  it's a good way to make money so I it's a terrible it's a terrible way to make  money if you're AT&T it's a good way to make money  people this is that that'll be private and then of course we know that the the  radio baseband software in all cell phones and I don't know if Apple has  mitigated this or not but the baseband software is highly hackable and we've  seen that be abused now that takes some sophistication on the part of the  attacker but I don't think there's any credit any any doubt that attackers are  very sophisticated these days I don't know why did this get to be the bad news

Transcript:  show I would I would I would have to say about that like this is the first I'm  hearing about this so I'm talking about the top of my head but you know I think  that if you're talking about law enforcement using these techniques they  clearly need to go to court and get a search warrant right like warrantless  wiretaps I have no issue go before judge pretty probable cause I'm all for it I  will if I'm in Congress I'll give you everything you need for that but  warrantless wiretaps like it's very clearly unconstitutional and both  parties have done a lot to erode that as far as the AT&T thing you know  something I've looked into I've talked to a lot of lawyers about is if we  introduce liability into the equation and we say okay AT&T like clearly  Congress can't regulate how you should code your software because that's not  gonna go well but if you're reckless in how you're doing it and clearly an AP  I that anyone can access with that kind of information that strikes me as  reckless you know you should encrypt that you should have public keys private  keys whatever you need to do to secure that I would introduce liability into  the equation and if they happen to have an Equifax level event I think they

Transcript:  information Equifax story keeps getting worse by the way this time this was  discovered again by a secure thank God for security researchers and I agree with  you Brianna we really have to indemnify them because so so often now they get  they get prosecuted for pen testing for finding flaws and there's a huge  disincentive for them to reveal these flaws at this point because you don't  know how the company's gonna react Equifax has a page so awful Equifax this  is recent this they fixed it but it's still like a couple of days ago they had  a page you know where you go to dispute a line in your credit report on that  page there was a link that would prompt you to download a phony flash player  phony flash player and that put spammed you with ads and Equifax's defense was  well we didn't do it was a third party that we put on the website and then and  then by the way I just saw today another firms doing the same was it  Experian TransUnion TransUnion was doing the same thing these thank you

Transcript:  it's a non-starter in the United States actually Aaron because we're paranoid  and a lot of the problems that we have in the United States come from our  national identity there's a new book which I just downloaded for an audible  about how since day one in the United States we have always believed in fake  news in we conspiracy theories this is part of our national identity it comes  from our notion that the individual is supreme and that everybody's entitled to  their own opinion and beliefs and it's one of the things that keeps this  because what it would be identified immediately as a national ID card and  there are many many people in the United States who are basically paranoid who  say no not gonna happen and it is a nonce I could tell you right now it's a  non-starter in Congress all you have to do is a national ID and that's it it's  over it's not going anywhere here's a country that has it Estonia they in  fact I anybody in the world can get one of these and I was in Estonia and I  meant to do it I didn't get around to it they have a national state issued  digital ID card that has on it a 2048 bit public key on a chip you have a card  it is your national health insurance card it's your proof identification when  logging into bank accounts it's your digital signature you use it to vote  check medical records submit tax claims get prescriptions it and they make one  available a similar card available to anybody in the world and this is  brilliant it's exactly what you just described and the reason is a non-starter  I think and I won't I'll vote for you Brianna again and again I won't stop you  but I do know that this is one of those hot button issue I know that you know I  know this I've worked in AM talk radio long enough yeah this is a hot button  issue for some reason I spent five years yeah Dan it's like it's the equivalent

Transcript:  most people aren't gonna do that I mean but you could start even if it wasn't  like a federal ID card that's the place that's the place you start the  discussion but then you go okay so in in exchange for not coming down really  heavily regulating like Equifax and companies like that okay so can you  agree to use this standard can you agree that you know for you to open up new  accounts you need to use this standard I sometimes get frustrated when people say  X can't be done and because it's like the expectation that something can't be  done drives the whole conversation no no no it's a fair point like it's we  should be clear-eyed and realistic about this but I think like just because you  start a discussion at a certain point doesn't mean like look at one political  party in the United States they take the most extreme view and then you know even  when they get something in the middle it's a win and I think as far as  updating like you know cryptographic standards there has to be someone that's
