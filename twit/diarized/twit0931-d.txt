Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 421.57
End time: 460.53
Speaker: Nicole Wakelin
Transcript:  I have a Lincoln Corsair plug in hybrid.  Nice. Yeah. Do you like it?  Pants and pants car. I do. I like plug in hybrids.  I think they're the good happy medium.  If you're like afraid of EVs and you don't want to have a gas car.  And I like the Lincoln's all fancy.  They have an adjustable seat.  And there's a separate thing for each of your thighs.  Like you want your left side to be higher than your right side.  You can pick. Who does that?  Each thigh has its own seat.  It each has its own little, little, little adjustable thing.  So your thigh support can be like, I want my right leg  like a centimeter higher than my left leg.  I don't I play with them like this just feels weird.  Put in the same.

Start time: 461.10
End time: 464.50
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  No, nobody has a symmetrical body.  So you have to have asymmetrical.

Start time: 464.62
End time: 474.47
Speaker: Nicole Wakelin
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess. But how?  I've never seen a car with separate thigh seats before.  It's like separate.  So while you need to go find yourself a Lincoln Corsair plug in hybrid  and then I think so.

Start time: 475.18
End time: 484.36
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And yeah, if you're in New Hampshire and it's cold,  I think a plug in hybrid probably is a good idea  because your range varies with the temperature.  And this way, you know, you're not going to get stranded.

Start time: 485.02
End time: 493.37
Speaker: Nicole Wakelin
Transcript:  Right. And it does.  Even with that, I can see it come way down as soon as it's chilly out.  But it's not a big deal because there's that gas engine is back up.  So you don't have a panic attack.

Start time: 500.46
End time: 503.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's that seems like the downside of being an auto journalist.

Start time: 504.98
End time: 519.04
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  Actually, I all of us really love the Maverick.  It is like it is actually the perfect truck for most people.  OK, most most people do not belong in a full size pickup.  You know, they want something to also mulch every once in a while.

Start time: 519.48
End time: 532.97
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I see people downtown San Francisco  driving an eight foot tall four wheel truck with a snorkel.  And I'm thinking, dude, you're going to work and back from Daly City.  What do you do?

Start time: 533.52
End time: 538.33
Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  It's crazy. What if they drive into the bay by accident?  That's true. Cover another.  That's true.

Start time: 539.24
End time: 542.56
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the Mavericks is a little truck if you want to just, you know,  bring some antiques.

Start time: 543.06
End time: 566.29
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  Yeah, little compact truck.  It's got a big enough bed for most of the stuff you're ever going to want to do.  It's got room for room in the cab for four people.  And you can get really ridiculously cheap.  The base Maverick now starts at twenty two thousand dollars for a hybrid.  That gets 40 miles per gallon. Wow.  See, that's my next door neighbors have one. They love it.  It's smart. Yeah, smart.

Start time: 567.34
End time: 574.22
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Robbie, somebody in our chat room, Igor, says that your next band  should be called Thigh Support, which I think is probably true.

Start time: 578.96

Transcript:  Now, I saved the best for last. Robbie, what are you driving?

Start time: 583.14
End time: 598.18
Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  Am I the best or is the car the best?  You're the best baby. Yeah.  I am driving a Lamborghini Huracan Technica.  Oh, which is it's pretty much just like the the the Lincoln, you know, Corsair.

Start time: 599.00
End time: 600.76
Speaker: Nicole Wakelin
Transcript:  Exactly the same. There's almost no difference.

Start time: 600.80
End time: 604.82
Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  No difference. They both have steering wheels.  They both have four wheels and tires.

Start time: 605.14
End time: 609.16
Speaker: Nicole Wakelin
Transcript:  Do you have yours have thigh support? Yeah.  That's no, no, it doesn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Lime green. What color is it?

Start time: 614.12
End time: 628.54
Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  It's a it's a matte gray. Oh, it's it's which is nice  because I can hide it between my two cars in my in my driveway when people drive by.  So they're not like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What's going on in the house?  Are you having a midlife crisis or what?

Start time: 629.04
End time: 636.20
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  I mean, if you got to park your Lamborghini outside in the driveway,  you definitely want something that's not going to attract too much attention.

Start time: 636.20
End time: 662.56
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's probably that's the auto writers special color.  Yeah. Neutro gray.  So while there are many car stories and we will get to those a little bit  because I got the wheelbarrings folks here, I think probably  there are two big stories the week that have nothing to do with automotive  technology. One is Apple's WWDC was on Monday  and they finally announced the Mac Pro.  No, no. Well, actually, they did finally announce Mac Pro.

Start time: 662.94
End time: 665.86
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  But nobody paid any giant case with a little Mac mini.

Start time: 665.88
End time: 719.18
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a big Mac mini base.  But they announced their nerd goggles.  They call it the Vision Pro.  The operating system is the Vision OS,  although we had heard, you know, all these wild trademarks that they were  including I think everybody thought it was going to be XR OS.  And it turns out in one of the reality, OS, a reality.  One of the breakouts, actually, all the slides said XR OS  and the and the presenter said XR.  So that must have been the internal code name.  But Vision OS is the final name.  And we and you know, the bottom line, which you probably already know,  because, you know, everybody's been talking about it is it's thirty five  hundred dollars and it won't be available till early next year.  In other words, it's it's a ways off.  But I would be interested in your thoughts.  Nicole, why don't you kick it off?  I know this isn't your normal beat, but I know.

Start time: 719.32
End time: 725.07
Speaker: Nicole Wakelin
Transcript:  OK, so I look at this and the first thing I see are like goggles for like going  when you're skiing.  They look like ski goggles.

Start time: 725.44
End time: 726.98
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They look like ski goggles. You're right.

Start time: 727.04
End time: 734.63
Speaker: Nicole Wakelin
Transcript:  That's what they look like, which I would never want to wear  unless I was actually skiing, because I feel like they'd be weird,  like intrusive.

Start time: 735.32
End time: 739.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That is kind of the test is like, would you wear ski goggles around the house  or in right?

Start time: 740.34
End time: 752.92
Speaker: Nicole Wakelin
Transcript:  I don't generally generally when I'm not skiing.  They are not out in the snow. I don't wear ski goggles.  I mean, like really, they're gay, they're cool and nerdy.  But thirty five hundred dollars for fancy ski goggles is not going to be my thing.

Start time: 752.98
End time: 756.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And one thing ski goggles don't have is a wire off the back to a battery in your butt.

Start time: 757.58
End time: 760.12
Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  And really, they start the battery.

Start time: 760.28
End time: 763.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, where you put it, you can put it anywhere you want.

Start time: 764.02
End time: 767.00
Speaker: Nicole Wakelin
Transcript:  You put it in your pocket.  I don't remember that in the presentation.

Start time: 769.20
End time: 771.12
Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  Remember that portion of the presentation at all.

Start time: 772.42
End time: 836.45
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, the wire always goes behind.  I don't know why.  I guess they just they want you to have it back there somewhere in your in your hip pocket.  But then the other thing that your goggles don't want you to get your hands tangled up in it.  Oh, that's why. Sure.  OK, that makes sense. It's like a tail.  And the other thing and I swear to God, I think this is creepy is these eyes  in the front. They're weird.  I keep fake eyes.  Yeah, I just don't like them.  They're using lenticular screens.  So when they record your eyes  or when they model your eyes, because these aren't this isn't exactly a picture of your eyes.  They have cameras facing you, but it is somehow modeled.  They record a variety of angles.  And then depending on how you're viewing these, you'll get a different up to 16 different  angles of these eyes.  And the eyes do mirror whether you're blinking or whatever else you do with your eyes.  They mirror that, but I don't think it's a direct image from your eyes.  I think it's generated somehow.

Start time: 837.08
End time: 862.16
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  So I think they I think they use the internal cameras to  track what you know, where you're looking and what your expression is.  And then replicate that in the screen and using those lenticular lenses,  try to make it look as if your eyes are actually back, like at the level of your face  rather than on the outer surface of the goggles.  Yes. There's this depth.  That would look even weirder.

Start time: 862.44
End time: 863.83
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's weird anyway.  Yeah.

Start time: 864.84
End time: 876.48
Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  I wonder if you end up with that like weird like 50 yard or a thousand yard stare  from like the Polar Express movies.  Yeah, it's uncanny valley.  Yeah.  Like you can't tell where the person is.  Look at how big that is in the back.

Start time: 876.52
End time: 880.00
Speaker: Nicole Wakelin
Transcript:  I didn't even catch it.  It's like not even like a thin it's this huge band in the back.

Start time: 880.04
End time: 886.62
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's so you don't get dense in your hair, I guess.  I don't know.  There's also and they never showed it, but there there is.

Start time: 886.96
End time: 888.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're trying to spread out the load.

Start time: 888.34
End time: 920.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, they're spreading out the load.  It's basically like separate thigh support.  Like one thigh, other thigh.  And then actually this would fit your thigh quite nicely.  And then there and they never showed it.  There's another strap that goes over the top, which a number of  optional on, for instance, the Oculus Pros to relieve some of the weight.  These weigh about a pound, I'm told, although Apple did not say.  But that's that's not an insignificant amount of weight.  If your ski goggles weighed a pound, you would not like them.

Start time: 920.60
End time: 931.04
Speaker: Nicole Wakelin
Transcript:  You would not like for your ski goal.  You want them to be as light as they possibly can be.  Yeah, this is this is there's another.  Like, I feel like it's not making me think of a CPAP machine  where it's like you're all strapped in.

Start time: 931.08
End time: 932.88
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, but you'll never snore again.

Start time: 963.72
End time: 973.73
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's OK, because there's a fan in there.  Apparently, Apple, again, is not revealing it, but there's there are openings.  They talk about cooling openings.  I think there has to be a fan in it.  But again, no one's.

Start time: 974.98
End time: 983.56
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  No, they've said there is definitely a fan in.  OK, all right. And the fan, I guess the intakes are on the bottom of the goggles.  And then it blows the hot air out the top.

Micah Sargent was there, Jason Snell, a number of our contributors.  I, of course, do not get invited to Apple events, but that's OK.  I didn't I didn't get to go.  But when they announced it and they started talking about it, as usual,  you know, you get a lot of oohs and ahs at these Apple events.  But then. They mentioned the price.  And let me let me play for you, because I have audio  of this, the reaction.  This is somebody tweeted this.

It was in that little itty bitty theater that they used to have.  That was bar none.  My favorite Apple event I've ever been to anything else after that didn't matter.  I didn't.

You've gone down to zero.  It would cut off your calls.  And Steve Jobs and his entire family were in Kona, Hawaii, a Kona village.  Vacationing when this came out.  And he was so pissed off.  He had to fly back and solve this problem.  And you remember what his reaction was.  You're holding it wrong.

Transcript:  Because they used to be able to use to be able to see the signal on the phone.  You can put it in a diagnostic mode and see the signal on the phone.  You could see when you held it.  But what was funny is I had some people bring over some Android phones  and I put those in diagnostic mode.  You could see the signal on the phone.  You could do the same thing.  All phones, pretty much your hand.  All phones did the exact same thing.  As soon as you grabbed it, you could see the signal go down.  They're like, oh, we're just horrible, horrible.  Apple's other solution.

Transcript:  Anyway, the tech press in general was fairly fawning over the Vision Pro  when it came out and absolutely the people who got to put them on,  the special few, the proud, the, you know, the several hundred journalists  and YouTubers who got to put them on.  But I and I knew there would be a certain amount of because I've seen this before  with other VR headsets.  When you first wear these, they're like, wow, this is amazing.  There's the there's that walk the plank game where you can't step out on the plank  because you think you're going to die, except, you know, you're standing on your carpet.  But it's it you you go crazy.  And then five minutes later, reality sets in and you never wear them again.  They gather dust.  And I knew that this would happen with Apple, too.  There was this kind of wave of rhapsodic reporting.  And then now we're starting to see stories come out.  Like the Wired story.  Where Kate Nibs, I think that's how you pronounce it, K-N-I-B-B-S.  It could be Kate Knibs writes Apple's Vision Pro isn't the future.  The new mixed reality headset is an alarming misfire.  Has Apple lost its innovation mojo?  I I I am not bullish on this.  I I I don't have any.  You know, there's no consequences to me saying that, speaking the truth here.

So the eyes show when you can see the room and there is a little crown,  a digital crown, and you can say, I don't want to see the room.  And then your eyes turn into a plasma blob.  But if you're seeing the room, I think they want to show your eyes  because they want people to know you're looking.  So I don't think they're going to disable that.

Transcript:  There are realistic applications, like, for example, in a design studio.  The first time I tried VR goggles was actually in a Ford design studio.  And walking around a virtual model of a vehicle,  before you invest in building that thing,  being able to see all the pieces in in order, you know, in this 3D environment  actually works really well.  But I think those kinds of applications are few and far between.  And they're, you know, for for average people.  I mean, the idea of wearing these glasses all day and trying to type  and do my job in that kind of environment, it's just it's absurd.

Start time: 1572.96

Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  Yeah. But when I when Google Glass was first announced, I talked to an AR  researcher and his first thing was, we don't even really know what these are good for.  Beyond like industrial uses, like helping people, you know, fix things  because you can see through the glasses, you can see, oh, put this here, put this there.  I mean, it's wonderful for that.  Like if you go to a car and it says, hey, this is you need to take this bolt, this bolt,  this bolt and this bolt out, you're like, oh, that's great.  And you take them out.  But around town and.  I don't know.  I mean, technology is still really bulky.

And now the only people use them are like mall cops.  I feel like there's like a limited number of applications for things.  That's a good point. That's a good point.

Start time: 1618.64
End time: 1645.53
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There are some people who use segues.  I've a segue to me is a good example that it was widely lauded when it when it was introduced.  Remember, Bill Gates said it's going to change the way we design cities.  I mean, people thought this remember Project Ginger was going to change everything.  But then people got on them and they're nine feet tall  and they look pretty stupid riding them.  I know because we have two of them.  And the original thing you do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, there's more.  But wait. But I think that the dork factor was some of this.  And this is why I pay attention to the creepy eyes, because I think  and it's the same thing with glass.  There's a certain if people mock you when you're using a technology,  you pretty quickly put it aside.  Most normal people go, I don't want to be mocked.  And I think that's what happened to segue.  So we have we bought two of the original seven thousand dollar  segues and we had a lot of fun with them.  The kids loved them.  Our son, when he was about 12 and his other boyfriends  were jousting with them.  So they got, you know, pieces of old splinter wood

Start time: 1695.04
End time: 1702.87

Transcript:  Wow. I remember they were up here because they were based in New Hampshire.  Yeah. So there was where they were in the mill buildings,  say these old mill buildings, and they would you be like just walking  into the building to whatever business and like zoom, zoom, zoom segues  were everywhere. And I remember thinking I've almost been killed by these things  20 times. And I was like, look out, look out, look out.  I'm like, this is not going to make my life better.

And he had many of them and we all got to play with them.  But that was 20 years ago.  Anyway, that was a famous example of  something that has some real use and some merit.  You still see them in tours around the cities all the time.  You do. Yeah.

Start time: 1761.26
End time: 1818.56
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  Well, I think I think that, you know, the idea that they had around segues  changing the way cities are built, the that idea was actually directionally  correct, but it was ahead of its time.  And I think the segue itself in the form that they built it was the wrong vehicle,  because what we've seen in recent years is that same idea of changing the way  we move around cities, coming to us in the form of modern micro mobility,  you know, with electric scooters, e-bikes, things like that.  And, you know, particularly during the course of the pandemic, when  in the early days when there was very little traffic, we actually saw a lot of  cities use that opportunity to go in and install permanent protected  bike lanes and access lanes for bikes and scooters and so on.  So they weren't on the sidewalks.  And in fact, the the idea of changing the way cities are built,  it's still a good idea starting to come to fruition.

End time: 1855.70
Speaker: Nicole Wakelin
Transcript:  So that's is that what's going to happen?  That these Vision Goggles, Vision Pro with the idea is correct.  But what we're going to end up with is something that we're going to see in 20 years.

Start time: 1856.06
End time: 1866.20
Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  Something we've seen like from BMW, where it has augmented reality in the car,  where it like it can like the windshield is essentially augmented.  Yeah, that makes sense.  And it's like, oh, you need to go over here.  You need to go over here. I think that's the.

Start time: 1866.72
End time: 1914.76
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  Yeah, there's already augmented reality heads up displays in some cars  that, you know, traditional heads up displays display the information  in a single plane that looks like it's floating over the front edge of your hood.  You know, maybe four, three, four feet in front of you.  The these are HUDs actually are multi plane displays.  Mercedes has them in the S class and the EQS and some other models.  And it's coming to other vehicles.  You you actually see the information floating at multiple distances away from you.  So when you're driving down the road with navigation,  it actually looks like it's overlaying the directions right on the road.  Or arrows and everything.  Yeah, you have an arrow floating above the intersection where you're supposed to.  But it doesn't look like it's it's reflected off the windshield.

Start time: 1914.82
End time: 1916.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It actually looks like it's on the road.

Start time: 1916.70
End time: 1971.10
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like it's further out in the distance.  So the focal distance is is different.  And you see you see different bits of information  at different locations in your field of view, different distances.  So like the turning prompts look like they're floating over the intersection  and they're they're stuck there over that intersection.  So as you get closer, it looks like it's getting closer to you.  And says, here's where you're supposed to turn.  And I think that sort of thing actually really works.  And if if you can do that, you know, in something like,  you know, you talked about in the form of traditional eyeglasses,  you know, as opposed, you know, so it looks like you're just wearing glasses.  That I think, you know, that's going to be that's still a long ways away.  But it's interesting that you can get it today in an automobile.  Is that well, because it's a much larger device.  It's a big, heavy device.  Yeah, it's not something you can wear on your face.

Start time: 1971.28
End time: 1984.64
Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  And it's not to track your eyes in order for it to work correctly.  So in the Mercedes Benz, there's actually eye trackers in the dash.  They're tracking your eyes so that it'll it'll project the the the arrows  and the information to tell you to go left or right or whatever.

Start time: 1984.72
End time: 2010.80
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That kind of makes more sense.  That's that's a very good use of a are.  Also, the technology to shrink that down to your spectacles is not doesn't  I don't think even exists yet.  I mean, that's no, it doesn't.  Yeah. Yeah. But it does exist in cars.  It's funny that they're not getting more attention for that.  But Apple's getting all this attention for basically  what's a computer strapped to your forehead, which is not appealing.

Start time: 2011.00
End time: 2032.98
Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  Everyone's been waiting for Apple to do this.  Yeah. It's like the Apple car.  Like when the Apple car comes out, if or when it ever comes out,  it's going to be a huge deal.  Meanwhile, all these other automotive startups have been doing this.  And traditional automakers have been doing this.  And it's just it's because Apple, like, you know, the hype machine around Apple  and the fact that we've we've known that they've been working on it for years.

Start time: 2033.70
End time: 2074.44

Transcript:  Well, and plus, you know, Apple, you know, they they created the iPod,  the iPhone, the iPad.  And these were all devices that had been done before.  You know, we'd had MP3 players.  We had smartphones. We had tablet computers.  But when when Apple did it, you know, they they really executed it correctly.  And so the assumption was when they when Apple finally did  this headset, that it would be the one that finally breaks through  and gets and fixes all the problems with all the ones that came before.  And I don't think that they're there yet. No.  So I mean, I could be wrong because I've never obviously I've never  actually had one of these on my face. Right.  But I remain dubious.

Start time: 2075.56
End time: 2096.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm dubious as well, although maybe this the whole point of this.  You said something interesting, Robbie,  is to gather information about how it would be used  and what works and what doesn't work for an Apple car, for instance.  Maybe this is a a stealth product because they surely don't expect  to sell many at thirty five hundred bucks.

You know, I'm like trying to type and also the cats walking on something.  I'm like, what's going on? It's chaos.  But no, the cats there just can't see it because you got this thing on your face.  Also wearing this thing on your head for hours on end, like the Daft Punk thing.  We wear these helmets for the set list is about an hour and 20 minutes.

And then like one of my computers, my MacBook Air,  like my current MacBook Air, the resolution is so dense  that it was too dense for the monitor.  So the cursor was so tiny, I couldn't find it.  So I have to move the cursor up to the top right hand corner  and then slowly move it down to trigger the next section.  And I'm just like on stage and I'm freaking out.  I'm just like, oh, my God, this is going to this is the worst thing  is ever happened because you have to trigger it like at the right time.  You know, you have to keep time.  If you trigger the wrong time, it sounds weird and messes up.  You trigger the wrong section.  And then I would go back to my 2015 MacBook Air and it'd be fine  because, you know, the resolution density isn't as tight.

Nicole Wakeland, Roberto Baldwin.  And of course, Sam Abuelsamidbel Salmond.  We will have more with our fabulous crew.  I can see why this is I can see why your show is so good.  You guys are great.  We'll have more in just a bit.  But first, a word from our sponsor.  Decisions. I love the name. Decisions.  In today's digital landscape, businesses are faced with an overwhelming  number of tools and systems.  You got to have them right to operate effectively.  But managing all these disparate tools, ensuring they work together seamlessly,  that ends up being the biggest part of the job. Right.  That's where decisions is fantastic.  It can change your life.  Decisions is the ultimate orchestrator for IT  and industry experts, providing a unified platform for businesses  to manage their digital infrastructure by automating routine tasks  and customizing workflows.  Decisions helps businesses reduce operational costs,  improve customer service and streamline the overall process.  It's incredible.  You know, these days.  Business relies completely on digital technology, right?  But it's constantly changing.  Innovations happen on the fringe.  Adaptability, though, is critical to stay ahead of the game.  Decisions is a no code platform that allows both developers and business users.  You don't have to be a coder.  But people with the knowledge, you know, that they're trying to encapsulate  can build applications and automations.  No coding involved at all.  With decisions, your team can collaborate to build and adjust workflows.  You can do dynamic forms.  You can do decision making processes that fit your unique business needs.  I'll give you a really good example.  When Covid first started, remember the PPM loans?  The government decided we're going to lend money to industry  to keep those people employed.  And they did it very quickly.  And all of a sudden, banks were in the position to make those loans.  But it was a complicated process.  There's one bank, Use Decisions, to create an app on your iPhone  that allowed you, they did it within a few days of the PPM loans,  that allowed you to apply for a loan.  They got the lion's share PPM loans for the first few weeks  because they were the first people to market with it.  All because Decisions let them write that app  to write that code, write that website quickly and easily with no code at all.  Decisions has a very powerful workflow engine.  You can define your own rules.  Of course, they've got integrations  that let you connect any legacy system via an API.  Otis Elevators has thousands of elevators all over the world.  And they all have different systems running them.  You know, it's not just one big unified platform.  They were able to use Decisions to create, again, no code,  a system to check every elevator in the world every single day.  Couldn't have done it without Decisions.  A simple drag and drop visual interface designer,  the person who has the knowledge domain is able to create the tool.  And that is very powerful.  Knowledgeer does this.  They manage portfolios and investment activity for family accounting offices,  investment firms, complicated digital landscape,  lots of inputs, lots of knowledge flowing around.  With Decisions, they could completely integrate.  They set it up so that Knowledgeer could pull data from any database  communicate with every system and application in the process  and create a simplified, unified view.  A pain-free solution to managing their portfolios,  to streamlining operations, to improving their customer experience.  That puts them ahead in the financial industry.  There are so many great stories.  If you go to the website, decisions.com slash twit,  look at some of the case studies,  look at some of the people who are using Decisions.  You'll see what an amazing, amazing tool it is.  Decisions, you'll see what an amazing thing Decisions can be.

We thank them so much for their support.  This Week in Tech and our Wheel Bearings Takeover.  The other big story, I said there were two really big stories this week.  The other one I think affects us all.  And this is what's happening at Reddit.  I imagine you pay attention to this.  I'm a big Reddit user.  It all started when Reddit decided, first of all, it really all started.  The truth is it really all started when Reddit decided to go public, to do an IPO.  Reddit was purchased by Conde Nast.  They spun it out as a standalone company, but they still have the majority holder.  They decided to have an IPO.  And of course, the problem is Reddit's never made any money.  It's only lost money.  So before you do an IPO, you want to figure out a way, how can we show people  that we are going to make a nice, tidy profit?  Well, the first thing you do is you look over at Elon Musk.  What's he doing over at Twitter?  Maybe not the best idea, but anyway, that's what they did.  And they said, oh, look what Elon did.  He started charging for the API.  Started charging a lot for the API.  Reddit announced that all third party apps, anything that integrated with Reddit  that wasn't company property, would pay these fees.  Really the battle began when the creator of Apollo, which is an excellent iOS  third party app for Reddit, it's the one I use on my iPhone and iPad.  I love Apollo.  Christian Selig posted, hey, I've talked to Reddit about this API.  And based on my number of users, it's going to cost me $20 million a year  to continue to run Apollo.  He's since announced that June 30th, Apollo goes away.  It's gone.

Speaker: Roberto Baldwin

Start time: 2939.92
End time: 3039.98
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, what kind of fool are you?  Come on.  It's only $20 million.  Reddit is fun.  RIF also going away.  A number of third party apps have decided to go away.  A number of subreddits, the Reddit communities have announced they are going dark  starting tomorrow.  A little boycott.  One, iPhone says we're going dark forever.  Then CEO Steve Huffman says, let's have an AMA.  I can solve this.  Doesn't answer a lot of questions.  He's I think the last time I saw his karma was down below 100,000.  It's like, it's as bad as you can get.  The moderators of Slash R Videos wrote that Huffman's AMA performance was a  collage of inappropriate responses.  Goodness.  He also kind of implied that Selig, the creator of Apollo, was lying.  Selig said, you know, it just turns out I live in Canada, a one party country.  I recorded all our conversations, Steve, and he posted them and showed that in  fact Huffman was misrepresenting the conversation completely.  Huffman at that point in the AMA said, well, we're just not going to do business  with this Apollo guy.  There is a nasty battle, a Bruin.  And I wonder how this is going to affect Reddit.  Because I'll tell you what, I can get away with, I can lose Twitter.  Not happy about it, but I can lose Twitter.  I don't want to lose Reddit.  And it looks like it's almost as if users have finally realized, hey, you know what?  We have the power here.  What do you think, Sam?

Start time: 3042.88
End time: 3132.21
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  Obviously, Reddit does need to make money.  There is a cost associated with providing these APIs, just as Twitter and every  other company that does APIs like Google and Microsoft and Facebook and everybody  else, there's a cost associated with that.  And it's not unreasonable to charge some amount of money to cover those costs.  It's the way business works.  I don't know Reddit's financing.  I don't know how much it actually would cost them to provide these APIs.  But I'm guessing that it's a lot less than $20 million a year, at least for the amount  of hits that they would get from somebody like Apollo.  So like I said, I don't know what Reddit's financial, what their costs are.  But I think if there were a reasonable cost for access to those APIs, I think that would  be perfectly fair.  It's legitimate.  And if you're building your business on top of somebody else's platform, it's not unreasonable  to expect to be paid or to expect to pay some amount for access to that platform.  It's just a question of fairness.  How much is actually fair based on the real cost and what people are willing, what your  downstream customers are willing to pay?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When Reddit announced my initial reaction as well, at least they gave you notice.  Twitter just pulled the plug.  Yeah, very true.  One day everything just stopped working.  Stopped working.  And then they said, what are you talking about?  And then they said, oh no, these third party apps have broken our rules.  That's it. They broke our rules.  And then the creator of TapBot said, what are you talking about?  We've been doing this for 15 years.  What rules do we break?  And then Reddit said, these rules, the ones we just wrote.  I mean, not Reddit, Twitter said, these rules, the ones we just wrote.  It was just a nap.  It was terribly handled.  Right.  And so I thought, oh, Reddit, at least they announced it.  They gave you time.  You're right, Sam.  They have a right to make money on this if they're losing money.  And others, third parties, are making money.  Share in the proceeds.  Of course, 20 million is a little.  That's, I'm sure, more than Apollo makes.

Start time: 3189.00
End time: 3199.52
Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  It seems a bit disingenuous that it cost them 20 million to host,  you know, to have these APIs going for this one app.  I'm like, I think you would have collapsed years ago if that was the case.

Start time: 3199.74
End time: 3225.63
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that was Christian's point is, look, I understand.  I'm willing to give you some of my money.  But, you know, it's only you're asking for much, much more than it's costing you.  And if you know, well, and this is the thing that he then said, look,  if you say that I'm costing you 20 million, why don't you buy Apollo?  I'll sell it to you for 10 and you're going to make money.  You're going to make money.

Start time: 3226.34

Start time: 3230.02
End time: 3259.92
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  My guess is that, you know, Reddit doesn't see a whole lot of potential  revenue streams and they've got a lot of costs across a lot of different things  that they can't necessarily directly recover revenue on that.  And so they look at the APIs and say, well, that's one place where we can pull  in some money, you know, let's use that to cover the cost of all this other stuff  that we have to do.  And, you know, so anybody using those APIs is getting disproportionately  hit by those costs.

Start time: 3260.02
End time: 3288.42
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and remember, if you're using a third party app, you may not be seeing  the ads that Reddit posts on and Reddit, by the way, has apps.  They're not very good. That's why people use the third party apps.  And of course, they have a website where you would see the ads or you  as I do pay for Reddit so that I don't see the ads.  But I guess just like the Twitter third party apps, Reddit's feeling like, well,  you're you're hiding our ads.  So you're costing us money and you're not letting us recoup that money.

Start time: 3288.52
End time: 3310.26
Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  That's not I feel like there could have been a resolution that included ad share  revenue, you know, ad revenue sharing between the the the  the applications and Reddit.  I mean, there's a lot of ways that Reddit could have figured out how to do this.  But instead, they just went like full hammer, like, well, just like charged for  APIs because we saw that worked out so well for Twitter.

Speaker: Nicole Wakelin
Transcript:  It's such a weird choice.  Even if they do that, like isn't somewhere there's some being counter.  He's like, well, if we charge X and the break even, we'll lose these guys  if we go this high and we'll keep these guys if we go this low.  Like you feel like somebody should have crunched some numbers back there and said  20 million dollars is going to be unreasonable.  We will make absolutely nothing on that.  Like, it feels like somebody they forget to check with an account.  That's a good point.

Transcript:  You know, you priced it so high, you're not you lost the sale in effect.  It's a very good point.  Tomorrow, according to the BBC, 3500 subreddits will go dark.  Most for two days, although, as I said, are are slash iPhone and are slash music.  Two of the biggest subreddits are going to go dark, they say forever.  And there, you know, I think there's going to be some people that leave red.  The problem is there is really no good alternative.  It's not like Twitter, where there are lots of places you could go.  There is a Fed of dig.  Oh, no, never mind.  Dig the good dig.  Never.

Start time: 3372.52
End time: 3399.80
Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  Actually, reddits court is a copy dig, didn't it?  Yeah, I think this court is a place that a lot of people are going to start  ending up for some of these very niche communities because you can just start a  Discord server and you can have people on there.  And then if you're on Discord, you want a better experience, you can pay a little  bit more to get Nitro or you can pay, you know, so you have enough people on  your your your your community here paying for Nitro and then you're paying a  little extra so you can do more things with your community.

Start time: 3400.30

Transcript:  Yeah, Discord seems to have figured out a way to make money doing this, right?  Yeah.  Actually, that's what iPhones doing.  If they say if you go to the slash are slash iPhone, they'll say join our Reddit.  I mean, our Discord and here it is 12000 members now, 1687 people actually  actively online.  So maybe they have found an alternative.  But for me, I mean, so I'm a Reddit lurker.  I confess I don't contribute as much as I auto.  I've done AMAs and stuff, but mostly I'm a read only Reddit user.  I will. That's a big loss to lose the content on Reddit.  And it is and frankly, Reddit is so useful that a lot of people, instead of  searching Google, they search Reddit dot com for answers to questions like, you  know, what's the best car?  Right. What's the best D.V.?  It's a much better place to search than Google.

It's never you know, if you've ever worked at any website and you've known  anything about the analytics of that website, you know, the Twitter  traffic to your site is nothing.  It's really nothing. It's mostly just a place where everyone just goes and hangs  out and like, hey, look at this thing and five people look at it.

Start time: 3509.92

Transcript:  There is a Fediverse version of Reddit named Lemmy of all things.  I don't know if it's named after the bass player like the I don't know if it's  Motorhead. Yeah, I don't know if it's Lemmy or what I'm on.  So it's it's federated. This is the one I'm on Lemmy dot world, which is the  biggest instance right now.  It just it's like a few weeks old and they have if you go to the communities,  they have their slowly communities are their subreddits.  Basically, they're slowly creating a bunch of subreddits, but it's not it's  nowhere near the volume of traffic.  And ironically, because this all started because third party apps didn't want to  pay the API there as far as I know, no Lemmy third party iOS or Android apps.  There's no mobile apps.  So I don't know if Lemmy is going to be a reasonable alternative.  I just don't know. I don't think there's anywhere like Reddit in the world.

Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  There's a wealth of knowledge on there that's that's sadly going to be either  decimated or, you know, we're going to have it's going to disappear in five,  ten years because they've blown it over Reddit because they keep driving people  away and then they just delete everything or it's, you know, people are going to  get contributed to it anymore. So all the information, any any new information is  going to be contributed to all these other these other sites.  And so you sort of lose that one central spot where you can find out about, you  know, who played the dog in Gremlins and or, you know, how do I hard reset an  iPhone 11 or, you know, whatever people are looking for on Reddit.

If like there was one clear, like, well, instead of Reddit here, but there's  not, you have no idea what's going to take over for it.  So if there's a bunch of little things that pop up like Lemmy and other things  that are all sort of substitute Reddits in the time it takes to figure out which  one's going to win, you've got your information scattered all over the place.

Transcript:  I think the ownership is thinking, well, this, this too shall pass.  There've been a numerous revolts on Reddit in the past, but I also think, uh,  there's a lesson to be learned from Twitter that users are starting to  understand that they are the, they are the, they're what brings the value to  these social platforms without.

It's never been run well.  Um, you know, it's just run horribly, but the only reason Twitter exists and  Twitter has thrived is because of the people who are on Twitter, not because of  the corporate overlords.

I will never post again.  There are at least two major sub Reddits who are saying we're closing.  We're gone.  Um, I hope this isn't just, it feels a little, I can't decide.  Is it a temper tantrum by the users?  Are they feeling empowered by the social media spring and, and are they  revolting and maybe they're going to break something irreparably that  never will be recreate recreated.  Should we just put up with this?  I mean, honestly, uh, yeah, it's sad for Christian and other third party app  developers, but is that a, is that a good enough reason to, to abandon Reddit?  Something of such value.

Transcript:  Huffman is acting like, I don't care what you do.  We're going, this is happening.  He's not showing any flexibility.  I thought initially once he sees this reaction, he's going to back down.  They're going to adjust the pricing.  They're going to do something to keep Apollo and riff and all the apps going.  Somebody is saying in our IRC, and it's really true that, uh, if you, if you try  to use Reddit on mobile and the, you have to use a third party app because the  Reddit apps are terrible.  Uh, it's horrible.  Yeah.  On the web, right.  It's all right.  But you're like, no.  Yeah.  I won't.  Yeah.  Apollo is so much better.  I use Joey on Android.  It's so much better, uh, than the native Reddit apps, which are really terrible.  But I don't want to lose.  I'm, I don't want to lose Reddit.  I think this is a huge loss to the internet.

Now he of course has a board and he has, you know, Conde Nast breathing down his  throat and share other shareholders.  So he may not be free to do whatever he wants.  Christian Selig says he has 50,000 subscribers to Apollo.  So he would have to charge them a lot of money to make up 20 million, to make, to  make $20 million.

Somebody in the discord says, once you cut off your nose and spite your face, it's  kind of hard to put it back.  Um, and I, you know, but I don't think that either Steve or Christian can pray  that the Redditors will solve this.  So it's up to you, Steve, please, um, fix this, you know, you can still make money.  I understand why you need to make money.  Absolutely.  But you, you can't make that much money.  And by the way, you're going to kill the goose that like, make a little less.  You're going to, you're not going to make it.

Transcript:  Let me take a little break.  They're all going to find out the hard way.  Let's talk about Tesla.  Since you guys, I mean, you cover it.  Let's talk about Tesla.  Let's talk.  There's actually some Tesla news, quite a bit of it.  Um, when we come back with our wheel bearings takeover on this week in tech,  we're finally going to talk about cars.  How about that?  Woohoo.  Woohoo.  But first a word from zip recruiter.  Let's talk about jobs.  If you're a business owner, we, Lisa and I have this small business called  twit, uh, you know, it is hard when somebody leaves or you have jobs you  need to fill on average, it could take 11 weeks to hire for an open position.  That's 11 weeks where you're working double time, filling the hole that's  left behind by the, the empty position, but also doing all the work it takes  to hire somebody to fill it.  That's two and a half months down the tubes.  Do you have that time?  If you're listening, I've got some advice to you.  Do what we do.  Stop waiting and start using zip recruiter.  I have to tell you, it's always hard when an employee says, you know, I,  I got another job or I, you know, I'm going to go back to school or whatever.  We hate that.  We love our employees, but they've got a life to live.  And now we've got a job to fill.  What Lisa does is go to zip recruiter.  Uh, zip recruiter can help you find qualified candidates for  whatever role you have fast.  It's not just for podcasters, believe me.  And right now you can try it for free.  If you want zip recruiter.com slash.  Twit.  Usually it's breakfast.  Lisa says, all right, well, I got to fill this job.  Most recently, uh, Ashley and our continuity department decided to get a  job closer to home, such as never such a long commute.  Good for her.  But that meant we've got an empty seat in our continuity department.  We've really got to fill it.  Lisa posted on zip recruiter that morning for breakfast before lunch.  In fact, within an hour or two, I'm worried cause I'm going to all this  means more work for all.  Lisa says, Oh, look, here's a great, Oh, here's another great kid.  We had three or four great candidates before lunch.  How does it recruit do it?  Well, they use powerful matching technology to, they have more than a  million current resumes.  People come to zip recruiter looking for work.  They will go through those resumes and find the most qualified people for that role.  They know what you're looking for.  They say, Oh, look, here's three people that fit this role perfectly.  Now they don't invite them to apply.  They send them to you and you can look at them, check them out.  And if you like one or two, you can invite them to apply with one click.  There's just a button.  It says click.  Yeah.  Ask this person to apply.  And I got to tell you, when you ask somebody to apply for a job, they, they  respond quickly.  They're so flattered.  They go to the interview, they, they go through the process.  They, that's a great way to start a relationship with a new employee.  It works so well.  Four out of five employers who post on zip recruiter, get a qualified candidate  within the first day.  That's been our experience.  That's why we use zip recruiter.  That's how we got Viva.  That was great.  Cause we had three or four people to choose from.  We interviewed them.  The nice thing about zip recruiter, you might say, well, I don't know.  I don't want hundreds of people applying for my job.  I just need that one.  Don't worry.  They all go into the zip recruiter interface.  They reformat the resume so you can scan them quickly.  They give you screen questions.  Yes, no, true, false, multiple choice, even essay questions that make it very easy  to screen out people who just, you know, don't have the qualifications.  They allow you to put little tags on there like remote work.  Okay.  Or offering training that helps bring your, you know, your, your listing  top to the top for a lot of people.  Uh, and then you can quickly go through them.  You don't get emails.  You don't get phone calls.  It all goes in the zip recruiter interface and hire the right one fast.  It really is a system that works so well.  We've been very happy with it.  Speed up your hiring process with zip recruiter.  3.8 million businesses have come to zip recruiter for their hiring needs.  Just like us try it for free.  When you go to zip recruiter.com slash twit.  Zip recruiter.com slash TWIT.  Try it the next time you need to do some hiring, you will be blown away.  It is the smartest way to hire.  I will vouch for that.  Zip recruiter.com slash twit.  Thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  I mentioned, uh, uh, to Sam earlier, I think I actually told all of you, uh, you  know, I have a, I have the Maki with, with blue Cruz.  So it's, it's hands off in only in certain areas.  It goes, it goes blue and I don't have to have my hands on the wheel.  I really, I really liked that.  I mentioned earlier that I was, uh, I put down a deposit to pre-order the new  BMW i5, which comes out later this year.  They say on that you got that on.  And if you just look at the side mirrors, it'll change lanes for you.  And I thought, well, I'm not going to turn that on.  That's a terrible, terrible idea.  Uh, I remember what could possibly go wrong.  I think what they say is it'll only change lanes if, if, you know, there's  nobody behind you and you're being slowed down by traffic in front, like it's

Start time: 4495.44

Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  yeah, like currently, yeah, currently.  Um, if you, uh, you have to tap the turn signal stock, um, you know, left or right.  And then the sensors will check.  And if the adjacent lane in the direction you pointed is clear, then  it will execute the lane change.  Now it's doing that.

Uh, I did have the, the change lanes when you do the blinker on the, on the, on  the Model X, when I had a Tesla and it was a much more aggressive than I was.  It's supposed to wait till, you know, you have clear, it would change lanes in front  of a car that was a lot closer than I would have changed lanes.  Maybe it was safe.

I was just driving a Mach-E over the past week to test the new version of blue  cruise and it, it is, and the same thing goes for, um, the new Nissan Aria and  super cruise, they're all fairly conservative, you know, they're, they're  not going to try and squeeze into a little gap in the traffic, you know,  they'll wait until it's really genuinely clear.

Transcript:  I bring this up because the Washington post did a little data digging and came  up with kind of a scary headline, 17 fatalities, 736 crashes, the shocking  toll of Tesla's autopilot.  They say autopilot has been involved in far more crashes than previously reported.  Now they did that by digging into the NHTSA's data.  Do you, what do you, what do you think of this story?  Is this, should I, I guess, is it reliable?  And then is that a large number?  I guess I should ask.

Start time: 4635.20
End time: 4682.62
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  Um, yeah, it is reliable because what they're doing, um, last year or the  year before, um, the NHTSA, the national highway traffic safety administration  issued a standing general order, um, for all automakers and all companies  developing automated driving systems.  Any crash that occurs while the system is either active or if it's been active  within 30 seconds prior to the crash at any point in that phase, cause one of  the things that we've seen now that this has happened, now that this data is  available is that a lot of the Tesla crashes happen shortly after, uh, autopilot  decides to deactivate for whatever reason.  And the driver has not realized it and they thought it was active and it wasn't.  Right.  So that's interesting.

Start time: 4682.74
End time: 4698.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And, or you could deactivate it.  I mean, all of these systems, if it's starting to steer into a wall, you can  take the wheel, but maybe, maybe it's too late in this process.  Yeah.  There's a lot of things that can happen.  Contributory to a crash as well.  But you're saying,

Start time: 4698.00

Start time: 4718.22
End time: 4741.40
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  You know, I mean, all of these systems have limitations on where,  when and where they can function.  Right.  Yeah.  So there are certain, there are situations where the systems just can't function.  Like I'm sure if you've used Blue Cruise, you've noticed, you know, that there are  times when the system will ask you to put your hands back on the wheel.  Which is fine.  If you're, if you're going down the highway and it hits a curve that it can't,  doesn't think it can handle, it'll ask you to put your hands back on the wheel.

Start time: 4741.72
End time: 4753.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 4753.88
End time: 4790.80
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  But the key thing is that the vehicle has to make it really clear to the driver.  I need you to put your hands back on the wheel and take control now.  The Ford beeps loudly at me.  Yeah.  And this is one of the issues that, you know, with Tesla, it's not always obvious,  you know, when, you know, with their, their HMI, their human machine interface,  when the driver is actually supposed to take control or that it's changing modes.  And so a lot of drivers get confused because, you know, they think they're in  one mode when the vehicle has actually transitioned and they haven't taken back  control yet.  Yeah.  That's the thing.

Start time: 4790.86
End time: 4808.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, some of this might be human error, like, okay, you were driving along  and then the Tesla said, well, I can't keep driving.  So it's your turn, take over.  And you ignore that or you don't notice and it plows into something.  That's kind of more your fault, isn't it?

Start time: 4809.18
End time: 4856.44
Speaker: Roberto Baldwin
Transcript:  Well, it's my issue.  It's like, if you don't know, like if they're not like one of the things that's,  that's great about super cruise Mercedes and BMW is that on the steering wheel,  there are lights that tell you what mode you're in.  So it reduces mode confusion.  If you don't have any sort of like very just blatant warning that tells you,  Hey, you're not in this mode anymore.  You are in charge.  Then it's, it's whose fault is it?  Is it, is it, is it Tesla's fault?  Because they just built a bad system or is it your fault because you  didn't notice until it's too late?  How does the Tesla tell you that you're, it's like the guy who grabs the wheel  of your car and steers you towards the wall and then you, and then suddenly it  turns off and you have to grab the last minute and turn, is it your fault that  you ran into the wall because you didn't realize?

Start time: 4856.88
End time: 4878.38
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In that case, no, pretty clearly.  How does the Tesla, I don't even remember, how does it warn you?  I think it buzzes at you and bleeps.  I remember at one point, my Tesla said, I'm not going to, I'm not going to drive  anymore, you're, you're not paying attention and turned off and I couldn't  continue to use autopilot until I started a new ride.

Start time: 4879.86
End time: 5007.18
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  Yeah.  And, you know, especially on the, the model three and the model Y, which are,  you know, that's the vast majority of their volume.  Those vehicles don't have an instrument cluster in front of you.  They only have that center screen.  And, you know, the kind of the left-hand strip of that screen is where they have  control information, the rest of it is maps and audio interface and things like that.  And, you know, when I went for a drive and a friend's model three with their full  self-driving beta to try that out, you know, it had, you know, all it showed, you  know, there was a little icon of a steering wheel with hands, I think, in the  top left-hand corner, so it was kind of off in my peripheral vision, but it wasn't  particularly obvious when, when it wanted you to take control.  And I pretty sure it didn't make any sounds.  It might've made us a slight sound, but it was, it was not at all obvious.  And this has been one of my complaints.  You know, if you're going to have a system where, you know, any sort of  automated system where you expect somebody, a human to supervise, first of all,  that's a, I think a fundamentally problematic idea because humans are  terrible at supervising.  Especially when you call it autopilot.  That implies.  And if it works, if it works most of the time, you are going to get complacent.  That is a known reality of the way humans behave, which is why, as Robbie  mentioned, Tesla or GM and BMW and Mercedes and others use, you know, very  obvious interface devices like a light bar and the steering wheel, you know, or  you know, Nissan with their, their cluster and heads up display that completely  changes the color scheme is changing modes though.  You know, you need as an engineer, it's your responsibility to anticipate the way  things could go wrong and do everything reasonable, you know, to mitigate that,  you know, to mitigate the consequences of that, to try to, to try to avoid  anything bad happening when things inevitably do go wrong.  I remember this is where I think Tesla has done it wrong.

This was the first experience I had of this.  My Ford now has this monitoring my eyes and you made me, it wasn't easy.  You said, don't look at the road.  I said, I have to look at the road.  I'm it's driving.  He said, no, don't look at the road.  So I went like this.  I put my hands in front of my eyes, but I peeked and it, it shook the seat.  It buzzed.  It was like, wake up, wake up, wake up.  It was very aggressive.  And it, you know, it started ramped up and it got more and more aggressive  as I continue to peek through my eyes.  That was good.  That was a system that really did make me pay attention.  No question about it.

Transcript:  So let, let, uh, earlier today, when we recorded the new episode of wheel  bearings, we talked about, um, a story that came out, uh, the other day.  Um, money, uh, money, money.com, money magazine did a review of Tesla auto  insurance, uh, I don't know if you know, but a couple of years ago, Tesla actually  started selling their own auto insurance.  They're now in 12 states because a lot of insurance companies were charging  Tesla owners more for insurance than for other vehicles.  Um, and you know, that's because the cars are more expensive to repair.  Um, also that they had more claims.  Um, but one of the interesting details about the Tesla auto insurance, because  the vehicles are connected, they have access to all the data about how you drive.  Um, you know, most auto insurance, you know, every six months you get a bill  to pay for your insurance and, you know, at six months, you know, they may have  adjusted up or down, usually only up, but sometimes it goes down.

Transcript:  You know, what, what Tesla does is they have dynamic pricing so that they are  constantly monitoring your driving behavior and calculating a safety score  based on how hard you accelerate and brake and steer and so on.  Uh, and if you, if your safety score goes down the next month, your insurance  bill will go up and vice versa.  If it, if your score goes up, your insurance premium goes down.  One of the factors that they include is actually, um, your use of autopilot.  Uh, if you use autopilot, you will pay more for Tesla insurance.

I don't know if it was an expensive car because of the autopilot, but I have  a feeling it was the autopilot.  Um, so this is what the Washington Post analysis said.  Tesla's 17 fatal crashes revealed distinct patterns, the Post found.  Four involved a motorcycle.  That's, that's a quarter of them.  Another involved an emergency vehicle.  Ooh.  Meanwhile, some of Musk's decisions such as widely expanding the  availability of the features.  And we've talked about this a little bit, Sam stripping the vehicles of radar  sensors, he thinks that all you really need is cameras, you don't need LIDAR  or radar appear to have contributed to the reported uptick in incidents according  to experts who spoke with the Post.  Tesla and Neelon did not report, respond to a request for-

Transcript:  That's a tacit admission that maybe that was the wrong thing to do.  Whoops.  Whoops.  NHTSA said a report of a crash involving driver assistance does not of itself  imply that technology was the cause.  That's what we were just talking about.  Um, NHTSA does have an active investigation into Tesla autopilot,  including full self-driving.  NHTSA reminds the public that all advanced driver assistance systems require  the human driver to be in control and fully engaged in the driving task at all times.  All state laws-  Even when you're using full self-driving.  Yes, according to all state laws hold the human driver responsible for the  operation of their vehicles.  I don't care what you got going.  Is, so what do you think?  I mean, uh, seven fatal crashes.  That's pretty crazy.  Four of them with motorcycles, one of them with an emergency vehicle.  We've seen reports that sometimes, uh, Tesla's don't notice, uh,  fire trucks that are stopped.  Frequently.  Frequently.  Um, crashes involving Tesla's driver assistance system have grown,  but so is Tesla sales.  I wouldn't be surprised.  I can't decide if this is legitimate or, uh, uh, you know, kind of  over the top hit piece almost.  No, it is legitimate.

Transcript:  You know, the data from this standing general order, it's it, they,  they publish it.  You can download an Excel spreadsheet and they update it every month with, you  know, the new reports that have come in and all automakers are, are obligated  to submit their data.  Um, and you can go through and you can see how many crashes there have been,  you know, where level two or above systems were active.  And you compare the number of crashes with Tesla vehicles versus the population  of Tesla vehicles and the number of crashes with vehicles from other manufacturers.  And the, you know, the, the numbers are disproportionately Tesla, uh, in terms  of the number of crashes that, that those vehicles had now, it's also important.  You know, when you look at the, and you look through the, the data, you know,  the data in detail, which I have done as part of my job, um, you know, what you'll  also find is that, you know, because of the way the requirement was, uh, was  written, you know, any crash where the, where the driver assist system was active  at the time of the crash or up to 30 seconds before they, um, you know, they  have to submit it, even if that system had nothing to do with the crash.  So for example, in, in that data, there are two crashes involving Honda vehicles.  Um, they, I think the only two crashes, one of them involved, uh, the, the  vehicle, you know, was the driver was using the system, um, which technically  isn't even really a level two system and probably shouldn't have even been  reported, but Honda was being overly, um, aggressive, I would say in reporting,  uh, you know, not to leave anything out.  And in that particular instance, the, um, the vehicle was going through  intersection legally and was T-boned by somebody who ran a stop sign in the other  direction.  That's not the, that's not the fault of the system.  Right.  So if you look at the, the Tesla data, you know, it's not those kinds of crashes.  Uh, and the other reported 736 crashes under auto pilot.

Transcript:  The post says, uh, the enormous Gulf probably reflects wider deployment and use of  automation across Tesla's fleet of vehicles, as well as a right, wider range of  circumstances in which Tesla drivers are encouraged to use autopilot for one.  Uh, I can't use autopilot anywhere, but mapped highways in my Ford.  You can use it on city streets in a Tesla.  That seems problematic.

Start time: 5594.41
End time: 5639.40
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, it absolutely is.  Um, and you know, as you know, what you were saying, what Robbie was saying,  you know, the, the number of vehicles, excuse me, from Tesla and other  manufacturers that have these kinds of systems is not necessarily that different.  It's not like Tesla has dramatically more vehicles with autopilot on the road  than some of the other systems that would qualify under this regulation.  But, um, I think that Tesla drivers are far more likely to be using those systems  and because they are not restricted in any way, they're more likely to be using  them in system and scenarios where they probably shouldn't.  And then that's when you end up with more, um, with more crashes.

Start time: 5639.68
End time: 5661.10
Speaker: Nicole Wakelin
Transcript:  And I wonder about that because the, because so many Tesla folks are sort of,  you know, were early adopters of EVs and they're sort of people who are willing  to give tech a chance that maybe other people own, how many people have.  Self-driving stuff or not really self-driving driver assistance,  wherever you want to call it on their vehicles that are non-Tesla.  They're just like, I'm just not using that.  So it doesn't seem like there's as much happening because they  just don't use it as often.

Start time: 5694.86
End time: 5760.74
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  is another one of my complaints.  Yeah.  But, you know, as far as, you know, that five times fewer crashes, they are  almost certainly comparing, you know, their vehicles, which are the, like  80% of their vehicles, 90% of their vehicles are less than five years old.  They're comparing their vehicles to the entire population of 290 million  registered vehicles in the United States.  Yeah.  Most of which are much older and don't have these kinds of systems on them.  Um, because, you know, the average age of vehicles in the U S is 12 and a half years.  Those vehicles that are 12 and a half years and over, they don't have these  kinds of systems on them.  So they're comparing, if you were to compare, you know, Tesla, a premium  vehicle with, you know, a lot of stuff on it to only to other five years or  younger premium vehicles, you know, so you, you had, you had a real valid  comparison base, I, I would guess, uh, that the numbers are probably very, very  different and probably not better and, and very likely worse than the rest of  that population of vehicles.

By the time we get there, it's already left.  It's like, he took too long.  It's like, and then it, we hailed another one and it's like, no,  we got to walk another two blocks.  I think we walked like six blocks to hell, the stupid robot taxi.  So, and then they just kept going from there and nothing like horrific,  but just these like, this is not right.

I'm thinking what's happening.  Like how, what, what is it doing?  Where you just, at least it makes it feel a little bit like, you know,  you're driving that really nervous driver who either doesn't know what  they're doing or maybe you're, you're not from this town.  You have no idea where Elm street is and you're desperately trying to find Elm  street.  So you're driving like past every road and kind of pausing.

So if they hear a siren, you know, they're supposed to pull over and stop  just like just like we do.  Right.  And so there's, you know, it may have heard the sirens and it didn't know where it was.

Transcript:  But that's that's the issue with self-driving cars is that getting them to go from here to  here in a straight line where on a highway is easy.  But when you have the context of, you know, you've been driving a car for decades, you  understand, oh, I'm in an area.  Yes, there are sirens going on, but I definitely need to get out of this area.  I'm in the way or I'm doing this.  And the driverless car doesn't know that it doesn't understand that it doesn't understand  edge cases. And so you can keep throwing edge cases at it and keep throwing edge cases  at it. But still, it's a very it's it's very difficult for a car to react like a  human who understands the entire world and the context of what is happening in the  environment they're in at that moment.  Like that cruise had pulled up and there'd be a bunch of, let's say, sheep.  A bunch of sheep got out.  You would know, oh, OK, I can just sit here.  I wait till the sheep go by. There's a sheep herder or whatever.  Like, oh, this is fun. Let's shoot video.  The car doesn't know what's going on.  All it knows is there's a bunch of dogs and how it's completely confused.  It's just like little itty bitty things like, you know, someone throws a firework in  the road. The car doesn't know what's going on.  You know what's going on.  And so it's it's it's like all the edge cases is the reason why self-driving cars  are still, I mean, to be honest, pretty far out.  Yeah. In a way that we think that a self-driving car will be.  When you get in the car, it drives you from your house to your office without you  interacting at all.  I mean, surface streets, it means the highway.  That means, you know, with with construction zones, with weird traffic patterns like  that's still pretty far off.

And the amount of of like they have these super high, high quality GPS sensor that  tells you within like a few centimeters of where the vehicle is.  I mean, there's a lot that goes on to this vehicle, essentially.  So if you're stuck in traffic, if you're stuck in gridlock, you can do something  else. That's it. That's really what it's for.  The their their level three system is really for if you're stuck and you're not  going above a certain, you know, a certain speed, it's literally just like  I'm stuck in traffic.  I'm not getting off the freeway for the next 20, 30 minutes.  So I guess I'll watch a movie.  You could watch it. Also doesn't work at night or in the rain.  Oh, yeah. It also doesn't work at night in the rain.  And they're very like they're very forthcoming.  Like, yeah, there's sensors here just in the wheel wells, just in case the other  sensors don't know it's raining.  There's a moisture sensor in the wheel well.

Transcript:  Yeah, I just said usually, usually, you know, I want I want to address something  you mentioned earlier about how bad human drivers are.  Yeah. And granted, you know, 40,000 people a year dying on the roads in the U.S.  is a million worldwide.  I mean, it's terrible. Yeah.  And we absolutely need to do something about that.  But you actually you have to look at it from the other side as well.  You know, this is a classic case of tell me which side of the argument  you're on and I'll give you statistics to prove you're right.  You often hear 94 percent of crashes are caused by human error.  Well, that's only partly true.  Human error is a factor in those, but it's not it's almost never the only factor.  And when you consider how much we actually drive,  we drive in the U.S., we drive about three point two trillion miles a year.  Wow. That's trillion with a T.  Wow. And we have about six and a half million crashes.  So that works out to about one crash.  And this is not fatal crashes.  This is all crashes, you know, even fender benders.  But one crash every half a million miles.  If the average person drives 15000 miles a year, that's you're going to crash.  Your your odds of crashing are about once every 30 years.  That's about right. Yeah.  So, you know, that's that's actually a remarkably high threshold  or an automated system to overcome.  Yeah. And they have not done that yet.  Yeah. You know, one crash every every 30 years, every half a million miles.  We've still got a ways to go.  And that's that's those those human crashes under all conditions.  That's in blizzards and, you know, monsoons and dust storms.  And at night.  And that includes drunk drivers and everything else.  So, you know, it's actually really, really hard  to make an automated system that is better than a human driver.

It's amazing. There's all these lights and there's all these stop signs  and there's all these things that happen and there's construction  and people walking in the road.  And again, the sheep and all these things are going on.  And we just yeah, I'm doing my thing.  I always think that Michigan is dear.

And I'm thinking, you know, as impossible as it seems,  probably that's not that much different  from us driving around day to day in our we're just used to it.  That's all. Yeah.  And it's probably, you know, in the in the sometime in the future with flying cars.  I always thought we wouldn't have flying cars until we had full autonomy.  That's the only way because if a flying car crashes, he falls on your head.  It's not a problem.  The car is falling out of the sky.

Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, that's something else.  You know, probably the first regulation we need to have,  because we don't actually have any regulations  at a federal level around automated driving.  The first thing we actually need to have  is a change in the rules that if a vehicle is in an automated driving mode  where the human is not required to watch the road.  So level three and above, the manufacturer must be liable.  If if something happens while you're in that mode, the human should not be liable.  That would shut Elon up fast.

You know, I always struggle with Miro because I don't know how to describe it  because it could be anything you need it to be.  It is a workspace for you and your team to get the job done, to brainstorm, to share ideas.  If you and your team are still going from tab to tab and tool to tool,  every time we switch context like that, you lose ideas. You forget where you are, right?  Important information just drifts away with Miro.  You don't have to do that. Miro is a collaborative visual platform  that brings all your great work together no matter where you are, no matter what you use  because it integrates with all the tools you use today.  And even if you're not in the same time zone with your team,  you all can work together in one workspace online.  It really is the best way to collaborate.  It democratizes collaboration and input.  Everybody's on an equal playing field.  There's one source of truth.  You can zoom in if you want to see the details, zoom out if you want to see the overview.  Miro's infinite shared boards give product teams a perpetual space  where they can drag and drop insights and data.  Nothing is lost.  It can be a vision board. It can be a Kanban board.  It could be a swim lane chart.  Miro covers a breadth of use cases.  You can build visual assets. You can present findings.  You can run brainstorms with cross-functional teams.  The product designers can sketch out an idea.  The engineers can come in and build it out.  Your executives can come in and say, how do we market this?  You can build out your product vision by brainstorming on a Miro board  with sticky notes, with comments, with live reactions.  There's a voting tool, which is very useful.  There's a timer, great for online meetings.  So you come to consensus quickly.  You can express yourself in creative ways,  bring the whole group together around one idea.  It's so hard for me to describe because it could be so many things.  Here's what you do.  You go to Miro.com slash podcast, sign up for your free account.  Your first three boards are free, so you can start working right now  and really get an idea of what it can do.  You can also, and this is fantastic, click the button on the left.  It says Miroverse.  This is a whole bunch of templates created by Miro users, donated to you.  You can use them yourself, but it's a great idea to get an idea,  a sense of what you can do with Miro.  It is incredibly creative, whether it's a wireframe or a sketch  or images collaged from other sources.  You can drag in your data from all the tools that you use,  Google Docs and Drive and Zoom.  Miro users say they save up to 80 hours per user per year  by streamlining conversations, cutting down meetings.  It works with Zapier, so you can actually bring data into Miro automatically.  It's a great way for any team to stay connected to real-time information,  no matter where they are, no matter what time zone they're in.  It gives project managers and product leads a bird's-eye view of the whole project,  so nothing slips through the cracks.  No wonder a million people use Miro every month.  A million people use Miro every month.  I want you to try it, and you can for free.  Three boards free to start creating your best work yet.  Miro.com.  I can't tell you what you could do with it.  You got to try it, and you will see.  It's really amazing.  Miro.com.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech  and our big wheel bearings takeover.  Wheel bearings.media.  Do we want to talk about the...  I'm a little worried that Elon is going to...  All the Karmic...  Well, Ford and GM at least, but I think if once Ford and GM do it,  probably others will as well, are saying,  we're going to support the Tesla Supercharger.  And Sam, you said this will ultimately be in  replacing the fast charging system that we use today.

Start time: 6990.94

Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  I think it will be.  I think the Supercharger connector,  the so-called North American Charging Standard connector,  which Tesla just rebranded a few months ago from...  It previously didn't really have a name.  Now it's NACS.  That is going to become the standard,  and CCS is eventually just going to fade away,  much like HD DVD is so popular today.

Betamax was always better, right?  It was better.  It was better.  These charging companies, they've had time.  They've had time to build a nice, robust, reliable network,  and they've not built a reliable network.

Start time: 7064.02
End time: 7120.58
Speaker: Nicole Wakelin
Transcript:  They have a million reasons.  When you talk to them, I did a road trip from Disneyland  to Disney World in an EV to see how it would go.  Yeah, it was insane.  So I did this, and it was to see if you just did it,  and you just stop at charging stations,  how hard is it to do, and how long will it take?  They didn't work.  And then when I talked to them after the fact,  like, well, you know, when we installed these,  we were trying to get them out really quick,  and we were limited to where we could put them.  Excuses, excuses, excuses.  We were limited by the infrastructure.  It was just a million different excuses.  So I was like, we're really doing our best,  and we're making it better.  I'm like, but it stinks.  It was terrible.  Just having things, you walk up, it's like, oh, I should be getting tons of power,  seven kilowatts.  I'm going to be living at this charger now for the next five hours.  Like, it was just, it was ridiculous.  And they just, there's no, there was never any kind of,  we messed up, and this is why.  It was like, well, all these things made it impossible for us to do better.  We just couldn't, we couldn't.

So it's not an ideal situation.  But if someone comes up to me and says, I want to drive an EV across country.  What's the best way to do it?  My immediate answer is, and even though I don't want this vehicle,  I wouldn't recommend anyone buying this vehicle other than this situation.  Buy a Model 3.

Start time: 7181.24
End time: 7204.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is one of the reasons I bought a Model X.  I actually, my first electric vehicle was a Tesla Model X.  And I didn't buy it until they put a supercharger just down the road in Petaloma.  Because I, in my mind, I think it's probably true,  a lot of people who have never owned EVs thought, oh, I need to have a supercharger.  And what I didn't realize is 99.9% of the time I charge at home.  I have a gas station in my house.

Transcript:  That's the crazy thing is that Americans think they take way more road trips than they actually do.  Because they all remember as kids because flights are so incredibly expensive.

And when you're driving to work, you feel like you're driving so much further than you actually  are because you're stuck in traffic.  It takes an hour to go 20 miles.  Yeah.  So there's this huge mental block within the American psyche when it comes to driving.  That, no, I need to have a supercharger.  I need to be able to drive from here, from San Francisco to Philadelphia at a moment's notice.

You have to deal with that junk ever again.  If you're just cruising around town, like mostly what we do,  we are still stuck in that mindset that we're always driving hundreds and hundreds of miles  every week.

Transcript:  We all think we're the Blues Brothers.  Flip side.  Let me give you the flip side of what Robbie just said.  So he's absolutely right.  Most people rarely have ever taken long road trips.  And 85% of daily driving is less than 40 miles a day.  So the vast majority of people could get along just fine with an EV that has a 200-mile range.  Or 110-mile range, as Lisa has found out.

Start time: 7392.80
End time: 7418.18
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  But what you said, Leo, about you charge it at home almost all the time, same for Robbie.  And when you look at the people that are buying EVs today, that is absolutely true.  The vast majority of them just do most of their charging at home.  But the reality is most people don't buy new cars.  We saw three and a half times as many used cars in the United States every year.  It's because most people are smart.

Start time: 7445.60
End time: 7515.86
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  So, you know, the reality is, you know, that people that actually can afford to buy new cars  are much more likely to live in a single family home with off street parking and they will  they will charge at home.  But as as EVs start to filter into the used car market, people buy people in apartments,  and cars.  Yeah, yeah, you have a much higher proportion, you know, probably half of those people that  don't live somewhere where they have off street parking.  Those people are going to be dependent on public charging infrastructure, a lot of which  is going to be DC fast charging.  So it is critical that we actually make this stuff reliable, because even though we may  not use it as much as as you think today, 10 years from now will be a lot of people  will be much more reliant on those public chargers.  And so, you know, going to Tesla today, and which will put economic pressure on the electrify  Americas and EV goes and and charge points of the world to get their act together and  improve their charging network reliability is I think is really important.  Yeah, I don't want I don't want Tesla to have a monopoly and I don't think they will.

Now, you might wonder why you would listen to Mr. Bean about anything, but he points out that he,  in fact, got his university degree in electrical and electronic engineering,  and a master's in control systems.

Now, we've heard this before from the gas vehicle industry that, oh, and anybody who  doesn't like electric cars, which is most people who own ice cars, oh, you know, those emissions  in the making of the electric cars are so high and the usage of, you know, rare earth elements  and lithium is so bad for the environment.  Is that true?

Start time: 7629.51
End time: 7640.10
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  Not entirely.  It does take more energy and there's more emissions associated with producing batteries  and EVs than it is with internal combustion cars.

Transcript:  He says Volvo released figures that greenhouse gas emissions during production of electric car  are 70% higher than for manufacturing a petrol one.

Start time: 7649.74
End time: 7708.82
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  Is that right?  That is absolutely correct based on the way that we make batteries today, which means  mining lithium and nickel and cobalt, you know, out of the ground and shipping it to China,  you know, from South America or Indonesia and processing it there and then shipping it to  a Volvo factory in Sweden.  So, yes, that is correct as far as it goes.  But it's not the whole story.  Once that vehicle is in use and it's not emitting anything or at least it's not directly  emitting anything, even when you factor in power plant emissions, the crossover point  is on average is usually somewhere around three to four years.  After three to four years in use, from that point on, the EV will have less life cycle  emissions over its entire life.  No gas emissions.  Right, because you're adding much less in terms of power plant emissions.

Transcript:  And that doesn't take into account like the drilling for oil, transporting oil,  getting a boat for oil, doing this other thing for oil, doing all these things that have,  you know, the oil industrial complex, all the things that are going on.  That's not even taking any of that into account.  While at the same time, they're taking into account the mining of lithium,  they're not taking into account the, you know, drilling for oil.

Start time: 7731.94
End time: 7775.14
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  And when that battery reaches its end of life after 150,000, 200,000 miles,  we can recycle that battery.  We can't do that with oil.  And when you take a lithium ion battery and you recycle it, and then you take those minerals,  instead of mining them and processing them, you can put them right back into new battery  production at a tiny fraction of the total energy cost and emissions of building that new battery.  So that 70% number is only true for the first time,  the original battery being made from virgin materials.  After that, those numbers start to go way down.  So it's only true as far as it goes, which is not very far.  Mr. Bean says,

Transcript:  It's like there is green hydrogen, but there's only a tiny amount of it being made.  Making it by splitting water using renewable energy, it's green hydrogen.  There's zero emissions associated with that.  But there is only a tiny fraction of what we would actually need is produced that way today.  Someday, hopefully, that will change.  Today, that's not the case.

Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  So it's effectively a net zero process.  But it's a process that has not yet been scaled up to anything that would be useful for  the amount of fuel that we actually use for ground transportation or aviation.  And it's also much more expensive than producing fuels from crude oil.

Start time: 7978.08
End time: 8016.36
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  It uses a fair amount, but if you're doing it at scale, if you make large wind farms  or solar farms or nuclear plant, you can generate a lot of hydrogen from water.  And the other thing, if you do it in coastal areas, you can use that nuclear plant to drive  a desalination plant that you can then take that water and you make potable water.  And you can also take some of that and split it to produce hydrogen.  And there's...  Because we're going to need those desalination plants real soon.  The fact that there aren't any yet along the West coast is quite remarkable to me.

Transcript:  Somebody in the chat did make an interesting point though about tire emissions.  You know, over the last decade or so as particulate emissions from diesel engines,  you know, the soot that used to be the biggest source of particulate emissions  has largely gone away because of particulate filters on diesel engines.  The biggest source of particulate emissions now is tires.

Start time: 8052.86

Start time: 8058.32
End time: 8100.48
Speaker: Sam Abuelsamid
Transcript:  You get from road, from regular road tires, you get a lot of airborne particulates.  When your tires wear out, I mean, that stuff doesn't just magically vaporize.  Those little chunks of rubber, they end up floating in the air.  Is that bad stuff, that rubber?  Oh yeah, it's very bad for you.  Tire companies are working on trying to reduce that and make tires that...  And EVs because they're heavier and also have that instantaneous torque,  they put more stress on the tires.  So EV tires do wear out faster.  And so tire manufacturers are working on new tire formulations to try to reduce that impact.

Well, we're just driving javelins and chargers everywhere and peeling out and using leaded  gasoline.  And so over the decades, we started holding these companies accountable and they have to  make changes in order to make the world an easier place to breathe and live.

Start time: 8133.22
End time: 8168.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's an important point.  The price we pay for stuff does not reflect the total cost of that stuff.  And the rest of it is...  There's a lot of externalities.  Yeah, those externalities are subsidized either by the government or by us or by our lungs.  And that really should be part of the total cost.  33 cents a gallon gasoline for decades in my youth really cost a lot more than 33 cents a gallon  in the long run.  And if you live in...  Are you getting any of the smoke from Canada in New Hampshire?  Or is it blown?  I did.

Transcript:  The thought process is like, well, EVs aren't going to solve it all.  I'm like, yes, it's a part.  It's a part of a solution.  We got a lot of solving to do.  Let's put it that way.  We got a lot of solving to do.  We need a more robust public transportation system.  We need more protected bike lanes for people to ride their bikes.  You don't need to drive your car everywhere.  You can have a nice bike ride if you want to go somewhere.  We have to change...  We try to get rid of all those high emission peakers on the grid, try to get rid of coal  fires and all these things are changing.  But mostly they're changing for monetary reasons.  It's cheaper to have batteries next to a power plant than it is to fire up a coal burning  or diesel burning peaker on the grid.  It's not because the utilities feel better about making us feel better.  It's because, oh, it's cheaper to do this.  It's also cleaner, but it's cheaper.

And this is an interesting editorial in the New York Times from Russ Dutat who says,  okay, why is this guy who is actually credible, he's still working in the US government,  he's operating through normal national security channels making this report,  why is this guy all of a sudden surfacing?  He says, he actually thinks it's the US government doing this.  He says, there may not be alien spacecraft, but there clearly now is a faction within  the national security complex that wants Americans to think there might be alien spacecraft.

Eventually someone's going to get, because we all have cameras with us at all times,  eventually someone's going to get real credible evidence.  And if we've already accepted it, then it's fine.

It also includes, according to Duterte, examples of other credentialed figures like the Stanford  Pathology Professor Gary Nolan, who claimed they're being handed evidence of extraterrestrial  contact.  Writers are being fed strange stories.  Strange stories?  Strange stories?  Now, I have to say the mere thought that somebody would have the skills, the faster than speed  of light vehicles, the ability to transit huge distances to come here and then just  crash seems unlikely.

Transcript:  We also want to thank all of our Club Twit members  for making this show possible and all of our shows.  Club Twit is seven bucks a month.  You get a lot of benefits,  including ad free versions of everything we do.  You wouldn't even hear this ad for Club Twit in the Club Twit feed  and shows we don't put out anywhere else,  like Home Theater Geeks with Scott Wilkinson,  Hands on Mac with Micah Sargent.  There's some great shows just for the club.  We use the club to launch new programming.  That's where This Week in Space came from  because club members subsidize it.  They help us do this stuff on the air.  So if you're not a member of Club Twit,  you want to get ad free versions of the shows.  You want to see those other shows.  Oh, and by the way, you want to get in the Discord,  which is a wonderful hang.  It is the future of social.  twit.tv slash club twit.  Seven bucks a month, $84 a year.  Tell your spouse, we don't want any chargebacks.  We got a couple of chargebacks.  I think almost all of our chargebacks come from  geeks who bought a year-long subscription  and then their wives or husbands,  their spouses noticed this and said,  what's this?  And said, that's fraudulent.  Now we have to pay them back.  So, twit.  Please, does that happen on your Patreon?  Does that ever happen to you guys?  Must be a unique thing that's just us.  I don't know why that is.  And chargebacks, you know this, are terrible.  I mean, all of a sudden, at some point,  Stripe is going to say you can't use this anymore.  Please, tell your spouse.

The rules weren't clear.  Like many other crypto entities,  they've been asking for regulation, asking for clarity.  Paul Grewell, Coinbase's chief legal officer,  says the solution is legislation that allows fair rules  for the road to be developed transparently  and applied equally, not litigation.  So SEC has now sued Binance,  the world's largest crypto trading platform,  and now Coinbase.

We now understand what governments  are learning about us, and we are more aware of privacy.  I also think it's a little weird  that he is now a Russian citizen.  He's been living in Moscow for the past 10 years,  but that's mostly because the US  wouldn't let him live anywhere else.  He was in Hong Kong.  They chased him out of Hong Kong.  He had planned to go to Ecuador  until he was told you can't go there.  So now he's a Russian citizen.  The good news is you can't be extradited  if you're a Russian citizen.  I am so up in the air on this one.  I just...  Yeah, I think it's the same.

Transcript:  At the time, we might not have known  that Glenn was what he was to become.  But honestly, Snowden says,  I tried whistleblowing.  It didn't work.  They wouldn't listen to me.  I had to do this.  And certainly we've learned a lot from him  and it sells scooping up everyone's records.  In 2015, Congress wrote the USA Freedom Act,  which made that illegal.  Rightly so.  So there have been some shifts and benefits.  This is terrible.  But I feel like he should have done  what Reality Winner did,  what Chelsea did, Chelsea Manning.  He should have done what he did  and then stood up and taken the charges.  But in response, he said,  I'm responsible.  Look, I think this is important.  I will go to court.  I will be tried.  And if you put me in jail, you put me in jail.  Going to Russia taints it a little bit.

It needs better railings, sir.  I don't know.  It needs better railings, better windows.  I don't know what the situation is with Russia and windows,  but the people just falling out of them.

But I think a majority of people understand what he did and what that means for us,  privacy and encryption wise, was a benefit.

Transcript:  We do a tweet every Sunday, 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2100 UTC.  Now, I only mentioned that because, I mean, normally people download it,  but if you wanted to watch it happen live, you could.  That's the time.  And the way you would watch is going by to the website, twit.tv slash live.  There's audio and video there for your enjoyment.  And if you're watching live, you might as well chat live with the folks who chat  as they watch, either on our IRC, at irc.twit.tv.  All you need is a web browser, although you can use an IRC client because it's real IRC.  Or if you're a ClubTwit member and you want animated GIFs,  you should probably go and sign up for ClubTwit.  There's a Discord associated with it.  Oh, look, here is from newengland.com a website.  Thank you, Joe, to the Canadian...  See, I'm not crazy.  Oh, this looks good.  Me Mers Rousseau's Tortier.

After you watch, if you watch, you can download copies of the show,  whether you watch or not, actually.  That's the whole idea.  It's a podcast.  So go to twit.tv, download it there.  There's a YouTube channel dedicated to the show.  It takes us a couple of hours to edit it.  Later tonight, it'll be up there.  Actually, the best thing to do, so you don't even have to think about that,  find a great podcast client, Overcast, Pocket Cast,  Apple Podcasts, Google, whatever you use, subscribe.  That way you'll get the show the minute it's available.  You'll have it tomorrow for your commute or whatever,  whenever you like to listen to it.  By the way, there's special feeds like all the Twitch shows.  If you search for Twit, you find that.  Subscribe, you get them all.  And then you've got this wonderful potpourri.  It's like a pork pie for your ears of stuff.  And you just listen at your leisure when you're in the mood.  How about that?
