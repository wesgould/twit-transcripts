Transcript:  That's why it's red, baby.  So there is lots to talk about, including right now a breaking  story which has pretty much broken from the Sunday Times  of London.  And it's so funny because Read Write Web and others have  reported on it saying that it's behind a paywall.  And they apparently didn't want to pay the two pounds  to read the article.  So they're all saying, we don't know what they said,  but Fox says they said this.

Start time: 513.08

Start time: 520.20
End time: 573.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a piece of crap.  Well, not only that, apparently the story itself  is a piece of crap.  So here, let me read you what's going on.  Fox News summarized the article that says Facebook,  using its Facebook app, was reading text messages  on your phone and admitted to it, according to Fox News.  Furthermore, YouTube can remotely access and operate  your smartphone's camera.  Flickr, Badoo, and Yahoo Messenger  have accessed users' private information.  I mean, if this were true, especially the Facebook  allegation, it would be a bombshell, a huge story.  And that's why I was trying to get to the bottom of it.  My suspicion when I first read this is, I want to read more.  I wasn't sure that this was exactly.  Yeah, you might be good.  Well, and by the way, talking about that accessing other  Here, get that microphone in your face here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let me talk a little bit about this.  Facebook has responded, Ian McKenzie responding on Facebook,  says, another day, another piece of disingenuous reporting  that does nothing for journalism and confuses users.  And apparently, he says, we worked with the Sunday Times  to explain why the Facebook Android app requests SMS read  and write permissions.  Here's what we sent them.  Facebook is currently running a limited test of mobile features  which integrate with SMS functionality.  SMS read write is not currently implemented  for most users of the mobile app.  But as part of this test, we declared the presence  of that functionality within the App Store permissions.  That's part of Android.  If you've ever used an Android phone, you'll get a list of things.  The phone says, this app wants to do all these things.

Start time: 643.26
End time: 646.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  What does everyone always do?  Say, yeah, whatever.  Right.

Start time: 647.56
End time: 648.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't even read them.

Start time: 648.96
End time: 668.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, this really is a rehash of the, right,  we've had this conversation a million times in a long time ago.  It's just the default permissions  that we all kind of click, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,  to say that they are reading it is really,  this harkens back to the story you did last week about,  you know, the declining state of tech, quote unquote, journalism.

Start time: 668.74
End time: 675.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's worse than that.  I don't think that this is accidentally bad journalism.  I think this is maliciously bad journalism.

Start time: 676.00
End time: 680.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think it's maliciously bad?  I mean, I just think this is lazy reporting,  but what makes you think that this is?

Start time: 680.88
End time: 792.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it goes part and parcel with the same sensationalist  reporting that Sister Publication, the Wall Street Journal,  has been doing about privacy.  I think that this is good copy.  It sells papers.  It generates links.  And I think that they look at a blind eye to the fact  that they may or may not be doing this.  They write it in such a way that it can't be said that's wrong,  but it's very sensationalistic.  It's saying they're asking for permission.  They must be doing it, essentially.  And I think that sells papers.  But I think that it is also scary to people.  And I think it's clickbait.  I don't know anybody scared by it.  You're like, there's a smoking gun in there, right?  No, in fact, as Ian...  Now, I don't know who Ian McKenzie is,  but he's writing on behalf of Facebook.  PR gun, maybe.  He's saying that as far as he can tell,  nobody at the time's looked any farther than what permissions  these apps asked for.  Now, that's admittedly an issue.  Part of it is actually the fault of Android.  It happens on the iPhone, too.  In order to do some things that you want to do,  you have to ask for broader permissions than you really want.  In this case, Facebook said,  the features aren't used outside testing.  We're testing it with a small number of people  who we tell exactly what we're doing.  And what we're doing is testing things like carrier billing.  That's why we need to read and write SMS messages.  He says the paper wrote,  companies are using smartphone apps to extract vast quantities  of private information about users' lives,  in some cases reading their text messages and intercepting calls.  I find it hard to believe that any company would want to intercept  anybody's calls.  What would you do with that?  How would you hire enough people to listen to those

Start time: 793.06
End time: 807.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to make it worth anything?  You could target people.  I think that's the real concern.  And that's what the real business is.  Okay, I got a guy that's one of my customers,  and he's on the phone all the time, and I can listen to his call,  and he comes to be a stockbroker who has some great clients.  I'd love to listen to these calls.

Start time: 808.06

Transcript:  Let's get some stock tips.  In the executive suite, I'd do it.  Have you ever worked for a company where you have not found a guy  that's in IT that says, yeah, I got the payroll for everybody in the company?  That does happen.  It always happens.  And you know if they're doing that, they're doing other stuff.

Transcript:  And that was the complaint about Dropbox,  that you weren't allowed to use your own encryption keys.  Dropbox knew what your encryption key was.  The concern was somebody in the back room would take advantage of this.  And they do. They're bored.  Among those that...  Boring job.  Again, reading from the London Sunday Times,  among those that admitted reading text messages this weekend  was the internet giant Facebook,  which said it was accessing the information as part of a trial  to launch its own messaging service,  which has already been launched months ago.  Companies ranging from Facebook and Apple to small operations run by individuals  gain access to the treasury of data  when people agree to the terms and conditions of downloading an app.

Start time: 872.18
End time: 889.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, this is the business.  When Facebook went public, somebody wrote a ridiculous article  on one of these blogs out there that said,  in the Facebook documents that went forth,  it didn't ever say what business Facebook was in.  And Facebook said they were in the advertising business.

Start time: 899.14
End time: 952.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the bigger question is that, you know, on all these apps,  like you said, both Android and iPhone,  we've agreed to a lot of these permissions,  and we've given carte blanche to a lot of companies to do stuff  that a lot of us would frankly be uncomfortable  once we find out it happened.  So this is related to the path thing to a certain degree.  It's related to some of these other apps  that are sort of overstepping their bounds  in some of the things that they're doing.  In some cases, they're overstepping the permissions,  and in other cases, you know, the permissions are there,  and companies can do a lot of things.  And I think we're going to see more things come out  where some smart companies are either going to do this sort of on the sly  or they're going to do stuff maliciously  that they could eventually monetize,  pull a bunch of data from people  that they could eventually monetize in lots of different ways.

Start time: 952.14
End time: 1036.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Part of the problem is we don't have a good solution.  Right now there's two ways to do this.  One, the Apple way, which is a company just writes an app.  Apple presumably vets it, decides whether what it's doing is okay or not,  doesn't tell the user,  because Apple doesn't have that set of permissions,  and just says, you're approved or disapproved.  The other way is the Android system, where there isn't much oversight,  but a software does have to say, this is what I want to do,  and that list is given to the user.  Clearly, we have problems with both solutions.  Path was the iPhone issue.  This is now the Facebook Sunday Times issue is an Android issue.  What if, now let me just pose this this way.  I don't think any of these companies really want anything about you, personally, John C. DeWine.  If I was a stockbroker with some great clients, they would.  What if I were a company creating an Internet app,  a really cool Internet app that I didn't want to charge for?  I wanted to have it be ad-supported.  In order to make this a viable business proposition,  I would need to know what my users were doing so that I could give them appropriate ads.  I would need a way to track this,  and I would want, because I'm a responsible business person,  some way to notify the user that I'm doing it without overwhelming them,  without getting too technical.  For instance, when you buy a grocery store card at a Safeway store,  you know what you're getting.  You're giving them personal information in return for lower prices.  I refuse to use such cards.

Transcript:  Well, I think we as consumers need to change our expectations.  Instead of expecting that companies are going to treat us with any kind of like...  I mean, companies, Leo, the path that you just described is,  the best intentions are still going to lead us to hell.  Exactly. My point exactly.  And even though I may want to, I have the best intentions at heart, it doesn't matter.  We as consumers need to change our expectations and not assume that a company's motive is not to make me happy.  They have a profit motive, particularly a public company.  And we just need to assume that if we engage in this space, our data will be sold out at one point or another  and take personal precautions and either not use this stuff or not assume that our data is being protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, you get the lower prices without the card. That's the irony.  How do you do that?  You just say, I don't have my card, I don't have a card.  Or this person behind me, can we use their card? And they swipe their card and they get credited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Holy crap, you go back in the back room with these data guys.  Progressive never was... At the time I went there, they weren't an insurance company.  They were nothing but a data collection company that did all kinds of schedules so they could say that this guy has to be charged this much  and this guy has to be charged that much because this guy is more dangerous.  He's got a certain age.  So here's the choice then. Here's the choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you educate yourself.  I don't think the government needs to be involved.  How does education help?  Okay, let me give you an example.  On March 1st, Google will unveil its unified privacy policy.  You know about this, right?  So there is a way, if you're smart and you look around, that you can go online and through...  Log in to every Google account you have, your Gmail, your YouTube, your Google Docs, everything.  Follow two or three steps.  They're clearly outlined on the Electronic Frontier Foundation site, Leo.  And you can clear all that stuff before March 1st.

Transcript:  They claim on the Google dashboard, and the EFF has pointed this out, that you can opt out.  And I think that's why... I think Google is doing this right.  Not everybody is doing that, by the way.  But I think that's pretty good of Google to offer that as a capability.  You can only do it until March 1st.  So are you going to do that on everything that you use?  Every app that you use from now on?

End time: 1280.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I'm not. I don't want to know anything.  Maybe you're an aggregator, Leo.  No, I think that there's a couple of things.  There's this knee-jerk reaction that people say, oh, but you're getting my stuff.  Nobody wants your stuff. Maybe the insurance companies.  Nobody really wants your stuff.  Advertisers want your stuff.  Advertisers want your stuff in aggregate.  I think that's what we're doing.  In aggregate. They don't care about an ad to Leo Laporte.  They want to get all of the mid-50s guys in Northern California or whatever.  They don't care about me. So how is that a privacy infraction?  Secondly, what people are arguing is going to end up with either European Union-style government regulation of this,  or you're going to lose all the free stuff that you get. Bye-bye to the free services.  What free stuff are we going to lose?  Facebook and Google are free. Do you use either?

Start time: 1280.42
End time: 1298.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Facebook does. Google, yes, I do. But Google makes its money from advertising.  It does it. And this whole thing is a bunch of bull crap, by the way, that they're aggregating all this information.  All I know is I go and I look for one product, and for the next three weeks I keep getting ads for a product that I would...  So what? What's wrong with that?  That shows me that it doesn't work. It's a scam.

Start time: 1343.46
End time: 1439.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not defending them. I'm saying that it's increasingly part of what we've...  This tacit agreement that we've made with the services that we're increasingly coming to use. All of us are.  But you do have the option.  You can be smart about it the ways that Gina and John are talking about.  You can take the Tiger by the tail.  But you're going to be swimming upstream more and more, right?  Because everything we do is being tracked, is being aggregated.  Big data, which is happening right now, is enabling...  We sort of have the computing power and the tools to take and find in aggregate what you are interested in.  The interesting thing about that target thing is one of the things that came out was that they could...  That I thought was so interesting.  They were targeting people, sending them specific flyers.  Even their print media, they were printing...  If they found out you were pregnant, for example, they sent you a specific flyer for pregnant people.  Mailer in the mail.  If they can...  If it's cost effective enough to do that, just your target mailer that you got, essentially was customized now, if you were in the pregnancy category.  Then we're only a couple steps away from the targeted advertising that we all know is coming for a decade.  But we're having to make these compromises and the problem is we're tacitly making them.  And it's going to be harder and harder to swim upstream and get away from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm saying in general, I would like to continue to have these free solutions on the internet.  And I understand people's desire for privacy.  You have no solution except I'm going to complain a lot and not use Facebook.  Is that your solution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me present the government argument, right?  And that is only...  I'm not saying this is the best solution.  However, the government is more accountable to us as citizens than a private company is.  And some type of legislation or regulation saying that you need to present this information and needs to be worded clearly to people,  at least that legislation will in theory come from individuals or from legislators.  I don't think that that is an ideal solution, but I think that the government is more accountable to us than a company is.  Having said that, I like John's solution.  I'm going to move to South Dakota, get a dog and a gun.

Start time: 1536.19

Start time: 1541.24
End time: 1549.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 1552.65
End time: 1648.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true, but I agree with Dan.  I think that we're naive to think that this isn't going to happen, right?  Because citizens, more and more as they sort of realize this stuff is happening, there's going to be an outcry for it.  And this is going to happen.  They're going to get involved.  I think that the personal sort of private solution that all of us need to consider is that we need to look at this the way that a lot of essentially those of us who are in the media look at this.  You control the message a little bit, right?  You control the things that you, the places where you have these, your cards.  You control your public stuff that you have out there.  And then you have some stuff that you do try to keep private and you look at it at the places where you can.  Facebook, right?  You understand the fact that you can, that Facebook wants to make yourself public and that there's some stuff you just want to be for only your friend.  So some of it is kind of education, but it's just, I think people are becoming more and more sophisticated about their understanding of this sort of social world that we live in.  The people that have been doing social media longer and longer, right?  They start to figure it out naturally.  Obviously the first round, people are up there filing their drunken photos all the time.  After a while, people sort of start to get it.  I think we're going to see more informed consumers.  And I think that's the way that we have to deal with it individually is we sort of have the public persona that they can find and they can see.  And then we control sort of the private thing, the private stuff that we don't want to put out there.  I do think, though.  Personal responsibility.

Start time: 1649.40
End time: 1664.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I do think that, I mean, the personal solutions that Gina described, the EFF solution and what John describes getting off Facebook, A, nobody's going to do it.  But B, it puts a lot of the onus on the consumer.  Is that really where the onus belongs?

Start time: 1664.35
End time: 1666.06

And a lot of people don't know there was a recent survey that came out that showed that 80 percent of Facebook users had no idea this data was being collected.  So there's a lot of ignorance out there.  That's pretty ignorant.  So first.  I have to say.  That is amazing.  It's Facebook.  80 percent.  And try to delete your Facebook account.  It's very, very difficult.  I know.  I have done it.

Transcript:  We live in this age of like no personal responsibility.  Right.  Nobody wants to take responsibility.  Blame all their problems or all the things on the corporation.  Blame it on the government.  Right.  I'm just saying that at some point we're going to have to say people are still responsible for themselves.  Governments have responsibilities.  Corporations do have responsibilities.  But citizens also have responsibilities.  Is it?  Is what Facebook did.

Start time: 1723.78

Transcript:  Google.  The Google thing.  Yeah.  I think that's a great first step.  Right.  I mean I applaud them for doing that.  It does give people.  It does make it clearer and give you the chance to go in there and do it yourself.  And it's you know pretty self explanatory.  It's a little complicated.  But all in all I think that's the kind of thing that we're I hope we see more of.

Start time: 1754.56

Transcript:  Dare.  And yeah the EFF because I was looking around there on this other story we were going to talk about and they said you know our advice in 2006 still holds.  There are six things you can do to protect your privacy.  And I thought really I thought your privacy was gone.  And I went to their site and this is a lot of work.  They say don't put personally identifying information in your search terms ever.  That means don't self Google.  Right.  This is from 2006.  That's what's so funny about this.  But the EFF published yesterday that all six of these things still apply.  Don't use your ISP search.

Start time: 1817.08
End time: 1830.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait a minute though I have to say let's start with the first one.  All right.  Don't put personally identifying information in your search terms.  It says.  It makes sense not to put your name address and credit card number but if you search for Parkinson's disease and Facebook keeps track of it.

Start time: 1831.10
End time: 1835.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then you search Leo Laporte and then the insurance companies will jack up your rate.

Start time: 1835.50
End time: 1861.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's pretty hard not to.  In fact we learned that when.  All these things are hard.  We learned that when a supposedly anonymized search information from ask dot com was given to I can't remember who and a reporter in Florida was able to track down a person from that data.  Yes.  Because if you aggregate your search terms together they don't need much to find.  So.  So that was it.  That's it says easy not so easy.  Not so easy and it gets harder as their list goes down.

Start time: 1861.72
End time: 1864.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 1886.06
End time: 1894.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 1894.60
End time: 1925.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You also can go and tell them not to record your history.  That's what I do.  Sometimes I want to be logged into Google.  But I don't want them recording my search history.  So you can through the tools that you mentioned Leo.  You can go in there.  That's the first tip I would give everybody right here.  If you are logged into Google or Bing.  Go there and tell it not to take your search history.  To log your search history.  And you know try to give you all of its information based on search history.  So that's a great place to start.

Start time: 1935.51

So they're going to go along with anything that the government suggests and to allow  consumers to opt in to do not track is of course very good business for all of the above.  Yeah but then.

Transcript:  Today's show.  I guess it's my fault.  I was the one who brought up the cheese.  Today's show is brought to you by Ford.  Did I mention that they are the creators of the EcoBoost engine?  You could find out more at ford.com slash technology.  Amazing technology they're putting into these cars.  A 21st century car company.  The EcoBoost engine.  The idea is you get the power of a V8 with the economy of a V6.  That's the 3.5 liter EcoBoost in the SHO.  Now they've got two liter EcoBoost.  Those are four cylinder engines that give you great pickup, great fuel economy.  Do you feel like you're driving a big car?  Well, you are because it's in the 2012 Explorer or the 2012 Edge, but you're getting small  car economy.  In fact, an EPA estimated 28 highway miles per gallon on the 2.0 EcoBoost four-wheel  drive.  That's the best in class for large utility vehicles.  How do they do it?  Well, two technologies.  Direct injection, of course, that produces a cooler.  I'm going to read this copy because I have no idea.  It sounds so technical.  You know this much about cars?  Nothing.  I do drive a Ford Mustang, but it's got a V8.  It does not have this.  I wish it did, actually.  It's got a direct injection, produces a cooler, denser charge.  It generates more power per drop of fuel.  Really?  Yes.  And then, now sometimes I've been told that, you know, the old turbocharged engines, big  turbine takes a little while to spin up because a lot of momentum in there.  And that gave you something we call turbo lag.  But this is, they're doing two smaller turbines.  Let me play that video again because they show it in here.  Two smaller turbines that spin up right away.  So there's no lag, but you get a huge amount of torque.  What a turbine does is it takes power from the engine's exhaust to spin those turbine  wheels, then compresses the air in the cylinder.  And that pressurized air, again, significant increase in performance per liter, or gallon  if you're here in the US.  So the 2.0 liter EcoBoost engine now available on the 2012 Explorer and Edge.  And next year, the 2013 Escape, actually it's not next year, it's in the spring.  The 2013 Escape will offer 1.6 liter and 2.0 liter EcoBoost engines.  Again, great performance and great gas mileage.  It's kind of a holy grail.  Actually, if John were here, he's the guy who told me that one of the goals in engine  design, this kind of holy grail, is to get one horse per cubic centimeter.  Really?  I never knew that.  Yeah, that's like, in fact, when he comes back, I'll ask him.  He told me this.  This 1.6 liter engine, which is what?  1600 cc's, I don't know.  I'll have to ask him, do the math.  But anyway, it's more than one horsepower per cubic centimeter.  It's amazing.  365 horsepower in the 3.5 liter V6.  420 foot pounds of torque.  It's incredible.  So take a look at it right now.  Just go to ford.com slash technology.  I'm trading in my BMW.  You should.  You know what?  I really should.  You would love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The 11th Circuit said he has the right under the Fifth Amendment not to incriminate himself.  So the really interesting question is if you have an encrypted drive, is giving the police  the key, is it self-incriminating?  And one court ruling says yes.  The other said no.

Transcript:  This would go all the way to the Supreme Court.  Well, maybe.  Well, nice to see you.  Interesting thing here.  And Jason, I'm glad you're here because I was going to pitch this as a story for you  for tomorrow.  There's a whole cool enterprise angle on this.  So say I'm a user in a big company and I decide to use TrueCrypt.  And if you've ever used TrueCrypt, you know, I mean nobody can get into this hard drive  unless they've got that password.  And I encrypt everything.  And let's say I break the law.  You fire me and I leave and you take my laptop.  IT now not only has no control over what's on your iPad and on Google Docs, they can't  get into any of your email or any of the stuff that supposedly belongs to them on company  property.  And that, what are the implications here?

Start time: 3140.64

Transcript:  And courts have ruled that it is not, of course.  That it is in fact.  Right, but it is.  You're incriminating yourself, same thing.  DNA, fingerprints.  Oh, self-incrimination.  All completely legal.  Some would say, not the courts, that that is self-incrimination.

Start time: 3197.28
End time: 3244.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That happens fairly frequently.  And the way that this will, I mean, this could go to the Supreme Court and that would settle  it.  I don't, I mean this is going to be a pretty contentious year for the Supreme Court.  I don't think they're going to take this.  But it depends entirely upon how each decision is written and in your particular situation,  how your court, and using the second person, if you are, if you will rely on this as precedent,  it will depend on which one is written and which, the discretion of the judge to look  at which they want to use as precedent and say, well, this one was written better.  This one refers to law in a way that seems to, depending on the district or the circuit  that you're in.

Transcript:  Timothy Lee, who writes the Law and Disorder column for Ars Technica, says the issue is,  in fact, there is a slight difference in the two cases.  So the cases may be reconcilable.  And it has to do with two...  He says, while two rulings reach opposite results, they don't necessarily contradict  each other.  The results turned on how much the government knew about the contents of the drive ahead  of time.  In previous cases, the courts have held that when the government already knows of the existence  of specific incriminating files, they know that that drive contains something that could  put you in jail.  In that case alone, compelling a suspect to produce them does not violate the Fifth Amendment.  However, if the government merely suspects it, if it's a fishing expedition...  Right.  This is one of those government crazy...  If it's a witch hunt, then the owner of the hard drive is entitled to invoke the Fifth.  In other words, if there's no other reason to get you in trouble than the revealing  of this, that they can't do it, does that apply, I wonder, to DNA and fingerprints,  the same kind of standard?  I can't just take your fingerprints and see if you did something.

When the laptop was closed, the portion of the hard drive containing these files was  automatically encrypted.  Actually, maybe it wasn't the file name.  Maybe he actually saw the pictures.  They were encrypted after the drive was closed.

No, but I love his name.  Remember this name?  He is, by the way, watching this show right now.  He called me on Saturday.  He sent me an email a couple of months ago, said, I am pissed.  I have an iPhone and I have an unlimited plan.  I'm grandfathered in on my unlimited plan.  I got a message from AT&T saying, you've used more than the top 5% of our users.  We're going to throttle you.  What does he do?  I don't mean to throttle you like this.

Transcript:  I love this.  He went to small claims court.  Not...  He didn't make a federal case out of it.  He went to a small claims court where you don't need a lawyer, right?  You bring the case yourself.  In fact, you can't have a lawyer.  He was smart.  He called the Associated Press before his day in court and said, you might want to be  in the courtroom that day.  The AP showed up.  So did somebody from AT&T, which is unusual because a lot of times...  Generally speaking...  ...corporation just says, screw it.  But AT&T takes this fairly seriously.  Matt said, I had a stack, a 30-inch tall stack of documents, including bills and everything,  showing what had happened.  He said, I was throttled.  I've been watching Netflix.  I used 1.5 gigabytes according to AT&T's own data calculator.  The judge said...  First of all, Matt told me this on the radio on Saturday.  He said, first the judge said, in this country, the rules get set in small claims court.  They get set at the most local level.  This is where true justice happens.

Transcript:  This is where real justice happens.  In this case, it was unfair for AT&T to sell you an unlimited data plan and then, buried  in the contract, say we have the right to reduce data speeds if you use too much of  this unlimited data.  He awarded Matt $850.  He said, Matt, how much do you want?  Matt said, well, I don't know.  He said...  The judge said, well, how much does it cost per gigabyte?  Matt said, 100 bucks.  The AT&T guy said, $50.  So the judge said, well, we'll split in the middle.  Let's say 85, which is in the middle.  That's fine.  And he gave him 10 gigabytes worth or $850.  Yeah, we're spoiled.  AT&T says we are appealing.  Yeah, I don't know.

I would say most of the people watching or listening to our shows have received from  AT&T that message.  I just got it the other day.  You're in the top 5% of users.  I wonder if I saved it.  I don't think I did.  No, I know I did.  I took a screenshot of it.  What are you on the phone all day?  Well, Matt was watching Netflix.  And I said, well, Matt, why don't you use Wi-Fi?  He said, well, I don't want to watch on my phone.  They did.  In his defense, he only used a gig and a half.  It's not much.  And they said you have unlimited service.

Transcript:  It's not going to help.  They'll do the same thing.  In a related case, our good friend Dane Jasper, who runs SonicNet here, at one point offered  to some professors who were doing a study on how do you fight congestion.  And he said, well, I'll give you some anonymized customer data so you can see.  And their contention and his contention as well is that, in fact, throttling and caps  aren't how you fight congestion.  Most of the time, the people who get throttled or capped are not the data hogs.  That's not the problem.  They're just people who use it during peak hours.  And in about 80% of the cases, these people are not the ones you really want to go after.  It's ineffective.  Dane Jasper then jumps to a conclusion saying, really, all of this throttling and capping  is about preserving AT&T's right to sell you television via U-verse or Comcast's right  to sell you television via Xfinity.  They don't want you watching Netflix.  They don't want you using VoIP solutions because...

Transcript:  So the cool thing about Ed is that he was working at IBM and loaned to Microsoft when  they started writing NT and this guy…  OS 2…  Well, he did.  So it was like a cross-trade like Microsoft guys went to do OS 2 and OS 2 guys went to  do NT.  The idea being that NT kernel was going to be built into OS 2.  And he learned how… like the deepest guts of Windows.  And as a result created Citrix, which is absolutely got the fundamental desktop sharing.  In fact, Microsoft licensed it back for RDP and so forth.  GoToMeeting is based on this incredible, powerful desktop sharing, but it takes it to the next  level.  This allows you to do screen sharing and now with HD Faces, they've also built in video,  very high quality video.  So suddenly…  You could turn the sound off on this guy.  There's suddenly you're in a meeting, you're seeing who you're meeting with, even though  they're all over the world.  You're getting their body language.

Transcript:  It does lend credence to the idea that we are in a post-PC world and that you will not  need a PC.  Avid's released a very nice video editor for the iPad.  I like it a lot.  It's pretty competitive for even not only with the iMovie, but with really desktop apps.  Microsoft, even though they denied it, I think it's agreed is going to be doing Office on  the iPad very soon.  Microsoft issued a non-denial denial of the original story.  A non-denial denial?  Yeah.  Mary Jo Foley writes about it quite nicely.  We talked about it on Windows Weekly this week.  So, in fact, let me look up the full story so I can give you the details of all of this  for the iPad.  The original leak came from The Daily and they had pictures and The Daily said they  were briefed by a Microsoft guy and Peter Ha of The Daily who is trustworthy said, we  didn't fabricate the images.  A working version of the app was demoed to us by someone at Microsoft.  Though we're very clever in their denial, they said the picture is not of a real Microsoft  software product, which would imply maybe it's a fake picture.  But in fact, Mary Jo says, after working with Microsoft for years, I know what they're really  saying is that's not what it's going to look like.

Transcript:  Like all the presidents, man.  So it's pretty clear...  Mary Jo believes, and I think this is true, that The Daily is right.  There will be an Office 15 for the iPad, very similar to the one for Windows on ARM.  Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote.  They will be Metro, which will be very interesting.  Remember, Apple has to still approve this.  But I think Apple would be...  It's in Apple's interest to get Office on that.  Microsoft bails Apple.

Transcript:  Go ahead, Dan.  I mean, that's the excitement that I'm kind of getting to.  You know, if you think three, five, ten years ago, you had to have a device that was so  expensive and so convoluted that it excluded most creative people from that marketplace.  Now on a 500 or in two, three years, a $300 device, you can put these incredibly powerful  tools into everyone's hands.  That's exciting.  PC means more people can do computing.

But middle class people and lower income people, I mean, we can't simply talk to the people  who can afford to buy into this.  And there are a lot of people, particularly if you think about Africa, if you think about  India, the developing markets, there's a ton of creative people who've never seen these  devices.  Now we have revolutions being held on SMS.  These devices are not just about the North American market.  It's about the world and it's about putting powerful devices into the hands of creative  and smart people.  I think he's a music behind.

Transcript:  But I go a step further, Dan, is the touch interface also makes it more accessible.  If you can solve the issues of how do we wrap complexity enough so that we can make it touchable.  But you watch a kid use an iPad, it's so intuitive, little kids immediately doing stuff with the  iPad very comfortably, very easily.  So I agree with you.  I think that touch is also very, not just the price, but also the interface is very  important.

Don't forget it is less powerful for power users and they're not gonna get away from  the tools they have now, even though they're more complicated and more sophisticated, but  it is more accessible to a lot more people and there's a lot of value in that.

That's why Microsoft thinks Google is its biggest competitor and why they sort of totally  took their eye off Apple, right?  Because Microsoft looks at Google and they see all the stuff Google's doing and they're  doing all the same stuff that we used to do and they're doing it better than we did and  they're going to burn us.  Meanwhile, what they should have been looking at was Apple sort of undercutting the whole,  just eating the whole bottom out of the PC market with the iPad.  And that's what's really hurt them.

You know, they would spend a tenth of the amount on Google apps that they spend, you  know, for their Microsoft license licensing on office.

Transcript:  There is one reason why this HTC phone is significant.  It really is an answer as much to their HTC Titan 2, which they announced it, which was  their big thing.

Start time: 5012.49

Start time: 5014.08
End time: 5029.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a Windows phone, right?  So at CES, their big announcement was a Windows phone, and there were a lot of questions.  Is HTC sort of backing off of Android?  They've gotten crushed by Apple in the courts, and they don't have the deep pockets that  Samsung does.

Start time: 5030.00

Start time: 5032.80
End time: 5081.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  They got crushed by Apple, and that sort of made them kind of reticent.  And they've gotten crushed by Motorola at the end of last year.  They got crushed by Motorola and Samsung in the market, and they looked like a company  that was backing away maybe from Android, because Microsoft was giving them apparently  some better patent protection with Windows mobile or Windows phone than they were getting  from Google with Android, right?  So now this is looking like, okay, they're sort of back in the game.  Maybe Google buying Motorola, in a sense, and them having access to more patent protection  is sort of letting HTC step forward.  And really, because this looks like the kind of phones we're used to seeing from HTC, right?  They're sort of, they had been one of the boldest innovators and the leading device  makers.

It is 1280 by 720 on a 4.7 screen, which is, I think for most people, that's a bigger  screen than they're used to, but not too big for them.  It's just a half inch smaller than the Galaxy Note.  This is a spectacular.

Start time: 5098.60
End time: 5106.36

Transcript:  It's like privacy.  Interestingly enough, the Titan 2, the big Windows mobile phone, that thing had a 16  megapixel camera in it, which is insane for a phone.  This one does only have an eight.  So they haven't put it, but it has the 4.7 inch screen like the Titan 2, but they haven't  put everything in that they would do with the Titan 2, but obviously this is a pretty  sweet device.  This is a very desirable phone.

Everybody says they've not done a lot of smart things lately.  But I do know that the opportunities there, if they do get it right, there are a lot of  people, especially businesses, that are waiting to see what they do before they sort of go  hog on iPad.

Ubuntu.com slash devices slash Android if you want to see it.  I don't know if this is just kind of nutty, but they do make a good point, which is that  you now have in your pocket with a dual or even quad core phone a whole lot of power  that could really be a desktop computer.

That's right.  Chess is derived from Go.  Chess is all over.  You know, computers beat us.  But Go is so difficult that a computer cannot be made to beat the best, or even the somewhat  good Go players.  Copoint.com.  Which is why we called the company Copoint.  I like it.  You guys did...

Transcript:  I've got an Audible recommendation.  Yes, please.  You know, they have more than just books there, right?  They have this great series called The Modern Scholar, which is professors basically just  doing their books.  I didn't know that.  So I've got this one here.  I know it's probably...  It's hard to see there.  Anyway, it's called Stranger Than Fiction, The Art of Literary Journalism.  It's written by Professor William McKean from the University of Florida.  It sounds a little more highfalutin than what it is.  It's basically a history of modern journalism from about early 1800s forward.  But he tells it in such a great way.  I mean, the guy's a great storyteller.  He talks about Mark Twain.  He talks about the idea of sort of the Wall Street Journal versus sort of the rumor mags,  which is what essentially the early newspapers of the early 20th century were.  And it's so parallel to what's happening today, right?  You see the story of what's happening today and the way we're doing journalism and then  the way there's sort of rumor sites versus more traditional media sites.  And it really is a similar story being told over and over again.  But there's a lot on Modern Scholar.  If you just look up there, there's awesome stuff.  No kidding.  What is it called again, Jason?

Start time: 5855.96

Transcript:  I've been trying to figure this out actually.  It's a little unclear whether Sanjay Jha got pushed out or if he just went out.  Or if he just walked.  He decided to leave.  You can make an argument that he did some good things to get Motorola turned around  and really focused.  He was the one who decided, look, we're only going to do Android.  We're not going to try to go in 100 different directions.  That was a pretty smart move for them.  It was a winning move and obviously it's what got them bought by Google.  My sense is, I just haven't gotten any good sources on it yet, is that he was just ready  to move on and that part of his deal wasn't that he had to stick around for two years  like there are in a lot of these things.

He talks about the fact the guy that they're putting in charge is really an advertising  guy.  That says a lot.  It's not a device guy.  Sanjay Levy obviously says a little bit of that as well.  I think that'd be sad.  I think Motorola becomes the Nexus.  It becomes a boutique brand.  Motorola becomes the Nexus maker.  I think that's more likely but probably they're going to cut pretty deep.

Transcript:  It's a really great...  Well, let me just read it now and you can decide.  I'll let you be the judge.  Okay.  This was an email that we got.  I thought it was...  Actually, John, you might be interested in this.  It's kind of interesting.  I'll turn all the mics on.  Is his name Archie?  Or no, I got it from Eva.  Eva sent it to me.  That's right.  Hello from Cartoon.  Cartoon.  Hi there, writes Archie.  Meaning get in touch with the Twit Cottage for years.  Finally decided to do it.  You don't have to read my words, but I'm happy to be writing them.  I am Aki.  He says Aki or Achi, but his full name is Archibald.  I've been listening to Twit since the early days, and it's been a constant source of information,  smiles, and company during the years.  Although I'm from England, I work internationally.  You tell me what this guy does.  I find myself in conflict zones from Beirut to Jaffna, Monrovia to Gulu.  I didn't really expect it.  Bizarrely, I was an archaeologist for years.  It's a long story.  So anyway, I'm in some places that aren't the most genial in the world, but through it all,  I've somehow managed to find an internet connection in a world strewn with the mess that people create  and have downloaded as many Twitnet casts as I can get my ears on.  I've driven through tsunami destruction, barely awake after months of relief work,  listening to early Twits on an old HP laptop the size of a paving slab,  and wondering how these war-ravaged people became part of a natural disaster.  I've fallen asleep to John C's ranting,  the only way to overpower the noise of the army bombing the LTTE in Sri Lanka  as the rattle of AKs competed with tropical crickets.  Wow!  I was in Liberia, sneaking downloads from the work Vsat system,  listening with the curtains closed and the outside world firmly outside  so I could drift off to Petaluma and join friends I've never met,  talking about tech I never saw but loved anyway.  I was in Uganda just after the war, rebuilding that beautiful country  and walking along the red-brown roads made vibrant with the light of Gulu city sunset,  watching women carry water-filled jerry cans on their heads  and hearing the latest about Android on my iPod,  smiling at the dichotomy of the modern world.  I found my true love there too, she'll be my wife in April.  I now find myself in Khartoum, Sudan, trying as always...  You know, I think he must work for a relief organization, right?  No, he's with MI6, he's the IT guy.  It's either MI6 or he's...  Or Secret Service.  I now find myself in Khartoum, Sudan, trying as always to keep on believing  the world will sort itself out and the little I do might give it a helping hand.  And I'm still downloading, still listening, still falling asleep thinking,  I'll get to visit one day, go see the Brickhouse and say hello to that curmudgeon Dvorak  and shake hands with Leo. It'll take me a while but I'll get there. I can't wait.  I wanted to share to say hello and thank you.  It's a strange world and I feel happier you guys are in it doing what you do  because sometimes it feels like you were doing it just for me  when a bad day comes and I want to go home to my friends, family and more.  And more my love, you fill my head with your chat and keep me sane.  I think he's confused about me and April.  Take care, warm regards, much love and keep on keeping on Archie.  Can you do me a favor, drink a cold beer for me Sunday during the next twit?  It's a dry country here and I miss a cold one, you know, just once in a while.  Nanite.  Is that wild?  When he comes here we'll give him a lag. Nanite's IPA.  I think he's a relief worker.  You think he's a relief worker?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would guess that.
