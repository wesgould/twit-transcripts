Start time: 200.64
End time: 234.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, we, we, we, she moved in just before COVID shutdowns happened for all the right  reasons and timing was good.  Timing was good.  And we realized that, you know, we probably should make this serious given that the world  was falling apart.  And we put together a small outdoors, socially distant in-person gathering for our families.  And I watched on the stream.  And then we had about 300 people on the, on the live stream, which was really, really  special.  That was cool.  Also, it's a hell of a lot cheaper than inviting 300 people to your wedding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Actually, Lisa and I, when we got married, didn't invite anybody, which is the two of  us, which is a little, it was a little embarrassing because we had, we got the package, which  included a bartender and a waiter with canapes.  It was just the two of us.  So we go, would you like a canapé?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm actually, I actually, I was going to say, I think that, that, you know, one of the interesting  things that's come out of COVID that, that will have been very positive is that we'll  see a lot more live streamed weddings, especially for guests who, you know, are too far or in  firm or otherwise unable to attend.  And it's really neat.  Like Juliana's grandmother, who's in her, you know, mid nineties and can't make it,  couldn't make it under any circumstances, was able to watch.  And that's really cool that people who are in those situations are able to participate  in these life events in a more personal way.  And it's sort of stunning to me that it took something as terrible as a global pandemic  to get us to that point.  But I think for now it's going to be here to stay for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think actually, if you think about it, it's unusual that for crises to be an inflection  point for a new way of being in many respects, you know, whether it's war or famine or COVID.  I mean, obviously you don't want to encourage those things, but it isn't unusual at all.  Georgia Dow, you're a psychotherapist.  Welcome, Georgia Dow.  It's great to have you.  Nice to be here.  You were ill last week.  I hope you're feeling better.  Oh, yes, I am.

Start time: 355.91
End time: 425.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's nice.  I think that that's the wonderful thing is that we've opened up to being able to do many  things remotely that we had the ability to do, but because there wasn't a need, we weren't  doing it.  So I do, like I would say, 95% of my sessions are through video and some of them are still  through phone call because people might feel shy or not feel comfortable setting up their  camera or, you know, some people have a tech phobia and so they're just using a device  they're worried about being spied upon or being seen.  Is it better with video?  For most of them.  It is better with video, right?  Because you get visual cues.  Yeah, like I don't get all of the visual cue.  Like I'm missing like feet and hands most of the time, but it's much better.  And I think that we can form a bond sooner.  I'm more emotive than lots of people.  So if you're a very quiet therapist or you don't emote a lot, I think that it becomes  more difficult, especially if it's just on the phone because you're wanting, like if  you don't hear anything, you're wondering, are they listening?  Do they like that?  Do they hate that?  Did they care?  I think it's a very positive space and that can cause a lot of more anxiety, especially  if they're dealing with that.

Transcript:  It's the tin foil episode.  Thank you, Seth.  So nice of you.  Actually, you know, I was thinking, Seth, nobody ever mentions this.  Nobody ever mentions this.  But if you're a single person and you go into quarantine, it's been now nine, 10 months  you haven't had sex.  That would be hard.  That sounds horrible.  We're all partnered up.  But I would, I'm just thinking there's nobody to hug, nobody to kiss for nine or 10 months.  That's tough.  Yeah.  It would be tough for me anyway.  I don't know.  I just, I never even think about that.  Does that come up for your patients?

Transcript:  Oh, I have a lot of people that are alone and in a lot of distress because they can't  meet anyone in Quebec.  You can't date?  We are after lockdown.  Yeah.  We can't date, but if you are single and alone, you are allowed to have one other person come  to visit you.  That's being allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because of how difficult it is.  It should be.  This has now been a long, long time.  And just to be hugged, to be touched, and even when you meet them, you're not really  even supposed to be hugged and touched.  So that we need it.  We need to be touched.  We actually release neurotransmitters and chemicals when we are feeling touched and  hugged and cared about.  And you don't get that through a screen.  Even if you're feeling that affection, it's not the same.  I hugged the grub hub guy the other night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, thank you all for being here and staying healthy and being well.  And I think more and more we're going to talk about over the next six months is how the  world has changed.  For instance, I don't think before COVID-19, Slack was worth $27.7 billion.  I think you could even say they may not be worth that now.  They lose money every quarter.  They have revenue of $234 million, which is up, but not up nearly as much as Teams and  Zoom.  They're kind of the laggard in the COVID thing.  Were you surprised, Jason, when you saw that Salesforce buying them?

Start time: 605.66
End time: 651.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wasn't.  And I think the value, I mean, I don't know about billions.  What do I know?  $20 billion, $28 billion, whatever.  But I think this is, I was excited about it because I do use Slack.  I use it a lot.  I've been out on my own, even pre-COVID.  I've been working in my garage for six years.  The way I collaborate with people is mostly through Slack.  And it has a lot of value.  I know that they've been attacked by Microsoft because Microsoft has such leverage.  If you're an Office 365 user, you can just, or 360 user, I always get those mixed up.  I don't know, is it degrees around the circle or every day of the week?  365, it's not degrees, it's days of the year.  It's days of the year.  OK, so 365 and a quarter, technically.  But anyway, Microsoft, why spend money on Slack if you already have that, even if Microsoft  Teams isn't as good, it's good enough, right?

Start time: 651.64
End time: 658.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, but it's beating Slack handily in terms of signups because it's part of the deal, right?  A lot of people are Microsoft 365 users.

Start time: 658.84
End time: 707.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And why would you pay for Slack under those circumstances?  So I think what's good about this is that maybe it frees Slack up to focus more on their  product because you're right, they have gotten lapped by not only is Microsoft caught up  with them or at least gotten close enough with them, but you look at some of the other  stuff that they do.  I talk to people who have tried to do audio conferences in Slack.  It's not very good.  Like they kind of missed the Zoom opportunity to be the place where everybody gathered for  video in their workplaces.  So, you know, for Salesforce, it's an interesting purchase, but Slack is important.  And I think it adds another chapter to Salesforce's story talking to their clients.  And hopefully it frees the Slack people up to improve their product because that product  does feel like it sort of stalled and hasn't really done a whole lot in the last three  or four years.

Start time: 708.40
End time: 776.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In a way, it's better to be a smaller money loser because, I mean, if Microsoft or somebody  wanted Zoom, its market cap is $115 billion.  It's a little bit bigger of a chunk to bite off as much as $0.7 billion sounds.  Interesting article by Casey Newton in his new website platform.  I remember he left the verge to start this, kind of like you did, Jason, to start his  own solo blogging venture.  He points out that Slack was the poster child for worker-centered work tools, even more  tools that the workers brought into the company, used it in small groups.  And then eventually it spread to the corporate culture.  And that's how Slack got in the door because people loved it.  But now we're kind of in a world where the company decides and the company's a Microsoft  company or a Google company.  So they're just going to use the tool that they're already buying in effect.  And that's going to be hard for Slack.  That's one of the reasons Slack had to sell to somebody with a sales force, if you will.

Start time: 778.38
End time: 818.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do think, though, that one thing about this acquisition, I've seen a lot of people say,  well, the free tier of Slack, and there's so many of us who are on free Slack instances,  it's going to go away because Salesforce is going to want to make money.  And a lot of buyers of companies do stupid things with the business model of the company  they buy.  And so they might do it.  But I feel like that free tier is Slack's best sales pitch, right?  That Slack is getting people to like Slack and then go to their bosses and say, you need  to buy Slack.  So I hope they keep that around.  But yeah, I also imagine this is an opportunity for Salesforce to start selling Slack into  all of the organizations where Salesforce is already playing.  If anybody can take it to Microsoft, it's probably Salesforce.

Start time: 818.60
End time: 828.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They must feel that way.  Otherwise, they wouldn't have spent what is a considerable premium on what Slack's value  was.  You don't use Slack, Seth, or do you?  I don't know.

Start time: 829.86
End time: 848.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I've been forced to for certain projects that I've worked on and whatever.  I mean, I think that if Salesforce winds up fixing Slack so that it works fine when you  have more than four Chrome tabs open, it would be an enormous victory.  It's an electron app.

Start time: 848.52
End time: 851.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's part of the problem.  It's just a pig.  Yeah, it's just a pig.

Start time: 851.42
End time: 899.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really is.  I mean, I feel very weirdly about Slack because I have enough distractions throughout my day.  I don't really need to use it to communicate with a lot of people.  I'm not in an office environment.  I also feel like people communicate about things on Slack that they feel very comfortable  talking about in person, which is great for Slack.  It's amazing that they created a product that people are doing that with.  It's just really unfortunate that a lot of those things are going to be either work-sensitive  or personally sensitive and that Slack is probably not a really good platform for that.  You don't want to be talking about super sensitive information in a place...  Is it insecure?

Start time: 899.92
End time: 900.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it considered insecure?

Start time: 901.88
End time: 925.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it depends on which instance you're using.  Last time I looked, I could be wrong about this, but the last I looked, Slack was not  end-to-end encrypted, which means that those messages are simply available either to your  employer or possibly available to be subpoenaed if needed, if you're not in a work environment.  There's all kinds of things.

Start time: 925.60
End time: 926.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't even think of that.

Start time: 927.72
End time: 933.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's all kinds of things that I personally am a little twitchy about, if you'll forgive  the reference.

Start time: 933.72
End time: 944.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you want to not commit to email or Slack anything in writing that you don't want to  be subpoenaed because it lives forever.  I didn't even consider that as an issue.

Start time: 945.02
End time: 974.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you have a PGP key in email, that's fine, right?  But certainly I advise people who want to talk with me in a Slack instance about something  that's sensitive that we go take the conversation to any other platform.  Even Facebook Messenger has its secret conversations, which are end-to-end encrypted.  There's just so many more options out there right now.  Probably for Slack's developers, they feel that there are so many other options, it's  not really something that's worth worrying about.

Start time: 976.14
End time: 1008.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just thinking about the most famous Slack security flaw, and it really wasn't Slack's  fault.  It was the social engineering of Twitter engineers.  That's how all of those Twitter accounts got co-opted, including Joe Biden's because apparently  Slack had, rather Twitter had posted credentials for its god mode in Slack, which was a big  mistake.  As I remember, and I haven't followed it since, but I think it was social engineering that  got them into the Slack community and then they found the keys there.

Start time: 1010.64
End time: 1023.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's a really important point.  Of all the things that you must be doing in Slack, perhaps pinning your super credentials  is less brilliant.  What can you do?

Start time: 1025.72
End time: 1058.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It shows how people don't really know what is safe and what isn't safe and what they  should put into water that people, if they're your admin can read your emails.  I don't think that people by and large are taught what this should be.  This media savvy should be taught in schools so that people are thinking, most people don't  know what end to end encryption is.  People don't know that when they send an email to someone that someone else might be able  to read that and have full access to whatever's happening.  I think that it's not just people at large's fault.

Start time: 1059.76
End time: 1086.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Boy, you would sure hope that Twitter engineers would have some sense of off sex.  But you're exactly right, Georgia.  Even they probably don't know how to assess the risks.  Clearly pinning credentials in a Slack channel is not safe.  But maybe they thought it was.  Is that your experience, Seth, when you're talking to enterprises, that people who should  know better just are not as educated about operational security?

Start time: 1088.28
End time: 1100.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's challenging.  In Twitter's instance, they just did really well by hiring Mudge, Peter Zatko, as their  new CTO.  Mudge is great.

Start time: 1101.12
End time: 1103.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mudge is a great security guy, right?

Start time: 1105.30
End time: 1176.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of all the people they could have gotten, he really knows his stuff, whether he's able  to influence the culture there.  This kind of thing that happened doesn't happen again in the future is, I think, an open question.  But I think it's a question that a lot of organizations are facing, especially from  the pandemic work from home era, where you don't know what your employees are using for  their home routers.  You don't know who else is on their network.  You don't know what else is going on.  My wife, for example, wasn't able to use our printer here because she has a work laptop  and she doesn't have permissions to connect it, which is really good.  I think.  I told her, it's unfortunate that you have to connect to my computer to print, but whatever.  There's worse things in life.  But I suspect that there's a lot of organizations that don't have that kind of forethought in  their processes because they're just trying to get stuff done because everybody's under  the gun these days.  And it's so hard just to ensure that you're able to come close to making your numbers.  And when companies...  It's a real challenge.

Start time: 1177.02
End time: 1216.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When companies do enforce that, I mean, obviously her company is aware of security flaws in  HP printers and others, and so is reluctant to allow her to connect to an unknown device.  But I had a caller on the radio show today who was pissed off because he had video from  his Aukey security camera and he couldn't share it.  It was downloaded to his Apple photos and he couldn't share it without giving Aukey  permission to access his Apple photos.  And he was all upset about that.  And I said, no, that's a good thing.  You want a company to have to ask for permission to access your stuff.  And if you...

Start time: 1218.00
End time: 1228.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You see, I don't think that he knew that they weren't...  Like that if they were just granted permission, they're going to be accessed in any way.  I don't think that people really grasp that that means that they have access to everything.

Start time: 1228.56
End time: 1236.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, he called the company.  He called Aukey and said, how would you do?  And they said, no, we don't want your photos, but you can't access it unless Apple says

Start time: 1236.48
End time: 1240.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We can't access your photos unless we can access your photos if you want to access your photos.  Yeah.

Start time: 1241.65
End time: 1242.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Exactly.

Start time: 1243.86
End time: 1254.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That may be the signal biggest hurdle in security is just people don't have that mindset.  I don't blame them.  Nobody wants to have that mindset.  But you need to kind of be paranoid.

Start time: 1255.96
End time: 1348.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you do.  And it's challenging when the technology is developing at such a rapid clip that you're  not even able to stay on top of how things are changing.  So things that were true maybe 10 years ago, in some cases aren't true.  In other cases, I think are even worse.  And we see this in so many otherwise benign instances.  So what I'm hoping of all things that happens with the Slack acquisition is that Salesforce  is able to really force its Slack users to improve the levels of security that they're  using and to really consider what they're posting, how they're posting it, which is  a challenge because it's in their interest as the owners of Slack to have people post  as much as possible.  But I think there really has to be some thought given from software developers and manufacturers  into what kinds of things you want people posted.  It's not good that people put everything into Gmail.  We've seen time and again that come back to bite politicians and military generals and  all sorts of people in the behind.  Technology isn't for everything.  It's not your side brain.  It's not where you should be dumping everything that you can't keep track of at the moment.

Start time: 1349.66
End time: 1392.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So let's be honest, our brains are not that good at keeping the information in the first  place.  So we want to be able to have a place where it can exist and we don't have to worry about  it being forgotten or lost or have an easy way to remember it.  And so dealing with passwords, like, yeah, you could have one password or something else  that would then be a safer way to do it.  But a lot of people would feel stressed out just putting onto one password.  And then you might feel comfortable with, say, your Ring doorbell and then they get  out with another company and everything changes.  And are you going to change your doorbell once it's hooked up now?

And we read it as a normal human and say, oh, my God, they say they reserve rights in  all forms of media invented or not invented for the rest of the eternity.  I can't I can't agree to that.

Transcript:  And I think one of the one of the solutions, one of the partial solutions to the problem  is really going to wind up being a national privacy policy law.  Yeah.  And California has taken some very interesting steps and, you know, that push it much more  in line with Canada and the EU.  And I think it's really going to happen at some point in the in the Biden administration.  I don't know if he's going to support it, but I think that, you know, tech companies  are going to be so frustrated in dealing with this, you know, multiprong approach to privacy  that they just want to have one standard.  And, you know, if California's law looks a lot like Europe's law, there's a really good  chance that the rest of the US is going to go in that direction as well.

Transcript:  There's kind of a sneaky thing that happens to Jason and I are California voters.  The ballot proposition that we voted on in November, which passed to even strengthen  the California Privacy Act, was actually kind of written by Facebook.  Yeah.  So it looked good and it seemed like it strengthened, but there were these weird loopholes.

Start time: 1547.70
End time: 1635.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I wrote about this and I'm actually doing a piece, a follow-up piece for a non-tech  publisher, which is kind of exciting because it's so rare to get an opportunity to talk  about these very deep in the woods tech issues for non-tech audiences.  But Prop 24 does some really interesting things.  It creates a California government agency similar to the FTC to regulate this stuff  and they gave them a budget that is almost the same size as the budget that the FTC has  for regulating this stuff.  So California alone will have a $10 million budget to be looking at these issues.  It did change the minimum threshold for ultimately what is a violation of the law in a data breach,  which is 100,000 users, which is up from 50,000.  But it also means that these companies could potentially be exposed to legal action, possibly  class action suits, possibly individual suits in situations where they were breached and  they didn't protect their consumers' data.  It's revolutionary in California and in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing that was controversial was, besides the giveaways to the big companies, the feeling  was, well, Facebook can afford to...  comply.  But what it does is kind of pulls up the ladder for smaller companies.  It makes it very hard for them to compete with Facebook.  So it had this kind of inverse benefit.

Start time: 1656.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a very confusing law.  The way that the bill was written, it was not particularly clear.  I was even a little weirded out and I asked one of my sources for the story about this,  about the fact that it physically looked or visually looked, the PDF looked sort of off  and they said, yeah, it looks like it's been photocopied five times and then scanned in as a PDF.  And I said, oh, good, this isn't just me that is sort of unnerved by that.  The other thing to keep in mind is that while the California privacy law that was passed,  that created this tougher regime in the first place in 2018 didn't take effect until January 1st  of this year, they didn't even finish delineating a lot of the nuances of it until September,  which means that the law had been in effect for nine months and then they sort of kind  of finished it but still haven't really.  And there's a very good chance that that's going to happen with the CPRA, which is this  law that Prop 24 codified.  So it's going to be a long, it's going to be a while before things start to get settled  in California privacy, but this is a step in the right direction.

Start time: 1737.58
End time: 1754.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's probably better to do something rather than nothing.  The other thing that was a little controversial was companies could pay or allow businesses  to create pay for privacy schemes so that if you could afford it, you could be private.  You'd pay Facebook a buck fifty a month or whatever and then they wouldn't use your information.

Start time: 1774.09
End time: 1795.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they're providing a free service.  But they can find another way to monetize it.  That's not my fault.  One way would be to charge, right?  They can charge and then they lose their...  They don't want to charge, right?  That's the thing is that they don't want to charge because they're making more money off  of selling off our privacy.  So they end up getting their cake and eating it too.  That it's like the phone book.  You have to pay not to be in a part of the phone book.

And we're going to be able to go against laws that we've said that we're going to say, oh,  we're not going to click and this is not all going to be linked to where you are and then  do it anyways and then get a small slap on the wrist that isn't going to bother us.  Or you can pay us money not to abuse your privacy.  That seems...

Transcript:  Did you deal with this, Jason, when you were voting?  I presume...  I ended up voting for it, Prop 24, but I was very mixed.

Start time: 1830.46
End time: 1871.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I voted against it and I voted against it mostly because our privacy restrictions that  went through California's legislature are very recent and I kind of want to see...  I'm really suspicious when we have a brand new law that's taking effect and we don't  really know how it's going to go.  And then all of a sudden there's a ballot measure that wants to tweak it in some way  because it feels to me like maybe we should watch this work and then everybody should  learn.  And I get real suspicious at that point that maybe this is industry trying to quickly knock  out the things that they don't want to have in there.  So I voted against it.  I'm for more protection, but it did seem a little bit iffy and I always figured you  can come back next year and fix it if we don't like it this year.

Start time: 1871.70
End time: 1918.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You also had weird groups opposing it, like the ACLU opposed it.  The Republicans opposed it, but so did the Green Party and the Libertarian Party.  It's like kind of...  I think that this was one of those cases.  It was created by Alistair McTugget, who is a real estate guy in San Francisco who proposed  the original ballot proposition that the legislature jumped in and said, no, no, no,  no, no, no, no, no, if we pass a bill, will you yank this?  Two years ago, he said, all right, but pass that bill.  And they did.  I don't think he talks like that, but he should with a name like Alistair McTugget.  He said, all right.  And they passed it.  But then he came back and said, but I'm going to do it anyway.  And that's by the way, why that so quickly after the initial California law went into  effect, we had to vote again on a new proposition.

Start time: 1919.64
End time: 1990.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I voted against it in part because I couldn't easily parse what was happening  with it.  And I really feel that California is already besotted with so many horribly written laws  that are really hard to follow and have unclear impacts on voters and have really harmful  effects down the line.  Like look at Prop 13.  Oh, God, yes.  It is a real estate law, which you can have an entire different podcast on.  But ultimately, I think that Prop 24 is good in the sense that even though I voted against  it, I think it's good in the sense that it gets people thinking and discussing this.  But it's very early in the process, as Jason noted.  And I feel like it seems we all do that pay for privacy is a bad idea.  I just think that we're already halfway there in a lot of cases.  If you have the resources to understand that there are more private email options available

Start time: 1990.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to you, for example, I don't use Gmail anymore.  I decided not to.  So I use a paid service called Fast Mail because I don't trust Google with my mail.  But it is a luxury.  I understand.  But the issue is you could not use Facebook.  That's free.  You could use Facebook completely for free, in which case they need to monetize you some  way, which they do with advertising.  Or if you don't like that, you could say, here, I'll give you a few.  The estimate is pretty low.  It's like $4 a year or something that they get off.  That sounds off.  It seems like it'd be worth more.  But anyway, say it's $5 a month.  If you really wanted to use Facebook in a private way, you could pay $5.  I like that having that option.  That gives you three options.  But you think it should be by default private, Georgia?  But then how do they pay for themselves?

Start time: 2042.46
End time: 2054.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that if they get caught misusing, going like every time that they get caught  misusing our privacy by their own privacy policy, I think that there should be like,  we should have a right to our privacy.

Start time: 2054.70
End time: 2058.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if they don't adhere to their privacy policy, they should absolutely punish.  They should.

Start time: 2059.50
End time: 2130.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I don't think it should be a little tiny fine.  I'm sorry.  These fines are nothing to them.  They're nothing.  And it takes so very long to be able to go through it.  They're absolutely ineffective.  I think that if I get caught going into your house, Leo, and stealing your documents and  then selling them, I'm going to jail.  I'm just going to say it.  Yeah, you run a company.  You're the head of that organization.  You should be legally liable for everything that happens within your company.  And then I bet everyone's only going to be watching their P's and Q's and being much  more careful because that restriction to their own freedom would be something that they  would care about.  But if I'm making, you know, say I'm making $100 and you're going to find me $1, that's  like just a cost of operation.  Great.  I'm going to use this without any worry and fear.  So I think that one is there should be laws about our privacy and what information should  be used and what information shouldn't be used.  And they should be able, they should have to disclose what is specifically going to  happen in layman's terms that everyone will understand.  And that should be across the board.  And then they get caught, you know, with Facebook being caught how many times, right?

Start time: 2132.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Georgia, I think you're absolutely right.  And something like fines being equal to a percentage of rev.  As in GDPR, yeah.  Yeah, would be would be great.  You know, and the challenge is, is that even in GDPR, which for the most part is a significant  improvement over anything we have in the U.S., there is still a loophole in it that allows  companies to remedy the problem and then come back to the regulatory agency and say, look,  we fixed it.  It's amazing.  So these even when there are reasonable safeguards ensuring that companies are fined for bad  behavior at a rate that is fair, I think it's still really challenging to deal with situations  that allow them to do things like fix it when there may not really be a fix.  You know, if your data has been stolen and leaked, then, you know, that horse is long  left the barn. There's no way you're going to get that one back.  And often it's not like and I think that laws are not up to laws are just not up to snuff

Transcript:  at this point. Also, I hear a lot of people talking about, oh, well, what is Facebook  going to do? How are they going to survive if they can't do this?  And I just want to point out to somebody who worked for a media company for years.  Yeah, poor Facebook is a lot of what they do in terms of personalization, in terms of  targeting. You know, some of that is necessary.  A lot of it is unnecessary.  A lot of personal information gets collected by all of us and we get tracked.  And it's all in in the the purpose is to target us and know everything about us.  Although what you'll find is a lot of times untargeted advertising works pretty well.  Facebook, I get like Facebook micro targets and it's great for small businesses that need  to find a very particular kind of person.  But I am I'm going to say I am based on my history in the media, extremely skeptical  that you cannot put in a privacy regime and limit the information that gets shared and  limit tracking that that happens, especially across sites, and that tech companies that  rely on advertising are not going to be able to find a way to make a living at it.  I just don't believe it. I think that they are very smart and that there are lots of  ways to sell advertising and there are lots of ways to identify target audiences and that  you don't need to do the level of collection.  I think a lot of the data collection that goes on is completely unnecessary and is just  used as a sales tool.  So I think that, yeah, the stricter the laws, the more evidence you're going to get that  a lot of this stuff, not all of it, but a lot of it and some of the most invasive stuff,  I don't think it's really necessary.  I think it's just a technique they use to convince people that their ads on the Internet  are going to be effective.  And then, you know, they aren't.  And we move on with our lives.  So I think I think always make them prove it, make them prove that they actually need  that information, because I don't think they do.

It's I mean, podcasting is going through the same thing now.  We are.  Oh, now we need to have data about the number of downloads in the time of day we need to  target.  And a lot of it is just a psychological tool that salespeople use to get money from their  clients.  It's not something that anyone at any point in the chain actually uses.

It's that of the ocean of data that gets collected, what of it actually does get used and is effective?  And I would guess it's very small and that they could be limited dramatically by laws  in terms of what information gets shared and what cross site tracking is allowed.  And they would still be able to do a pretty good job of targeting, especially advertising  into people's eyeballs.  I think that they overstate how much they need.  And again, I think it's up for them to prove it.  I think that as members of the public, we should be demanding as much privacy as we  can and hear from those tech giants about what they actually need, because we can't  take them at their word.

That's not enough.  We got to know a lot more.  And I don't want to give them any information.  So this is this kind of tug of war between.  And Lisa says if we don't do it, we won't get the buy.  Go go to somebody who will.  And the problem is Spotify and I heart the two biggest podcast companies in the world  are because they use apps, do know that information and are willing to give it to advertisers.  So advertisers say, well, why would I buy your podcast?  I get all that information from Spotify.  If you won't give it to me, see you later.  It's very challenging.

And the answer is yes, sometimes, but not in the ways that you think and not from necessarily  the reasons that the advertisers wanted to work.  It's super complicated.  But one thing that you learn spending a couple of decades around salespeople, right, is there's  sales technique and what works to make the sale.  And then there's what the what is actually required.  And I would I would wager not only that we are living in an era where everybody wants  more data, but I would I would very strongly suggest that the people who want more data  won't do anything with it.

Like almost 0% of people will read this.  They click, they go and they use us.  But you use Facebook.  Don't use Facebook.  I don't.

I think the entire infrastructure needs to be an overhaul and that it should be, you  know, one page and it should be comfortable.  If we were going through and going to a contract and we were equal parties, had the same lawyers  that were going through it, we would make sure that we both fully understand.  You go to a court of law, they ask you, do you understand all of the charges that you're  going to be relayed to?

Now, if there were a wonderful place that made the best soup in the world down the street,  and it really, there was nowhere else that you could get soup with that was that good,  that wouldn't justify you going in and saying, I'm not going to pay you for the soup.  Give me the soup.  That's the only place you can get that soup.  You got to pay for it.  That's the deal.  I don't think monopoly or not monopoly makes any difference.  If you want that service, you should pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, and I don't think that the commercial internet has ever really come up with a good  way to move beyond that.  Some things on the internet are free.  You have to sign up and you give them your email, you know, Facebook or whatever.  Some things you do have to pay for.  There are certain email services you can pay for.  And I think that if Facebook weren't a monopoly, if there were other options, if Instagram  was its own entity, if WhatsApp was its own entity, you know, there would be much more  diversity in what you can do.  Oh, that's cool.  And there would be, you know, I'm like, if you're a parent and you don't want your kids'  photos plastered all over Facebook, but you do want to share them with a group, is that,  is there a social network that you can pay so that you're, you know, for a nominal fee,  you're able to share photos and details and whatever and not worry about getting, you  know, having your toddler data mined?  You know, I think that that's a really, those kinds of questions are really interesting.  We haven't seen effective answers to them.  We've seen a lot of sort of plays and stabs, but nothing has really stuck.

Transcript:  The Hacker Manifesto information wants to be free.  I think what we've learned is that the gatekeepers want to keep the gate.  Because we thought in those days, we thought, oh, no more gatekeepers.  You're going to, anybody who wants to put up a blog or a video or what, anybody can  do anything.  There's no more networks.  There's no more newspapers.  There's no more gatekeepers.  And I think what we've learned over time is for whatever reason, the gatekeepers end  up keeping the gate.  YouTube now is run by Google and yeah, you get to put videos up for free, but Google  still gets to pick who is the winner and who's the loser.  I feel like the gatekeepers, how about, Jason, what do you think?  This is my, I was thinking about this this morning, this is my new thesis, that for some  reason we didn't get rid of gatekeepers.  We thought we would with the internet, but we didn't get rid of them.

Transcript:  Well, you know, Ben Thompson, who does strataquiri, talks a lot about aggregation theory, right?  And like you either want to be on one end of the funnel or the other end of the funnel.  And you can see it like having the enormity of YouTube or Facebook, like that is so powerful.  And it is very hard to not end up in situations like that unless you have regulation.  This is the argument for regulation.  And I'm not a big, like, let's regulate everything kind of person.  But there is a point at which you have to regulate what happens or you will just go  to a monopoly.  That's just replacing one gatekeeper with another, the government.

Start time: 3095.16
End time: 3128.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's depressing to me because what I think we all thought with the internet was this  great hope that would be the ultimate democratic institution, that everybody would get a voice  and what it ended up happening.  And yeah, Ben calls them aggregators.  But really the aggregators are no different really than the old gatekeepers.  The New York Times was, I guess, an aggregator of stories written by its journalists.  But it was a gatekeeper.  If you couldn't get into that, when I started in radio, if you couldn't convince one of  a handful of radio stations to give you a job, you didn't get on the air.  Now anybody can have a podcast.

Start time: 3128.04
End time: 3151.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not quite a gatekeeper in the sense that I can post things on YouTube and YouTube is  happy to let me do that.  Yeah, but nobody will see it.  Well, yeah, but if I had mailed it to the New York Times, they're going to be like,  no, no, no.  I'm not a crackpot.  I'm not going to put this on.  But they still contain this enormous amount of power, especially in terms of reach, right?  Because YouTube or Facebook reaches this huge audience and they're sort of the only game  in town or one of the only games in town.

Start time: 3152.83
End time: 3209.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So this wonderful idea that anybody can get into radio and do a podcast is true.  But without the gatekeepers, without Apple's iTunes and I Heart and the various directories,  no one's going to know you're doing the podcast.  You're talking to thin air.  It's a little disappointing to me, but I think it's the way the world is.  It's interesting how we trend in that direction, no matter what.  Anyway, I have to take a break because I got to pay for this.  I can't do this for free.  This all is all these boughs of Holly.  They don't they don't come cheap.  They don't come cheap.  I can't go and say, hey, Holly store, give me Holly.  Give it to me for free.  I want it for free.  No, they make me pay for it.  So I'm going to make you pay right now.  Listen to this ad.

Transcript:  Yeah, they might.  There's no reason why you couldn't be on it.  Our show today brought to you by WWT.  This is actually a great company.  About 10 years ago, they started building what they called the Advanced  Technology Center.  Lisa and I went out to visit it earlier this year when you could still travel.  We went to St.  Louis.  The ATC is amazing.  Started in one little building, one little rack of servers, and now it's  mile after mile of racks in many buildings, half a billion dollars in  equipment.  What they've done because they're consultants, they're experts.  They help big companies buy and use enterprise technology.  What they've done is they've just aggregated all of the biggest and best  technologies from the hundreds of OEMs and key partners like heavyweights, like  Dell Technologies and VMware and Intel.  But and also the little guys, the emerging disruptors, companies like Equinex,  they put it all in this ATC.  Their engineers, it first started up, I think, mostly because their engineers  wanted to work in these labs to beta test new equipment, to build proofs of  concept and reference architectures and to set up integrations for their  customers to make decisions and see results faster.  But they realized there's so much value in having this ATC that they should open  it up to customers as well.  And this is what makes WWT such an interesting company.  They really are a partner that people stay with over decades.  Many of their customers have been with them since the beginning because they  know they can go to WWT to get the answers.  They need to make sure their business runs right in every possible arena.  So as an example, they have at the Advanced Technology Center, on-demand  schedulable labs you as a customer can use for things like Dell's VxRail or  PowerStore, Unity or PowerMax, Data Protection Central and IDPA.  These are, this is, this is, you know, if you're looking at storage, these  labs have the latest, greatest and primary storage and there's hundreds of labs  there covering everything from networking, secondary storage, data analysis, AI.  You can learn so much just as your engineers do about the products  before you launch them.  You can use the ATC lab environment to make sure you're getting the right  solution that solves the problem you're trying to solve.  And frankly, the ATC reduces concept time from months to weeks.  It really improves speed to market.  This lab as a service is exactly what makes WWT unique.  They could say, oh no, no, we built this.  We'll keep it to ourselves.  No, they let their customers do their own programmatic testing using this  vast half a billion dollar technology ecosystem that they've built.  And they're always building.  They're always adding more.  If something new comes along, they add it.  And it's completely virtual.  You don't have to go to a St.  Louis like we did.  You can use the ATC anywhere in the world.  24 seven.  That's this.  They launched this last year, their digital platform and company  encompassing the entire ATC ecosystem.  It's a multiplier of knowledge and speed and agility for their customers and their  partners anytime, anywhere in the world.  You'll not, not just the labs, you get access to articles, case studies, all the  tools you need to make a difference in today's fast paced world.  You want to learn more?  Here's what you do.  You can actually sign up and start using the labs right now.  WWT.com slash twit.  Learn more about worldwide technology.

Uh, there are, I imagine people around you and Dan Moran and people around you are  very excited about the M one.  I've come and gone on this.  I, when apple announced it, I was over the moon as people will know.  And then everybody said, calm down, calm down.  And I said, no, you don't understand.  This is the greatest thing.  And then, uh, then I got mine and I, I, I calmed down because as fast as it is, it  wouldn't run some of the things that I really wanted, mostly geeky edge stuff  like E max and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it.  Yeah.  And home brew where you're building a lot of stuff, uh, it's not there yet for  apple silicon.  I think that's part of the charm of these max though, is that they're, um,  they're still max and recognizable.  And if most of the stuff you do, they just work.  And so even though it's a lot faster, I mean, the speed you can get for that 999  MacBook air is kind of a mind blowing.  It is still just a Mac doing Mac stuff, but it is the most exciting thing to  happen, I think to the Mac in years.  So we are loving it.

Transcript:  I think you can argue it might be the most exciting thing to happen to  desktop computing in years and maybe not so much the M one, although I have to say  if you, I never used Safari for a long time.  I was just Firefox.  I don't like Chrome.  It's a pig.  And I, and I use Firefox everywhere, Windows, Mac and Linux.  So it was convenient to sync it up, but I'm only using Safari on the M one  MacBook pro because, oh my God, I didn't know the web could be that fast.  I thought it was about bandwidth, but apparently after you get the website,  there's a certain amount of churning that has to go to generate it.  I opened twit.tv.  I said, cause Lisa's been using my old MacBook air and I said, Oh, Lisa,  you're going to want this.  She said, no, I'm not.  I said, Lisa, look, come here.  I'm going to load for the first time ever twit.tv on this site.  It came up literally the whole thing like that.  And it was like mind boggling.  There are, they're definitely doing something pretty amazing.

Start time: 3748.24
End time: 3789.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a lot of stuff going on.  There was a back and forth on Twitter the other week.  That was a cranky reviewer basically saying Apple has cheated by making  JavaScript so fast, which I mean, it's faster.  That's not cheating.  Everything's faster.  But it's interesting to see when you control your own operating system and  you built your own chip, you can prioritize certain kinds of tasks.  So like I can edit 4k video on that MacBook air, the 999 MacBook air,  and it is way better at it, way more capable than on a $5,000 iMac  pro from three years ago.  And why is that?  It's because Apple's got a lot of video and code decode stuff that it built in  because it knows people edit video on their platforms and that results is

Start time: 3790.94
End time: 3876.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  great. That's why having the hardware and the software together works because  you can make a purpose built chip.  Now I'm going to say though, so one of the tools that I really love and use,  and it's very much an edge case is it's a programming environment and language  called racket and they have a IDE called doctor racket and it didn't work.  One of the guys, Matthew flat spent some energy.  Didn't take him that long.  He three days after he got his M1 Mac, he said, okay, I've made it work.  And it compiles and works.  And now I guarantee you that Apple did not optimize for doctor racket.  It's a scheme like language. It's like, you know, I mean, I know they didn't have to,  that thing. I won't,  I can't use my iMac pro with 64 gigs of Ram and 10 cores anymore because it's a,  it feels like a pig.  So it is faster across the board, even in things Apple didn't contemplate.  There's a, there's a Lisp that I use SBCL steel bank, common Lisp.  That is somebody asked one of the maintainers, are you going to do it?  Are you going to update it? Cause it won't run at all. There is stuff that literally,  it won't even run on Rosetta. Just won't run. And he said, no,  I don't have an M1 Mac. So I said, look, let me buy you one cause I want this.  And they put up a fundraiser. He's actually raising, he's raised,  I think enough money now to buy at least a Mac mini eventually he's going to,  uh, it's on, it's on Reddit. So he put up a fundraiser for it.  Thank goodness because if these, if people spend a little time, it's not,  it's, it's little tweaks on some of its big security tweaks.  It's not even the M1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you rely on that app, that's $700 well spent to that guy in Mac mini. Right.  So my question for you, Leo is what does Microsoft, what does Qualcomm,  you know, what is the response?  Is this enough of a game changer in terms of price, you know,  and power and, and, uh,  and uh,  energy usage for the PC side to look at this and say,  we have to find a way to be more integrated than we are right now.  Or is it just not a big deal?

Start time: 3903.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right now what I see from PC people for the most part is yeah,  tell me when you can run an Aradeon GTX, uh, 6 30 or  yeah. Tell me when Far Cry looks good on it, but they're missing the point.  And I don't think it's the pressure's on quite yet. Here's what I see, Jason,  I think it's going to be very interesting. This M1 is really, really,  really fast, but this is the first one. Yeah.  The low end chip chip on the low end next year and the year after,  what about a Mac pro with that has 64 cores, you know,  32 high efficiency, 32 low, lower efficient, you know, high, low, uh,  power. And, um, I don't know,  64 core GPU built into the system on a chip with 64 gigs of  Ram of unified memory architecture. But when did that,  when that comes out in a year or two,  then what is the PC industry going to say? The pressure will mount.  And I suspect, I actually told people on the radio show,  this might be jumping the gun. I said, buy a Mac mini and start learning Mac OS.  I know you hate Mac OS. I know you hate Apple. I know you hate it,  but trust me in a year you'll wish you were using it.  Cause I don't think Microsoft and Qualcomm can compete.

Start time: 3974.72
End time: 4004.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. If I'm Microsoft, I do have to start thinking about like,  is there a way for us to, to how,  how do we be more Apple like?  Cause I think they've been playing that game for a while now and it's really  served them pretty well to be like,  what are the secrets to Apple having its own hardware with its own software?  And we've seen that with the surface line, but the challenge now is that,  you know, that it's Intel or, or a Qualcomm essentially,  making these chips that they can shop for and it's not integrated and they're  not able to take advantage like Apple has.  I don't know where it goes from there.

Start time: 4005.70
End time: 4035.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has to be Microsoft,  but Microsoft's never going to do it because they have all these other  companies that make windows computers and they can't screw them.  So it's the problem. It's the innovator's dilemma kind of,  the problem is you can't cannibalize your existing business.  Only Apple's business sucked so bad that they could do that.  That's not actually fair,  but they were small enough and they made enough money on the iPhone that they  didn't mind disrupting the Macintosh ecosystem.

Start time: 4035.82
End time: 4045.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause they figured that their users will come with them.  They've always figured that,  which is why they've done like three or four chip transitions and they did the  OS 10 transition and they just figured that they're going to come along for the  ride. And they generally do.

Transcript:  They also didn't need Mac to be,  it was a small part of their business. It's a little wedge on your graph.  So they don't, they can afford to cannibalize Mac a little bit.  And I'd be honest, I think anybody, look, I have a,  that's a $6,000 iMac pro that I'm not going to use much anymore.  It's this is a,  I don't think people understand how much this is going to disrupt the Intel Mac  world. It's, it's a different game.

Transcript:  I mean, it's all, it's almost already over for,  for people who are looking at this from the other side and saying, you know,  how fast are these low end chips?  The only Macs that are running Intel that are faster than it are a couple of  i9 configured to order iMacs at the very, very high end,  the most expensive iMacs you can buy and the iMac pro and Mac pro with the Xeon  processor. That's it. So like the every other Mac, every other iMac,  every other MacBook pro,  they're all slower than a 999 MacBook or a 699 Mac mini,  which, you know, if you extrapolate,  what's the next chip going to be like and what else is Apple going to do?  But it's starting from this position.  These are the weakest Apple silicon chips that will ever be in Macs.  And they're already like just dramatically more powerful.

Transcript:  Yeah. And I don't know,  PC people hate it when we say this because it's just, they go, oh no,  don't worry. AMD and Intel can do this. I feel like there may be,  maybe they'll try, but I don't know. I don't know.  This is some pretty secret magic secret sauce they got,  Apple's got going on. And it's not like this is the first time they've made an  ARM chip. They've been doing this since 2007.  They kind of know what they're doing. So I don't think there's  pressure yet. The pressure will mount.  And over the next year or two, people have no, I mean,  the potential for this chip is mind boggling. And as soon as I can get, you know,  the things that I need, I found an EMAX,  a development version of EMAX that runs native.  Once you get things running native,  the problem is a lot of stuff doesn't even run on a Rosetta. Like some of the weird,

Transcript:  Yeah, it's not, it's not great,  but the idea here that the,  this hardware that is running in a virtual machine on Apple Silicon is still able  to put it out like that. I,  I think that's a good example where I think it's really Microsoft, right?  Windows ARM is not a product, right?  It's only bundled with hardware and now there's another place it could potentially  run. And I imagine it will. I mean, I wrote a thing,  I think this week basically said it's going to happen.  It's just a matter of when they're ready,  but it's clearly possible for that stuff to happen. So that'll all get there.  But yeah, there, you know, it is a chip transition. Like as boring as it is,  there's still going to be some things that don't work.  And there are still some reasons to use an Intel Mac if you're,  if you're on one because it all works and that platform has been there for 15  years.

Transcript:  Anyway, I know, I know windows people hate me when I say this.  So  not all, and you know what? I'll make, I'll make up for it. And meanwhile,  in Italy, Apple's in big trouble.  This will make you feel better. $12 million fine,  which is basically the cigarette money in Tim Cook's couch. But  it's there. I think they're absolutely right.  It's for misleading iPhone water resistance claims.  And the Italian watchdog cited this famous, I won't play the audio,  but the famous ad where they have an iPhone 12 in a test chamber and they do all  sorts of miserable things to it, including dumping a ton of water on it.  And it turns out that the iPhone,  you can only call the iPhone 11 and 12 waterproof if in specific lab  conditions with the use of static, pure distilled water.  And, and, and for, yeah, you can't,  you can't dump a wedding cake on it and make it rain. But furthermore,  and I think this was really the big issue was Apple,  their warrant. And I know this because I had it happen to me.  They will not warranty water damage. So they advertise water resistant,  but then they get, don't get it wet. Cause if it breaks,  No, it's outrageous.

Start time: 4306.38
End time: 4357.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's outrageous that they advertise water and dust resistance.  But if you drop your phone in the toilet or in the pool and it,  it dies because the water entered and broke something, they won't cover it.  So, you know, what they basically say, I've asked them about this time and again,  and what they say is we're making it less likely that when you drop it in the  water that you'll need to replace it.  But if you drop it and you need to replace it, you got to pay.  And I think it's, I don't like that,  but I really hate it when they then roll out an ad campaign like they did last  year for the iPhone 11 series,  where they're showing it be impervious to all these things,  because the implication there I would say is that it's safe for you to drop it in  the water and that if it fails, that's Apple's failure. And Apple's saying, no,  if it fails, it's your problem. And it's ridiculous.  Yeah.

And I, you know,  after that I'm like blowing all like trying to get water out.  And I'm like hoping that this is not going to be the phone that, that, you know,  this one's the time that it dies, but it happens so often. So yeah.

Transcript:  I mean, I will say having tested these things,  they have done a lot lately in the last like five years of making the iPhone  more water resistant and dust resistant and shatterproof.  It still will break. But I think as an iPhone user,  it's really nice to know that if I drop it, cause I've done that, yeah,  drop it in water, there's a good chance it'll be fine.  And five years ago that was not true. So that part of it is good.  It's just making this as a claim that I think is misleading that if, uh,  if it breaks it's Apple's fault, cause they'll still blame you. Yeah. Yeah.

Also placed our best game winner for iPhone game of the year.  Legends of rune Tara iPad game of the year.  Disco Elysium game of the year.  Dandara trials of fear. Apple TV game of the year.  And for Apple arcade, sneaky Sasquatch, which is kind of fun.  Okay. I guess it's cute. Yeah.  You're a Sasquatch and you have to sneak around. Um,  all right. Just thought I'd mention it. No big deal.  I don't understand it. Since we're in the Apple section. Uh,  I don't understand this acquisition and why they're making a big deal about it.  Former venture capitalistic Greylock partners.  He led early investments in discord and musically hired away from  Greylock Josh Elman to run the app store.  Jason, you probably know why this is a big deal.  Why would Apple hire this VC to run the app store?

Start time: 4600.87
End time: 4641.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the best pitch I could do cause I really am a little bit boggled by this is  probably that Apple views app store revenue is important because it's part of  their services revenue and that they view enhancing app store revenue by  selling more apps as being super valuable.  And this guy is going to help, uh,  figure out how to get more apps in front of people and sell more apps and  generate more app store revenue. And that's sort of his thing. Um,  but it's a, it's a weird one,  unless there's some behind the scenes like secret power of his that we're not  aware of that also to leave VC and go work for Apple is an interesting choice  for him too. That's a,  that's gotta be a real change in pace and attitude.

But again,  venture capital guy playing with money all day, rolling around.  And that's what they do. Right.  That's what VCs do is roll around and money all day.

Start time: 4707.24

Transcript:  Yeah. We'll see how long that lasts. Apple did do, and I want to give them kudos.  They reduced the commission for anybody except Epic and Spotify to practically,

Start time: 4719.10
End time: 4723.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

End time: 4764.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From 30% to 15%, if you make more than a million, you got to pay the 30%.  Now the international book publishing association, or I'm sorry,  independent book publishing association says, Hey, what about books?  You still charge 30% for Apple books. Let's,  let's lower the price there too.  Is Apple doing this because they're really nice and they feel like they've  overcharged people all this time,  or are they doing it more because they're looking at the antitrust action going  on all around them.  And the amount of time Tim Cook's spending on the Hill and going,  eh, we better do something.

Start time: 4765.78
End time: 4784.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's such a small amount. It's not going to really affect them, right?  These are for people that are made, that made the last year, a million or less.  Right?  So it's not going to be a huge dent for Apple to be able to that causes a whole  bunch of goodwill, whole bunch of, you know, we dealt with it and it does,  you know, put a little bit of a pin into Epic.  I'm sure that that made them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean,  it's a vast majority of their developers and a teeny tiny fraction of the money  that passes through the app store. So it's a great PR move.  And you could see in the anger of,  of those guys like David Hannah Meyer Hansen and, and the, and Sweeney,  right? You could see there, they were kind of rageful when this,  it was a good chess move. It was a good chess move.

Start time: 4814.46
End time: 4830.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're so right, Jason. You're so right. Right. Cause they were,  especially when, when Tim was coming out, like I'm gonna,  I'm doing this for the little guy. I'm fighting for those companies.  And that's what we're going into it. And then they said, Oh, guess what?  We'll take care of the little guys. We just won't take care of you.

Start time: 4830.98
End time: 4842.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's a very good point too.  It didn't cost them that much because the bulk of the revenue from the app  store, do you think comes from people over a million bucks?  That's really where the big bucks is for them.

Start time: 4842.92
End time: 4857.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. It's the big, it's the big whales who were doing like lots of in-app  purchase and stuff like that. That,  that's where the bulk of the money comes from.  So it is one of these things that has a big impact in terms of like a happy  story about a small business without it really cutting into Apple's bottom line  very much.

Transcript:  Okay. Can I, can I posit a question? I'm listening to this and I,  I'm not an Apple device user these days. And, and no, actually I care.  I care greatly. I, I,  I'm not sure where Apple came up with its 30%  number in the first place.  And even 15% sounds to me to be very,  very high for what they are doing, which is a fairly passive thing.

Start time: 4904.28
End time: 4919.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  30 is not bad at all. I mean, if you were selling in the old days,  if you're selling your software through Ingram or any of the big distributors,  they take 50%. Sure.  Microsoft and Sony both take 30% for game titles sold in their platforms.  30 is kind of the going rate, I think.

Start time: 4920.62
End time: 4930.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they doing that? Are they, are they doing that because they,  because Apple started taking a 30% take from the iTunes store first?  It's just, I think it's the standard.

Start time: 4931.00
End time: 4992.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think in 2008 as well, which was, you know,  a very different period than it is now. Like Leo said,  30% was a number that maybe they pulled out of a hat,  but you look around at other closed platforms and it didn't seem unreasonable.  And at the, in the, in the moment, it seemed great.  It actually seemed generous because in fact, Steve Jobs at one point said,  or you can sell it for free and we won't charge you anything.  And we'll host the download and you don't have to pay anything.  It's completely free if you want your app to be free.  And at the time that was like, wow, that's really generous of them.  So it's just only over time. And they make some disingenuous arguments,  right? Because it's not like you couldn't buy software online in 2008.  You could. And, and for a lot using Kagi or something like that. And you could,  you could,  you would share a lot less of the money with your processor than 30%.  But it was still, you know,  not unreasonable for the time looking at it as a closed platform.  It's just that in 2020 it looks a little bit, uh,  less generous. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And unlike Kagi, I mean,

End time: 5025.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's fair at this point. I think that's very fair.  And if you're making a million dollars a year,  the funny thing is if you're making a million dollars a year,  it's a lot of money you're giving Apple that 15% is a significant difference.

Transcript:  All right. Tell me I'm wrong. Doesn't he look like he belongs in Brooklyn?  You could, you look like, you know, you look like Seth.  There were crickets there, man. There were crickets.  Well, they're all, they're too polite. They're too polite.  People at home were thinking, yeah, Brooklyn for sure. Yeah, definitely.  So I don't know.  There is labor strife aplenty at Google.  The NLRB is now accusing Google  of surveilling its employees and other labor violations.  They investigated the firing of several employees in November, a year ago,  not this past November.  And they say the Google violated parts of the national labor relations act by  surveilling employees and generally interfering with restraining and coercing  employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed by the national labor  relations act. You have the right, by the way.  If you're my employees, stop listening for a second.  You have the right to form, join or assist a union or engage in other  protected concerted activities. Don't you dare.  No, I don't care.  The complaint makes it clear workers have the right to speak to issues of  not merely unionizing, but ethical business.  And that's a big deal.  On the heels of that, Google fired perhaps the best known black expert on  ethics and AI, Timit Gebru.  She was fired after she complained that her research had been suppressed by  Google. Now more than 1500 researchers and 1200 Google employees have signed a  petition protesting her firing.  This is always a challenge for me to weigh into these.  The story from Google is she said,  I will resign if you continue to suppress this or at least not tell me why you're  suppressing this research. And then Google said, and so she resigned.  She says, no, I didn't resign. I was fired.  The dispute arose last month when a senior manager at Google told her that she  would have either have to retract or remove her name from a paper she had  co-authored by researchers inside and outside Google saying,  and this is the reason by the way Google hired her in the first place,  saying the technology companies could do more to ensure AI systems do not  exacerbate historic gender biases.  She says, I feel like we were censored.  And I thought this had implications for all ethical AI research.  You're not going to have pay. This is, she was talking to wired.  You're not going to have papers that make the company happy all the time and  don't point out problems.  That's antithetical to what it means to be that kind of researcher. That's why,  you know, she was brought in to help Google with ethics.  She's the technical co-lead of Google's ethical AI team.  So Google and a lot of labor issues right now.

Transcript:  So just Leo, just to be clear, legally,  if you say you're going to resign at some point in the future and then you're,  or you're thinking about quitting or something like that,  and they terminate you immediately, you got fired. Legally. You got, she,  they fired her. And although her boss's boss's boss can say, Oh no, we,  we accept her resignation. It's not true.  That wasn't a resignation. Yeah. It's not a resignation. She was saying,  it was also like a, if this is true that you're going to do this,  we're going to need to plan for me to leave because this is an unacceptable  choice that you made. And they're like, well, you're fired.  And then they can claim that it's a resignation, but it's not also their defense  of what they didn't like about the paper is amazing. Cause it's basically like,  it didn't have enough sources, which it had like a hundred sources.  But it seems very clear that what, what Google didn't like about it is  they wanted to insert some things that maybe softened it or made it seem a  little bit easier.  They basically want to use some PR spin on an academic paper,  which is not,  I think it really makes everybody should stop and say,  why are big companies like this hiring people to do research like this?  Because clearly they don't want independent research and independent thought.  They want something that'll back up whatever their corporate desire is.  That's the message that this firing sends, I think.

Start time: 5627.28
End time: 5643.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's the more serious issue.  Because, you know, it means she was a figurehead.  They hired her to make it look like they cared.  But the minute she did anything that challenged the status quo, it was like,  see ya. We don't really care.

Transcript:  And they call out a bunch of the processes that Google has for submitting papers  and said, well, you know, by the letter of the law.  And then what we've heard in the last few days is they never followed that.  There were all sorts of things that were submitted at the last minute.  People didn't get fired over it. People weren't told to stand down.  So in the cases where they can say that she violated some of their rules,  they were rules that were never enforced before.

Transcript:  One of the things Google didn't like was in the paper,  they talked about these large AI models consume a huge amount of processing power  and hence a lot of electricity.  Google is very sensitive about this energy usage.  You know, they've gone 100% carbon neutral, etc., etc.  They said, well, that's old information.  The carbon emissions hasn't been a problem.  But you know what? That's not how you you don't suppress the research to prove  that point.  So, yeah, I think this is.  I, you know, I always hate to weigh in on employment issues because there's  usually a number of things we don't know, information we don't know about the  whole process. But this does not look good for Google at all.  The so-called do not be evil company is looking more and more evil.

Transcript:  They got rid of that for a reason, right?  Yeah.  They got rid of that. You went, oh, no, wait.  Why isn't that your tagline anymore?  Yeah.  But it also shows that it's such a hard thing to actually stand up to a certain  amount of values when you work for these companies, because I think like she's  one person that stood up and said, you know what?  I'm going to stand by my research.  Right.  How difficult it is to be able to do that against these large, like any company,  to be able to stand up against the people that hired you, that hired you for a reason.  And yes, you're absolutely right.  It was so that they could look like they were doing the right thing and then they  could hopefully squeeze it out to make it look like they're not doing as bad of a  job as this paper showed that they were.

Transcript:  And I think that out of 100 people, I think that there would only be a handful of  researchers that would be able to stand up.  It takes so much fortitude and it goes to stand where these companies cannot police  themselves for this reason.  This is one of the things that shows that these companies do a very poor job.  In the end, the company's job is to take care of themselves, not to take care of you.  HR is for the company.  HR is not for the workers.  They just look like they're for the workers.

Transcript:  And I think it's important to also mention that it's not just that other employees were  allowed to get away with rule bending and so on according to Google's own explanation  of what happened, but that the one time that they come down on somebody happens to be an  African American woman who is already in an extreme minority at the company.  This is such a horrific bad look for Google, at the very least.  I can't imagine that there's a single labor attorney in California that is not rubbing  its hand, rubbing their hands, hoping that they get this case because she's got a really  good case and Google is on the ropes with it.  And they're not going to come out of this smelling well no matter what happens.

Transcript:  And this is a PR own goal, right?  Like, honestly, you've got an ethics researcher.  You fire her in this way.  It's public.  Her message was public.  The people know she had outside collaborators who were going to have the paper.  We're going to know everything about it.  That's what I don't get about it.  Like, Leo's right.  We never know about behind the scenes things.  Maybe there's something where people at Google weren't happy with her work and they wanted  her out anyway.  Why would you do it this way in this public way that makes you seem like a villain?  I don't I don't understand why they did it the way they did it, even if they decided  that they hated the paper and that they really wish it had been better.  I think the right thing to do as a as a crisis advisor would be you just got a letter  published because you hired independent researchers.

Transcript:  And you could argue that however damaging this paper was, if Google was seen having  had their people involved in it, it would almost be like a credit to Google.  Like, look at what Google is allowing.  They're allowing criticism of aspects of Google because they've got this group that does  independent ethics research.  Instead, it sends the opposite message, which is don't believe anything that comes from  people who work at Google because the only stuff that they let out is good PR.

Start time: 5932.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  And one of the worst things is, is that of all the various fields that are connected  to tech that do need independent review, that do need a real close encounter with an  ethics committee, machine learning and algorithms, I think, are, you know, have to be up at the  top.  There's, you know, there are other places that do this.  But if it doesn't happen in the companies and the companies are not subject to outside  scrutiny, it almost isn't going to have much of an effect.  Right.  We need to know as users what's going into these algorithms that are deciding what we see on  Facebook, what shows up in Google search, you know, how Amazon is determining what products to  show us.  I think these are all really crucial questions.  And for Google to do this at this time is just so boneheaded.  It's a bad look, at the least.

Transcript:  The MIT Technology Review, Karen Howe has a story.  They got the paper.  They summarized it.  But I think the re if you ask why should I care?  It's an employment issue.  The reason you should care comes in the last paragraph of the story.  It's a quote from Emily Bender, who was one of the co-authors of Gebru's paper.  Bender worries, they say, that Google's actions could create a chilling effect on future AI  ethics research.  Many of the top experts in AI ethics work at large tech companies because that's where the  money is.  Bender says this has been beneficial in many ways, but we end up with an ecosystem that maybe  has incentives that are not the very best ones for the progress of science for the world.  You know, I think everybody understands that AI is a cash cow for a lot of these companies.  It's important for research.  It's important for us as a country.  But that there are potential ethical landmines here.  And it's really important that ethics researchers are able to weigh in on this and say things  like, for instance, one of Gebru's previous studies was the one that found that women of  color were something like 40 percent misrecognized by face recognition technologies because  they've been trained on white men.  And so she was the one who first rang the alarm on this.  That stuff is important.  Otherwise, these these AI tools get used to they have built in biases and they can really  screw things up.  And so it's it's absolutely paramount if Google's going to be doing AI research or any  company that they have independent ethics people there who have the power to say, no,  this is bad. This is wrong.  Without fear of censorship, it really is risky.  It's really I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder if and this is a very dark turn.  So I apologize.  But I wonder if this is kind of like the polodium tea, like that they're fine with it.  They are there to send a chilling effect that, you know, what?  Be careful what you choose to stand up against us, because we'll fire you and we really  don't care. And that's probably the case.  Back to us.

Transcript:  You know, the truth is, there's a lot of outside independent research that's funded, you  know, that comes from places that are funded by corporate money, and they're not necessarily  independent either.  The tragedy here is the advantage of having somebody a group like this inside Google is  you get they get access to Google and Google's tech.  And it is important for us all to have somebody who's looking at what Google is doing and  not from the outside.  But at this point, it's hard to see without a pretty dramatic turn on Google's part that  anybody is going to really look at the output of that group without a huge amount of  skepticism. And I feel bad for the other people who work in that group, because I would  imagine they're all going to feel like they have to go somewhere else in order to reclaim  their credibility.  So it's a it's a real like I said, it's an own goal by by Google.  Like they even if they were unhappy with her or some of the work she was doing, I you  would think that they would move sort of silently in the background to sort of just wind it  up and and finish the program or have her go to the door.  And instead, they just did this.  I'm glad they did. I'm glad I do.

End time: 6222.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We all benefit from knowing the truth.  Yeah, it focuses our minds.  You know, companies are doing research have a high I think they have a high ethical  requirement to pay attention to what the impacts of this research are.  And if they don't, they need to be regulated.  Then something you know, this is where government needs to step in and say, no, no,

Start time: 6222.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so there is a solution here, I think.  And I can not foresee any future on any, you know, version of Earth in the multiverse  that would that it would fly.  But the real solution, I think, is is that these companies, especially when they're publicly  traded, need to have a corporate ethics ombudsman.  And that person cannot be a figurehead and they have to have some kind of power within the  company. That's really the only way I could  see, you know, Google coming out of this looking better.  And I can't see that happening.  But I would love to see it.  Unions, unions, unions would help.  I absolutely think that that tech is tech employees who, you know, are developers and  whatnot are long overdue to unionize.  But again, like, I think people look at their salaries, I think people look at their own  salaries and say, what do we need a union for?  That would that would hamper our our earning ability if it's tied to metrics.  And they look at the way that unions have have gone in the US over the past 30 years  and say, what do we need any of that drama for either?  But I agree.  I think unions would be a big a big good place to start.

Transcript:  There's a long history of these companies kind of playing lip service to corporate ethics  and doing the right thing.  And it's all just a veneer.  Facebook or Oversight Board is a perfect example of this.  They are now starting to hear cases.  But we're learning that the cases they hear, they won't be ruled on for 90 days.  Like, oh, yeah, 90 days later.  Oh, we were wrong to take that content down.  I'm sorry.  Do you want us to put it back up?  No, no one cares about it.  It's over. Thank you.  So there's all sorts of all sorts of issues.  The idea of the Oversight Board.  Very I mean, the people they picked were very impressive.  And the idea was that you could appeal to them about Facebook takedowns or maybe that  something that should be taken down is not taken down.  But the problem is the board can only take up appeals against removal of content.  I'm sorry. So I was wrong.  It's only about removal.  It can't look at where cases were disputed materials left up.  It can't review cases that aren't appealed.  And it's it's got to operate completely in secrecy.  Members of the board can't discuss their work except through Facebook PR.  It you know, just overall.  And they have 90 days to reach conclusions.  They've selected out of 20,000 appeals.  They've selected their first six.  So this is a perfect example of Facebook doing something that looks good on paper is great PR  is completely pointless.

It was like 2010 or maybe 2011.  And almost 300,000 people voted for it in the U.S.  But because 300,000 U.S. voters is equal, even back then was equal to, you know, some, you know, tiny percentage of Facebook users.  And they decided that it was for global.  It had to be a global percentage of global users.  And it count. Yeah.  And so it didn't go anywhere.

Transcript:  So here's the here's the six questions that they're going to look at.  Should a set of Instagram posts that showed nipples be allowed considering the photos were part of a breast cancer prevention program?  They really picked like tough, tough things to decide.  Should historical quotes from Nazi propagandist Joseph Gebel's be allowed to circulate even if they're in violation of Facebook's dangerous individuals policy?  Should screenshots of tweets, not even Facebook posts, but tweets by Malaysian prime minister stay up in order to raise awareness of the hateful nature of his bigotry or be removed because they violate the hate speech policy?  Should posts criticizing the French government be reinstated despite their allusions to alternative treatments for covid?  There nothing about conservative politicians being censored.  Nothing about QAnon.  Nothing about anti-vaxxers.  Some of the most thorny problems facing Facebook completely ignored.  So, you know, it's just PR.  We knew it. But now we know it.  You know what I mean?  We know it, man.  Facebook says we will remove misinformation about covid vaccines.  You know, as we get closer to actual working vaccines, they're going to start to be distributed at the end of this month in the United States to health care workers.  And it is expected that most of the nation will have access to either the Moderna or what is it?  The Pfizer is the second one vaccine by April.  What's going to be really important is a public relations and marketing campaign to get people to take these vaccines.  What's going to be really important is to get stuff saying don't get vaccinated off Facebook.  Right?  Or maybe I'm maybe I'm biased in this matter.  That's where it's going to really be where the rubber is going to hit the road, as they say.  Yeah.

Transcript:  I mean, this is this is one of the big concerning things about the firing of Chris Krebs, who is the leader of the of CISA, the cybersecurity division at DHS,  is that not only was he working on, you know, on securing the election and providing factual information in a digestible way to counter election disinformation,  he was also working on a very similar project for covid vaccines and not having a figurehead running that as we start getting into a place where we have vaccines that can fight covid, I think is really just it's utterly messed up.  I mean, Biden, of course, will be will put somebody in there.  But, you know, even though Krebs is a lifelong Republican, he was doing the right thing, regardless of politics.  And and it's certainly going to set the agency back in their efforts to fight vaccine misinformation and disinformation.

The big four Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, we've seen to some extent all four of these countries doing some kind of espionage or spying, trying to get intellectual property related to the vaccine.  And what we had been thinking through at CESA was not just the vaccine developers, but the entire supply chain trying to undermine, not merely steal the idea or the recipe, but actually trying to undermine the program.  And I expect there will be big disinformation campaigns as well from these countries.  This is this is going to be a big issue.  And it's really sad that Krebs is no longer running CESA because this is this is as important as anything he was doing.  And it's going to be a big problem.  Yeah. So. But of course, you know, that's the world we live in right now.  The good you know, what's interesting is despite all of the pressures against him, he was able to make the election run well.  Is it I should I should this is your your your bailiwick, Seth, is it considered he said it was the most secure election we've ever had.  Even in 2016, there wasn't really any assertion that the Russians tried to change vote counts.  It was mostly disinformation campaigns and things like that.

It's a very heterogeneous system.  And we talked to election experts before 2016, including Ron Rivest.  And everybody has there's been a strong consensus since that time that a paper trail fixes the problem.  And I think we do here in the four years intervening between 2016 and 2020.  That was a thanks to Chris Krabs, among others, very successful notion that we put in much more secure systems.

Transcript:  Yes. Well, we we did.  We sort of did it in a haphazard.  Well, that's the election system in the US.  No, no, no, it had nothing.  It had nothing really. It had nothing to do with the with the election system.  But if there's any, you know, if you're a Mandalorian fan and you remember the episode where the the Mon Calamari guy fixed his fixed the Mandalorians ship Razor Crest with a whole bunch of string entwined, that's sort of what happened.  There was a whole bunch of string entwined that led to an improvement in the number of states that created a paper trail.  But it wasn't from a federal government mandate, which is really unfortunate.  And it means that there are still states and large jurisdictions in some states that do not produce paper trails.  It's it's better than it was in 2016, but it's better than it was by luck, by just people fighting and getting small victories in their own jurisdictions.  The you know, ironically, the defeat of Stacey Abrams in Georgia in 2018 led to Georgia and it led to a lawsuit.  And the consequences of that lawsuit were to mandate that Georgia has to have a risk limiting audit.  So in addition to it improved paper trail in Georgia, they also had to do the recounts.  And that's what led to that's what's led to this runoff.  There's been a lot of improvements made, but they're not systemic.  And there's still plenty of opportunity for backsliding.  You know, these are things that I think are tenuous right now.  But yes, 2020 was no doubt a much safer election than 2016 in terms of cybersecurity, in terms of reacting, reacting to widespread disinformation campaigns.  And it's not that the campaigns didn't happen.  The campaigns were absolutely out there.  But there was just more of an effort to get to get factual information out there.  A lot more jurisdictions were on board with it, as well as, you know, national agencies like DHS, CISA.

It's not everybody.  But those people, I think, are influencers in their own circles.  And so when they're not on Twitter, they're probably talking things up.  And I think just news reports about, you know, somebody taking some kind of action against leadership driven disinformation is, you know, probably helped out a lot more than than we think.

I want to talk about that HBO thing in just a second.  The Warner Media thing.  Very interesting.  But first a word by from Casper, my mattress.  Man, did I sleep good last night.

Transcript:  Screw the residents.  I'm growing pumpkins.  Right.  Pretty soon, nobody will buy the pumpkins and then you'll be sorry.  All right.  Let's talk.  I want to actually, this is a big story.  Jason, because you cover media with a lot of your shows, is something you've been kind  of aware of.  Let's go back in time.  The Trump administration fought it for a couple of years, but AT&T wanted to buy Warner Media.  And boy, this was a big acquisition.  More than $100 billion.  And they finally got through.  The Trump administration tried to slow it down.  Eventually, a judge was convinced by AT&T that nothing bad will happen.  So this is following Comcast buying NBCUniversal.  I mean, this has been what's happened is that Viacom buying CBS, as these channels, the  distributors, the delivery companies, the streamers buy content up and they're just  all vying.  Eventually, everything will be owned by Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, the big ISPs.  So they bought Warner Brothers.  They got HBO.  They got Turner.  They got all sorts of things like DC Comics, which by the way, the first thing they did  was Kill Mad Magazine.  Why are you on a...  It's such a bummer.  God, it just makes me mad.  It's such a bummer.  But now, then the next thing that happens is that Richard Peppler, who's in charge of  HBO and actually widely considered to be a brilliant movie executive, gets forced out  by AT&T's, eventually became CEO, John Stanky.  And I remember a couple of years ago when Stanky said, and I felt a little chill go  up my spine, HBO needs to be more like Netflix.  Yeah.  That's in effect what's happened.

Transcript:  Everybody is afraid of Netflix's power, right?  Everybody in the entertainment industry, and they all want their own Netflix.  They all want to be their own Netflix.  And everybody took a different path to it.  So Disney took their path to it with Disney+.  And what they wanted to do is WarnerMedia, driven by AT&T, they wanted to create something  where they could pour all of their resources into their own premium streaming service.  And in doing so, they took HBO, which was probably their best property, honestly, their  best brand.  But they said, you can't be HBO anymore.  You need to be Netflix.  And that led to an exodus of HBO executives.  Peppler is now at Apple, I think, right?  Yeah.  Peppler, the pleb is doing his stuff for Apple TV+, yeah, which is actually, I would say,  maybe the streaming service most like classic HBO, in that they're focused on originals.  You know, meanwhile, HBO Max now, like they are trying to be Netflix.  And Jason Kilar, who's a smart guy, who was the founder of Hulu, basically, is running  it.  And, you know, it's a, they're playing a different game.  And now with the story, I assume we're about to talk about, they've got some content that's  really interesting and may actually motivate people to sign up for this service, which  apparently so far, most of the people who actually are eligible to get HBO Max have just  not bothered to sign up for it.

Start time: 7798.94
End time: 7858.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in classic antitrust theory, the way it works is a company becomes bigger and bigger,  pushes out all the competition.  And one way they do it is by undercutting the competition, selling below cost and so  forth until the competition is gone.  They control everything and then they raise prices through the roof.  I think this is exactly what's happening.  Warner Brothers has announced that starting in 2021, I don't think it's going to end,  but they're going to release all their new movies, both on HBO Max and in theaters.  They'll be on HBO Max for a period of a month.  They gave the theater companies one hour notice of this.  And distributors like AMC and Regal, who are this close to going bankrupt anyway, thanks  to COVID-19, are freaked out.  It is going to be a huge threat to the future of motion picture theaters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, for sure.  For sure.  It's actually starting Christmas Day, right?  Because it's with Wonder Woman 84.  And then going on, there'll be a one month window where those will be playing not just  in theaters, but on HBO Max.  And then after a month, it will go to online sales and rental and Blu-rays and whatever  else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I think this summer is ambitious at best.  I think we're going to see a very slow and measured rollout of a vaccine.  And I think that this is actually probably the only way that HBO could make any of its  money back.  I understand that theaters are freaked out.  You know, there's a whole sidebar we could do on what AT&T has done to DC Comics.  But, you know, ultimately, at least for the movies, there I don't see any other option.  You're sitting on these things which are done.  They're in the can.  They're waiting to go.  And there's not going to be butts in seats at theaters.  It's insane.  I wouldn't I mean, I don't know that I'd even go to a theater that a friend of mine rented  out and there were, you know, 15 seats per person.  Like, I just don't know that that kind of risk is worth it these days.  And I think a lot of other people are making a similar calculation, especially with the  massive spikes in COVID going on around the world right now.  It's not just the U.S.  It's everywhere is seeing a resurgence.  And I'm just I would not go into a theater.  Bottom line.

Start time: 7991.93
End time: 8078.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's the excuse.  I feel like really this is WarnerMedia saying jumping on that and saying, good, we could  put these theaters out of business.  AMC's CEO slammed their plan saying they're going to lose not AMC.  Warner is going to lose a ton of money.  This is the statement published by The Hollywood Reporter.  Clearly, WarnerMedia intends to sacrifice a considerable portion of the profitability  of its movie studio division and that of its production partners and filmmakers to  subsidize its HBO Max startup.  I would submit that's exactly what you do if you're a monopoly is you is you you give  up profit for a short term in the long term, hoping and what better to be the you know,  this is this was, by the way, one of the very first antitrust cases was in the movie  companies which owned all the theaters were forced to divest the theaters because when  you own the production and the distribution, there's no competition.  And I think this is what I think this is what Stanky is going for.  I love saying that name.  I think this is what Stanky is going for.  AMC says we will do all in our power to ensure that Warner does not do this at our expense.  We will aggressively pursue economic terms that preserve our business.  They said we made a deal for Wonder Woman 1984 because we knew the theaters wouldn't  be reopening by Christmas.  But this is all of 2021.  And this is not the deal we made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, listen, I don't want to I'm not a big fan of the movie theater chains either.  I think that they have had a their own little not they're not motivated and have not been  motivated for a long time to actually have a good product because they had exclusivity in  terms of these windows of time when they're only in theaters.  And that may be coming to an end.  I think people will still want to go to movie theaters in the long run.  But I think that they're going to go for reasons that are not time exclusivity.  They're going to be going because they want to be with an audience because they want to see a big  screen because they want to get food with their their movie and like have an experience.  It's going to be different.  And a lot of these movie theater chains that have theaters that are getting by on a terrible  experience and we've all been in those theaters because it was the only place that you could see  the Marvel movie of the week.  That's going to they're not going to be able to get away with that necessarily.  That all said, I do believe and Seth said it the whole idea that even if people come back to the theaters  over the summer, it's going to be at 40 percent or 20 percent or 50 percent.  We don't know. It's not 100 percent.  The big challenge is if you're Warner or Disney, you can't make a movie for two or three hundred  million dollars for streaming.  It doesn't work.

Start time: 8162.48
End time: 8210.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The money's not there.  People aren't going to pay like they do in a theater.  So they're going to be motivated in the long run to have those big 10 polls that cost hundreds of  millions of dollars.  And there's some exclusivity and they get them into theaters because otherwise the alternative is  those 300 million dollar movies are going to not be made anymore.  And instead, everything's going to be the Mandalorian.  Everything's going to be a hundred million dollar Marvel movie that goes directly to Disney plus.  And I think that while we will probably see more of that, I think there will still be a place for the  big blockbuster that cost a fortune in the movie theater.  But like how many of those theaters exist and whether to your point, Leo, they're all studio owned  and operated or there are things that are more like, you know, some of these special like restaurant  movie theater chains that we see.  Like Alamo or maybe IMAX.

Start time: 8327.94
End time: 8339.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then they might have some streaming partners overseas or they may just wait.  But I think the window for the rest of it's going to be really like a month later.  So it may be on video in those markets on like January 25th, for example.

Start time: 8339.96
End time: 8352.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's making the best of a bad situation because they know that either they hold on to it till next year.  As has happened with the James Bond movie.  Or if you're going to release it, you have to release it streaming because nobody's going to go to a movie theater at Christmas.

Start time: 8353.25
End time: 8379.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of this may be contractually driven.  We don't know what's in the contracts on Wonder Woman 84 and whether they had to get it out before the end of the year.  Yeah, there may be something related to like that related to the movies that are being released that they're releasing on streaming in 2021.  But the other thing that we're forgetting is that they have to pay off their debts.  They have to pay off all the actors and stuff.

Start time: 8379.50
End time: 8409.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They actually have to do it structurally where HBO Max is writing a check to Warner the studio because they have basically there are a bunch of actors and directors and stuff who worked on the movie who have a piece of the box office or related to the box office gross, which no longer exists.  So they've had to and now they have presumably to do that with their whole 2021 slate is like figure out a way to negotiate a rate that is sort of like virtual box office because that is all they have.

Start time: 8409.64
End time: 8471.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure. But we're also forgetting that in especially in terms of video and audio media that a lot of some of the most popular shows over the past 10 years, especially Game of Thrones,  really hit their mark and blew up their audiences because people were torrenting them in countries where they couldn't stream it.  And, you know, I would never encourage anyone to do anything illegal.  But torrenting has been around for 20 years.  People know how it works.  And we've seen that when shows like Game of Thrones get torrented, things that are incredibly popular, they get even more popular.  And and I would be very surprised if that doesn't wind up having an impact, a positive impact on people wanting to go see these movies whenever they do get released into theaters, because we know that's going to happen.  They're not going to keep a tentpole like Wonder Woman 84 out of the theater.  Once theaters reopen, they're going to have some big rewatching experience for it.

Start time: 8471.48
End time: 8515.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in some ways, this might be a positive thing.  Theaters stick around for blockbusters.  People do want the social experience.  But there are great movies like Alfonso Cuarón's Roma, which came out on streaming only on Netflix, that will find an audience.  These aren't 100 million dollar movies.  These are small artistic movies that might find an audience in streaming that they wouldn't have found.  Otherwise, it could be more diversity in films just because there's a more diverse platform for films.  That wouldn't be a bad outcome.  Yeah, I just I wouldn't want to be you know, Alamo Draft House closed 41 theaters this year.  I wouldn't want to be in the theater business this year anyway.  I wouldn't want to be in any business this year.

Start time: 8515.50

We do have a couple of big multiplexes as well.  But you know, there I live in the Richmond district and there are two independent movie theaters here.  You know, a short walk away from where I live for both of them.  And and it's really remarkable that they've been able to eke out a living, you know, up until 2020.  It would be horrible if they closed down.  But I can't imagine, you know, just seeing where things are going that if they can make it into, you know,  post covid times, then they will see a resurgence because people will be so excited to go do things.  And people, at least here, you know, in this city and other large cities, love independent movies.  They love smaller movies.  They love second run movies.  They love it when, you know, Francis Coppola puts out a new cut of Godfather three.  You know, that just happened. I mean, there's all sorts of things that I think are going to be driving people back into theaters.

And, you know, there are a whole bunch of people that I knew who we all bought tickets and drove our cars in.  And it was nice to see people socially, even if distanced for the first time in months.  But they got this giant screen, LED projection, just brighter than, you know, brighter than almost the sun.  I mean, it was just incredible.  You know, and people would either pull in with their hatchbacks or their trucks or they would, you know, whatever.  They tuned the radios to it.  We had our dogs there. I mean, it was great.  It was so much fun.  But, you know, so if there's that kind of thing, that would be great.  But I think, you know, we're going to see more options coming out in the post-COVID world and not fewer.

Transcript:  I want to make a plug for a really good book.  It's a, depends on how you're feeling and what your mood is.  But there's a book called The Song for a New Day by Sarah Pinsker that was one of the Nebula Award nominees, I want to say, from 2019.  And it is literally about a pandemic that changes the phase of live music performance.  Oh, my God.  And how technology, how technology is a replacement, but not a good replacement for live music and how people still, after a pandemic, want to be in spaces together.  And yeah, her timing wasn't the best because it came out and then the pandemic hit.  But it's really a good book.  She was present.  If you're into sci-fi and sort of like near future social aspects of things like what we're living through, Sarah Pinsker, Song for a New Day.  It's really good. Good book.  Just, you know, just a little bit of a downer given what we're going through right now.  But yeah, it's, it'll all come back, but it will be different.  I think that's the lesson, right? Is that what comes back won't be what was there in, in 19.  It'll be a new thing.  Yeah.

Really good conversation.  I do want to show you, though, and you can avert your eyes, Georgia, because this is not for you.  Actually, might be. It's for the man in your life.  I want to show you my manscaped performance package.  I think just because we are quarantined doesn't mean we have to look like a Sasquatch, I guess, is my point of view.  This is the this is the manscaped performance package.  Let me tell you, this is going to be the holiday gift for 2020 because so many people have been stuck inside.  And guys, let's face it, our grooming kind of goes downhill, right?  You know, you don't you don't need to fix yourself up so much.  This is the men's hygiene bundle that makes for a perfect gift.  Included, you get the weed whacker, which is their ear and nose hair trimmer.  There is nothing worse than if I had a friend had a forest growing out of his nose.  Young guy, too, you know, his 40s, young for me.  And I every time I talk to the guy, I'm looking at him and I can't stop staring at his nostrils because there's so this don't let that happen to you.  Don't have hair. I see. I see. I see you. I see you nodding, Georgia.  You don't want to hair coming out of your ears.  The weed whacker is waterproof.  It has a 9000 RPM motor and a 360 degree rotary dual blade system.  High speed is good because it means no nicking, no pulling.  Seventy nine percent of partners pulled admitted long nose hairs, a major turn off.  And this is the best tool for the job.  And by the way, when you get the performance package, you'll also get a subscription to replacement blades every three months.  So you always have a nice sharp blade on your weed whacker.  This is the lawn mower. This is awesome, too. Look how quiet this is.  This is a high speed ceramic blade.  Look, there's a little LED light so you never in mystery about what you're where you're navigating.  And, you know, my friend, Micah Sargent, says that the best example is you often will you'll trim your hedges to make the house look bigger.  You know what I'm saying?

There's a ton of these.  There were so many big stories this week. I don't even know how to get through them all.  Arguments in front of the US Supreme Court on the CFAA,  the 1986 law that has been used to prosecute everybody from Aaron Schwartz on down.  I mean, it's just a nasty, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.  The case is involving a Georgia police officer convicted of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act  by accessing a license plate database.  The good news is the justices seem to come down on the side of privacy.  Neil Gorsuch said that this was an example of the government trying to broaden the scope of criminal laws  in contestable ways. The DOJ's argument risked, quote, making a federal criminal of us all.  And I think if you remember, I mean, poor Aaron Schwartz, who was prosecuted under the CFAA  and eventually committed suicide because of it, it's a perfect example of overreach.  And we've seen this time and time again, the feds using the CFAA in ways it clearly isn't intended.  I presume you agree, Seth, on this, that this is a problematic law.

Start time: 9262.22
End time: 9316.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the CFAA is, everybody I speak with says it's overly broad.  There's almost unanimous agreement, no matter what perspective somebody is coming to it from on that.  This is actually the first time in its entire existence that it's gone before the Supreme Court.  So this is a really sort of unique moment for the preeminent anti-hacking law in the US.  I would hesitate, despite what the questions were and what the justices said,  I would hesitate to read too much into them. We've seen that time and again.  But it's interesting, and I think it's going to be very important to see what happens to this case.

We'll see what happens, but he said, I'll veto it unless you have a repeal of Section 230.  And of course, the National Defense Authorization Act should not be vetoed.  It is pretty important.

Transcript:  We will watch with interest because my suspicion is he's already got a job at Verizon.  And he's just ready to... he's packing his briefcase, ready to move on.  Let's see. What else?  Big pressure on BuzzFeed.  And this actually is a BuzzFeed article, which is also in violation of ICE's request.  ICE is demanding that BuzzFeed divulge its sources on a story about immigration.  And of course, BuzzFeed protects its sources, as all good journalist enterprises do.  ICE even said, not only do we want you to divulge your sources,  but you can't tell anybody that we're asking for this.  So, of course, BuzzFeed immediately published the story.  Needless to say, it's important that journalists can do their job without repercussions.  David Snyder is a lawyer and executive director of the nonprofit First Amendment Coalition said,  I think this is the best description.  If journalists had to divulge sources of information,  sources or information they obtained in the course of reporting,  they'd be no better than the investigative arm of the state.  The power of journalism to advance the cause of our democracy would be severely diminished.  So this is just more of the same.  I presume BuzzFeed will continue to say, yeah, no.  And at some point this may end up in court,  but I would hope a judge would be smart enough to protect the First Amendment.  That is a pretty important part of the Constitution.  Let's see.  It looks like the Chinese have had a breakthrough in quantum computing.  They are now, remember it was Google this year who said,  we have, what do they call that, the quantum singularity  where we finally have a quantum computer that can do a calculation.  The main, you know, a supercomputer would take hundreds of years to do in mere seconds.  This is a big breakthrough, a second breakthrough in quantum computing.  I don't feel like we're that close to quantum computing suddenly taking over the world,  but they are making some progress.  And now it's the Chinese turn to quantum supremacy.  Yeah, that's it. Right.

Start time: 9574.54

The idea that you could really build something that a normal computer couldn't do.  And China says, this research group says,  they did something in minutes that would take a normal computer 2 billion years to do,  which is a long time, longer than computers.

That's unheard of, thanks to modern mRNA technologies.  Oh, this is a sad one.  I'm going to end with a sound bite from Puerto Rico.  This is the Arecibo Observatory.  Remember a couple of weeks ago, we talked about the fact that it had been damaged in the hurricanes of Puerto Rico and the storms  and the towers, they were concerned they were going to fall,  so they were going to demolish them before they could fall and damage the dish beneath it.  They were unable to do so and a few days ago, here's video from Arecibo, it collapsed.  Let me turn up the sound because I know you're not getting it.  Into the dish.  Fortunately, there were no humans around.  They were really concerned the visitor center is below it and so forth.  But that's the end of the telescope that has operated for, I think, close to 60 years.  It was part of the SETI at home.

It was the second, I think, largest radio telescope and has been used for all sorts of things, including SETI,  Contact, the movie with Jodie Foster.  There's a bunch of early scenes that are set there because that was definitely a place that SETI used.  It's a real tragedy, not just for radio astronomy, but the whole astronomical community.  So many of them, astronomers, have fond memories of going to Puerto Rico and going to Arecibo,  which is sort of like way out far away from the main parts of Puerto Rico.  There's a little village that's grown up around there where all the astronomers are.  It's a point of pride in Puerto Rico.  It was already kind of broken and not going to come back, but now it's been completely destroyed.  It's really tragic.

Transcript:  If you want to go to Singapore, you can have chicken nuggets grown in a vat.  This is the first time ever lab-grown meat has gone on sale.  It's a single restaurant in Singapore that's selling it.  The chicken bites are produced by a U.S. company called Eatjust.  You may be aware of them. They have vegan mayonnaise and stuff in the stores.  But there are dozens of firms trying to figure out how to grow chicken, beef, and pork in a vat to avoid killing animals.  Vegetarians will be thrilled.  And one of the things, you know, it's good for the environment. It's good for your health.  But one of the things that stops people like me from being a vegetarian is I like the taste of meat.  So now they can use a few cells of a chicken, feed it plant proteins, grow it in a 1200-liter bioreactor, and serve it in a restaurant in Singapore.  I would like to taste these, but I'm not going to fly to Singapore to do it.

Transcript:  All right. So that's... You know, I think it's going to be, they think, maybe by 2040, in the next 20 years, most meat will come from a vat  because as they grow it and they scale up, it can get cheaper and cheaper.  Right now it's fairly expensive, but so was the Impossible Burger.  And now they're selling it at White Castle.  So the difference is that Impossible Burger is plant protein. It's not an animal protein.  It's just a burger-like experience.  This would be actual meat, but just not made by an animal.  So I guess you could argue that it's not really meat. I don't know. I don't know.  All right. I think we should wrap this up.  There are still many, many stories I didn't get to.  These things happen.  I thank you for being here. Great panel.

And I'm using Descript, which if you haven't heard about it is basically you feed audio files into this thing and it transcribes them.  And then you edit it like you're editing a Word document and audio comes out.

Transcript:  So that made it possible. Yeah, otherwise it would have killed me. But that made it possible.  And then you can export the beauty of Descript is that you can export it out into any popular editing software in project form.  So you can clean it up. So I take it out to Logic and then I clean it up and add music and stuff like that.  But that way I can I can literally use my editorial skills as a writer and an editor to look at my interviews and move quotes around and stuff and build a script out of that.  And that's what's enabled me to do it. It's pretty amazing technology. That's interesting.

Transcript:  It's pretty close. And now they've got a video version or video features, too.  So anybody who's doing like a documentary where you've got hours and hours of interviews to go through, can you imagine all you have to do is edit the text of your interview and you've got video at the end of it?

Transcript:  It's brilliant. It's brilliant. I like what you're saying, because I never trusted to do it by itself.  But I like what you're saying is you get the Logic project and then you tweak it a little bit. Make sure that was the moment for me was when I knew I could take it out.

Transcript:  I mean, they have a rudimentary editor in the app, but you can just take it out and then use your video editor, your audio editor to do the fine tuning.  But it does. It's pretty amazing. You remove one word and then you play it. And that word is just gone. It's it's pretty cool.
