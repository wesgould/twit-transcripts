It's the largest, no not that many, but it feels like it.  Starting with the guy who's with us in studio today and was so instrumental, so helpful in  building the ultimate gaming machine.  You did a great job Ryan Shroup from PC perspective.  It's good to have you back.  Thanks.  We've been having fun with that ultimate gaming machine.  Colleen's building it right now at the warehouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I heard they were doing the actual case modding today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's amazing.  This ultimate gaming machine is just faster than greased goose bit.  John C. Dvorak is also with us at Dvorak.org slash blog.  Hi John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi, you know I couldn't hear what he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, sorry, is this any better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ah, much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah Dvorak.org slash blog, that's where you want to go to get a few, then it hooks me  to everything else, hooks you to everything else that I'm doing, which is plenty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hello.  Steve Gilmore says hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Steve Gilmore is also doing plenty now at TechCrunchIT where he's a blogger.  He also does the News Gang and the Gilmore Gang pretty much almost as much as I'm on  camera.  You're doing the show.  Good to have you Steve via phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thanks.  I tried to come in on Skype but you didn't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I like you on phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, you got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because Steve is kind of the old school guy.  He likes the phone.  We also have so many people on this panel, we kind of have to mix it up so that people  can know who's who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's a phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, somebody said when I said Steve Gilmore is going to be on the show a  few days ago, somebody said, I bet he calls on a 1940s Western electric black rubber telephone.  Bakelite.  Bakelite, not rubber.  They didn't have rubber in those days.  It was so long ago they didn't have rubber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have one of those phones, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They never wear out, do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing is unbelievable, it weighs about 40 pounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The key with that though is that you can get moisture gets in the, because it's a microphone,  it's just charcoal, it's carbon, so it can get clumped up.  When I first started in talk radio, every once in a while you'd say, because somebody  would say, and you knew it was because their microphone, the carbon microphone was clumped  up.  So you'd say, do me a favor, bang your phone headset on the desk.  And they go whack, whack, whack.  And then they'd sound fine because it would loosen it up and break up the, it's like salt.  I had no idea.  Yeah, who knew?  Who cares, in fact?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like the olden days when we used to have, when television sets had tubes in them.  And occasionally you can get this set to work again by slamming your fist against the side  of the thing.  And it could be like something loose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's in the Army repair manual.  I'm told that that's actually a procedure.  There's probably a name for it.  Hey, that technique still works.  Hey, that voice is familiar.  Mr. Robert Heron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey guys, how are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He slaps TV sets for ZD Net.  I do.  The big one.  PC Mag.  PC Mag.  Is that the same anymore?  ZD Net is different now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, ZD Net is different.  I'm so confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what ZD Net is, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You work for PC Mag, which is Ziff Davis Publishing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say so.  It's Ziff Davis Media, for sure.  Ziff Davis Media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He doesn't even know that's how complicated it's gone.  Robert, of course, still hosts DLTV as well.  Always.  It's really great to have you.  We haven't had you on in so long, Robert.  I apologize and welcome back.  We're really glad you're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good to be back.  Thank you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Finally, last and certainly not least, Mr. Kevin Rose has returned to us from his racquetball  game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you win?  I haven't played yet.  I'm leaving at 4.30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've got to come up.  He was going to come up and he wanted to play the racquetball, but you've got to come up  sometime because I'd just love to give you a tour of the cottage.  Absolutely.  And we have a hide-a-bed upstairs just in case anybody gets too inebriated.  You can just spend the night upstairs.  Do you ever do that at Dignation?  Has it ever come up that you or Alex needs to be bedded down at the location?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was one episode a year ago.  The famous Jaegermeister episode.  That's where it was a Reno episode where Alex actually stood up after the second the cameras  went off, he stood up and fell over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They never get the best parts on camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We missed that one.  We've been good lately though.  We've been drinking tea and just saving ourselves for the live crazy episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you've been doing a lot more of them.  You're going to be at Envision on, is it Tuesday or Wednesday for Dignation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tuesday, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's in San Jose at the Convention Center.  Envision 2008, which is Nvidia's yearly party celebrating visual computing.  We're going to be there on Monday with Uggum.  That's where we're going to display its first public showing of the Ultimate Gaming Machine  in Mod Alley.  And then Dignation on Tuesday.  And also the Mythbusters.  It's going to be an amazing event.  That's going to be so much fun.  Are you going to try to hook up with Trisha Helfer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do not know who that is.  You know who she is?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's the Cylon in Battlestar Galactica, the one who's got lights going up and down her  spine.  Former Victoria's Secret model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's very attractive, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Two words.  Robot sex.  That's all I'm talking.  All right, let's get that.  I think that's everybody.  Is there anybody on the show that I've left out?  All right.  Our stories as usual on Delicious, delicious.com slash twit.  And this is episode 157.  So if you really want to go straight to them, delicious.com slash twit slash 157.  And actually the biggest story of the week came from you, Kevin.  You did it again.  You've been pretty good in these iPod predictions.  Do you have a source?  What's the deal there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, there's probably two or three people that email me randomly, anonymously and say,  hey, I've got some rumors for you.  Sometimes they're with pictures.  Sometimes they're just like, hey, here's a heads up.  And these were, you know, I put one of the pictures up on my blog.  You don't really believe that's real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That picture looks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  No, I have.  Listen, here's what I'll do.  I'll send you the pictures right now.  Okay.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll send you the independent authority validating these pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Send one to me for God's sake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't want these all over the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin understands.  I'm the guy who reviewed the Zapruder film for accuracy.  I know exactly what to look for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, listen, here's the deal.  You have to delete this after you receive it.  And I just want you to say, I mean, honestly, you can't show any of these pictures off anywhere.  Like do I have your word on that?  Yeah, I promise.  So you know, you trust me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've sent me pictures before that I've deleted them immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here we go.  So Leo, Leo Ville is at work.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it'll take a little walk because of the email.  Well, later on, in fact, we might do an after show today.  There might be two tweets today.  Steve and I want to stick around and we'd invite anybody who else wants to join us,  especially you, Kevin, to talk about microblogging, not just Twitter, not just pounce, but a  Laconic.  I've set up Laconic a server at army dot twit dot TV.  And I'm very excited about the idea of open microblogging.  I think it takes it from kind of a broadcast medium to a communications medium.  And I'm very excited about what that what that means.  So you know, another we'll talk about a little bit more after the show, but I just want to  invite people to stick around for that.  So the iPod.  So one of them is long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So open up your email right now.  All right.  Okay.  And don't say what type of anything that I just sent you, but just open it up and then  you tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you've become Kevin, you've become the world's worst tease.  Every time you're on the show, you're talking about something you can't tell anybody.  Now you've got the mystery pictures that only Leo gets to see.  So everybody out there that's listening to this show is going, what, what, what, why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm not trying to be a tease.  Honestly, I'm just trying to get people in trouble.  Oh, my God.  Oh, now it's worse.  I'm just trying not to get people in trouble.  Like, you know, the people that send me this stuff, like they trust me not to leak it out  on like a mass scale.  So I don't want to like post everything that I get online.  I'll just say, you know, whatever it is that I get, I'll try and come up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I have to say, Kevin, this looks very real, of course, but couldn't, I mean, you  could fake anything nowadays, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but look at the fourth page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, could you go to that reverse angle for a second?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want to see that?  Okay, let's, we'll do the tight zoom.  No, I'm not doing that to Kevin.  Because, because, wow, that's so the, the thing looks, it looks like it was extruded.  I have to say, I poo pooed the new nano.  I thought, oh, that's a joke, because the pictures we saw originally, remember those,  Ryan, they were just really looked phony.  Yeah.  And it was exactly right.  So I'm no longer basing anything I say on.  So can I say I can't say even what this document is that you sent me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I didn't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because that would kind of give away the source of it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm really I'm getting more and more irked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing is that these are probably fake and I'm going to be screwed when it comes  time when they make the real announcement.  It's a good fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a better, it's a better fake than usual.  You know why it's a good fake?  Let's just say this.  It's, it's a good fake because it doesn't try too hard.  It looks like, and it looks like a very technical document, not a, not like a photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I made a Photoshop of the iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if it's, if somebody's faking this, they should do Howard Hughes Will next because  they're good at it.  So that's credible.  The big advantage of this is it's a bigger screen.  Is that the idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a, it's a bigger screen, different form factor.  It's not as chunky as the old one.  It has like a glass outside.  It's kind of curved around.  But the thing I'm really excited about, I mean, I hear iTunes 8 is coming as well.  There's going to be some, they're really going to chop the prices on the iPods to kind of  distance them a little bit from the iPhone.  The iPhone's priced at $199 right now.  If you take a look at the touch is $500 for a comparable device.  It's ridiculous.  It's crazy.  So those prices will fall down.  iTunes 8 will be announced with some new features and that's pretty much about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  I'm deleting the document now.  I'm using a secure delete.  No one will be able to recover this.  If you are a federal official, you can stop with the battering rams.  Now the door is actually wide open.  Just come on in.  It's gone.  But that was pretty, you know, okay, I believe you now.  You're in a perfect position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People out there listening to you guys talk, it's like too good.  I mean, it's just not even in, I mean, at this point.  No, no, no, I'm just giving it, look at it.  But it's worse than teasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go to Kevin's site.  What is it?  Is it Kevin?  It's kevinrose.com slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, slash blog.  Just kevinrose.com.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No blog.  So kevinrose.com and you can look, you can see the picture, John.  It's right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He removed the supporting documentation around it that gives as an independent, as an independent  third party with a judicial robes on, but nothing underneath.  I think that I can validate that this, this is pretty darn, this looks good.  Kevin, you probably get a lot, you probably get sent this stuff all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm looking at this.  I'm looking at it now.  Yeah.  And so I'm looking at it.  It looks really fake, doesn't it?  No, it looks like it's possible.  Okay.  I mean, it does look kind of fake.  It looks kind of, because it's blurry and you know, there's all kinds of these issues.  But the possibility of something like that existing doesn't surprise me.  What's the difference?  It looks like an iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what's an iPod?  Okay, so good.  So we all agree.  This is the new iPod, I guess.  Big deal, right?  Lower prices on the touch.  Is there going to be, and what's new in iTunes 8?  The big rumor is that there'll be a subscription model in that.  Does your source tell you that, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have a different source for the iTunes stuff and I hear that it's not going subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, see, that didn't seem credible to me either.  I think that was one of those wishful thinking rumors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know though.  That's not confirmed.  It's just what they said.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I mention something here based on this picture here?  Of course, Kevin will be getting me a lot of hits.  But the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, gee.  We wouldn't want anybody to plug their blog on the show or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know why anyone would want to.  But anyway, so the thing that makes it credible to me, at least in terms of creativity, if  it was somewhat of a fake, although I wonder, is the fact that Apple seems to have been  moving slowly to this curved line that they use in the Mac Air.  And this exhibits the exact same feature characteristic.  There's a word for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The new iPhones are like that too.  The back's kind of curved a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's going to this kind of a...  That look, whatever.  There's a word for that type of...  It's a touch.  I don't know what it is.  Swoopy doopy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Steve Jobs has learned from Detroit that the key is to change the model design significantly  every few years because then the old models look old and out of date.  You want them to look old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you look like a schmuck because you got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you got the old square iPod.  Don't you know curved is the new square?  And then you feel like a square.  Because otherwise there's no real compelling reason to buy a new iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think what's overlooked here, and I think it should be taken into account, is this particular  curve that has this rounded little corner.  Looks very much like one of those rocks that you find at the beach, which means that they're  obviously designing this thing to be skipped into the ocean for the piece of crap that  half of these things are when they break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I taught my son how to skip.  I'm going to tell him the iPod...  Actually the current Nano is a perfect skipping stone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think that this is the...  Remember at the Apple financial call they said there was a major product transition  coming up?  And it's going to cause financial issues.  So if the price is going to drop to be competitive of financial issues, that's the financial  issue because Flash hasn't dropped that much that quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I hear this is all going to happen on September 9th is when the announcement is going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  made.  Unfortunately, I'm going to be in Los Angeles.  If the one day in the month I'm not going to be in town to cover that, I wish I were.  But we'll get somebody out there to cover it.  And iTunes 8, anything else?  Some people are saying maybe an app store for OS X applications, which I think is a  good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I really don't know much about iTunes 8.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you get a lot of stuff over the transom?  You must.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the problem I have now is that I don't want to be slaughtered by giving out wrong  information.  So I have some stuff on iTunes 8, but it's like if I say it and then I'm wrong, everyone's  like, oh, he's full of crap and he's talking about.  So they're going to say that whether you're saying it or not.  Kevin, just do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John is an agent provocateur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No one's going to say you're full of crap.  Oh yeah, right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So come on.  Come on.  I never took him on the show.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I almost said when I sent the invitation, Kevin, I almost said we won't pick on you.  We won't pressure you.  It'll just be like you're one of the guys.  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's loaded with information for this show.  I mean, he's got good stuff.  I mean, this blog thing is going to get a lot of good hits on his blog.  He's got some crazy thing about Dara Torres.  And you know, so people should go check that out.  And he's a, you know, everybody likes Kevin.  He's one of the most likable guys out there.  He's like the guy in Entourage.  So no one is going to, he can say something that could be dead ass wrong, which is always  a possibility.  I do this constantly.  And nobody is going to say you're full of crap.  Kevin, what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  So the one thing I hear about iTunes 8 is that it's going to do something along the  lines of looking at your music and kind of recommendations based on certain things.  Napsterize.  Pandora.  Pandora, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pandora plus napster.  Yeah, yeah.  Makes nothing but sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Speaking of which, Tim Westergren is saying Pandora is almost out of business.  We'll talk about that in just a bit.  But I do want to mention our good sponsors today.  Go to My PC.  I think their first time on Twitter.  Welcome, gang.  I'm a big Citrix fan.  They do the GoToMeaning product we mentioned before.  Pardon me, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm just, I was looking at something else on Kevin's blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry.  It's a good picture of Dara Torres, I gotta say.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She looks like she could kick your ass.  She does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You put this here because you like to stretch Kevin and so does she.  Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's good for rock climbing and stuff, stretching, so it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You say you lost 10 pounds in two weeks by climbing rocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And not drinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And not drinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's probably true.  I'm going to start drinking and see how much weight I can gain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back to GoToMyPC, which does work, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say, I might get getting paid a dime for this, obviously, but I use  it all the time because my dad, to help him out remotely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, do you, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I have all Macs, right?  And so he's got a PC and he's always having issues and little things that I need to fix.  So I just fire up the client and then connect to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you do it from a Mac to a PC?  Yeah.  See, that's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I launch it, no, actually I use Parallels inside of...  Parallels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think you can, you know, they just added Mac compatibility to GoToMeeting.  I think GoToMyPC also works from Mac to PC.  In fact, I'm pretty sure I've done that.  I think so as well.  Yeah, you have to run it on a PC.  It is PC World's world-class award for best remote access software.  It is, I mean, look, you ask the experts, that's what they use because it's easy to  set up, easy to configure, very affordable, and it just works.  Besides, Citrix knows more about the guts of Windows than Microsoft does.  Microsoft's own remote desktop client was written by Citrix.  So you know, of course, this is going to be the fastest and the best.  I want you to try it for free.  Just go to GoToMyPC.com slash twit and there's a free trial there for you.  GoToMyPC.com slash twit.  A great way to access, I don't know if we've really explained this, but you can put it  on a computer and you access that computer from anywhere on the net and you can do any...  It's like you're on the computer.  So people often use it to commute to work or for tech support.  It's really great that way.  You just log on to your computer, you run any program, send and receive email, access  to any network resource you could pretend.  Let's say you work for a large Cupertino company and you want to pretend you're in your cubicle  when in fact you're passing secret documents on to Kevin Rose.  You could use GoToMyPC to send a corporate email from the internal corporate system right  before you gave it to Rose.  It's a perfect alibi.  GoToMyPC.com slash twit.  It's that good.  We thank them for their support.  I bet nobody's ever said that in a GoToMyPC commercial.  That's a first.  Are we worried about the fact that Internet Radio is about to die once again?  SaveNetRadio.org.  Tim Westergren of Pandora says they're currently paying what was it?  $10 million a year in royalties already.  Something like that.  Some huge amount.  It's going to double, almost double if the Copyright Office has their say.  The thing that's unfair, fundamentally unfair, is it's doubling the amount of money Internet  Radio has to pay without increasing the amount of money that regular radio has to pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't believe regular radio stations pay any fees like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh no, we do.  We pay Ask FBI.  Regular radio?  Yeah, but it's literally one half what they're asking for Internet Radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then between that and the satellite stations, you would think it would all be the same,  but it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what?  The recording industry is so stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's grounds for some sort of legal action here.  This is a restraint of trade, it seems to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wish they would.  Go sue them, Tim.  We'll be behind you.  I'll give you a buck.  They give away that great Pandora app on the iPhone.  I just love it because you can listen to any music you want.  And the contention is from the recording industry that real terrestrial radio, broadcast radio,  promotes records so they get a deal because they're selling records.  But something like Pandora just is a leech.  But think about it, when you listen to Pandora, you enter in a couple of artists, you pick,  you know, it makes a station based on those artists, plays artists it thinks you would  like based on that and gives you an opportunity to buy and many people buy all the time from  Pandora.  I do all the time.  It's a great idea.  And they make up they make a lot of money, by the way, something.  What was their revenue?  It's like 85 million a year.  Let's see if I can find that.  It's a huge amount of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually have started using that instead of satellite radio in my car.  Well, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It kills satellite radio.  Yeah.  Because you can listen on edge.  Hmm.  Not very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But, you know, auxiliary input into the car and there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The amount that they pay right now is point oh eight cents per listener per hour, I think.  They want to make it in by 2010 to point one nine cents.  That's that's more than doubling it.  And it's just it would be Tim Westergren at Pandora says it would be 70 percent of our  income because the royalty rates are so high we wouldn't be able to basically wouldn't  be able to make much money at all on this.  So he says we'll pull the plug.  I don't think it's an idle threat.  Steve Gilmore, you still there?  Did we put you to sleep?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I just completely disagree with all of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well you should speak up, sir.  I was waiting.  You're biding your time before you launch into it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not going to launch into it.  I launched into it on the Gilmore gang this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well maybe some people listening didn't hear the great Gilmore gang.  Probably 99 percent.  So which part do you disagree with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that, you know, Pandora should suck it up and get the money.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they have a business model.  The problem is that it's based on this earlier royalty rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, except that, you know, the problem with Pandora from my perspective is you type in  Beatles, you get four Beatles songs and then you don't get any more Beatles for a week.  That's not true.  And then you get Klaatu.  Klaatu's Beatles.  You get everybody that doesn't sound like the Beatles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When Klaatu came out, I remember, you and I are old enough to remember, we thought they  were the Beatles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, Leo.  So in other words, Steve's argument is that because Pandora in his experience sucks.  They should suck it up.  That's the rationale for this being a screwed up situation?  Yes, John.  I just want to get that straight.  Well, you got it straight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As far as I'm concerned, you know, we are not here to support, you know, theoretical  business models.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not theoretical.  They have a revenue of $25 million.  Of course, the whole idea of this genome thing that they use.  Well, all right.  Then what about smaller internet broadcasters who will be put out of business as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, smaller internet broadcasters, if they figure out how to have a unique product  that they can then leverage the IP of, will end up making a whole lot more money than  a machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and I guess you're right in the sense that a lot of people say, well, they should  just play independent music and screw Madonna, you know, not that most of us would want to.  But the OK, fine.  If the major labels are going to act that way, just stop playing their music and see  what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The major labels are waiting for people to inflict some pain and they will when they  start to realize that the back archives that they have, the live gigs, the in studio remixes,  the kinds of stuff that they're right now laying off on DVDs, when they start to make  them available online, there's going to be a huge tip over of the record business and  it's going to they're going to make a lot of money on it.  So the sooner that we stop encouraging them to, you know, fight this so-called boycott,  I mean, most of the music of today is crap, as far as I'm concerned.  So your opinion?  Yeah, of course, this is all my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Steve, you're 59 years old.  It's normal for anybody, those of us in our 50s to say, you're young people.  You know, our music was good music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, the Beatles, the Stones, the Who, give me a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I went to see John Mellencamp in Berkeley a couple of weeks ago and it was all people  my age in their 50s.  And the cloud of marijuana smoke over that stage couldn't move.  I was and I had my kids, we had three generations.  I brought my 75 year old mom and my teenage kids and my son's looking at there's a guy  next to me, you know, 58, 59, right about right about there.  He's drumming along.  He's got a little pipe.  He said, my son said, that guy's smoking an old man pipe with pot in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the only thing, the last thing I'll say about this is that everybody likes the  Beatles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're right.  Even my kids like the Beatles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.  So it's that's new music, not old music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's not new.  You can't call it new music.  Oh, it's totally new music.  You might say everybody likes it.  I don't think you can say it's new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even people my age, one of the older guys here, find the Beatles a little tedious in  this day and age.  And I don't go out seeking Beatles albums or looking for Beatles songs on some crappy  FM station because they play old music.  In fact, I don't do anything to go.  I mean, I know there's a renaissance of the Beatles, but I'm not buying this at all.  That everybody loves the Beatles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The last thing I want to hear is brand or ancient music right now.  There are so many great bands out there.  And I just I want to hear the latest and greatest from the latest artists.  The Young Man's Pandora.  Pandora was a great way to get that experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was because you can listen.  What do you type in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whatever your favorite tunes are currently.  The Pixies, Cardigans.  They've played say or been released say in the last eight years.  They've done a pretty good job of cataloging and indexing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what?  I put in Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan and James Taylor and I still got a great mix of stuff.  They have a good, you know what I put in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then you get Jim Croce and you get, you know, it's pretty predictable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I put in some classical music.  I want to see, well, did they have classical stuff?  I put in Jusscan Dupre, a medieval, beautiful music.  And I got a bunch of very great stuff, related stuff.  I was thrilled with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By who? Kenny G?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you know, great classical stuff like MASHO and stuff.  I mean, it was really good.  I was very impressed. So right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, guys, and all those songs are available.  Because the the cartel doesn't have a stranglehold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I see what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they do. How's Last FM holding up on all this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're European, right? They're based in England.  Where are they based? Yeah, they're in London.  So they have a different issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're owned by CBS, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that weird?  Isn't that weird?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always liked Last FM better than the Pandora.  It seemed to be their algorithms give me better choices of music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you have one or the other on your iPhone?  Do you listen to any of those on your iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I use Last FM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's also an AOL radio client that's pretty good, too.  I'm going to be talking to the National Association of Broadcasters  next month about radio versus the Internet.  And the first thing I do is hold up the iPhone and say, dude,  this is better than satellite radio and it's completely free  and it works over 3G and Wi-Fi.  You're screwed. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Robert, do you use Last FM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I just logged onto the site and I'm definitely...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that's what the hipsters like is Last FM, I think.  Do they have a... You said they had an iPod app, too?  They do. Or an iPhone app? iPhone.  Well, iPhone or iPod Touch.  Yeah. If you've got music on your touch,  but you also have these three applications on there,  you've got an amazing collection of music on there.  And the other thing I'm using, I'm sure this is illegal,  there's a thing called Simplify Media that lets you listen to  any 30 people's iTunes collections over the Internet anywhere.  So I could invite you, Robert, I could invite you, Kevin,  and then I could listen to your music and you could listen to my music  with this Simplify Media thing.  And it's actually it's on the iPhone, too.  It's amazing. Simplify Media.  Simplify Media dot com. Very cool.  I'll invite you. Sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll send you an invite.  Me too.  I don't want to listen to your music, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What would I hear if, John, if I listened to your iTunes collection?  What would be in there?  Mostly classical. Yeah, I like classical, too.  I listen to a lot of classical.  A federal judge Wednesday.  Through some support, thank goodness, behind the concept of fair use.  A Pennsylvania mother, Stephanie Lenz, is suing YouTube.  She put up a 30 second video of her baby dancing to a Prince song.  Universal issued a takedown notice.  YouTube, of course, responded immediately, pulled the video down.  It's just a baby dancing to Prince music in the background.  Not going to exactly steal any any money from Prince.  The judge said that's fair use.  Fair use, he says, is a is a lawful use of a copyright accordingly  in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the DMCA with a, quote,  good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of  is not authorized by the copyright owner.  The owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use.  In other words, you got to consider fair use.  And he says, in this case, the Prince song, barely audible in the background,  clearly represents fair use.  Federal courts had thrown the suit out in April,  but the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a second complaint  and a federal judge ruled in their favor.  He didn't throw the case out, but he expressed doubt.  Well, now this is interesting.  Although Fogel.  Refused to throw the case out a second time, he expressed doubt  that she could win the court has considerable doubt that Lenz would be able  to prove that Universal acted with subjective bad faith.  I don't know. Now, that kind of undermines the whole thing.  I guess the case goes on.  But copyright owners do have to consider there is such a thing as fair use.  They didn't define fair use, though, did it really?  And that's the part of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You kind of dug your hell self in a hole with this story, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's not my fault. Seen it buried the lead.  You read the story.  Well, it's the last frickin paragraph.  It's going along, going along. Fine, fine, fine.  I missed the last paragraph where it said he refused to throw the case out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the title does say YouTube user wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's my problem. I read the titles before I read the story.  Thanks, CBS.  You sandbag me on that one.  No, I think that everybody and I've read a number of articles about this,  agrees that this is significant for a judge to say, yes, fair use  does impact DMCA takedown notices.  They do have to judge whether there's fair use of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It'll be a good reason for Obama to win so we can stack the Supreme Court.  So by the time it gets there, then they'll rule in favor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, now, what do you think of this, Steve Gilmore?  Obama text messages clever, right?  I I'm going to go directly to the people.  Forget the press. I'm going to text message my VP pick  to the people, to you, the people.  I'm going to use Twitter and SMS and send you the message before the press gets it.  Then he misses the news cycle.  The press gets it anyway.  So he releases it at three thirty in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He missed the news cycle. I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Three in the morning is not a great time to announce your vice presidential candidate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The whole thing was a botch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I never even got the text message. I didn't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a scam. You guys, you Obama, you robots are being

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  scammed.  You know, well, first of all, a couple of things to point out,  oh, bots, a couple of things to point out.  One, of course, all the press subscribe to the text messages,  so they're going to get at the same time everybody else does.  Bing. Two, what is the real win here for Obama?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They email addresses, they have millions of millions of cell phone numbers.  Correct. That's two millions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which they can sell.  Even more of a sucker's game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, Kevin, you and I should be glad we didn't get that text message.  It must have lost our number.  I don't know.  So the question is, how far can the Democrats push this?  How often can they use this emergency?  Life vest here.  Can they text the conversation and they tell, well, they can they tell  how often can they text message you if they've got your number?  Can they send me a message today? No.  Can they call me? No.  But could they text me maybe the week before the election day  and say we need a little money or the day before election day?  Say, don't forget to vote or the day of.  Don't forget to find print.  Was there a privacy policy?  There's no freaking anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just text them.  You just gave it up, huh?  You just give it up.  Yeah, I'm stupid.  I wanted to be the first to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you were and you weren't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you were. You saw it on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw it on CNN, just like everybody else.  That's how I found out.  Paul Kent got it before anybody got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, anyway, I find it to be deplorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just say that every five minutes and that's deplorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plorable. OK, so there's a story I want to talk about here  since I'm on the show.  Has anybody played with photosynth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm. Yeah, I just loaded that up.  Isn't that cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I couldn't get on it when I tried when it first opened  because it was crashing, which is another, you know, indictment  against cloud computing.  But besides that, I can't get it since I didn't go on it.  Can you explain what it does?  Because I can't tell whether it does 3D or just panoramas or simple stitching.  I'm not finding figuring out.  All of the above.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It takes a collection of photos and it essentially  it uses all the different views and allows it then to seamlessly  move between the different views.  And it interpolates what it would what that view would look like  if it were panning between the two different shots.  Or in this case, I think the image I was looking at was that  the Taj Mahal, I believe, and they had probably about 50 images.  And you could pretty much pan, spin and tilt all around  that entire environment using those 50 photos.  You could go in wherever there was imagery.  So the various shots that look like they were probably about,  like I said, about 50 shots taken from variety of places  on the outside of the Taj Mahal.  So it's just 3D photo stitching, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. It's stitching in three dimensions.  So let me just ask this question.  So as a photographer, what would be your strategy  for visiting someplace, the Taj Mahal, a church, a forest?  I don't care.  Would you shoot a bunch of pictures like in a panorama  and not worry about stitching them and then just go roaming around  taking aimless pictures?  And hopefully this thing would figure it out.  Is that what you would do? I mean, tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the idea is that it's automated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, it's automated.  But what if I give it to if I give it one photo or two photos  of the Taj Mahal, I'm not going inside.  That's for sure. Here's the deal. Here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When the photos are joined in any form or fashion,  it will be able to join them and allow you to with, you know,  if you don't take complete blanket coverage,  you know, it'll have you'll have to have blanks.  But if you you don't have to kind of consciously do a panorama,  you just take a lot of pictures and it will know where they overlap.  Now, here's a question, Robert.  Does it allow is it only your photos or could it take  everybody's pictures of the Taj Mahal and then make a much more comprehensive image?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See that if you could have access to the like Flickr accounts  and things like that, you can go out there and figure out, OK,  this actually contains images that are it.  I would hope it would be able to look into those images and find similarities  rather than just saying relying on tag information or something like that  in order to piece it all together.  So that's the big question.  I'm trying to look up something else right now.  But there was another similar technology that was just demoed  earlier this week that gave me a minute.  And I'm going to see if I can dig it up right now.  But it did something very similar.  But at the same time, it was better at the interpolation process  between two different images.  And it was phenomenal looking.  And I'm just now right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the only reason I bring this up is because I've you know,  I've used all these different, you know, photo stitching  packages, and I've seen people who put together like 50 or 60 images.  When with my experience, when you get past four images,  these things fall apart. They don't work.  I mean, they kind of work.  But then all of a sudden, there's like a thing with half missing.  And it doesn't figure this out or that or something's off out of skew.  And the fact that Microsoft is supposedly has put together this fabulous product,  I'm just so skeptical about this thing actually working  unless the situation is ideal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, in fact, the demos are great.  No, the demos are great.  But it is. Well, we have this many people, John.  It's we're all being very polite and letting everybody talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No reason for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Steve, Steve Gilmore, you're a Microsoft fanboy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, is this just a cool demo or is there something of real value here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a really cool demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. They're good at cool demos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they controlled it.  I mean, as I think John pointed out,  they spent a lot of money on shooting up a whole lot of places  in a very complex and complete way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The St. Mark's Square is really pretty neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's extraordinary.  And if you look at what Silverlight will do,  it's a perfect match for that with the deep zoom. Right.  So, I mean, they're going to get something out of this.  But, you know, I agree with John.  I don't think it's going to be that app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Photos is a little bit in the in the  those Yosemite pictures that they showed to.  They use photosynth to make these very, very,  you know, ultra gigapixel images of nature.  And they're really quite spectacular.  What was the other one, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was actually a project done by which university?  It looks like Washington University.  And what they're doing in that other project I was talking about  was enhancing videos using high resolution still imagery.  And some of the things they're able to accomplish in terms of either enhancing exposure.  So if you're dealing with maybe you want to create a high dynamic range  using your standard video camera and a good still camera, you can do that.  Or touch ups of material, say, like you want to  you want to, like, eliminate a sign in a scene or something like that.  Or if you just want super resolution of an object in that scene  and say you've already shot the video, maybe using your your camera on your phone,  which is really low resolution, then you just went back to that same scene  and snapped a few high resolution pictures with your still camera.  You can then stitch those together and really do some neat things.  And it was just it's an impressive demo.  I have the link for it.  I can send that around if anybody wants to take a look at it real quick.  Is it real long? Send it to me.  No, it's beautiful. It's got a video, too, that just it completely.  It's one single page with the video link and I'll pop that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does John have to erase it immediately after he looks at it or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, as a matter of fact, Leo, let me ask you a question.  What if these GPS devices  are starting to be used much more prolifically?  And it's not a what if it is.  Yeah. But what I'm suggesting is the tie into this idea of photography.  What if does the government have the right to go in and request  GPS locations from all of these devices and therefore triangulate  whether or not pictures might have been taken by people around an event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting.  That's it. How would they get that information, though, from the phone companies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, these devices are sending GPS all the time up to the cell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Oh, I like that. This is good.  Yeah. No, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess this is this is the next Will Smith movie.  He's going to there's been a murder and he's going to it's kind of like Roshomon  meets Mission Impossible.  There's a murder and then the government.  Wait a minute. We did see that.  What was that stupid movie where they went back in time because the conversation was?  Wow. No, it's a recent movie.  They went back in time to witness a murder was actually a very cool movie  because they had all these different cameras  and they could put them all together with this photosynth like technology  and watch what happened.  That was a cool movie.  What was the name of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wasn't that John Van Damme movie was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was a minority of the the was it called Vantage Point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was that it? No, that was well, whatever.  Oh, deja vu. That's what it that's what deja vu.  If you haven't seen that, that was exactly what you're talking about.  The notion that so many images are being taken now, all with location  information in them.  If you could pull the data streams, maybe using something like that,  I don't know, Patriot Act from all of these cameras everywhere  and all these cell phones everywhere, you could reconstruct everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can just see the government coming to your door and ripping your  your seven year old daughter's camera out of her hand and impounding it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't. You know what, Steve, I can't see that.  You know why? Why?  I haven't got a seven year old daughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I've been using this I.F.I.  Explorer, which is really, really cool.  It is an SD card that has built in Wi-Fi.  You put it in your camera as you're taking pictures.  It goes to the nearest open Wi-Fi or your own Wi-Fi if you've set it up  or a waypoint Wi-Fi and uploads your pictures to Flickr, Smug Mug  or whatever you've set.  It's amazing.  And as you know, we use one in the offices here.  And whenever anybody takes a picture, all of a sudden I see it on my Mac  coming in and gets received automatically.  And they have GPS tags.  It's got it's completely tagged using that Skyhook, I think.  It's using some sort of Wi-Fi based tagging.  It's not it's not GPS. It's Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can figure out to automatically just find an open access point  without any any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't need to dig into a menu or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, a woman who got all her camera gear stolen.  One of the cameras had one of these I.F.I. cards in it.  The crook didn't know.  It looks like a regular SD card. He's taking pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He takes pictures of himself, his friends, his family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It gets uploaded to her account.  She catches the guy and gets her stuff back.  Great story. Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually at least it's a happy ending to what was getting pretty creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is it is a very interesting technology, I have to say.  All right, we're going to take a break coming up in just a bit.  Microsoft has 300 million dollars to blow.  They've decided to hire an out of work comic to represent Microsoft.  In their attempt to beat the switch ads from Apple.  Who is it? We'll tell you in just a second.  But then how's that effort easy like that?  But first, this show brought to you by the good folks at Visa.  You know, when you go shopping online,  when you're when you're buying that Wi-Fi card or the GPS  or the phone that phones home, you don't want to think about  whether fraud is in the picture.  You don't want to worry about getting ripped off online.  That's why you use your Visa card.  Just pull it right out and say, I'm using Visa here on any website  where you're shopping.  All your purchases are safe and secure with Visa.  They do everything possible to prevent, detect  and most importantly, resolve online fraud.  And I know that's what really matters.  The minute they discover online fraud, they give you a call, they let you know.  They they reverse the charges.  It boils down to two words, zero liability.  You're just not liable for unauthorized purchases.  That's that's why the next time you go shopping,  you want to use the secure card, the safe card.  You want peace of mind, safe, secure Visa.  And we thank them for their support of this week in tech.  We're of course, we only use Visa on the show.  So, OK, let's see, who could you pick?  If you're Microsoft, you've got three hundred smackers to spend.  You're going to do a new campaign to promote.  Windows is a great choice, particularly Vista, because everybody hates Vista.  Who are you going to pick?  Of course, Jerry Seinfeld.  He's been out of work for 10 years.  He represents all that's hip and cool and with it.  Could you pick a worse person?  Maybe, you know, I don't know, Rodney Dangerfield from the grave.  What could be worse?  Is this hip? Is this cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if it's hip or cool, but it's he's a recognizable face.  You know, he's a recognizable person to everybody ever since B movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's been hot. He's a hot property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he did do those HP commercials, so he has experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He also used a Mac for like 10 years on Seinfeld.  Did you know that? I did see somebody point that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the computers in Seinfeld were all Macs. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They paid Jerry.  Well, actually, it's worse than that.  I mean, because I wrote about this on the blog and somebody said, sent a clip in.  He was Seinfeld was actually in in the original series of Apple.  Think differently as you're kidding.  Oh, boy. And he's a switcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's a switcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They could do the whole switch back and forth.  He switched. But nobody.  The fact is, everybody who knows this industry knows that you don't.  And I hate to admit this, but generally speaking, people,  when they switch to the Mac, they don't go back.  And there's no reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a lot of reverse switchery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's not much.  Oh, I like Vista better.  And they go running around the Vista.  They just don't do that because the Mac is a is comfortable.  It's a roach. I mean, I mean, it could, you know, things can change.  But right now, that's not going to happen.  So so they you know, this is kind of like ridiculous.  But I'm not convinced that, you know, that they can't put together some ads.  Maybe it's going to be him and Gates apparently doing, you know,  something to try to halt the more recent Mac versus PC ads.  If you go to the Apple site and look at them are extremely at  there, they're the worst kind of attack ads.  I think that Apple hired Karl Rove to be honest about it,  because these things are just really going after Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why? Because they kind of pushed it, pushed it, pushed it.  Microsoft never responded, never responded.  So they have a free hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is, I know, two years have gone by and Microsoft has done nothing about those ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they're a small part of the market, Steve, but don't you think they're growing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's seven point eight, seven point eight up from six point something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Well, it's three point.  Nothing three point nothing two years ago.  So it's it's working.  And there is I mean, look, there's nothing wrong with Vista,  but there is absolutely this strong perception that Vista sucks everywhere.  But a perception, which, by the way, Microsoft promoted with its Mojave experiment.  We we asked 100 San Franciscans what they thought about Vista  and eight out of 10 said they don't like it, even though they've never used it.  So we switched their operating system with Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never had this at home.  This is good stuff. What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. Enough of that. I'm sorry.  It's not going anywhere. I'm just trying a little comedy.  John, would you please help me? Let me help me out here, Johnny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, normally you don't do the Indian.  I mean, what was it? That was an Indian accent.  That was Norwegian.  Good Indian accent. You did that.  That was Norwegian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just I'm slipping.  So the the new slogan for this is also terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if anybody asked me about my that accent, I do.  It's Norwegian. I'm going to say Norwegian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the slogan.  Vindos, not walls, windows, not walls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. That's another lame thing.  These guys are clueless.  This is the problem with the monopoly mentality within a corporation.  By the way, Kevin, this is going to happen to you.  He hopes he dreams.  You get the monopoly thing going.  And the next thing you know, you start, you know, you lose your edge  and then you don't even think about anything.  You think, well, I don't understand why this is happening to me.  Well, you know, they just were number one.  This is bad shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What does it mean, windows without walls?  Windows, not walls.  OK, what does it mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, well, they should really say windows, not door, not French doors or,  I don't know, windows, not bidets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah. What does it mean?  Maybe Steve's right. What does it mean?  It's meaningless.  It's just some crazy thing.  A bunch of it sounds like a bunch of people got stoned  and dreamt it up.  I mean, I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're saying that the Apple software creates walls.  It's not an open platform.  Oh, and Windows is well, as far as hardware goes, as far as  how you can get your systems from that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're saying you could.  They're saying you can you can go through the window,  but you can't go through the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess what it means is Apple creates a wall and they should have named it.  Windows creates a window.  They should have named it door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is an image.  That's an image and a concept from from 15, 20 years ago.  And, you know, Apple had to lock down, you know, interface and you  to write to their operating system.  You had to go through a rigmarole.  And yeah, and you can't do this.  There's all kinds of restrictions.  Yeah. But that that's such an old nobody cares anymore about that.  That is old, old, old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think they'll use the same slogan for like cell phone market  where they're Windows mobile versus Android, iPhone, iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Crash, not flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  AT&T getting into the tech support business,  they're going to do a geek squad of their own.  Do we care? Thank goodness.  Really? I'm glad. Why so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just I think too many people rely on the geek squad, folks.  For a variety of things.  And if they could bring some competition into that and increase  the quality of one or the other or both is that that commonly used, that widely used  every time I go into Best Buy or wherever,  it seems like those guys are out there, you know, every HDTV sold.  They want to be a part of that installation every, you know.  And besides that, I don't think it'd be hard right now for another company  to get involved, considering some of the bad press, right?  That Geek Squad and other of the  quote unquote fix it companies are doing right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we certainly get the slogan.  We don't look at your porn. We just fix your machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Install key loggers and install.  Granted, they're not all doing that, but you know, Windows, not key loggers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like it.  That could go somewhere.  Maybe they get Jerry Seinfeld to do their ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was in a Best Buy store the other day and they had two brand new HDTVs  sitting right next to each other and one had a sign hanging on it that said  with Geek Squad calibration and one, the other one said without Geek Squad  calibration, they're both running the same.  They're both running the same video.  It was a 1080p version of Planet Earth.  Same same everything. And  it was so obvious that they had went in and purposely jacked the settings on this TV.  They went in and just messed things up.  And I said, well, if you give me the remote and let me just simply reset it,  and I won't do anything else besides resetting it, it's going to look fine.  So I was just like, I had to take a picture of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, that's funny because that goes back into the to the days  of the stereo store chains that used to be in the Bay Area.  And there were two or three of them.  And they would one of the things that you find out if you dug around  was that they would like to take, you know, they had they always made  these proprietary speakers that were garbage, but they would always have them  in some room where they would compare them to like, you know,  something that was reasonably good.  And they would literally they would take a screwdriver  and they would put a hole in the quality speaker.  So when you listen to the comparison, it was always just kind of breaking up  a little bit. It's just old tricks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used to work at Best Buy way back when when I was like 17.  And they didn't have the Geek Squad yet, but they did have the computer  support services.  And the problem, though, is that they paid everyone so low  that all the good talent that came in and all the people that we hired  would just jump to a new job six months later.  So you always kind of got that middle of the road,  middle of the road kind of tech guy that could, you know, replace hard drives  and do very basic stuff.  But when it came to actual advanced troubleshooting, it's like  you're better off finding an expert somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People do still need a lot of help.  It's really remarkable how much help people still need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think they're great for like if you buy a wireless router,  like if my parents or mom or whatever bought a wireless router  and I was out of town and couldn't install it, I'd say, yeah, you know,  pay the extra 30, 40 bucks.  They'll come over, they'll hook it up and they'll get you going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Apparently Verizon is already doing this for their DSL and Fios customers.  And the theory is that they may expand as well into this business.  It's a good business, you know, and it frankly, it's a good business for goodwill.  I have a friend we do a home.  We're starting to going to start doing a home theater podcast.  And the guy who is going to do it for us is an editor at a big magazine,  Home Theater Magazine.  But he he said calibration does make a big difference.  These these sets are set to be very bright so that they look good in the store.  And you don't want to take them home and leave them the way they are.  Is that true, Robert?  Do you feel like that people do need to calibrate their sets a little bit anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It used to be the case. Not so much anymore.  Energy Star really changed things.  They they basically are making it so that that default setting  can't be that super jacked up right setting anymore.  And all the TVs now have a store mode.  Right when you first turn a new TV on nowadays,  most of them have a menu that pops up that says, is this being installed in a store  or in your home? Oh, interesting.  And it will it will it will default out of that super jacked up right mode  and into something a little more reasonable.  One, because in order to pass Energy Star ratings for the energy consumption.  Right. So but I mean, besides that, the big thing you really just have to do  is, you know, use something like the TV's movie or theater mode.  That gets you so close to right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or they come with this kind of this dynamic mode or this store mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really the dynamic or the worst. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's a thing here.  This terminology bugs me, by the way, and I don't know.  I'm sure some will complain about me complaining about this.  But is this really calibrating?  I mean, it's like, you know, it's such a thing.  I'm right. Yes. And you turn down the contrast a little bit and you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if real calibration goes beyond that, it would also affect things  like the white point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know that. I agree with that would be real calibrate.  But that's what we're talking about most of the time.  These guys usually jack up the brightness and the contrast.  And well, in theory, if these if these are the geek squads been trained,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  these guys are certified to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to bet on that one.  But I'm just curious of what training they had or what certification they had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, they told it's it's a something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The ISF ISF Imaging Science Foundation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they're ISF certified or TX certified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't believe that.  I just that's an expensive course to be putting your your minions through.  I mean, it's a minimum for ISF.  I believe it's upwards close to a thousand bucks.  And for THX, it's like fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars for those courses.  So are they doing that?  That's every person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Clearly not. But that's that's what you want.  You want a guy who's been certified like that? Hopefully. Yeah.  And I got I went out and got you can buy.  There's a I got a DVD Essentials disc, Blu Ray disc,  that has all of these different charts on it.  Yeah. HD Basics. That's it. That's awesome.  It's 16 bucks on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I'm buying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's Blu Ray. They have HD DVD, Blu Ray or regular DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All the HD Basics. Yeah. Yep.  I saw a production protector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's DV digital video essentials.  It's on Amazon.  I bought it and you just walk through. It's not hard to do.  I mean, you know, to do it right, you'd want a colorimeter or something  to measure the screen. But you could do it with your eyes.  And so it has the chart that says, OK, make this be just visible.  OK. You know, and it's it does make a difference.  That's probably 90 percent of what an ISF guy would do, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really just gets down.  There is variance when you build a line of TVs,  if you're building one hundred thousand units, even even using you part out.  You're using identical parts in each one,  but there will still be variances between each unit.  And if you really want it accurate and if you want somebody  to go through all those settings and ensure it's doing all the right things,  it's good to have somebody come out that knows what they're doing to take a look at it.  I've ran into every now and then I run into a brand new set that out of the box,  it is literally destroying, say, half the video picture. Right.  Before it gets to the screen. Right.  Because one of the settings in the TV wasn't configured properly  or the firmware is bad.  I've had two TVs this year already from major manufacturers, poor firmware.  And they're like, oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this is, by the way, the one they sent to you for review.  So that's not a good sign. It's not even that if it's to me that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to everybody that way.  So it's not like I'm getting these before.  No, I know. I know. It's bad news. So, yeah.  No, I'm looking at the.  I'm at the.  Some manufacturers are actually posting those now on their website,  so people can, if they want, download those and apply that firmware to their own TVs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm at the I'm at the Geek Squad site and they have a special kind of specialist,  the elite service specialist who is ISF certified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good, brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about their computer tech?  So they all like a plus or Microsoft certified or what's the deal?  Anything? Let me look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. That's a good question.  I know. I know a couple of people who work at a Geek Squad near me,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and they don't have to have that to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's really an A plus certification.  Any guarantee of anything?  No, they still do serial port testing and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, A plus neither is ISF certification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, really?  Well, it's just sure you pass the course,  but did you get out in the field and actually do anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it says here Geek Squad professionals are highly trained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but it doesn't replace hands on experience.  And at least in the circus, they make you do 10 field  calibrations before they actually certify you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, by the way, wasn't Tom Cruise great in Tropic Thunder?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I haven't seen it yet. I'm going tonight. Don't tell me.  Tell him the ending. Should I mute myself now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Initially, let's just put it this way.  Don't look for Tom Cruise. You'll never you'll never spot him.  Don't look for him because you won't spot him.  And then at the end, you'll see the credits. You go, what?  All right, we're going to take a break, come back with more in just a bit.  But first, I want to remind you this portion of the show  brought to you by the good folks at audible.com.  Audible provides all of our audio.  You got some, right, John?  You finally got your Audible account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got the account, and I have a book to recommend, although I didn't get it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, audible.com slash twit.  You go there, you sign up.  It's U.S. only. You sign up.  You can get a credit toward a free book.  And John is going to tell you what you should get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I don't know if they have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, well, let me look while you talk. I'll look.  We've had that. We had that happen last twit, by the way.  Cali canis says, oh, I love Good to Great.  It's this great book by Jim Collins.  It's not on Audible.  See if Legacy of Ashes is on. It is.  And I have it. And it's great.  It's the story of the CIA.  And it is on Audible in unabridged, and it is I am listening.  It is amazing, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And apparently it's all true. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just screw up after screw up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I don't know about that.  I looked at it as more from the humor because I have the hard copy  and I was going to put the finish it off on Audible.  But because it's too big to read.  I mean, it's huge. Yeah, it's a long book.  But the it's these stories, many of them are just I mean, yeah,  there's a lot of screw ups in this like the ending of the book  just to be a buzzkill here as it says that, you know, this  this system is not is broken.  Yeah, what a surprise. Really?  But but the stories, some of them are just the hoot.  I mean, they're just the funniest things you've ever read.  And then you read them and you begin.  You always vaguely remember when this happened in the news like ever.  But now we know the real story. Yeah.  Yeah. And you read the real story and there most of them are funny.  And it's I think it's a very entertaining book from that perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tim Winer wrote it Pulitzer Prize winning author Legacy of Ashes,  the history of the CIA.  It's 21 hours on Audible on a bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, it backs up most of the confessions of an economic hitman.  Oh, really? Yeah, I mean, I think it does.  So if you're a conspiracy theorist, you're a nutcase, a nutter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you're one of them nutters, you're going to love it.  Tim Winer, Legacy of Ashes, read by Stefan Rynicki, who's one of their best.  Audible does a great job of making these books come to life.  And really, when a book's really long like that, it's heavy.  You know, you're reading it. It's hard to hold.  You know, you're trying to drive the car with the book on the steering wheel.  It just, you know, it's distracting.  So much easier.  Put on the headphones, relax, listen, put it in your iPod, put it on your CD,  a CD, listen in the car.  You'll be amazed. You know, 23 hours sounds like a big book.  And it is if you look at it.  But if you commute and if you commute as I did one hour each way,  that's two weeks and it's done.  You I read so many books when I was driving down to Tech TV.  That's what got me hooked on Audible.  And I'm still hooked. Audible dot com slash twit.  50,000 titles. Some of the best stuff in the world.  We thank them so much for their support.  And I'll let you know a little bit later on, I'm going to be doing something special.  I'm really excited with Audible.  I read a short story, which is still not on Audible, but they liked it so much.  It was kind of my audition.  They're going to ask me to I think they're going to ask me to do something else.  You can do a big book.  I don't have time to do a big book, but I think I'm going to do a part of a bigger book.  You'll see. It's going to it's really exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm really I think you should do a book, a big book with that needs a lot of voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would love to. You know, that's what I  you know, the guy who did the Harry Potter books on on Audible is so amazing.  He's a man of a million voices, Jim Dale.  And but I but I read those books to my kids.  And it's fun to come up with all these different voices for all these different people.  It's really it's really a treat.  So that yeah, I would love to do that.  I mean, really a lot of fun.  I'd actually just like to do Legacy of Ashes in my Russian exit the whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're like the Russians.  The Russians know what really happened with CIA.  They could tell you stories.  You would curl your hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's going to sound a little bit like a line like a bell.  A legacy. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I drink your soup before it clots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let's see any other big stories that we want to talk about before we dismiss the team.  We're going to keep going a little bit.  I want to talk some about what we're doing with the Twitter army and why.  And Steve Gilmore, who is a really strong advocate for this open micro blogging platform,  wants to stick around and anybody else who wants to is welcome to.  We got to remember that we are working on some really cool  twit gear from Scott E.  Vest, Scotty Vest, dot com.  They're the official purveyors of twit gear and we're doing a special twit hoodie  with artwork by Nitro Zac of Nitro Zac and Snaggy of the Joy and Tech.  That's going to be really fun.  Keep watching for that.  In fact, I think Scott is actually having a little contest in our forums for the design.  So that's kind of a neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it should be designed like a straight jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, you laugh.  But Nitro Zac's picture of you, John, is of you.  Yeah, yeah, that was the callback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the point. Yeah.  It was only for the two people who ever saw that cartoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was a great cartoon of you in a straight jacket.  What was that for? I forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I was claiming that Apple was going to move to windows or something like that.  It was a long time ago. Yeah.  Yeah. Fun stuff.  Still can happen. Still can happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin Rose, you say September 9th, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not certain, but yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have in my hand the papers that will prove my contention.  And of course, dig, dig.com.  Dignation on Revision 3 is one of the great shows on the Revision 3 network.  And you're with Pounce.  So if you want to stick around and talk a little bit more about, oh, you got a racquetball game.  But, yep, I do indeed.  OK, we won't keep you then.  But I would love to get you and Leah involved in this idea of open  opening up these these micro blogs so that they can intercommunicate.  It's just to me, a very exciting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They still have a racquetball.  I thought that, Kevin, that by now you would have moved to squash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, squash is out now. Racketball's back in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Squash is fantastic. Everybody loves squash.  We played it at school. In the basement.  John C. Davorek dot org slash blog.  And of course, he's on, boy, Tech 5 and.  Oh, he's on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's on. Let's listen in as John talks to his agent late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, too bad. Hey, Dvorak, I just submitted your an Olympic moment.  Phelps caught behaving badly and submitted that today.  It's very funny. What happened?  What do you do? Oh, you have to see it yet.  It's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Dvorak dot org. I'm going there right now.  Let's all go to Dvorak dot org slash blog and then dig it on dig dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that gets some numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There we go. Like some money for John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's a good thing on a Sunday.  There's not much action anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you guys? What did you think of the Olympics success?  I liked them. Fun to watch.  On the watch, they kind of do you feel like NBC went a little easy on?  I guess it wasn't time to get political with China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not if they wanted to cover it.  But you know, it started getting a little meaner near the end,  especially when the boxing controversies broke out. Right.  And so they started slamming them a little bit, but it wasn't at the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's for sure. You know, China, it's so funny because China really tried to make  to look like an open nation and part of the world, you know, and so forth.  But but at the same time, on Monday, they shut down iTunes.  The entire thing.  One and a half billion Chinese can no longer download songs from iTunes  because there was a pro Tibetan album, one album on iTunes.  They shut the whole thing down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, this was a funny moment.  I was watching with my son and we were thinking about some of the things  that could be done.  There's two things that I think should have happened at the Olympics.  One, when somebody's losing, like, for example, in the super high dive,  why don't they just run off to the platform, screaming and yelling,  waving their arms and then do a cannonball and then flip off the bird?  Now, that's one.  The other one is that there was a race where the American was disqualified  because he stepped on the line or something when one of these very long races.  And he's traipsing around with a flag and then he's now he's disqualified.  That is the moment that he should have said, I'm disqualified.  I'm not in. You mean free Tibet, free to.  Oh, yeah. See, that's the opportunity.  Because if you do, if you say free to bet, apparently it's in the contract.  If you say free to bet during the Olympics,  the agreement between the Olympic Committee and China is that you would be  disqualified from whatever you were in.  So if you're disqualified, hey, what difference does it make?  There's a lot of fun stuff that didn't happen.  Hey, why is your sight down, John?  Is it probably got slammed by six thousand people at once?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's why.  The Twitter army strikes again.  That can happen.  These things happen.  Any sites you want us to kill, Robert?  That's it's not down. It's working. Is it OK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess not. Never mind. It's not working.  I got to I got there.  I got to the work dot org splash page, but which without the blog,  you get a little thing and then you won't hit the blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Robert Heron at ZD Media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This should be a little more robust. It came up anyway.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not. No, we bring down sites every time we mention a site, we bring it down  also on DL dot TV.  Anything else you want to plug, Robert?  Is Robert gone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
