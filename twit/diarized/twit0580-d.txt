End time: 593.72

Transcript:  But if you use the Samsung VR where you're only tethered to your phone  which maybe in a pocket you can walk into anything or off a cliff and I  You know I I wouldn't say I've completely tired of it, but it's not I don't find it that compelling  Maybe it's my age. I'm not a big gamer, but I have one problem  So you know the New York Times they had this it's an app and you can get it on the fact  They gave away the cardboard VR, so I'm watching this really compelling video, and I actually am enjoying it  No, you're watching yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm not enjoying it, but I'm appreciating though. It's amazing and all of a sudden  I hear I hear this plane, and it's dropping  Supplies I think in the sedan, but I don't see the plane because I in the real world if a plane were flying over me  I would actually know it was over me because I could hear it was over me  Look up to it, but I couldn't figure out where this plane was and I actually missed the important scene  And I realized that in a movie a director goes out of his or her way to make sure you're looking at the important thing  That you should be paying attention to in virtual reality  It's up to you to know where to look and I think it works well in some in some environments  But for movie type presentations. I actually felt myself

Start time: 684.96
End time: 694.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not not getting the full value out of it. You have to tune it for the you're right. I mean  You have to tune it for the experience. That's why gaming I think works well as opposed to storytelling

Start time: 694.98
End time: 699.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think storytelling is going to be great. It's just people haven't really figured out how to do it

Start time: 699.40
End time: 702.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's you have to get the audio right they have to figure out three. Well. That's another problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  None of these do the audio right none of them move the audio in the same way they move the

Start time: 707.32
End time: 736.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've seen some with very good position. Yeah, and look it's just you know all of the first movies right when films first came right  They were all just basically people filming like right plays right right and it took a long time  It took decades for people to figure out how to actually tell a story and television with just radio with pictures  Yeah, it'll take it'll take a few years, but I think it's gonna be pretty amazing  I mean I can tell when I the experiences have been getting better exponentially  And I can just I can I can see greatness to it  I would say like it's already great, but it's not yet good so I could

Start time: 738.38
End time: 739.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How do you get to great without going through good?

Start time: 741.88
End time: 752.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Most of the most of the really important things skip good  They go directly to great and then it takes a few years to get to sort of work backwards to good  I'm gonna make it actually you know file off all the rough edges. I'm willing to withhold judgment

Start time: 752.72
End time: 763.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just feel like there was so much hype and I fell for it as well and  Spent a lot of money and time doing it and then I I kind of have this gnawing suspicion. It might be just a fad

Start time: 764.94
End time: 815.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see I don't I don't think it's gonna be a fad because I've had I think everyone that I know try it out  And these are people that usually that don't game  And I think that it's really good at certain things so when you're playing  You know first-person shooters against other people. It's a wonderful experience  It's much more salacious when you shoot someone you're actually ducking behind something and running towards them  It's yeah  Well, I have been punched a couple of times when my child's playing it and I have hit the wall and broke my Vive controller  once as well  But it's it's a really immersive experience to that  I think that it's different like there's a certain things that would be good for I think that watching a horror film in VR  Might be too intense, but for people that want that level of intensity  The fact that you might miss something and you're constantly looking around your shoulder  I think would add to the experience to it. But again, it's first gen

Start time: 816.04
End time: 835.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anybody have any updates on the porn? I know the porn hub or one of these sites is tired of that, too  I haven't checked it out. No, I'm actually have it. I'm not saying I wouldn't I just haven't I've checked it out  I got tired of that too. I mean did it add any dimension to it's pretty immersive  Well, that's what porn ought to be about I guess I don't know I don't think so. I mean actually

Start time: 839.36
End time: 843.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and maybe this is another case where they'll get better at it because we don't yet know how to do it

Start time: 844.00
End time: 849.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't aren't they usually the early adopters? I mean, you know the old thing with VHS. First of all, I'm not sure that's true

Start time: 849.32
End time: 887.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that that's a common  misnomer, but I maybe or  misstatement but so I  Think here's my problem. I think VR in general demos great and people get very excited when they first do it  It's really exciting. I think I'm just not clear that it has a long-term  Appeal to it for a number of reasons makes people queasy is a big one and about 10 10% of everybody uses it's gonna stay queasy  but also  It's it's I don't know, but you know, maybe I feel the same way about video games  So maybe that's you know, I get tired of it after a while. It's also kind of a big McGill to get to do it

Start time: 887.10
End time: 893.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean if I want to watch I just turn on the TV and it's right there, right?  If I want to do VR, it's kind of like playing soccer

Start time: 895.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really nice. The PlayStation VR is fabulous. Like that's a great  I was really surprised with how good PlayStation VR was when I tested out  I tested out it on on heist, which I think is where Leo the same game that you tried with it  It was yeah, you're riding in a car

Start time: 927.18
End time: 964.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was really it was much faster to set up. It was easier to use. I think that and  The the screen like it was really  Exceptionally good. I think that this is something like it's more exhausting if you want a very passive experience  Virtual reality is not that it's very very immersive. It's a little bit exhausting. It's tiring  I think that for the younger generation they're often looking for that  They want something that will be more immersive than just a game that you're looking on a screen  And so my definitely increases my anxiety faster. It makes me feel like I'm there  I think that if you're looking for something that you can relax and do I think that virtual reality is not that

Start time: 965.12
End time: 978.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you really solved it for me because by the time I'm ready to  Play a game  Sitting there on the couch with a beer edging out  And so maybe that I think that's actually a very good understanding of it. Thank you. It's now

Start time: 978.40
End time: 993.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know why partly this is an occupational hazard because part of my job is to look at any new thing and say well  is this really genuinely life-changing or or technology changing or is it just and because  Let's face it Silicon Valley's thrown a lot of stuff up against the wall and most of it isn't

Start time: 994.00
End time: 1030.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hmm you can tell early like three this is nothing like you think this is a big deal  Yeah, it's a big deal and like and the negative  The the the problems that you guys are pointing out about him is but kind of funny like it takes too long to set up  Well, it's expensive. We had to build a multi thousand dollar PC to do well that'll change boy, you know  This reminds me of a conversation that I was having about  hundred thousand years ago  When fire first came out  Would you know and it's like  Yeah, it's hot and burns you you can like you can hurt yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's virtual fire that's all I think it's I think it's a I think it's a big step forward  It's everything is kind of clunky right now, but it has the yeah, it has the seeds of greatness in it  I understand in a way like that 3d TV never did like 3d

Transcript:  What about virtual versus augmented well, I think obviously to me augmented is really  Gonna be the revolution  But I wanted to ask George is because you've been using it now for six months who were very you and your husband  Very hot on it  And if anybody was gonna get tired of it, it would be you you you're early adopters  But you've spent a lot of time and you still love it  So that in a way that that's a data point that's valuable to me  I've always said and by the way, Tim Cook this week said it as well  He said Apple's much more interested in augmented reality and virtual reality. I think those are really totally different things

Start time: 1086.94
End time: 1093.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think VR is really entertainment. Yeah, and  It's meant to be immersive. It's meant to be and that's what Tim said is you can't see what's going on

Transcript:  well, but you know, I  Had somebody called the radio show today said I I have a  Medical condition where I can't remember faces. I think I have that yeah, I might actually  And he said I know there's facial recognition is it possible for me to use it to  When I see people to remind me who I'm meeting and I said well, I think all the companies have it  It's not even that hard to do go Google has it Facebook has it Apple has it  But none of them are willing to release this kind of general recognition mostly because of the stalker problem  I wonder though if you had what is it facial aphasia if you could get a prescription for it  Because that's what to me augmented reality would be awesome  It'd be like, you know being in Daniel Suarez is a demon where you look at somebody and they've got  Reputed not only their name  That's Joe his wife is Irma. Yeah, they have two children his birthdays tomorrow, but also reputation score like  He's high on chaotic evil stay away and I would love to be gamifying the world. That's more than productivity

Transcript:  That's a little bit. That's well with the before the user score  I was all with you and I think that that would be the same thing as when you look at your own photos and you set  It up yourself. That wouldn't be something that would that's what happens now  You could definitely  Yeah  would definitely be helpful for people that are dealing with that because it's  People don't really even understand how difficult it is to go through life if you're dealing with that  I think that having the rep score from different people  We could take that right?

I promise I fix it tore these down right of course  It's the first thing they do they went to  Japan Tokyo got it early tore it down and  Remember now. This is the phone you can't really see it. This. This is like the b2 bomber something  I'll do it on this one this  This is the phone that instead of having a headphone jack over here to the left of the lightning port has another speaker grill  So I fix it tears it apart and they said wait a minute those are just holes in the body  There's actually no speaker there  The stereo speakers are this speaker and the one up top that you listen to that makes sense  And they said we're not sure really what's going on. There's a plastic kind of baffle behind this  So Apple now forced to reveal the truth  Said oh, yeah, so  Then so that plastic baffle is a barometric  filter  that keeps water from coming in but allows to allows the  Air pressure to equalize inside the phone  Why because there's an altimeter in the phone and if the air pressure doesn't actually match the inside and the outside it won't know  What the altitude is so?  We gave up a headphone jack, but we got an altimeter congratulations

End time: 1481.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You think that's a fair trade? No, I'm just joking. They'd always had an altimeter  But because it's a sealed phone now, they had to have some way of letting the air pressure equalize without letting water in  But Apple made this big deal about how we're gonna take out the headphone jack that gives us so much more room to do stuff  Apparently it puts us it gives us some more room to put a barometer

Start time: 1631.91
End time: 1644.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think probably most of the time will just use wireless  Yeah, I think that's the plan and I think it's like the headphone jack is dumb like I'm not a judgment on it  I mean literally like it's not a piece of electronics that you can carry like a smart signal

Start time: 1644.44
End time: 1649.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

End time: 1668.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anything that you plug into it is really limited to what you can do what Apple wants to do is say that every headphone in  The future is actually going to be a wearable computer that you can do a ton with that you can swipe on that has sensors  On it like it is the ultimate wearable and so  Getting rid of that headphone jack making people go with either a lightning connector or wireless actually just makes a ton of sense

Transcript:  I think they're also we put a lot of pressure on Apple each year to make a massive change to the phone and this it doesn't  Have to be even in this the talk here where?  extensively you'd have a new design and  Apple is not gonna not have an event and make a big deal about the new phone even if it isn't  That much different you got the duals lens camera. You got a haptic button  Faster processor better screen these are incremental minor improvements, but Apple's gonna have what I realize Apple is so good  Is telling a story and they're they're brilliant at telling this story and getting people  Excited and buying into the story whether the story  technically  You know makes a lot of sense or is you know if it's a technical real technical achievement  And you must know this you know must have experienced this in your own  Career in tech that the story is as much as important if not more important than the technology actually

Transcript:  This is what you were saying about the story  I think like Apple  Tells such a good story that people think they know why they should upgrade as soon as it comes out

Start time: 3452.90
End time: 3461.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  With Android you just don't well that yeah some have something the other difference is what we already mentioned  Which is not everybody who has an Android phone even has the option, but I think this is this is of eligible

End time: 3469.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is ironic if I think of Android as a phone that geeks you this I mean I I use Android because I like the  flexibility and the geekiness of it, but you would think that that  You know a lot of Android people would be tech savvy and would be wanting that latest and greatest both

Start time: 3484.62
End time: 3512.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think there is a lot of us and I include myself who use it because we like to  Fuss around and do things and you have much more flexibility in an Android phone  And then it's also and I would say this is probably the majority of owners the cheap phone  It's a cheap many countries. It's a cheap phone. Yeah, and so there are a lot of people who have phones that can't go past  You know fro yo or gingerbread or you know jelly bean or KitKat

Start time: 3512.28
End time: 3525.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just like so even even in this country if you buy a phone  And it's even if it's not a cheap phone you may not be able to upgrade for a while  They don't you don't you have to wait until they get around to it which could take months or years in cases no my

Transcript:  My galaxy s7 is not yet right Nuget  In fact, I don't think I have any Nuget phones except for the Nexus phone in excess. Yeah, I think that for a lot of people

Start time: 3537.06
End time: 3588.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't upgrade because they already know how their phone works. They feel comfortable with it. They understand the ecosystem  They understand the the user interface and they don't want to change that they don't want something to happen  They don't want something that they don't understand and that causes a lot of people anxiety  And so once you're comfortable with it. They want to keep it that way  I think Apple does a great job of giving you all of these candies and bells and whistles  And you know if you haven't upgraded people that have upgraded are saying well  This would be sent with lasers or they sent a heart, but you can't see it and that makes people say you know  What I really want to send hearts  I want to be able to do what you can do and so that increases people saying you know what I might have a little bit of  anxiety of having to relearn how to use my phone again or some things may be changed or in a different place  But these cool things make it worth that hump to be able to go over it  And so Apple does a great job of being able to publicize why you want to upgrade

Start time: 3588.64
End time: 3602.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plus if some iPhone users found out last week, there is a risk during an upgrade that something could go wrong  I think about that. I never upgrade for example when I'm traveling because I want to be home or have backup phones if something goes wrong  Isn't the case though that the Apple doesn't tell you about the update for a while

Start time: 3604.64
End time: 3947.20

Transcript:  So you can find it if you go and look in your settings  But it's usually a week or more after the updates available that Apple will then start giving a notification  I always upgrade the minute it's available  So geeks have the ability to go oh let's see, oh I just read it's out  I saw an iMore, everybody get it  But then most normal people will not update in the first week and by that time Apple's fixed any massive problems  And they'll get the notification then. I think Apple actually does that quite well  But partly because they complete, they were in a position to completely control the ecosystem  When they came out, they held AT&T's feet to the fire  When Verizon wanted an iPhone, they held their feet to the fire  So they have better deals frankly than any Android manufacturer has with the carriers  And they benefit from that  Let's take a break because we were talking about messages  There is something comparable coming from Google I'm very excited about  And it may be coming soon  But first a word from GoToMeeting  Be a meeting MVP with GoToMeeting  Step up your meeting game, take them to the next level  Instead of having a boring old conference call, use GoToMeeting  It's just like a conference call bridge  In fact you can have an audio only call  What's nice though is you can do it on your phone  But you can also do it on your computer using VoIP with your headsets  It's built into the GoToMeeting software  You can do it on your iPad, you can do it on your iPhone or your Android device  So you've got the audio  But then, and it happens to me all the time  We're in a conference call, they say let me show you  And I have the screen sharing and I turn that on  And they go oh yeah, I have a PowerPoint presentation, let me show you  Or I'd like to see you, let's turn on the cameras  And suddenly you have HD video  And it's kind of getting more and more like you're meeting in person  And that's what's so great about it  You're on the same page with screen sharing  It's like you're in the same room with HD video  You can pass off presenter duties  It's a great way to collaborate  It's a great way to present  It's just the easiest solution  Once you install GoToMeeting  And you do it free right now if you go to gotomeeting.com  You can set up a meeting in seconds  There's even an integration into Microsoft Outlook  So you send an email  Your client will get an email that says hey  We're going to have a GoToMeeting 9 o'clock tomorrow morning  When the time comes around, it's in their Outlook calendar now  They get a notification, they click the link  Even if they've never used it or installed it before  30 seconds later the software installs, they're ready to go  It's so easy for them  And that's important too because if you're presenting to a potential client  If you're pitching somebody, you don't want to make it hard on them  You want to make it a great experience  It is, it invariably is, it's really awesome  One click recording, built-in audio  Toll free calls is an option  And you can do things like have back channel chats  Which is always fun when somebody's presenting  You can send private links and so forth  It's good, it's the best  GoToMeeting.com  Try it free for 30 days and step up your meeting game  Be a meeting MVP with GoToMeeting  We thank them, they've been one of our best advertisers  Supporters since, I think since 2005 or 2006 for a long time  We're talking about the week's tech news and early edition  Because it's a getaway day for me  I'm heading out and I'm a little disappointed  Because I've been waiting for Google's version of messages  Google Allo, they announced it at WWDC in June  And they said it would be out by the end of summer  Well, when is the end of summer?  September 21st  Soon, September 45th  It's a funny game sometimes companies will play  Is it calendar summer? Is it Labor Day?  Well, it's obviously not Labor Day  Ev Leakes, who's usually pretty good on this  He says it will be out this week  Allo is going to be very interesting  Because all the things we were just talking about  With Siri in your ear and the messaging platform  Google can do, and I think it tends to do with Allo  Including automatically pull up bits and pieces of apps  Even if you don't have it installed  Evernote, for instance, I don't know if they're going to do this  But they could, if I don't have Evernote on my Android device  By the way, it's cross-platform, Android and iOS  Which I really like  This is probably an Android-only feature though  If I don't have Evernote installed  I can ask for something from Evernote  And it will download a little small bit of Evernote  Just enough to accomplish that  And then after doing the task  Say, if you want the full app that's available  I think that's great for app developers  It's a chance for them to get some exposure  And it's great for users because it adds capability  Allo becomes your ombudsman, your middleman  The guy, instead of  And this is one problem I had with the chat platform on Facebook, for instance  Where I was interacting directly with the bots  And it's annoying after a while  With Allo, and I suspect Apple's going to do this with Messages too  It represents you to the outside world  So you ask Siri or you ask Google Now for something  And it handles  Oh, I'll make that reservation for you  Or I'll call that Uber for you  We'll see, it's supposedly coming out soon  End-to-end encryption  But you have to turn it on  That was a little controversial, but I think I understand why  Google Assistant built in  Sticker packs  Will they be as good?  Apparently, there are some  Well, according to this, condoms, butts, and nipples  So if, once again, Apple has aced you out of the dirty GIFs  You can get them from Google  I don't know if that's true

Start time: 3951.64
End time: 3973.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, and that's exactly why  Otherwise, the Assistant is not encrypted, right?  The Assistant is listening in  It's not encrypted  And I think that's why Google made it optional  And off by default  Because they would obviously like to hear as much as possible  Of what you're saying  And I don't mean to cast dispersion  It's not like they're spying on you  But that's how they get the functionality

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is what they say, they need this power to investigate a network of devices infected with malware and controlled by a criminal  Many of us, well not me, but many of you, your computers are, without your knowledge, occupied by malware  Which allows a bad guy to use you against other systems with DDoS attacks as a botnet  So apparently they're asking for permission to examine your computer to see if you have a bot on it  How do you feel about that?

Start time: 5911.64
End time: 5915.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think the SNARK is the right way to handle this  I think they need to be able to combat botnets  It's obviously pretty dangerous to expand this authority  But we should have pretty hardcore rules about what they can and can't do  Who sees it, who doesn't  And what are the rules for evidence gathering  This is a real thing that we need to confront

Transcript:  If Congress doesn't weigh in, December 1st this new rule goes into effect  It seems unlikely Congress is going to do anything  I do understand why the FBI would love to be able to be proactive in fighting these botnets  We'd all like them to succeed in this  This is a massive problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to put myself in the shoes of a federal law enforcement agent  Somebody who is very sophisticated about technology  Let's say what we would like to do is create a...  I'm not going to call it malware, that's Wired's term  I want to create a tool that automatically spreads throughout the internet  It looks at your computer and examines it for a bot  If it finds one, it does some forensics to figure out who the bot's contacting  What the bot's up to and then deletes the bot and moves on  Would that be okay?

Start time: 6003.66
End time: 6018.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It would be okay with me as long as it asks me for permission to advance  No, no, it can't ask you for permission to advance  Well, no, no, if I'm a victim of a botnet  If I'm a potential victim, I'm just average Joe Citizen  You might want the government to help me keep bots out of my computer  It's not going to know

Start time: 6025.96
End time: 6044.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What I'm saying is I would be willing to allow some trusted authority that I trusted  If the government qualifies to help me keep bots out of my computer  That's what I want to do  Just like I don't want criminals prowling around my backyard  That would be a good thing  I agree

Start time: 6044.82
End time: 6095.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is that Congress doesn't have the technical knowledge in order to make these decisions  So that they're actually protecting the privacy of the people that are going to be having this  In comparison to if a company say, Apple said, listen, we would like to systematically every once in a while  Check your computer to make sure that you do not have any malware on it  I would have a completely different opinion on this  But because we know that any government will want to have more power in order to protect you  But then that power could be used against the same people that they're hoping to protect  And then to control the way that people vote, sway public opinion  And also be able to monitor, which we already know that they are doing at a vast, expansive place  In a very enclosed kind of way without our knowledge  I think that they've already set the precedent of not being able to have the public feel comfortable and trusted

Start time: 6096.54
End time: 6168.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now does this change your opinion if I tell you that this article I'm reading from WIRED, this opinion piece  Was written in part by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon  He is very much a member of Congress  He's actually one of the smartest in terms of technology  He serves in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  He's worried about this  It does change my opinion  And believes that Congress is not going to act on this  Also Matt Blaze, who's a professor of computer information science at the University of Pennsylvania  And Susan Landau of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute  Where she also teaches cyber security policy  So these three people are pretty serious about all of this  They're very concerned  They also say the FBI statements to date don't inspire confidence that it knows what it's doing  One FBI special agent testified that a tool was safe because he had tested it on his home computer  And it, quote, did not make any changes to the security settings on my computer, end quote  Obviously, that's not enough  On the other hand, I do think appropriate  I agree with you, Phil, appropriately giving them the tools to do this kind of thing  With appropriate privacy guards is not a bad thing  If we believe that they are not violating their own privacy policy standards

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it would be useful to think about how would you be comfortable with the situation being handled  It's easy to say we don't trust the FBI  And I don't particularly trust them by default either  But you shouldn't  Exactly, that's not supposed to

Transcript:  That's different because you've gone out in public and you've given permission  Same thing as driving  You are using these public transportation systems  And part of the deal is you agree to give up some rights to use them  But you're in your own home now using your own computer

Transcript:  And the Supreme Court has ruled on things like this  In fact, there's quite a famous ruling involving police officers investigating reports of a bullet being shot through a wall  Seeing stolen stereo equipment, looking at the serial numbers and arresting the perpetrator  And it was thrown out by the Supreme Court because they said, you were there to investigate the bullet  Not check the serial numbers on the stereo  You exceeded your authority

And this is an interesting balance  Hey, we've got to take a break because I have to get out of here pretty soon  And I want to mention our great sponsor, Casper  A maker of amazing mattresses  It's really interesting how this has become a category, right?  This is reinventing  This is what I love about the Internet  Reinventing the things we do in the normal course of events  But using the Internet to make it work better  Now, often that means eliminating the middleman  But in this case, it's more than that  Because, of course, we've all been putting up with this idea that you can go lie on a mattress for five minutes  In a brightly lit showroom with a salesperson glaring at you  And know, oh, this is the right mattress for me, baby  I'm taking this one home  Casper, because they don't have showrooms, has found a better way  They had to find a better way  They let you get this beautiful mattress  It's engineered to perfection, made in the United States  Springy latex foam, supportive memory foam  So you get a beautiful sleep surface  Award-winning, in fact  They got the 2016 Business Intelligence Group Innovation Award  And then you get 100 nights to try it  100 nights  And if you don't like it, no problem  They'll come and get it  And take it away and refund you every penny  It costs you nothing  Casper mattresses uphold the highest environmental production standards  You can tell, by the way, when you open the box  It's a very compact box  And your mattress comes out and it smells fabulous  And it breathes  It is the best mattress for hot summer nights  It's cool  It's made in the USA  Shipping is free  Returns are free in the US or Canada  It's an amazing mattress

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's a great article in the New York Times, actually  Interesting that you should ask this Sunday  And what they did is they bought mattresses  And they returned them  In some cases, in most cases  Now, this was the problem was they did it in Manhattan  Where it's kind of hard to find charities to take mattresses  But in most cases, they try to find a charity  A homeless center, that kind of thing  And they don't resell it  They just give it to the charity  Which is, I think, kind of cool  In any event, it's off your hands  And you got your money back  I don't think you're going to return it  You think you're going to love it

Start time: 6411.64
End time: 6425.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

I think we got it all  I'm just looking at this  US tech firms including Facebook, Google, and Twitter  Urging Congress to support the government's plan  To give control of the DNS system  To ICANN  I guess the Commerce Department still has oversight  I thought that that happened years ago  ICANN will be in charge  Oversight of the nonprofit  ICANN  Oh, I see  Will go out of the Commerce Department's control  October 1st unless Congress votes otherwise  There's this whole conspiracy theory  The UN wants to take over  And the Russians and blah, blah, blah  No country should control the Internet  And I think this is appropriate

Start time: 6523.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 6550.00

Transcript:  The other way to think about that is  Is it broken now?  Kind of a big deal  Is it broken or is it working?  It seems to work to me  Right, so there's an argument to not screw around with it  And giving it to the UN is screwing around with something  What they're really saying is

Transcript:  You know, one of the things that exists in Star Trek  I think is most things are much more beneficent  They're like made in the interest of the people  Right  Like mattresses in Star Trek  Like when you buy a mattress  It's probably not this slimy thing that someone is ripping you off  And so actually, I think something like Casper  Which is not one of our investments  Is the Star Trek future?  Well, it's getting us in the right direction  Like the idea that you can do something like buy a mattress  Or open a banking account without feeling that someone is ripping you off  Right, right  Is a big deal  I agree  So that's the kind of thing I'm interested in  Nice, great to see you again  Come back soon  Thank you

Start time: 6736.31
End time: 6757.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, boundaries and consequences is wonderful  Because it teaches you how to help other people treat you  We teach people how to let us be treated  Yes  And so it just keeps all your relationships happy  Because you're not undermined or angry  But not able to share that  Because you've created a safe boundary and a consequence  If someone walks over that  So everyone should do that
