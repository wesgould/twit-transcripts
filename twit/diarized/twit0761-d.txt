Guy sitting and looking at a TV.  Experts are saying people may need to self-isolate to combat the virus.  He sits there.  I've been practicing for this moment my whole life.  I don't think that's quick.  Make plans.  Watch how fast I cancel.  I think there are a lot of us geeks who are finally going to have enough TV time.  Enough time to play with my Raspberry Pi.  Anyway, we are I should mention we are closing our studio for the time being.  So if you had tickets to come see us, I apologize.  But we really in respect to the staff as much as anything.

Transcript:  Good news.  The Pope is okay.  Italy is although he's not Lombardy, which is I think the region that is most affected  but he is testing negative for coronavirus according to Italy.  We've also talked to Father Robert balis air who is at the Vatican and he's okay too.  So actually it would be a serious thing for the Pope.  He's 83 years old.  He had part of a lung removed several decades ago and he has actually started to cancel  audiences not just papal audiences conferences being a cancel including bit of a shock South

End time: 416.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 416.52
End time: 428.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it was a very passive aggressive kind of cancellation message.  It was like we really didn't want to do this.  We didn't make the decision.  The city said we didn't have to but then you know, they said we should probably do it.

Start time: 429.20
End time: 432.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so the city I see I thought Austin made him do it.

Start time: 432.80
End time: 459.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the city doesn't think Austin made them do it is essentially what they'd said towards the end of it.  But they it was a strange message because I think it began by saying oh just as early as like last week.  The city had said we were going to be fine.  Everything was good.  But now the city is saying we have to do this public security and health risk, which like clearly and it didn't help that that Facebook Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's nothing worse than to have a conference and just nobody's there.  There's no booths.  There's no panels that would look almost even worse.  But I have to feel for the people in South in Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  God, I have friends of mine that have TV shows and documentaries down there that they are really trying to get sold.  So, you know, I kind of fear talking about this in terms of you know, a financial damage to people.  But it's it's very real and not just to corporations.  I mean why would you individuals?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

End time: 582.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is something like I mean, I think it's because it's a good day to sicken and die or something.  Nowadays, a large like a large large part of your revenue is going to be coming from audiences in China.  And if no one in China is being allowed to leave their homes and go congregate in public space, other people,  why would you release your movie when half of your revenue is not going to be there?

Start time: 582.28
End time: 587.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 642.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't mean to make light of it because it is you're right.  Absolutely.  Brianne, it's very it's a serious health issue.  Although people there are a lot of people who also think it's being overblown.  I had somebody called the radio show yesterday who said, you know, it's just the news media.  It's a sensationalistic story.  They're just over blowing it.  And I said, oh, are you a physician?  He said, no, I'm a piano tuner.

Start time: 644.22
End time: 647.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course.  Yeah.  So apparently the piano tuner constituency.

Start time: 648.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 650.74
End time: 653.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it something to be to be worried about?  I think so.  Yes.

Start time: 653.98
End time: 709.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I mean, it's I think the best way the way that I've kind of explained it because my father called me the other week kind of saying the same thing and I was like, oh no, I mean, I understand that for most healthy kind of young people, let's say if you got coronavirus right now.  You probably come out of it.  Fine.  You wouldn't need hospital assistance, hopefully.  But for any immunocompromised people or people who are more elderly, it's going to be a serious health challenge.  And it's kind of as if we are in a world where let's say the flu didn't exist and the flu for the first time was making its rounds.  Sure.  It's kind of like that, isn't it?  In a world where the flu does exist and it's a sad but reality of our lives.  If we are in a state currently where we can prevent another flu from being a regular occurrence year out year in year out and having that many people die and suffer health complications, why wouldn't we do everything to stop that?

Start time: 710.12
End time: 784.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think when you really understand the exponential nature of these kinds of pandemics, there's a lot to worry about.  The future I'm really scared that we're heading towards in the United States is one where our hospital beds just by doing math of how many hospital beds we have in the United States.  I think it's reasonable to be concerned that they are going to be filled with people with coronavirus soon.  You start looking at our nursing shortages and how people are going to get health care for that.  And you start thinking through are we going to get to a point where hospitals are turning people away based on who they think is going to get better and who is not going to get better.  You start thinking through supply change.  We went over to Walgreens today just trying to get some surface disinfectant wipe.  It's still out of stock.  Dust masks are out of stock and you think about the way these things are manufactured and I think they're very reasonable fears to have about our capacity in every sense of the work capacity for hospitals capacity to create drugs capacity for health care.  I'm I think it's really hard to overstate how serious this is.

Start time: 785.62
End time: 824.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there are also so many offshoot effects that people I feel like are not thinking about.  We're of course talking about how there are mask shortages and disinfection shortages and that affects not only people who are working in the health industry and trying to protect themselves from coronavirus.  But N95 masks are something that contractors need to be able to do their jobs.  You can't sand certain things or do certain jobs in the construction industry unless you have these masks available and are able to use them and a lot of people are out of work because they cannot obtain the supplies that they need to do their job.  And that's just one example of that actually.

Start time: 824.70
End time: 825.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.

Start time: 826.20
End time: 846.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is an incredibly strange and very Brooklyn thing to say, but I work in ceramics in my free time and a lot of ceramicists are not able to complete their pottery and sell their wares because you need to have these sort of dust masks to sand different pots and whatnot.  And so that's being put aside as well.

Start time: 847.60
End time: 873.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  I have the same problem.  What's interesting is we're so interconnected nowadays.  We're so interdependent that it's like the butterfly effect except it's much more dramatic.  Any little shift.  How about as editor of electric you probably more aware than I am.  What about we've talked a little bit about computer production in China Seth, but what about car production?  Is that going to be impacted?

Start time: 873.94
End time: 934.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, certainly.  I mean any part of the supply chain stops and you're stuck like there's you know, if the sea manufacturer stops then there's no cars coming out.  Right.  And so it's already we've already seen some slowdowns.  Car manufacturers are already warning against quarter one slowdowns and then you know the whole you know recession like theoretically coming out of this is slowing people down from making big purchases.  So it's it's going to be a big deal.  It's so you know, whatever you think about the virus itself, whether you know, it's going to affect how it's going to affect you directly indirectly because of everybody's reaction to it.  It's going to be a big deal.  And you know, we saw I think Elon Musk saying, you know that this isn't a big deal, but he's talking about well, how is this going to affect me?  You know, how is it going to affect people?

Start time: 934.94

Transcript:  Rhimes and I have a lot of popcorn in many shows to watch and we won't be leaving the house.

Start time: 941.23
End time: 949.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So it is going to be a big deal.  I think it's just it's it's how people are going to react to it and rightly so react to it.

Start time: 949.72
End time: 965.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and a big deal not just for now, but these economic consequences reverberate for months and years.  Sure.  So the disease may go away this summer, but the consequences could last we could hit a serious recession, for instance.

Start time: 966.52
End time: 978.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's that's the general thought right now.  The economy has certainly slowed already.  And in China, obviously, there's what you know, huge pockets of stoppages.

Start time: 978.24
End time: 1007.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now Foxconn on high precision says they're going back to work this month.  That's important because they're the ones making the new iPhones.  The rumor was that Apple would announce new $400 iPhones, the successor to the SE at the end of the month.  I wonder though, if really they are going back to work, you get the feeling that China is a little bit like the US where there's kind of this happy glad handing that's not justified in fact.

Start time: 1009.05
End time: 1029.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  I think it's up in the air.  Even if they are going back, there's probably some supply chain entity in the cameras or the whatever that may not have gone back.  And maybe they can get a few hundred thousand out or a couple million out, but they're not probably not going to get what they expected to be able to get out the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two developer conferences canceled.  Google I.O. canceled.  The conference will go remote.  Facebook's F8 also canceled.  This is going to be good.  In fact, I think Zoom stock did well.  This is going to be good for remote conferencing teleconferencing companies.  I would imagine DoorDash and the other food delivery companies.  In fact, I think which one was it?  I think it was DoorDash where they have now a new button on the app that says leave the food and go.

Start time: 1065.29
End time: 1129.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh my God.  I do think that's you know, I think if you're looking for a bit of a silver lining here, there are a few here.  I do think one of the long term consequences of this is I think we're going to finally get some remote work policies put in place for a lot of large companies.  And I think that's going to be good for the workforce over a long term.  I think it's going to be good for parents and you know, people sick.  I think once we get better policies in place, I do hope that people are going to be able to take sick leave more easily.  I think one of the most vulnerable populations with this is as you said, Leo, people working in the food industry.  If you're sick and you make food and you go to work, you're going to be spreading that to a lot of people.  It doesn't matter how often you wash your hands or what precautions you take.  You're going to be at immense risk.  So I'm really hoping when it comes to manufacturing drugs here in the United States.  We're going to increase our capacity when it comes to some of these policies that are common sense.  Maybe this will be the spark that kind of gets us to take this more seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  San Francisco's banned events for two weeks.  They've declared an emergency there.  Stanford has canceled classes.  Many companies are telling workers to stay home, including Twitter, Google and Microsoft.  And of course, Amazon has reported that they in fact do have a worker sick with coronavirus.  Let me see if I can find that story.  I'm not sure where that Amazon employee works.  So this is this is yeah.  But is it overreacting?  No, no, no.  There is Seattle employee quarantined with coronavirus.

Start time: 1172.02
End time: 1179.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Seattle has been the epicenter, I think, in the West Coast, certainly in the US.  But I know there are many cases in your neck of the woods, too, in New York.

Start time: 1187.90
End time: 1197.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I saw something this morning that said New York is on pace to eclipse Seattle.  Which is great.

Transcript:  Yeah, Westchester seems to be joining the elite in the coronavirus territory.

Start time: 1207.98
End time: 1228.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know, but it does seem to me that it's not an accident that these are the areas where we have cases.  And it's not because they're more likely to have visitors from Asia or from Italy or Iran, but it's because it's more likely to have tests.  You know, we were in St. Louis.  They said, well, don't worry, there's no cases in St. Louis.  There's been no testing.

Start time: 1228.90
End time: 1260.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, did you read the Fantastic Atlantic article that went through the details available from the CDC, of which there are very few?  And then it went to all the different states and how they're reporting coronavirus tests, how many tests are available, and what they're saying to the public.  And essentially the conclusion was no one is really testing enough.  A lot of states are not reporting how many tests they're even doing or how many people they are turning away.  And we have a massive public health crisis that is being kind of swept under the rug.

Start time: 1260.78
End time: 1277.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thousands, only thousands of tests have been administered and out of the, you know, who knows what the potential is in the United States.  And of course, if you aren't testing, then you don't know who it not only who has it, but how it's spreading.  Right.  Yeah.

Start time: 1278.60
End time: 1315.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you see how Seattle was testing for this?  They were unable to secure tests from the CDC.  So they went and they got some of the publicly available data and they isolated their population by saying, okay, you have every single flu like symptom and we're going to give you the flu test and you're not showing up positive for the flu.  So Seattle was actually forced to develop their own test for this because of a lack of leadership by the CDC.  And I think that's really scary that because of this lack of testing kits, a lot of states are kind of on their own looking for solutions like that.

Transcript:  The other side effect is I'm really sick of singing Happy Birthday.  So supposedly you're supposed to sing Happy Birthday twice while you wash your hands.  But Carsten has provided us with an alternative.  This is the poster from the National Institutes of Health on how to wash your hands combined with Dune's litany of fear.  I must not fear if by the way, this takes exactly the right amount of time.  Fear is the mind killer.  Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.  By that time you're doing the backs of your hands.  I will face my fear.  Now scrub your nails too.  I will permit it to pass over me.  Scrub your thumbs and through me.  And then when it has gone past, I will turn to the inner eye to see its path.  That's under the water where the fear has gone dry with a single use paper towel dry and then use the paper towel to turn off the faucet.  There will be nothing and then your hands only eye will remain.  That's credit to Reddit by the way.  I love that.  I'm putting that in my COVID-19 pages in my notebook.

Start time: 1379.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Our show today brought to you by oddly enough,  a life insurance agency.  You may want to know about this.  Wouldn't you love to be able to save on your life insurance  as much as 41%?  That's Health IQ.  You could get a million dollars worth of life insurance  from as little as $36 a month.  Health IQ uses science and data  to secure lower life insurance rates  for healthy people like you.  So if you know health, you exercise,  you ride your Peloton,  or you get a minimum of eight hours of sleep at night,  you're eating right,  then you really can get a better insurance rate.  But you can't just do it yourself.  You can't just go to the insurance company  because they're going to look at you funny.  To them, you're just a number.  What you do is you go to Health IQ.  They're your insurance concierge.  You're more than a number to them.  They give you white glove service.  They walk you through the entire process of applying.  The policy is underwritten by one of the top 30 insurance companies,  but they have rates that are exclusive to Health IQ.  You can't find them anywhere else.  And you have to qualify.  So this is how it works.  Go to healthiq.com slash twit,  healthiq.com slash twit.  Take the quiz. It's fun.  It's a scientific way to assess your health literacy,  knowledge assessment, not self-assessment.  So it's just asking you questions to see if you know.  But they put this together with the nation's leading medical,  health, and fitness experts, depending on your score.  And if you want, you can offer other qualifying factors,  things like your Fitbit data.  You can save up to 41% on your life insurance premiums compared to other providers.  Now there's no commitment.  You're going to the quiz is fun.  You'll learn even more about the opportunities to be rewarded for your commitment to living healthy.  Health IQ.com slash twit.

Health IQ.com slash twit.  And it's fun.  Apple restricting travel to Italy and Korea.  They are also rejecting all coronavirus related apps in the app store unless they come from legit health organizations.  The problem is, of course, humans being humans, they're jumping on this.  And there's people putting out apps.  And Apple does not want to put bad information out.  And I think that's probably a good thing.  I don't know if Google's doing the same thing with the Play Store.  I haven't heard that.

And I think in this, I mean, just generally in the history of the Apple's app store, there are cases where they've been like, oh, this is an app that's against our terms of service.  We're taking it down.  And I think that if somebody really wanted to, you could make an app called some random word and it could actually be full of coronavirus misinformation, but such is the way of Internet content moderation.  Right.

Transcript:  Yeah, I've heard that from Apple people for a long time.  This is this is probably an unpopular opinion, but I think for software engineering, there is a.  A lot of value in being able to sit in the same space with other people you're developing software with to like draw on a whiteboard, figure out solutions.  I I think it's one of these weird professions where it's not easy to do remote work necessarily, at least it's not for me and the people I've worked with.  So I can understand that policy.

Somebody has to work.  Yeah.  It's hard to know.  You know, I mentioned at the beginning, our studios are closed for the duration to visitors.  And that wasn't because of me.  I don't maybe I'm foolish, but I'm the guy drinking expired soylent.  So don't take it.  But I didn't bother me.  You know, I mean, I just I figure we won't shake hands, but it's not good.  But a number of my employees said, you know, I'm asthmatic or I have issues.  I don't think it's a good idea.  And if I think as an employer, you really have to take that seriously.  I don't want to risk the help of my employees.  So what I'm willing to do myself does not necessarily extend to as an employer what I would do.  And I'm wondering how this is going to impact.

But I think we're trying to buy time for health officials to do things like up the amount of mass we can produce, to up the amount of disinfectant and toilet paper we can produce.  To up the amount of tests that are available.  To get tests available.  So what we're trying to do right now is to slow down the spread of this.  And hopefully, you know, according to what my husband has told me, who works in this field, you know, if things go well, I think it's reasonable to hope we could start seeing a vaccine two years from now.  So if we can slow it down enough for us to kind of get prepared, that is a reasonable course of action.  So are we going to be living like this five years from now?  I really hope not.

Transcript:  No way whatsoever.  So I don't know if any of you saw this story, but I had to report to the FBI a  intrusion attempt to hack my campaign and the webcams for my house.  So we sent you a bunch of cameras.  Was it them?  No, it wasn't that.  It was the Nest system there.  That was the so the the weekly chain.

Start time: 4256.04
End time: 4261.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we sent you ring system, didn't we?  You did.  You did.  Did you retire those after the hacks?

Start time: 4263.39
End time: 4329.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a great product.  It's a very good product.  OK, but you switched to Nest.  You know, but the Nest system, basically I did have to report this to the FBI and they are currently coming through all of my email addresses for that.  I want to tell everyone here like everyone this show today, you're all journalists.  And I did go ahead and sign up for the Google highest security thing, which anyone can opt into with one of these.  This is a Google Titan key.  There are two of them that come along with it.  So, you know, all of us here, we've got multiple accounts.  It's kind of a pain in the butt to have an additional security stuff.  But the truth is, TFA and SMS is not the safest way to secure your email account.  So I can tell you, we went through I did this for I did a full security audit top to bottom.  We found other intrusions.  And this is a it's a very, very good system.  It's mostly painless.  It's a little bit quirky if you're all on iOS and there is a Bluetooth component to it that's inconvenient to USB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  I don't I do it also.

Start time: 4334.28
End time: 4371.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're advanced protection and you don't have to use the Titan key.  And I use this as a Yuba key.  The five CI that has both lightning on one end and type C on the other end.  And then you can see I also this is on my key chain.  I also carry an adapter for a type A.  So I use this key.  And by the way, don't get and Google gives you two.  But don't get one key in case you lose it.  You can register multiple keys.  And it's probably a good idea to register the key you keep on your key chain and as well as the key that you put in your safe deposit box.  Or I just keep it.  I shouldn't say where somewhere safe.  So do you know how you were hacked?

Start time: 4372.66
End time: 4435.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So one of the things I just want to let the FBI do their job and not comment on it publicly.  I think that's the best way to go forward there.  I think I will say I feel comfortable saying this.  Like most people, I have many, many different accounts in one of my accounts.  I did not put TFA on.  You know, we're tech people.  I'm sure all of us have like 10, 15 email accounts here.  And one of the ones in the loop was was vulnerable.  All it takes is one.  And that's exactly right.  And I'm someone I use one password.  I generate the longest string that I can.  You've got to take this extremely seriously, especially if you have devices like security cams for your house.  So I guess I just wanted to say the UB key slash Google Titan key.  It's a very, very good product.  And I think anyone that's a high risk of being targeted should consider this because there's a whole conversation to be had about the S7 backbone.  And how safe it is.  Cell phones are not safe.  Period.  That's a fact.

Start time: 4436.82
End time: 4478.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This advanced protection program is free.  Anybody who uses Google can use it.  It's a step beyond just using an authenticator or text messaging.  It uses these hardware dongles.  They do, in fact, specifically say anyone at risk of targeted attacks like journalists, activists, business leaders and political campaign teams.  And I think they created this in response to the DNC hack, as I remember.  So this is this is specific.  You know, you're the target.  But I also consider myself a target.  And I always use hardware authentication.  I just I feel like it's a great thing to do.  In fact, there's a ask the tech guy we did on authentication keys.

Start time: 4479.42
End time: 4524.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think one of the things that was really heartening for me, Leo, is, you know, I dealt with the FBI a lot during Gamergate, which also embodies the fact that I was a tech guy.  I was a tech guy at Gamergate, which also involved tech policy issues.  And the conversation I had with them in 2020 was night and day.  And I the impression I got is that they've had a lot of internal conversations because the level of education was stunning.  And the questions that were asking me were, have you been using a VPN to access?  And that's a pretty insightful question for the FBI to ask, you know, because that would throw false positives if you've been hacked.  So I was just really impressed by how much better they were today than five years ago.

Start time: 4525.00
End time: 4551.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's encouraging. By the way, Google also will let you in.  This is a newer feature of advanced protection.  Use your phone as a physical authentication key.  So my phone is one of my phones.  I won't show you which one is registered as an authentication key as well as the physical Yuba key.  And that's that makes it a little bit easier.  You can add external keys, but it's nice that you can use an Android or iOS device, even a Mac or Windows PC.

Start time: 4552.70
End time: 4560.00

Start time: 4570.10
End time: 4604.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course, remember that the lowest hanging fruit in your security chain is the one hackers will attack.  So if you are using and I see this all the time with banks, especially they'll let you use better two factor like an authenticator,  but they always fall back to SMS text messaging.  And that means you're no more secure than if you were just using text messaging.  If a hacker can say, oh, I lost my key.  Oh, don't worry. We'll text you a key that isn't good security.  Yeah. Well, I'm sorry.  SMS jacked.

Start time: 4606.00

Transcript:  They haven't said either way.  I don't know.  It was a real gut check moment for me, especially talking publicly about it, because I'm obviously running on a cybersecurity platform.  And it's frankly embarrassing that, you know, I know what the best course of action is.  I talk about it all the time.  And to have made a stupid mistake and to still have been, you know, it's embarrassing.  Don't be.  I'm just I but I thought it was the right thing to do to come forward and say, look, this happened to me.  This is something all campaigns need to take seriously.  I'm not even an elected official yet.  And I'm being targeted.  The thing to remember is there are really two kinds of attacks in the world.

Transcript:  Investigation ongoing.  I look forward to reporting on a future this week in tech that they got them.  They were taking them all in there, hauling them all in.  Actually, there is a related story because Patrick Wardle, who is a former NSA hacker, white hat hacker and now does security for Jamf, which is a big Apple company.  Apple consultant.  It also writes some of the best.  I really like his security utilities for Macintosh showed how at the RSA conference, how easy it is to repurpose nation state malware as just a little guy hacker.  He actually demonstrated that the problem is, you see, this nation state stuff and he was using NSA exploits, which were exfiltrated.  The problem with these is that once they're out, anybody can weaponize them and use them for ransomware.  We know that Eternal Blue, one of the NSA's exploits, was used for not pet you and want to cry.  And so he talked a little bit about how easy it is to use these nation state malware, then to execute second stage payloads.  And he should I should point out that this was on Macs.  So those of you saying, oh, no, well, at least I'm on a Macintosh.  I'm safe. No, no, it can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a really scary story.  I mean, this is like someone getting a tank like a weapon made by our government and using it against people or having the potential to do that.  I think it it speaks to the fact that I think as a matter of policy, we don't need to be stockpiling zero days.  We need a very specific policy to make Microsoft, Apple, different operating system people aware of this so they can start patching it.  And I think as a nation, we need to start developing a process to make sure schools, our hospitals, our financial institutions are are are are incentivized to update their software.  Because, like, this is out there and you see how easy it is from this story.  It's something where we basically we have the coronavirus playbook here.

It's that these these police authorities can't really be trusted to hold on to these things that they escape.  It's almost impossible not to have them escape.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not. I think, you know, I think it's an area of national security we need to look at very closely.  I think a ban would be very counterproductive, but we've clearly what I want to see as us emphasize the defensive aspects of it more,  because it feels like we're we're thinking more about the offensive and how we're going to target other people and get their data.  But because we've thought so little about the defensive aspects of that, you know, as people like you and I, we're paying the price.  So I just think there's a very serious discussion we need to have.

Start time: 4919.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in a way a very similar discussion in nuclear proliferation where it's exactly the same.  Yeah, we, you know, we decided, you know, we can't not have nuclear weapons.  And I think you could probably make the case that the doctrine of mutually assured destruction is what kept us from getting in a nuclear war in the 50s and 60s,  because the Soviet Union knew that to launch an attack in the United States was to in effect commit suicide.  But that does not justify the proliferation of nuclear weapons. If they exist, eventually they become more dangerous.  And so you have to balance the two. And it's very difficult. Yeah, I don't I really don't know.  That's the risk of cyber warfare is escalation could be devastating to both sides.  I mean, not in the same way a nuclear war would be, but still.

Start time: 4966.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I mean, look at Stuxnet, right? Like we had we had these nuclear reactors and someone could have gone in and, you know, bombed it or sent a special forces team in there and people would have gotten killed.  Instead, someone developed a cyber weapon. You shut that down remotely.  And I mean, I think there's a it worked.  And I I don't want to take options like that off the table.  I just think that I think that we've really got to have a process that people stick to for updating their software.  I feel very, very strongly the stockpiling zero days is a reckless thing for any security agency to be doing because yes, maybe you can use it on other countries, but you're also leaving the American people unsafe.  So I think that we need to really change our policies on that.

I don't have to do an ad, but I'll do one anyway.  Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.  This is actually an ad for something I used for many years.  I was a freelancer going up to Canada doing the TV show up there, but I hated invoicing.  Who doesn't, right?  You know when you get bills, end of the month, you got to pay them.  I hate that.  Well, it turns out making the bills is just as much of a pain.  I found FreshBooks.  My life changed.  It's easy to create invoices and put the expenses in there.  There's a great FreshBooks app.  You could take a picture of receipts.  They're automatically added to the invoice.  And here's the amazing thing.  When you do your invoices and your expenses through FreshBooks, it turns out you're doing bookkeeping without even thinking about it.

Apparently, one of the complaints I've had for a long time, and I'm not alone.  A lot of people complain about the fact that YouTube's recommendation engine just pushes you to extremism.  Well, there's been some research that indicates maybe YouTube is getting better.  A study published by the University of California last month says that a 40% reduction in the likelihood  of YouTube suggesting conspiracy theory content.  Okay, maybe they're not helping you not be a terrorist, but at least you're not thinking the world is flat when you do it.  They analyzed 8 million recommended videos over the course of a year,  hundreds of conspiracy and non-conspiracy videos so they could determine which was which,  and then they ran those programs.  It turned out that watching the videos wasn't that useful.  The transcripts, the metadata, and the comments, the top 200 comments of each video,  really helped you determine whether this video is a little nutty.  You can tell from the comments.

Transcript:  Overall, I guess this is, of course, good news, but I think something that's important to keep in mind here is that  the recommendation algorithm plays a very minor role in these sort of things,  as much as people like to attribute all of radicalization through YouTube to something like the recommendation algorithm.  A lot of research has come out in the past year that indicates that that's not really the case.  What is it then? Why is YouTube a hotbed for extremism?  I spoke to some researchers in October of last year who had worked on this really interesting study  that was going over a lot of the different research that had been done on online extremism on YouTube,  and they also did a lot of their own.  They found that it's not really the recommendation algorithm that is playing the largest role in this radicalizing rabbit hole,  but it is the communities themselves that form around extremist content  and those communities that are pushing users farther and farther into the rabbit hole  from interacting with others who believe in these kind of views,  as well as if you've ever... the researcher Becca Lewis at Stanford has had some really interesting work on this subject.  In particular, her number one piece is called Alternative Influence, which is a fantastic guide  if anybody ever wants to read academic papers about this.  But it speaks to how the reason that these communities are getting worse and worse  and people are increasingly radicalized by them is because they cross-populate.  If you're watching a video from one kind of milder YouTube star in this sphere,  he'll be a guest on somebody who's more extreme or other people will be a guest on their show,  and they kind of all connect in ways that are much more difficult to track and get a handle on  and attribute this all to than just saying it's the recommendation algorithm.

Transcript:  I think, and I just want to say anecdote is not data, right?  But my experience with this is I watch a lot of videos on gamer culture, on car repair,  on those kinds of subjects, things that are kind of contingential to, you know,  like gamer culture has a bit of an extremism problem.  I certainly in the past have been watching the YouTube algorithm  and it's recommended to me that's just not someone I want to be listening to at all.  I've certainly seen that decrease over the last few years.  And, you know, Paris, I agree with you, but I think the worry with this is you have people  that are maybe watching, say, a video from IGN or something like that  and suddenly find themselves watching one of these far-fringe right people that talk about gamer culture.  And I do think that shows up in the recommendation algorithm.

Start time: 5733.69
End time: 5782.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it definitely does. And I've seen that in my family myself.  But I think just something that is interesting to think about is that, I mean,  there want to have been no studies that specifically say or have ever been able to prove  that the recommendation algorithm is the key thing that is radicalizing people here.  And of course, it has certainly played a large role in introducing people to new content.  But there are so many different factors and forces behind the radicalization rabbit hole  that people fall into on YouTube. And it is a much bigger and more complicated and difficult to handle problem  than just the recommendation algorithm, which means that our response and any possible solutions  are going to have to attack it from 70 sides rather than one.

Transcript:  Well, one thing YouTube has done, and we knew it would do this, we just didn't understand the consequences,  is democratize speech. It used to be there were gatekeepers,  and you couldn't get a radio show or a TV show unless you got past the gatekeepers or in a New York Times article.  YouTube made it possible for anybody to make videos. And many of these people have found an audience  and have a voice that they might not have had if YouTube didn't exist.

Transcript:  And they're able to make money from it. It can even get monetized.  I mean, so that's one thing that these researchers at Penn State had found in a study that I covered in October,  which I thought was really interesting, is that what they see is one of the primary reasons why  a lot of far-right radicalization has happened due to YouTube is because there is the platform is allowed  for a massive increase in supply, specifically of these sort of alternative influencing media figures  in this specific area, because previously, like you said, media used to just be the domain of people  who had access to a fancy studio and a bunch of screens for other people to sit around them and talk to.

Transcript:  There is something interesting with YouTube that puzzles me a little bit coming from mainstream traditional media.  There is a affinity, there's a power that YouTube has that even transcends the intense power of television in general.  Television can make stars by bringing somebody's face and personality into your living room, and it has made massive stars.  But it seems to me YouTube can do that too, and maybe even more so.  And all I have to do is go to VidCon, and by the way, it's not just YouTube anymore. It's TikTok, it's Instagram.  I mean, yeah, it's the whole thing that we're talking about in regards to influencer culture.  Yeah, let me ask you though, isn't that something different than celebrity in the mid-century?

Start time: 5931.32
End time: 5955.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. I mean, and it's because the way that people generally, and we kind of think about other people's postings on social media and the way we kind of interact with it, it seems more authentic.  It seems more intimate that you are watching somebody maybe from an early day when they were just like you, just had a couple hundred followers on YouTube, a couple hundred subscribers.

Transcript:  I see it a little differently though. I think it's more about hyper segmentation.  I mean, I remember when I first started watching and listening to your network, Leo, it was about a hyper segmentation of the tech audience that corporate tech coverage was missing.  And I think YouTube has really accelerated this hyper segmentation. I love Nerf rival guns.  I have all of them and I get into battles with my husband constantly with them.  There are channels out there that focus on Nerf rival content. There are channels out there that go, hey, are you a feminist gamer that want news and coverage about classic games starring women characters?  Hey, let's bring out this cool feminist woman that's going to have... And there's a whole lot of channels about there. So I think it's about hyper segmentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. But I think that some of those subgroups do lend themselves more towards these extremist views.  And that's where I think it gets into the algorithm, because I've seen this in gamer culture, right?  I love Japanese RPGs. That is a genre that doesn't always treat women super well.  And some of the people covering that have comments and attitudes towards women.  And then suddenly I find myself being offered these fringe channel personalities over here.  And I could very easily see someone kind of falling into that rabbit hole.  So I think it's less about the celebrity and more about the hyper segmentation and the culture that kind of blooms around that.

Well, we still have that.  Hey, you know what? Here's some good news. The music industry revenues actually went up 13% last year to the highest they've been since 2006, $11 billion.  And why? Music streaming. This is the thing that the music industry was decrying a few years ago.  Oh no, Spotify is going to kill our business. No, it's been very good.  In fact, Senior Vice President of Research at the RIAA, Josh Friedlander, says the music industry today is healthier than it has been in more than a decade.  Revenue from streaming services are more than offsetting decreases in physical sales and digital downloads.  It's hard to overstate the impact streaming music has had on the music industry.

But now you pay five bucks a month or ten bucks a month and you have 60 million songs. You don't need to pirate. And guess what? Everybody wins.  What's also interesting is that somebody like Lil Nas X, who doesn't have a contract, nobody ever heard of, can put something on SoundCloud or Billie Eilish and suddenly become a huge star.  So it's not all bad. It's not all good. It's interesting. It's just it's a different world.  And I think sometimes people of my generation, I'll say it, we boomers look at this brave new world and we don't get it.  It's so strange. It's so different. It looks so threatening that what we do is we say, well, they're creating terrorists.  And really, it's much more complex than that. There's positives, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was very memory limited or very. Yeah, very. Games are very primitive as a result.  Very, very expensive to produce. There are a lot of famous cartridge shortages because of that.  So anyway, long story short, Nintendo ended up going with the N64 with the partnership with Silicon Graphics.  And then Sony had this technology with the optical drive ended up bringing a whole marketing team just as Sega was imploding.  Blake Blake Blake J. Harris did a great book about this called Console Wars.  Oh, I love that book. I love that book.  Amazing. So this is they swooped in and this particular device is the it's like a relic of this lost history because if Nintendo had gone ahead,  Sony would not be as dominant today as they are. A lot of people feel, you know, Palmer Lucky were friends on Facebook.  He was bidding like crazy on this trying to get it.  So I was rooting for him. But ended up this guy got it for three hundred and sixty.  He's going to put it in a museum. A lot of people expected this to go for like three quarters of a million dollars.

Maybe the production would not have been labeled that way.  It was found inside a box of stuff once owned by former Sony Entertainment CEO Olaf Olufsen.  The company that he was working at went bankrupt.  The stuff was auctioned off. A guy named Terry Diebold acquired it in the auction.  He's been taking it around to conventions for years. He finally decided to sell it at auction.  This prototype has never before been offered.  So it's historic, but it's not a product that ever was made.  Nintendo PlayStation, three hundred sixty thousand dollars.  That's that's pretty wild, isn't it? Yeah.  What year was that? Do we know? Ninety six, ninety five.  Yeah. No, you know, it's easy to say, you know, the revisionist history.  And I bet you there's already an Amazon pilot being made.  But with Nazis, Nazis, Nazis, certainly with Nazis, because it's no good if there's no Nazis.  Nazis are the new vampires, by the way. Did you know that?  But there's no guarantee.

There's no language where UTC is actually the abbreviation.  The official abbreviation for coordinated universal time is UTC.

Our show today brought to you by Wasabi, not the green stuff on your sushi.  No, but it is hot. It's hot cloud storage.  W.A.S.A.B.I. The perfect solution for anybody who's moving to the cloud.  If you're a managed service provider, you're going to love this because you can earn more while charging less.  Yes, Wasabi is 80% less expensive than Amazon S3.  And it's a lot cheaper than on-prem storage.  In fact, typically you can store data in Wasabi's cloud for less than just the annual cost of the maintenance fees on on-prem storage, let alone the storage itself.  Wasabi's disruptive price performance model makes buying cloud storage a natural addition.  I talked to more and more people all the time are using Wasabi for a lot of reasons.  It's not just less expensive. It's better. 11 nines of durability.  They have active integrity checking.  Every object stored in your Wasabi cloud is checked for integrity every 90 days.  And because Wasabi uses multiple tier four data centers that are highly secure and fully redundant,  if one bit goes south during that integrity check and they pull a good version of the file from another one of the data centers,  you never lose one single bit access control mechanisms like bucket policies and ACLs can be used to protect your data from employees.  And here's another nice feature that will protect your data from ransomware.  You can designate your data immutable.  It cannot be erased. It cannot be altered.  It cannot be hacked and no fumble finger employee can delete it.  HIPAA compliant FINRA compliance CJIS compliant.  I should really start with all the good stuff.  This is the best cloud storage.  And then I should mention, oh, and by the way, one fifth the cost of Amazon S3 and no fees for egress.  That saves you money.  It's the same API as Amazon's S3.  So you already know how to use it, but they don't charge for API requests.  No complex storage tiers in every way.  This is superior to any other cloud you've ever seen.  But of course, it's an uphill battle because everybody says, well, I, you know, I just use AWS.  No, you need to check out Wasabi.  Calculate the savings for yourself.  You can do it right now.  In fact, a free unlimited trial for you at wasabi.com.  Use the offer code TWIT.  Unlimited storage.  You just bang on that thing.  Free trial, one month, unlimited.  Use the offer code TWIT.  Wasabi is amazing.  And I have to say, I'm a little bit of a I'm a little biased because it was started by one of my good friends, David Friend.  And he's just done an amazing job with this.  This is such a great product.  More and more people are discovering Wasabi.  Shouldn't you?  Wasabi.com.  Use the offer code TWIT so they know you heard it here.  It's now.  Midnight.  Yeah, it's 20 23 38.  That means it's almost midnight, I think.  You know, if I do it that way, then that way I will.  I won't just look at it and go, it's it's it's it's midnight.

But the fans never turned off.  This is something that started back in the 90s.  The search for extraterrestrial intelligence SETI at home.  The idea was there are lots of people with computers.  You could put a screen saver or a background program on your computer and it'll just steal a few cycles and it'll look through the vast amounts of data collected by  radio telescopes looking for intelligence signals in there.  On Tuesday, researchers at the Berkeley SETI Research Center announced that's it.  It's over.  They're going to stop distributing SETI at home at the end of the month.  Did they find anything?  No.  So far, the researchers at Berkeley have only been able to analyze small portions of the SETI at home data because they had too much.

More powerful than the best supercomputer in the world at the time.  So do you do folding at home, Seth?

Transcript:  Where did I just saw, I think it was in the US, a New York, I guess it's a New York power plant, Upper New York State New York.  They put the bitcoin miners behind the paywall because they're generating their own electricity.  So basically there's no charge.  And they say they average 5.5 bitcoins every day.  That's about 50 grand at current prices.  Seven thousand miners powered.  It's on site behind the meter, as they say.

Transcript:  So as a New Yorker, this is upsetting to me for a couple reasons.  One, this is a peaker plant, so it's not terribly efficient.  It exists because of peak usage in the summer months when air conditioning comes on.  So it only turns on theoretically when those months happen.  Now it's running all the time.  Now it's running all the time, spewing carbon into the air.

Start time: 7599.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a horrible thing.  And Cuomo, our governor, has been talking about zero emissions.  And to have this inside his state is kind of a joke.  So I'm pretty upset about that.  And I've actually asked for Electrek, I've asked them for comment on it.  But it's the weekend, so we won't hear about it until tomorrow.

Transcript:  Seth, I think I remember reading that there's so much power consumed by Bitcoin mining,  it offsets every single solar installation we've put in globally.

Start time: 7643.97
End time: 7687.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That wouldn't surprise me.  It's quite frustrating knowing that.  Pointlessly. Pointlessly.  Well, yeah, I agree.  It would be nice if you could somehow game solar.  Instead of buying an electric using rig, you buy a solar panel and an inverter  and get money by putting energy into the grid.  That seems like maybe that's what I should be doing right now instead of...  Why not just make real value instead of just sucking value out  and then having this game that everybody's playing and valuing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had every computer in my house running that all of the time. I did.  Yeah, I do have to say there's a huge contingent.  MIT is here in Massachusetts.  We had a huge Bitcoin convention there just this weekend.  I don't know.  Not all cryptocurrency is as energy consumptive as Bitcoin itself is.  I do sometimes get frustrated with some of the stereotypes  that get thrown around with people that are into cryptocurrency  because there are so many legitimate uses of blockchain.  But this is obviously the case you're talking about, Seth.  It's indefensible.

Transcript:  Turns out the coronavirus, the way it gets into you...  Yeah, let's get back to the coronavirus. It's much more fun.  It has a little spike on the protein, right?  Which comes up to the cell, jams it into the cell and takes over the cell.  Scientists are trying to design a protein that could bind to the coronavirus's spike,  basically blunting it so that it can't interact with human cells.  No infection. Would you like to help?  This is a site, Foldit, solve puzzles for science.  This isn't folding at home.  This is an actual game that you could try.  It's a puzzle 1805B that you could try to design.  Well, at least you're having fun while you're doing it.

Transcript:  I have to say, I'm married to someone that works in this field.  The delivery mechanism of how drugs and infections, viruses, transmit,  that's a huge part of it. It's not enough to just generate a cure.  You've got to figure out how you're going to deliver it.  The basic science of this, I would guess, is solid.  But as far as getting to a human application from it,  this would be a very small piece of the puzzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I posted a photo of the neon sign in my room.  What's it say? It's an abstract thing.  It was the first neon sign I've ever done.  And it's very difficult to bend glass in a way that forms words.  So we just did abstract ones. Where is it on your?  Oh, it's a... There it is. Oh, neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we started with like large tubes,  which you have kind of like a phosphorus coating inside of in order to produce the violet color  and then kind of put it over this large wall of flame to bend it.  And then what you see me doing in the left on that photo is attaching.  It's called like a tubulator or something and a different type of cap,  which you kind of have to put the metal together or the glass together,  melt it together on those ends.  And then the people at the neon sign and glasswork studio we were at  put the mercury and different gas in using this kind of large machine they had.  And then we hooked up the electronics to it and whatnot.  And there you go. That's a photo of me.

Wait a minute. That sounds like a lot.  It's not an insignificant amount.  Don't drink it.  Don't drink the neon sign. But if it breaks, you're not going to die.

So this is the time of year.  I've been calling all of our donors to thank them.  I swear to God, I've called at least 10 people this last week.  I'm like, what are we doing that you'd like so we can do more of it?  And they're like, I saw you on Twitter.  We love your work on Twitter.  We want to see you in Congress.

Twenty two fifteen UTC, which is about two fifteen Pacific, five fifteen Eastern.  But I like twenty two fifteen UTC.  And if you would like to watch us do it live, you can go to Twitter.TV slash live.  As I mentioned, I'm sad to say we are not currently accepting requests to join us in studio.  We're trying to keep our staff safe and exposure down.  So I apologize if you're coming to Northern California and you had planned to see us.  I apologize.  I sincerely.  But as soon as this thing blows over, we'll be glad to reopen.  Meanwhile, at least we have the live stream, Twitter.TV slash live audio and video.  You can also get on demand versions of everything we do at our website, Twitter.TV.  Best thing to do, honestly, is subscribe, whatever your preferred platform is.  Subscribe Pocket Casts, Stitcher, Slacker, podcasts from Google or Apple, YouTube, whatever it is.  Subscribe. That way you'll get the show the minute it's available on a Sunday night.  Just in time for your Monday morning commute.  Thank you, everybody, for being here.  Please wash your hands.  Stay safe.  Social distancing.  That means listen to more podcasts.  We'll see you next time.  Another twit.  This is amazing.
