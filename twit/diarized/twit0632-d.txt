Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  we will get to that story in a bit, but I I  Have to say I was a little sad that the password wasn't one two, three four five  I mean seriously that would have been just the geek squeak  Yeah, yeah, but gentlemen, let's go ahead and dive straight in let's start with where I think a lot of people are starting  Whether or not they're fans of Apple Apple did make some significant announcements this week  Not just in product but also in policy and in pricing. So let's jump into what we know  We know that they release three phones. We've got the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus both are nice  Many people are saying they could just as well be the seven and the seven plus they've upped the technology a little bit  It uses Apple's new a11 the bionic  Processor with six cores two of which are low performance four of which are high performance. It's got a new 12 megabyte  Megapixel camera with optical stabilization with Apple signal processing  So they say they've upped their low-light performance a new portrait mode  Which I kind of like because it's got it's basically a filter before a filter  It can actually detect what a scene is like and choose the right settings for that and a 3000 milliamp hour battery  So it's it's gonna last long. It's going to be faster. It's got an all glass back  Let's start with that because obviously we want to get to the X but are we impressed with the 8 8 plus?  Have you pre-ordered? Are you ready to buy it? JJ? Is this gonna be your next phone? I let everybody else go first. I'm gonna last  Okay, well he's gonna sit on that for a while mark, what do you think I mean, it's a decent fine

Start time: 363.42
End time: 383.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is like comparable to any of their other, you know step step along phones that they do each year  The all glass back is a nice throwback to the four which I thought is probably one of the most attractive phones ever made  This is not impressive that you can keep the model straight. Oh, yeah. Well, that was the one that gives moto leaked  That was the

Start time: 385.88
End time: 400.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also it was strange because when they went away from the glass backing it had a couple of people scratching their heads thinking  So now it looks like every other phone again  With that glass back it was unique and yes, it had a couple of issues that had to be sorted out the antenna

Start time: 401.00
End time: 436.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah for sure, but also glass is more susceptible to breaking  So when you put glass on both sides, you've got like a Faberge egg that you're trying to carry around  So from a practical perspective, we'll see how strong this glass is  I look forward to the inevitable YouTube videos of people trying to smash it when it comes out  But it's it's a fine phone this is not the phone that the people who listen to this show are  Interested in I don't think it's not the one that I would be interested in but it's a decent phone and the addition of  Wireless charging I think they're really moving in that direction for a lot of their products

Start time: 436.12
End time: 441.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's gonna be an interesting move for are they gonna keep the seven on sale at a much lower price  What's what's the what are they gonna have to offer?

Start time: 442.48
End time: 445.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they did announce their pricing and so they are dropping everything

Start time: 446.00
End time: 454.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're keeping just the sevens the the eights and the ten actually it goes all the way you can get down to the six  You can get the six. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, which I

Start time: 456.26
End time: 486.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have to say if I had a six I would not feel a great urge to upgrade and if I had a seven-plus  I would definitely not feel the urge to upgrade it is the eight plus looks just like the seven plus  It is slightly faster  But the seven plus was already so fast and the screen was so wonderful that unless I really really really wanted wireless charging  Which I don't I don't see as a big thing  I've had wireless charging on a lot of phones and sure it's nice every once in a while  But the difference between putting on the platform and just plugging into a cable that was never

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The pricing we know is gonna be a little bit higher for the eight which is a four point seven inch screen  It's 1334 by 750 you can either get the 64 or the 256 gigabyte version for 700 or 850  And then the plus which has the 5.5 inch screen. That's a full HD 1920 by 1080  64 or 256 gigabyte for 800 or 950  So yeah, that's the lower of the phones announced. That's the lower the phones announced  So let's let's go ahead and let's jump to the X cuz oh, sorry 10. I bad my bad. Let's jump to the 10  Oh, I'm sorry.

My grandma was doing that back in 2012  Glass back. Oh, yeah, it looks sexy until you break it forget the YouTube videos  The average user always breaks that glass backing when you had the metal backing sure you had a little bend gate or whatever crap  That was but at least it took a dent and it kept on ticking now  You break the glass and you cut your thumb on the back of it because Lord knows half the people that have a regular job  Don't want to spend a $200 to send the phone back in to get fixed cuz most people don't get the Apple care cuz they buy  It to their self overriders. So that's just one more thing to break  Gorilla super duper whoopie man. This glass is gonna be it's breakable glass  Like why you made the same phone?  Then you had the nerve to skip the 7s and just call it 8 then you're gonna come out with an edge  Who is running this monkey show over there anymore? I miss Steve so much every day  It is insane like who cares about the eight nobody you could dim the lights on my picture cool story, bro  I got light room for 999 a month

Start time: 681.20
End time: 706.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So why wouldn't you wait for 10 because it's only got 64 gigs of space and again my grandmother had more space than that back  In 1942 what are you doing?  $1000 or 64 gigs when you have a phone is not upgradable in space capacity  Like that's ridiculous  Like you really just ripping people off knowing that they're gonna line up and buy this stupid phone and then the next jump is up to  256 it should have been what we you everybody on that panel knows it should have been 128 for a thousand dollars

Transcript:  Yeah, what do you do?

Start time: 726.40
End time: 788.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  11 X X I like I think the nine is gonna be one of those lost models like the Xbox 720 or Windows 9  Just just no we're just gonna pretend like that number doesn't exist  Let me ask you about this because JJ makes a very good point  From the people who have been watching technology and are kind of agnostic about their handset  The announcements that Apple put out OLED screen  Wireless charging bigger battery those have been features that have been available on other phones from Android and Microsoft  For years now literally years and yet. It's a premium on the iPhone 10 is  Is that right? Is it justifiable? I mean, it doesn't seem to be stopping pre-sales people are still jumping out there people  It still has a buzz people still want to spend their money. They're lamenting the fact is there gonna be a line  Well, you I think they'll be aligned for the eight even for the eight and the people who are buying the eight the only  Reason why they're buying the eight is because the the X the 10 won't come out till November

Start time: 789.06
End time: 796.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But also to save money. I mean some people don't  The difference is not great several hundred dollars

Start time: 797.16
End time: 808.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The top of the line eight plus is  $200 less than the top of the line ten and I mean when you're when you're already spending eight  $900 that's not a whole lot

Start time: 808.30
End time: 829.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The seven the seven sold more than the seven plus so you would assume that the regular eight to fit some most people's hands  Is going to be the unit that sells more as the eight?  Comes out too. So yes at the top end of the eight plus which isn't the max majority of users  So that that price difference is a big jump for the majority of people that usually buy the iPhone, right?

Start time: 830.39
End time: 835.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so  When was the last thing that Apple announced that excited you?

Start time: 837.48
End time: 841.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Apple watch and then I got unexcited the real quickly. Yeah

Start time: 842.64
End time: 854.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, well we can come back to the phones because I mean there are so many programs that have covered the phones  I think people understand the price breakdown and this is this is Apple. I mean people will buy it  It will still be a blockbuster product. Even if there are people looking at this going

Start time: 854.76
End time: 859.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't understand why so expensive face detection is significant if it works the way that it is and oh, yes

Start time: 860.94
End time: 866.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's let's cover that really quickly because they did come up with an excuse they did they I know what I was gonna say

Start time: 870.66
End time: 877.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You hold up a Polaroid of somebody's face and it unlocks it for you if Apple can do it where it actually maps faces

Start time: 877.36
End time: 975.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a big deal. Okay, cool. So they're mapping faces  Let me just tell you a couple scenarios. Okay now I may or may not have had a criminal past in my life  But let's I get into altercation with the police. I tape it on my phone. I try to lock my phone up  I'm in the back seat of the cop car  They hold my phone up to the back window and boom delete all the videos  I took it and beating up me and my friend and throwing us in the ditch  I know that I supposed to I know there's laws against that but we've seen that happen in the past  Secondly, I'm in here trying to creep on a conversation at my office and maybe play  I don't know words with friends and now instead of me hit my thumb on the button underneath my desk  I got to look down and up at my phone to make sure that it gives my face  in your passcode  Man, look, I'm talking about the ease ability and flexibility the button ability  You have me spending $1,200 on a phone and I ain't got no finger for reader on the back like every other phone  That's charges you like my heart I was more again when you talk about design and aesthetics now sex everything is I  Just don't understand why I can't still just have fingerprint reader and I got to use my face and there's all other kinds of reasons  And problems with the face and I don't think it's that cool  I can make I can make emojis. Yeah one face per device  I can make emojis and make poo move and stuff like that  Like my daughter is the only person I know that sends me those happy birthday balloon laser light show  Text emojis like so basically we're hoping kids pay $1,200 on a phone and use poo face emojis and unicorn emojis  Like come on man, like it's again marketing I get it  But I don't think it's a perfected technology and there's a lot of problems  I see on a horizon with that now the demo did fail

Start time: 976.74
End time: 1000.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  While they were actually showing off the facial recognition it failed but Apple did release a statement later on saying this was it was actually a feature  This was not a bug. There was this was not a demo fail what had happened  According to Apple is that many people had handled the phone and it had tried to do face detection on everyone who handled it and  It had the poor phone. It had aired out  Exactly. It aired out so many times that it locked itself, which is a security feature. You want that?

Start time: 1000.90
End time: 1021.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know what I dread, you know, so when I go in when I go into the men's room now  Don't worry  You know, I try to go under the sink I'm going like this it thinks I'm a zombie or something  I don't exist I get trying to get the paper towel. It doesn't exist  I'm afraid that if I had this phone, it would just say you're not real  No

Start time: 1023.14
End time: 1041.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey Owen, can I look at your iPhone X? No dog too many faces. Look at it. It locks up. I can't really  Phone and you can look at the camera that's actually a Samsung camera, but that's neither here nor there  Let's not talk about licensing but we can just look at the back of it. You'll get the gist  There's horns at the top, you know I'm saying like come on

Start time: 1042.00
End time: 1073.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I do want to address one point that you did bring up Owen and that is  Unlocking the phone. So if Ellie wants to unlock the phone right now, we know that  Biometric data is not actually protected so they cannot demand that you enter in your pin  I mean sure they could throw you in jail until you do but they cannot demand that you give them your password  However, your fingerprint and your face are not protected that does not it's not covered under the Fourth Amendment, right? Right? So I  Mean by that logic the phone should also not have a biometric fingerprint reader

Start time: 1073.32
End time: 1088.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you're really concerned about that if I'm dealing with somebody at least I could go like this  To protect somebody from taking my fingers when I'm getting put into a squad car and unlocking my phone when they just go like this  You're beat and they're into your phone. So yes, I get the gist of it

Start time: 1088.12
End time: 1097.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like I said, so imagine another way somebody steals your phone from you. They hold you up  You're still standing there because they've got a gun on you  They can unlock your phone and then go away

Start time: 1104.58
End time: 1107.96

Start time: 1115.50
End time: 1127.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could have just put the circle with a little  Line around it and made it flat to the back of the phone and still touch it because your button is a real button  Anyway, you could have some sleek sexy design and say hey you still want to use your finger guy use your finger dog

Start time: 1127.54
End time: 1151.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got you maybe you should instead stroke the notch  Yeah, you go  So the notch the night  Android watches that have the the flat tire right irritated the heck out of me right was bad design  It was just trying to solve a problem. It was a clue was the definition of a clue. The notch is a clue, right?  Yeah  Yeah, I'm not down with that

Start time: 1151.80
End time: 1164.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't see how that little bit of real estate at the top can be anything but a way to say no we're edge to edge  It's not useful screen, right? I mean you can't put anything that that's gonna look good  It's always gonna be that notch

Start time: 1164.68

She's had an eye  Touch or whatever since she was three. She's had her own device  She's had her own capability of text messaging and all that kind of stuff  The biggest thing is why I switched her to a phone when she was six is so I could track her  So I know where she's at. I know what she's doing. She's always got a signal  She doesn't need to be on Wi-Fi if I could have given surveillance dead  Yeah, why modern dead? Oh man, that's gonna be on and poppin  You know how many people have iPhones have kids and don't want to give their child a cell phone  But they can say hey  you can listen to kids bop on your watch with some headphones or that little speaker and if there's an emergency I could call you and  If Kalamazoo rolls up to the park with a candy van, I can at least track  You're an Apple watch that throws it out the window, but this device is great for children. It's an actual functioning device that works  There's a lot of other kids watches that they sell you and they usually charge $39 a month  There's a Mickey Mouse Club watch, but there's no  Closeness to the technology that's in this thing and some of those watches go for 200 bucks  So I think this is gonna be a big

Transcript:  Well, here's here's my thing though. We have had a decent watch that's been connected for a long time  At IFA they released the Samsung gear s3  Which had an LTE radio had great battery life multi-day battery life  And the big selling point was it's no longer tethered to the phone  It's been a popular watch but very few people are using the LTE features very few apps are utilizing the LTE features because they realize  If I'm not gonna do a text message on my on my watch, I'm gonna pull my phone out and do it that way  I'm not gonna do anything on my watch if I've got my phone because it's so much easier to enter the data  I'm wondering if that holds over to the Apple watch crowd or did Apple actually do something that's gonna that's gonna make this

Transcript:  But and it works it will that Apple has made a fortune on that  They don't have to have the biggest specs or the newest tech or the greatest design  Even though some people think it is the greatest design  They just have to sell an experience and the experience that they sell is second to none right now  So does this fit the experience is is the connected watch going to make you a better athlete a better mother a better?  parent a better whatever  And I think I think you can make a pretty good case that they've done that I mean people will but will pay a premium  Even if they won't actually use a feature because they like to think that they could use the feature mm-hmm

Apple is of the mind if speaking of experience that the Apple experience needs to be more than just buying stuff  That was the old Apple the new Apple is a town square where where we can we can have discussions about  politics and humanity and philosophy and then buy a bunch of Apple stuff is  This the experience is this the new experience the the new Apple?

I used to go wandering out when I was bored lunchtime  I'd go out I hit the bookstore and a record store. I'll tell you what that is later  I'd hit  you know I thought I hit  crazy Eddie's or I'd hit Best Buy or I'd hit the Apple Store and  years ago  There was nothing left to buy in the Apple Store, right?  Just you wanted tchotchkes you wanted a couple things to go in and buy I used to like the store  At headquarters where you get the cool t-shirt or something they don't think like that anymore  They just it's all you can get is a few things that you've been are way too expensive. So why go in I?  Don't see it being a town square

Start time: 1929.32
End time: 1985.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only incentive is what you just said food  You know if you wanted me to go sit in Apple  let's put in a salad works or some frappe rap a crap a and have me sit there and feel like I  Can talk to somebody because I don't know last month to Apple Store  There's one something broke the time before that is when something broke the time before that is when something broke and other than when  You look at somebody you think they're cute or you think that they're insanely weird-looking. You don't even pay attention other people  I'm here to do what I do and get out like no one's going in there to talk  Have you seen the comment sections on Facebook and you think you want to have a town square?  Granted Apple is usually in an affluent area  But you still think that you want to have a town square people talking to each other and becoming friends over Apple devices  Who makes I need to get a check with these people?  I need to go sit on a board and just throw out these frivolous stupid things  Because they got way too much money way too much time in their hands  Nobody's trying to sit in Apple have a conversation  You're better off give me a free cup of coffee if I come in there and sit for ten minutes other than that

Transcript:  I don't think this is gonna work. You know, JC Calhoun in our chat room has a good point  He said look for something to be a town square an actual town square  It has to be public because if it's private space if it's private property  You could get kicked off for any reason it's entirely I think JJ is gonna go in there a star complaint  And he'll get kicked out there you go, and then we know it's not a town square. Yeah, it's true story  All right one last Apple story before we move on I promise we have to move on because other things happened in the tech world

Transcript:  But I want to do one more story one more quick story because actually it's it's kind of fun and that is Apple  Thinking about a three billion dollar bid for Bain capital stake of Toshiba now  We know that Toshiba has been trying to sell off their their chip division because they had a  Disastrous year with their nuclear power division and they need to pay for it now  Apple I think this the timing is perfect for them because they are undergoing  Shortages of nan parts in fact everyone is undergoing shortages of nan parts  That's why they bumped the price of the iPad Pro by $50 because the manufacturers right now are switching over  To a 3d Nan process which is starting to constrain the supply of flash memory  Apple is looking at at flash memory as the last main component that they really don't have control over  They make their own CPU. They make their own image processor. They make their own DSPs. They have their own  Semi private facilities for for creating all the the structure needed for their devices  But the NAND is not theirs  So does this make sense the thing that bothers me about this is the  Factory capacity that are looking to buy will ultimately need to be upgraded to 3d Nan as well  So they're not just paying three billion dollars for Toshiba's  Equipment they're also paying an additional two to three billion dollars in the future to upgrade all of that to 3d capacity

Start time: 2103.36
End time: 2108.30

Start time: 2115.86
End time: 2144.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't do many deals, but and especially they don't really buy into the components industry  Usually like they they did chip they do chip design now, but they don't actually manufacture the chips  They outsource that for other companies to make them  This I think is to reduce their reliance on Samsung which has a dominant position  in this industry and they feel like  They're gonna get squeezed if they don't find an alternative

Start time: 2145.82
End time: 2184.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this has always been an Apple trade. They want to own the core technologies  That's why they didn't just license a processor  They took arm and then they made it into something of their own the same thing with their image processor the same thing with their DSP  I I think it makes sense for them to have a card  That they could show to Samsung and say you better cut us a better deal. Otherwise, we just move everything over here. However  At the moment that's an empty threat because Samsung is the leader in 3d nad right now  they have almost moved over their entire production capacity and  They could say well, you're two years behind us in being able to meet the 3d NAND demand  So you just blew three billion dollars for a for a bluff. I

Start time: 2186.48
End time: 2223.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think mark hit it on the head and maybe they're a little bit smarter than us, you know, they can't do it in design  But they do plan things well, so I think that they have a long game  That we're not seeing if they make this move and again, they have so much money. It doesn't matter  It's not really a loss or just saying oh so don't something to ground up  We have our foot in the ground and then we make the leap next year or whatever they're gonna do  But they have to have something  Stirring for them to want to do this more than just a bluff  I think but again gotta do something cuz as I said a galaxy iPhone 8 Samsung's out here doing everything and  It sucks for Apple in that respect and to be fair

Start time: 2225.00
End time: 2245.17

Transcript:  The three billion dollars it's not a fire sale price, but it's close. I mean Toshiba really needs to dump this unit  They've run into regulatory problems. They've run into problems with their partner Seagate, which didn't want them to dump the unit  And so, you know, even if Apple never uses the capacity they're gonna be able to sell it back for more than three billion dollars  So somebody else

Start time: 2246.18
End time: 2286.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah my my colleagues at Bloomberg broke some news on this  Apple would probably come in as an investor and not sort of buy the whole thing out, right?  So it'd be as part of a consortium and you know  If the Toshiba unit could conceivably continue selling to other suppliers, it wouldn't be an Apple exclusive  deal  but I mean they they Apple has shown a willingness to  fall behind in order to  reduce its reliance on a competitor you look at like the Google Maps like they  Wanted to pull it off the iPhone they didn't want to renew the deal and they put out a Maps product that was far  inferior

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We never saw the actual financials  But they probably saved themselves a lot of money by not having renegotiating that deal with Google and paying out the licensing fees for the Maps  So they're they're shrewd company and and like Owen said it could just be a long game

Start time: 2310.06
End time: 2325.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or if you wait until Google said oh, we're not gonna renew you and then you're scrambling to make your own thing  I guess they play long games for things and I just can't stand making that move without  Having some sort of purpose. I don't believe in them as far as design  But I believe in them as far as making money

Start time: 2325.98
End time: 2349.94

Transcript:  They make that money and then if you look at Apple in terms of the industry as a whole  Of course their their sales and their marketing is second to none  But also their logistics their especially long chain logistics looking far into the future  Has been the envy of everyone in Silicon Valley there. They're making moves for stuff that they're not gonna do use for ten years  Yeah, that's what Tim Cook has always been good at

Transcript:  We have to set some ground rules here because it's gonna be very easy for us to go off on a political rant  We really want to talk about the tech we want to talk about the policies that are in place with our online advertisers  This is a general note to anyone who might be listening  we do know now some of the facts behind a  recent spat of very interesting ad buys that have been having across networks  Not just at Facebook, but Facebook is in the crosshairs right now  specifically Facebook has disclosed that roughly  $100,000 worth of ads were purchased by fake accounts and sites that were run by known Russian troll  organizations a one group was known as secure borders and it ran a site a Facebook group and it bought ads  across many of the groups that were identified as  Acceptable to a nudge in voting. In fact Carson if you go to my computer  these are some of the ads ad buys that were showing up across Facebook and of course  we've seen this before you take a little bit of truth you take a meme and  Then you just kind of plaster it everywhere and you're not there doesn't even need to be truth  No, yeah, but it helps it helps a little suspicion right you take a little bit of suspicion  So these are the kinds of ads that were being plastered across all the different ad networks Facebook has identified them and now people are  starting to get past the shock phase and saying  Why didn't you do anything about this? You know you you saw this coming you you you just took the money  $100,000 is what they've identified right now, but even they have admitted Mark Warner said some was literally paid in rubles right it's gonna be more  It's gonna be way way more. So the question is here is  Does Facebook have a responsibility to stop this I mean they're not a national watchdog  They're not the ones who are trying to who need to make sure that a foreign entity is not interfering in an election  They just sell ads and they had an ad buy that they offered. Let me jump in first. No

Transcript:  No, they don't to be honest with you  I mean far be it from the American people that were not that bright that people just fall for anything  But  Somebody paid money for something and somebody put money up to do what they wanted to do now  You can get into the semantics, but then you start saying well, when does it stop?  What what is makes your ad more viable or credible than my ad and I'm paying for it and how I want to manipulate it  now some of those things are very blatant like you said, there's no truth to them, but  At what point is this company supposed to say? All right, I'm not gonna take this money  Which we don't really make money on anything anyway, but I snooping out on everybody  For an ad you take the money you put the ad up. It's not their job  I mean other than the bot part of it  but I mean they don't even need to have fake troll ads when you say it that way they could have  Whatever somebody's name is sitting in a room  Just posting these ads and people are susceptible to them because a lot of Americans are dumb and that's just the bottom line of it  Maybe if we spent more time and education then people wouldn't fall for every thing they see on the internet  But they do so I mean like I'm not even mad at Facebook like there are bigger problems that we have  Facebook manipulation on votes

Transcript:  That's just me. Let me do full disclosure here for a second as I I  Started the news integrity initiative at CUNY which has money from Craig Newmark Facebook and of the Ford Foundation and others  so full disclosure done I  I  Think there's a fundamental change in the architecture of media including advertising here  And we keep on trying to bring over our old presumptions of old gatekeeper mass media into this new world  Google and Facebook  Enabled anyone to advertise anything that was never possible for right?  Padres  Country jams right you can sell that stuff the world around now. That was never ever possible before well good  God bless it's like blogs nobody could publish before YouTube nobody could make TV shows before now everybody can so now  anybody can advertise as a result you have a problem of scale and  And so now that anybody and everybody can advertise that means that other bad guys will now  Manipulate the system right that's why Google had Matt cuts  That's why they had to worry about the spam  There is an expense that these companies are gonna have to go to I think JJ. I'll agree and disagree with you to this extent  Getting bombarded with propaganda hate lies bigotry misogyny is not a good user experience  And at some level I think that Facebook has to worry about that number one number two I agree with you though  They put up ads anybody can buy ads now. They want to buy these ads  There what I think they should be is a lot more transparent  I think that Facebook should be revealing the ads and especially the targeting criteria for these ads  Both Facebook and Google should be revealing how they are manipulated thus how people are trying to manipulate us now Facebook's argument has been  That legally they can't reveal it because of privacy what bots now have privacy  That's absurd  So they're gonna hand over the data to they were to hand it over to Mueller. They're gonna hand it over to Congress  It's gonna get out anyway  I think Facebook should get way ahead of this and say here's how the bad guys are trying to convince you  one last point  It's also been argued that before all political ads had to be public you had to know what was what on TV or radio  but that's not true because ever since the invention of direct mail and  Robo calls there's been dark advertising around politics. So there's nothing new there

Transcript:  The company's  Facebook chief among them and Google to like to position themselves as these neutral platforms  But they do police what goes on there when's the last time you've seen a porn ad on Facebook or Google?  so they if I haven't personally looked at the  foreign campaign finance law, but I don't know that Facebook is  Necessarily off the hook if they knew what they were taking money for do you think they knew that's the

Transcript:  My question to me is is with given the scale and given that there was Cambridge analytic and all that stuff out there  I think that's a key question  Could they have known and if they knew what were they obligated to do? How hard was it to know you think?

Transcript:  Personally think they probably didn't know but I think that is probably a question Mueller would be asking the company and asking for emails  And asking for documentation related to these ad buys the next is if Cambridge analytic is

Start time: 3041.88
End time: 3053.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and that's been overblown in terms of its capabilities, right right, but if  Targeting criteria were passed over from the campaign to these Ruskies. That's collusion

Start time: 3055.02
End time: 3102.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well there is another part of the story which is  $100,000 of an ad buy is actually nothing that is a drop in the bucket. However  Where the analytics goes crazy is how effective it was?  You know if you look at a standard ad and you expect 1x efficiency  These ads were something like 10,000 X efficiency that only happens if you really know how to target it  You you you had some sort of inside information. This wasn't just shot gunning out  You had someone in the country who was able to look at the demographics look at the groups that were forming on Facebook  Maybe tie that into some local grassroots groups and know this is a group you should target  These are keywords you should you should target and that's actually part of the Mueller investigation  It's not necessarily where the did the ads happen because we know they did it's under whose direction

Transcript:  And sometimes we give things a lot more credit than they deserve  You also got to think that the guy running for president was saying lock her up and crooked Hillary  So put Hillary Clinton behind a cage and regular people getting millions of clicks and views on it happened without  Collusion advertising money or anything. It was some dude named Jeb and I in a cave down Alabama  It was like oh lock her up and then he put it out there and it was a meme and it went crazy  So, I mean, yes, you have to kind of know what's going on  But the guy that was running for president was a meme machine  All he was doing was spitting out chunks of stupid information that was easily reverberated through

No, could they do better? Sure  And as you were saying earlier about the porness like that, there's certain filters they have for that kind of thing for a meme  They're not really checking those to make sure that is factual or not factual  They wouldn't do anything if that was the case because I mean people want to charge about  Advertising integrity. I don't know Apple just told me they made the greatest iPhone X name number games

Transcript:  That  Facebook could not have expected this was coming and therefore did not build in safeguards for it  But you can defend against this you can you can look for where's the money coming from and what is the type of content?  and if it's a Russian source with connections to the Kremlin and it's  Trying to place a political ad especially during election season. You should probably turn down

It's just it's just an advocacy group  During the election the high the election. They were they were they may just make memes  It's all they do is make memes and beams video beams and they were getting between 100 and 300 million impressions a week  Facebook

Transcript:  Which actually ties into another bit of the Facebook story and that is we now know that there were some  algorithmically generated  By targets and remember we're all about the purity of the algorithm algorithm doesn't have any bias  It just looks at what's popular and that's what it tries to sell against but  Because of the traffic that was running through Facebook you had topics like Jew hater or black people ruin everything

End time: 3322.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Talking about this that's the point. That's not Facebook's problem that that's not their fault  They didn't create those those ad buys over those targets. It's just an algorithm. That's looking  This is all the people are talking about hating Jews and that's the world  We're in now, right?  And you can't you can't really fix that unless you have a human or many humans sitting down and going no

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not something we want to sell again, but they have thousands of humans and they just hired thousands of moderators  So this is something that they can fix and they say that they're they're trying to fix it and Twitter  Had a policy even before any of this which failed them recently  But to block offensive terms that you so that Twitter is not profiting off of hate

I mean, it's just great to know that I wait never mind  Cool. This is true. This is true. Um, yeah, I forgot what oh, yeah. Oh we did that my bad. I'm just  Throwing in there, you know, everybody's hate in other countries, but we're out here doing the same exact thing on  Massive scales last time I checked there was a good story about  $500,000 the American government was spending on propaganda videos, but that's neither here nor there

Transcript:  Got this story wrapped up we done next one. I think so. I think can we put Facebook to bed?  I mean, yes, this is something that's going to be investigated  This is something that we we need to know how this happens so that they could put some preventative measures into place. However  I'm of the mind. I don't know what the panel thinks but I'm the mind that this this is you cannot drop this on Facebook Store  Well, let me ask a different way

Transcript:  So so Google's don't be evil which which was not a pronouncement from the mountaintop  It was it was licensed to employees to keep the company from being evil because being evil is bad business  Maybe it should have been be good and and in this time when there is huge pressure  From competitors from you know in Europe. It's from from publishers here. It's from Yelp from governments going after them  These these companies and I I like them. I'm wearing my Google t-shirt today. It's a nice one in New York  Right, I I like these companies are a books about them. I'm generally a fan of them, but they hold a huge responsibility  They hold the internet in their hands. They thus hold the future of society in their hands  We can't make them responsible for everything but the question is  Under what standards and ethics and morals do they believe they should operate?  So if your Facebook could come along and say well, it's illegal or illegal  No, you know Facebook I think could come along and say we should make all political ads public and you do it in the bright  Light of day that'd be a principle to operate it would write  But another principle the opera operate under is free speech and that any schmo can now sell their their jam and sell their viewpoints  What are the the the larger and got a perfect guy here to talk about it with what are the larger ethical?  Considerations for these companies given where they stand in our world now if you were their  ethical consultant  What would you say to them about about how they should operate? Oh, well, I would say that I

Start time: 3498.28
End time: 3580.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Think we all recognize that even though you're a private company or even a publicly traded company  Once you grow to an X amount of the market and you control a certain amount of mindshare and traffic and communications  That's going across the world. You cannot operate like every other company on the planet  That might be 100 1,000th your size. We've seen that with Google. We've seen that with Facebook  We've seen that with Apple there and Microsoft. They're held to higher standards because  Their decisions can have so much more weight than everybody else. So the the ethical consideration would be Facebook  We understand that you're operating as a business. However, because you control so much of the world's mindshare  It's now your responsibility  It's a comment upon you as a corporation which has been granted entity status by the Supreme Court of the United States  To act responsibly and acting responsibly means transparency  Yeah, it may be not being the police but at least let people know where these things are coming from  And that's even then even saying that much kind of brings up a bad taste of my mouth because it really sounds as if I'm  Asking Facebook to be a gatekeeper, which I don't want but I think we can all admit that there's something more that they're responsible for that  That that my space would never be have been responsible for right?  There's something different

Start time: 3581.64
End time: 3629.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's I think there's like been a shift in the in the larger consciousness  away from like letting Facebook and Google off the hook for this type of stuff and I think they are  Like really being held to a higher standard in like in the mainstream  I mean you see like there was a Financial Times op-ed today saying that the tech companies are too powerful  And this is like a theme you see in like a lot of the books that are business books that are coming out now  And I'm I'm curious like how that changing sentiment affects how they operate  I mean, I don't know that any trust action is gonna be taken especially from the US because it's hard to argue  Consumer harm and it's especially when so much of what they offer is free  It's hard to and there is competition for everything, but the advertising right?

What more do you want in life, man? I need marketing  I need a video of a kid in the rain doing some kind of dance. I'm never gonna do I mean  Splashing through windows and I need the right song to go with it. That's that's the only difference in these phones  These are I mean look I love my phone, but it's not like I'm sitting there drooling over the phone  They need to do something that makes me feel good about myself having a phone and as stupid as that sounds  That's why Apple sells so many phones. They make me feel  Important having this phone. I feel better than most people knowing that I got an iPhone the phone ain't better than other people's phones  But I feel better having that phone over other phones  That's something that the pixel needs to do

Transcript:  Okay, all right, let's move past hardware because we some of us are excited by the pixel but nobody  Nobody is excited by Google lawsuits  And right now we know that Google is going to appeal a record lawsuit a fine that was slapped on them on June 28  Now the EU slapped Google with a 2.7 billion dollar fine for denying quote consumers a genuine choice choice  Unquote by using their search business to steer consumers away from  Competitors and to Google's controlled shopping platforms the EU Commission  Concluded that Google was giving its own shopping services priority placement and you can see this if you if you go to actually a Carson  There's a picture in that story. It shows you what a typical Google page will look like you've got your ads  But right above it you look you get something that doesn't look like an ad  But is actually Google's partners and Google's shopping platform where they'll get a cut  The fine could have been as much as 10% of Google's annual sales or 90 billion dollars  But instead they did the 2.7 billion dollar fine. The EU has set a September 28th  Deadline for stopping the practice. So Google will no longer be able to prioritize their own ads  But Google has now filed an appeal and they were probably buoyed by a decision this past week for Intel Intel was able to  Force a re-examination of a 1.06 billion dollar euro judgment against them for similar practices for monopolistic practices now  We've had a long history of going back and forth with Google in Europe  Be it with Spanish publishers or the right to be forgotten and now with this this this idea that they are using their market dominance  to push a  Shopping platform that will get them even more sales  Let's start with the lawsuit itself on its face. Does it make sense to you?

Transcript:  Google shopping sucks. I was really  Annoyed when they changed it to like a pay-for-play model where they it used to be a good aggregator of like you're looking for  Products. Here's all the retailers that carry it. Here's the cheapest price now retailers have to pay to get into it  I mean, it's it is not it's not a good experience it violates

Start time: 4526.48
End time: 4551.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the original ad model that Google copied was paid placement and search and Google said no  No, we're above that and then they went and did that with shopping  I also can't imagine they make much money at all with shopping. I can't imagine they make two point seven billion dollars with the shopping stuff  It's a bad service. It's not there. That's what that's what gives lie to me to the EU  Argument that this is a huge antitrust the behemoth is coming in what with with with nothing

Start time: 4551.80
End time: 4585.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the clue there is a two point seven billion dollar fine  It's deliberately it's way lower than even what a normal fine would be of this magnitude because they realize the financial impact  Really wasn't there and if it if they does come to an appeal and Google actually does lay out their books and say this  Is how much we made from it  They they could make a good argument to say this is nowhere near a monopoly  We may have better placement, but people are still buying from all the ads that we place down below  But this but does that absolve them if they say our strategy didn't work does that mean that it wasn't a monopoly

Start time: 4588.39
End time: 4615.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think yeah by definition of it didn't work on a monopoly  But this is just the beginning the Android probe could potentially be much much bigger which which alleges that they  Prioritize their own services on Android phones over competitors with the result of consumer harm, which is something that they'll need to prove but  Android is  Become a significant revenue driver for Google and it's just a massive product that the world  uses

Transcript:  The EU has got a lot of issues and getting some free money would help those issues. So  That's why the the fine is only 2.7 billion because no matter what happens you can appeal  They're gonna settle out of court for 1.2 billion and go on about their day and say we're never gonna do it again  Cuz we make no money from the first place the US says cool story, bro. Let's go get private jets next week. So I mean  It's neither here nor there as far as I'm concerned. It's just  Legally's people out there trying to get a free check cuz it's it's wrong  Yes, but they're not very good at it and mark  I wasn't gonna say anything because you said exactly what I want to say their experience sucks now  So I mean shame on them for even trying because it's just a horrible experience which makes me care not

Transcript:  Alright, how about a Google story that is gonna make everyone a little uncomfortable?  And that's the fact that Google is again being sued by its employees this time for pay discrimination  Against women our three women have sued Google for discriminating against female employees  Specifically the suit hinges around so-called career tracks Kelly Ellis, Holly Pierce and Kelly  Whissuri say that they were placed into lower tier tracks than they were eligible for Ellis was put in a level 3 track  That's where beginners start and she was put on front-end development now hurt the suit claims that in her case  There was a male colleague with the exact same amount of experience who was put in level 4  Which puts him on the back end team and the back end team is a much more prestigious spot  It has it gets much more pay and it has more opportunities for advancement and it's almost exclusively male  Whissuri was hired into level tools level tool sales while a similar male cabinet candidate got level 3 which also gave him commission  Pierce had 10 years of experience going in but was listed as managerial instead of technical which limited her  opportunities for advancement since she was not a technical team all of the people that she was in charge of eventually  Passed her now  This is always very very iffy because of course we don't have any of the details really other than what it says in the lawsuit  And other than the very limited information coming out of Google  But right now the attorney for the three women James Feinberg is trying to win class action status  Which would cover all women at Google for the past four years and and of course whenever you're dealing with a class action  You're assuming that once it starts the complaints are going to come flooding in  Because that's the only way that this is going to work  is this  Something that's actually going to work will this achieve class action status  Will you see sort of a stampede of women at Google saying yeah, that's that's happening to me as well  Or is this an edge case?

Start time: 4897.22
End time: 4917.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's definitely not an edge case if if there is indeed pay discrimination and Matt and big pay discrepancies  That's a national and global problem  So I think if  If they were indeed discriminating against women then then good the women should be able to get class action status and get that corrected

Transcript:  Right now those of us in the valley who have friends who work for Google and other tech giants. I'll say  This is not the first time I've heard this  I've heard this a lot and this is actually a way to get away around  Some of the reporting information that Google has been doing to the Department of Labor  Because you can say well we placed this person in a higher-end job  That's what suited him her or him or her  And so then you say well, there's there's no pay discrimination because it's a different position  What these women are saying is wait a minute. We were placed in the wrong tracks  We were deliberately placed in the wrong tracks  They knew we were in the wrong tracks and they let us stay there because it would allow them to advance the men above us  Without it looking like it's it's blatant a sexism  Owen  So it's a big sigh

Transcript:  As much as I love California for being like better than like most of the rest of the country  That pocket that is San Francisco and is Silicon Valley is messed up  It is an run by mostly white males and the systems that are put in a place benefit  Those males first and males in general and people of color and women have tons of issues  that are bigger and smaller than money and  the bottom line is I  Don't know for sure that there was discrimination  But I like the fact that there's a class act or suit of foot so we can find out and if the pattern and the system  Seems to be laid out and then corresponding to make sure that these women could not advance and the way that they should  Google should be sued  Facebook any other large company with massive amounts of employees that might be doing something similar something different  Should also be looked at because at some point it's got to stop and in that place in particular  There is so much money being thrown around and everybody pretends like they're better than they are and they're not  Just because these companies rule the world look like they're ruling the world tries startups here and there the problem again is the core  process of these white males  not funding women  Founders like from top to bottom is an issue  So I will never side with a Google or anybody else over women or minorities  And I love white men to y'all my bros all you on the panel. I mean just in general  I got to side with everybody else first  especially a Silicon Valley because at some point it needs to get turned on this end and has to stop because  Silicon Valley has this  Error arrogance that is better than everybody that they're doing something special and when it comes down to it same systemic  problems are boring out in the valley and it's  disgusting because everyone there acts like they're better when they're not and more men to stick behind these women and  Support them so that it's not just women in their class action suit because some men are good men and no better

Transcript:  But again, it's not just the pay for the same job. That's been the right session the past  What this says is yeah, you're putting me in a different rank. So it's not the same job and you can justify the pay listen  I agree with everything Owen said and and and he said a better than I could have but there's clearly a  problem  Across this country didn't this election show us with understanding diversity  And there's a clearly a problem in Silicon Valley with diversity and Silicon Valley actually knows it  They just haven't figured out what to do about it  I think and and being forced into this position will probably in the end be a good thing because  The more diversity there is at every rank of the company the better the products and services are going to be the more they're going to  be  serving a  Larger  Markets and it's good business.

It's it's not you know a lot of companies  That don't play by the rules that aren't being fair that aren't being ethical will get ahead  They will get a leg up and so the other companies will say hey  Well, why should we follow the rules if they're not well you can be uber for a while.

There's nowhere you can go they could have had a business here.

Transcript:  Thanks, Leo  Alright, let's go ahead and take a trip over to cheese land  I've actually lived in the state Wisconsin Wisconsin three days ago in a 64 to 31 vote  Approved an incentive package to lure Foxconn into the state  Of course Foxconn is the famous manufacturer of so many of your your favorite pieces of gear from phones to networking  Units now they will be investing 10 billion dollars to build a factory and for that investment over the course of 15 years  Fox Fox Foxconn will get two point eight five billion dollars in tax incentives from the state of Wisconsin  Now the factory will build everything from TVs again to to networking devices  It will initially employ three thousand workers who are expected to make about  $54,000 a year plus benefits it could could potentially employ up to 13,000 workers in the future  Oh, the finances are a little  Interesting this is where the story kind of goes south the legislative fiscal bureau. It's a nonpartisan financial watchdog  they calculated that assuming that Foxconn hires all 13,000 not 3,000 but 13,000 workers and  Assuming that you have an additional  22,000 jobs created by suppliers wanting to come into the area that in that best-case scenario  You will start to get a return on the investment in 25 years. So that part  Doesn't sound super super great and people are jumping on that  However, I think this is actually part of a much bigger bet. This is not just a gamble on Foxconn  Wisconsin wants this to be the new Silicon Valley  in fact  It doesn't want to be the new Silicon Valley, right?  Because it's money but at the announcement when they announced this vote and that the bill was going to be signed  They specifically called out Amazon and they said we're gonna be the new destination for tech  Amazon and their 50,000 jobs would be more than welcome and we'll give them a premium place in the new Silicon Valley

We saw one in Berlin  Everyone's trying to recreate the Silicon Valley and they all have the same strategy which is will give you a lot of tax breaks  So that you come in and then you'll stay  It's not how it works  They come in then the tax breaks stop and then they leave because someone else is willing to give them a bigger tax break

I feel like if you come and add the taxpayers pay every single man woman and child in that region to get a ticket to one  Game, I don't care if it takes you 20 years to get them to one game  They should be able to take their family and go to a game because they're the ones paying for it on their backs  So to get Amazon or Foxconn or Ramacon to come here  I got to give you three billion dollars take money out of people's pockets in Wisconsin who their three thousand people already not having a job  Imaginary 13,000 people still don't have a job and you're pre taking away money from people that might never get that money back  But that's the way the system works because we have lobbyists and corrupt politicians and the way the world works and technology  So no, sir, sadly for you the dream of this working only works for the rich  Because that's the way the cookie crumbles the game is rigged and I can't stand it

I I'm gonna make a pitch right now because I live near it  I want this to go to Newark, New Jersey, and here's why  Audible is already headquartered there audible knows the city. It's next to an airport  It's next to the center of the universe otherwise known as New York, New York  It's next to a lot of things, but it could make a difference  It could make a huge difference in that city as it starts to come up  And it needs business and 50,000 jobs to make a big difference  So the part of the question is does Amazon go to just where they get the best deal or where they could make the most difference

Oh  humanity  Show title  If we wanted if we really wanted to do something that was  This is not social justice warrior  But if we wanted to do something to wake people up  We would go to a city like Los Angeles and say hey you guys buy a lot of iPhones  We're putting an iPhone factory in Los Angeles  But we don't see that it's always it's one removed. It's not in my backyard  I get this wonderful device and all the bad stuff goes to another part of the world or in this particular case another part  Of the country. I don't see that changing anytime in the near future and by all accounts Foxconn is not as if a real place to work  By the way, no, but I mean  $54,000 plus benefits that sounds that's tempting to a lot of  You know when you're hurting yes, it sounds great it does even though the chance that you're one of the three thousand that's gonna get that

Oh wow we've got  Jammer be you actually have a Bitcoin or you have what I also have one Bitcoin  So I am I was worth five thousand dollars twelve years twelve days ago, then I was worth  $2900 yesterday. Oh, and now I think I'm up to thirty seven hundred dollars today. So it's that it fluctuates a lot  We've known this it coin is pretty volatile  In fact, it's that volatility that makes it an interesting investment for a lot of people but recently  There's been a very strong downward tug on the blockchain because China has decided they're not gonna have exchanges anymore  They will just not allow it  Their thinking is that they have startups that are using  cryptocurrency specifically Bitcoin to fund their ventures and  The speculative the highly speculative nature of this means that if they have enough of those businesses  That a bad day of Bitcoin could wipe out an entire sector  And they've said no more so as of the end of September there they don't allow them all Bitcoin exchanges will shut down

Transcript:  Or or wipe out a lot of people's fortunes China has had a problem with this for a long time where there is this  the sort of cult of the IPO because there was an era in China where you buy shares in an IPO and  You suddenly have like a lot more money  And so like very uneducated people the middle class were like spending money on IPOs and then that whole market kind of  like collapse upon itself and a lot of people lost money and I goes are  Starting to look similar.

It's exact same thing  You're gonna make a lot of millionaires and billionaires and then you're gonna break a lot of millionaires and billionaires in this particular case  Though China is saying unlike the real estate crash where there was something left  There was a corpse you could pick over when you have a cryptocurrency crash. There's nothing. It's it's just gone

Transcript:  It's into the ether. Yeah, the other side of it is China  has a relatively controlled currency and Bitcoin allows people to  Exchange money in a way that's not always apparent to the government where it's going  And so Bitcoin has obviously had a lot of money laundering claims thrown at it for a while  But within China, it's also people can just use it to buy other currencies that they otherwise wouldn't be able to buy into

Start time: 6689.28
End time: 6758.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what surprised me about Bitcoin being allowed in and the exchange is being allowed in in the first place  I thought China would be one of the last places that would allow it because specifically because of that  You can't control your currency if you have this wild card currency running rampant in you know  Not not even in the back alleys in the streets in your in your vision of Wall Street  We've seen 60 million dollars of cryptocurrency wealth wiped out in the last week because of the fluctuation  We know that  China has one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges right now, but their volume has been decreasing since January because that's when China  Mandated fees it used to be it was free to exchange Bitcoin for other currencies in China  They mandated a fee to bring it on par with the rest of the world. So it's down to about 10% Oh  a lot of the Bitcoin  Aficionados are saying it's not that much the exchanges will pick up elsewhere, which I'm sure they will  But do you see this? Let's get speculative right now  Do you see this action being repeated across multiple countries as they start to look at this at China specifically and their answers?  To stopping a speculative market that could destroy their economy. Is this going to be repeated again and again and again?

So no, I don't see it going that way but  Again with all the Bitcoin stuff, you know fool me once shame on me fool me twice. I forget  Camera what he says, but yeah China China is one of the only countries that could do this. Everybody else is not gonna  Follow China's lead with this. I don't see how they could

It's what the security researchers had feared that this wasn't a zero-day hack  This wasn't someone being very ingenious in social engineering their way into the system  this was they didn't patch vulnerabilities in struts and  They left admin privileges at default  There was one web facing server that had the admin username of admin and the admin password of admin  Which you know is is absolutely fantastic.

They had no security background  Whatsoever which is not not  Super rare you see that a lot  But you at least see people who have backgrounds in which they have practical experience in security  This was one of these things where one was what an art appreciation major  And it's it's this is raising more questions than it's answering it looks as if Equifax really thought security  This is not something they had to worry about

He was already out of there  is that  All this information if it hasn't already been breached is gonna be breached, right?  So what we have to change now is not the security around the data that will be breached  Instead around what could be done with it. So transactions have to become more secure  We've got to figure out that end of it so that who cares if you have somebody's name and address and birthday and that stuff  Apart from stupid people and passwords admin admin  That'll never go away.

This is the world we live in like I said, oh the humanity  I just I laugh in my heart because you know  It's so serious  But we can't even do anything about it doesn't matter the fact that you're talking about a better  Security when you have that level of information  There's not really much security you could do because with that I can do anything  I mean anything if you're smart, so I'm just gonna sit here and hope that my credit score stays like a 640  I got good credits.

About mid week last week you started to see much more of a trend of asking. What is a credit bureau?  What is a CRC and people are actually trying to realize these companies have all this information about me  I had no idea and and they they honestly they did not connect their credit score with these companies that are maintaining vast amounts of  information on their credit activity  That's actually a good thing that can spark a good conversation of wait a minute  How do we decide who we entrust our data with? I mean to your your point taken  I think we ultimately have to move to a society where  This information can be in the open and I can still be secured  That's that's ultimately the goal  But it never hurts to have people start looking at who actually has access to their information  That could be one good thing that comes out of this now Elizabeth Warren has already submitted legislation  She's trying to get support for it right now that would essentially make Equifax  Responsible for everyone that they victimized for the rest of their lives  I have no idea how if whether or not that's gonna go through and then

The fact that somebody was has his name and was born in this state and their mother was named that that's just knowledge  What you can do with it is the issue the fact that I have prematurely gray hair  And you choose not to hire me because of it  You I can't make you not know unless I'm in men in black that you haven't seen me  You don't know how old I am  But if you don't hire old farts like me ten times in a row the use of that knowledge is wrong  We've got to change the whole  Paradigm here around this and I don't hear that discussion happening.

Transcript:  Facts act I'm just saying okay. Let's do a quick public service announcement here right now  If you don't have a fraud alert  Before the show actually ends you could go to trans you fraud that trans union comm you have to enter in some personally identify information  It's not  Equifax so it's a different it's one of the other big three CRC's credit reporting companies  It once you report it to one they report it to the others  So you just have to do it once you can do it entirely online  And the nice thing about this it will it will give you a reminder when it's about to expire  So once it expires you just renew it so it's good for 90 days now if you actually detect  Action in your credit report someone has tried to use your ID you can get a fraud alert that lasts for seven years  And again, that's free and you just do it once but there is a difference here between a credit alert a fraud alert  Which is what we're talking about right now, and what Leo is  Advocating which is a credit freeze which I've had to do which you've had to do if you've got a credit freeze  You don't need a fraud alert. Oh the difference is when you do a fraud alert  Companies can still get your credit report, but they get a bit of information saying this  Identity may be compromised here's a number you should call  Which will put you in touch with the actual person so you can verify whether or not this is them  In a credit in a credit freeze they can't even see that they see nothing until you whitelist them right

Transcript:  But you should know people should know that if you do put a credit freeze it will affect you in things other than applying for  Loans or credit cards what if you apply for a new job one of the first things they'll do is  They'll check your credit history because that will determine whether or not you're a trustworthy employee if when you go to buy a new phone  They will check your credit history  So you have to whitelist that you will find yourselves in a lot of situations where you have to take the extra step to jump  Into the app give your pin and make sure that okay.
