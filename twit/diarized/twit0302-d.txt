Also joining us from Houston at blogs.cron.com slash tech blog, Mr. D. White Silverman.  Hello Dwight.  Hello Leo, how are you? Very good. Good to have you on again.  And I want to introduce a newbie to our midst today.  Kevin Beradette is the CTO of the Johnson School of Business at Cornell University.  And a long time guy in the tech world,  when you sent me an email, you said, I have sat in the judging chambers of Comdex with Dvorak many a time.  Yeah, pull your mic up there real close. I'm sorry to say those mics have to be in your face for them to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We went to Maker Faire Detroit and they had a Utila kilt booth. I almost bought one.  My friend Patrick, as you know, is there's there's skirts, there's skirts.  Well, anyway, it's good to have you. Welcome to the show.  He sent me an email saying the top 10 reasons why I should be on Twitter.  I was so impressed. He said, come in.  So story number one, and this is the iPad kiosk story.  Man, Apple keeps pulling me in every time.  We saw the rumor earlier in the week that Apple was going to something big was going to happen.  The Apple Store employees were being told to stay overnight on Saturday night.  We knew that the 10th anniversary of the first Apple Store was this week.  So it was presumed something having to do with the 10th anniversary was going down.  They said black curtains will be going up. Lots of people will be in.  So what is it? It's Apple Store 2.0.  Basically, they've rearranged the store and they put iPads at every place and you can.  Oh, and you don't have to wait for somebody to come and help you.  You press a button like a like ringing for the butler.

Start time: 267.72
End time: 273.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't that the big news that they're bringing everyone in to let them know they were fired and being replaced by iPads?  That would have been a good story.

Start time: 275.58
End time: 280.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It reminds you of Poncho's, that restaurant where you raise the little flag to get more enchiladas.

Start time: 281.86
End time: 287.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if Steve Jobs would really enjoy that description.  Yes, now more like Poncho's.

Start time: 289.76
End time: 314.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, the thing the last time I was in the Apple Store just after the launch of the iPad 2,  all of the geniuses were running around with little claws and every time somebody would put down an iPad 2,  they'd have to wipe it off because all the finger grease.  And so I wonder how that's going to look, you know, at the middle of the day when they're going to have to run around and wipe everything off  because that gets kind of nasty looking after a while.

Start time: 314.16
End time: 330.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just think of those kids in the mall with the sticky fingers in the.  Yes.  So there's the button, talk to a specialist. Would you like a specialist to come over and answer your questions?  Yes. No, thanks.  The every device will have a little iPad kiosk right next to it with I think that's actually is a good idea from a retail point of view.

Start time: 331.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was in the San Francisco store just yesterday morning and it was so crowded.  Oh, it's amazing. With people milling around.  I happened to be up walking around being on East Coast time.  And so I got on the line and got my chip for an iPad and came back later.  And it was just a madhouse just after nine a.m.

End time: 362.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I guess it's still the old one.  Wasn't it last night? They're going to tell you.  No, it's just packed with people.

Start time: 364.00

Transcript:  Still phenomenally successful. So congratulations, Apple.

Start time: 367.86
End time: 393.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. Just you know, the ideal thing would be is you're standing next to a product and it's got that little iPad next to it and you tap it.  And you shouldn't really, I guess, even need a clerk or help.  You just say, I want this tap and one comes down from the ceiling.  Right. And then it comes down from the ceiling or from, you know, one of the the roving Apple store clerks.  Yeah. Here's your iPad. Yeah.

Start time: 393.90
End time: 410.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right. Yeah. Why should we ask a specialist?  Just give me an iPad right now.  Better yet, it's waiting at the door. Your house. It's there.  Just go home. Go home.  Actually, there, you know, there may be something to this.  This was the week of the rapture. I noticed none of you were picked up.  You're all still here.

End time: 479.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eileen said, yeah, you got to have some clothes.  So this in WAPTUR week, I think it's appropriate to mention this BBC story.  The BBC had a documentary in which they do.  I like these this this new technology is called a functional MRIs.  You can do MRIs of people while they're actually, you know, thinking about things,  doing things, and you can see how the brain is responding to stimulus and so forth.  And this fMRI is kind of amazing.  You know, you can you can tell all sorts of things about how people are thinking.  So this documentary apparently did an fMRI of Apple brains, Apple fan brains.  They ran a test on an Apple fanatic and discovered that images of the technology  company's gadgets lit up the same parts of the brain as images of the deity do for religious people.  Is this a surprise to anyone?  No, not.

Start time: 481.18
End time: 485.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, what would be more interesting is to see how the brains of Apple haters respond.

Start time: 488.88
End time: 509.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's pretty funny.  There's been a video circulating for a while of Steve Jobs in the original Apple  store, but let me see if I can find it, because when the Apple store opened ten years ago,  Apple didn't have an iPod, an iPhone.  It was just Max. It was just Max.  And, you know, it's interesting because they did feature other people's MP3 players.

Start time: 512.18
End time: 544.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a there's a woman here in Houston who's writing a book about sex and the brain.  I think it's called Dirty Minds.  And she has a she has a Facebook page called This Is Your Brain on Love.  But as part of her research, she basically gave herself an orgasm while in an MRI.  Well, well, well.  And the story is a new scientist that she wrote a story for it.  So she was able to get pictures of her orgasm of a climax.  Yes, in her brain.

Start time: 544.72
End time: 585.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And does it look like an Apple Apple gadget lover?  Exactly like an Apple.  I suspect it's somewhat similar.  Wow. That's these FMRs are very, very fun.  I mean, I, you know, I don't know how big a story this is.  It's certainly not news.  Anybody would know this.  Let me let me show a little bit of this video.  This was at Macworld.  Unfortunately, it's very low quality.  But at Macworld Expo, Steve Jobs giving a tour of the first Apple store.  What is that? Tyson's Corner, Virginia.  Is that where it was in?  That's the first one.  And we're waiting for the video to load.  You know, in 2001, it never loaded either.  All right. This is, I guess, from an Apple keynote at Macworld Expo.

Start time: 588.04
End time: 602.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, Steve Jobs.  And I'm here at Tyson's Corner Mall in Virginia, right outside of Washington, D.C.  And I'm standing in front of this wood barricade we built in front of our first  retail store that's going to open in six days.

Start time: 602.78
End time: 609.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you think, Dwight or Peter, that Apple was crazy when they said  we're going to go into retail?  I know I did. Yes.

Start time: 609.90
End time: 613.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Because of the Gateway.  Gateway was a fiasco.

Start time: 613.64
End time: 640.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say Gateway did a terrible job with their stores.  They were closing them at this time.  Yeah. I mean, when Gateway opened the stores, though, it seemed like a smart move, right?  Because it kind of helped them cut out the middleman with a lot of electronic stores.  You know, it's one of those things where it comes down to execution, right?  I mean, it's not necessarily just the idea or the concept.  It's really about how you execute on that idea.  So I think anyone who's been visited a Gateway store and then visited an Apple store  could see immediately the difference between the two experiences.

Transcript:  Here's our newest iBook.  We've got iBooks on display.  Most of the products are running self-running demos,  but you can just walk up to them and start using them for anything you like.

Start time: 669.90
End time: 681.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was that was actually a good idea.  And that's one of the things that stayed true.  In fact, this whole iPad kiosk is more of the same where you can really  you can go to an Apple store and really try that stuff.  I think that's the secret to their success.

Start time: 681.44
End time: 687.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more like a high end car dealership.  Yeah. Where you walked in and it's kind of the product is art.

Start time: 687.88
End time: 700.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's interesting to see this because the Apple stores did not change much,  at least in look and feel, like obviously the material,  what they were selling changed a lot.  You see that with somebody else's MP3 player there.

Start time: 701.80
End time: 703.52

Start time: 763.84
End time: 783.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yep.  Normal people feel like if you understand this stuff, you must be a genius.  So it makes sense to that person.  Boy, it sure is white.  It's it's supposed to look like, oh, look, a hotline with a dial.  It looks like it's it does look like he's in heaven, doesn't it?  THX 1138. Yeah.  Very sci fi.

Start time: 801.98
End time: 826.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think, you know, I think the experience that HP and Dell had,  you know, that's so low margin and so hard to do as  at the kind of margins that Apple likes to do it.  I just don't think they could they could do it.  And it just makes no sense for them to do it.  With the possible exception of the notion that it makes it easier  if it's all in one unit.  But other than that, I don't see any reason why Apple would want to do that.

Start time: 827.46
End time: 903.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they they it was a big success.  Apple store 2.0 just got 20 minutes of coverage out of Twitter.  Damn them.  I can't. All right. All right.  Here's the see me side.  The other big Apple story this week,  Apple users being badly bid, it seems, from this Mac Defender virus,  which is very similar to a virus that's been spreading in the PC world  or a number of viruses in the PC world where it warns you you've got malware.  You go, oh, my God.  It's I think it even says the Apple Security Center.  And but we have a fix downloaded.  Of course, you download it to give them a credit card and you're dead.  This is is this the the what we've been waiting for all this time,  the end of the age of innocence for for Apple.  Interesting Apple's response to this.  Apparently, Ed Bott talked to an anonymous Apple  care support rep who says we are not supposed to help  customers remove malware from their computers.  He also said that our phone lines are currently being jammed by  mostly people with Mac Defender problems.  You know, Apple says we won't we won't fix it.  It's it's your problem.

Start time: 904.68
End time: 921.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's in their terms of service.  The Apple they're very clear about service.  Yeah, the Apple care terms of service is that they don't help with malware.  And to a certain extent, you know, they have liability issues.  If they start telling people, delete this file, delete that file,  it can, you know, they can end up with more problems.

Start time: 921.82
End time: 924.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And imagine the length of that call if they start doing that. Right.

Start time: 925.22
End time: 944.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although Microsoft does it,  Microsoft has a number that you can call specifically to get help with malware.  Right. So but they're set up for that.  I mean, you know, like Microsoft has a few years of experience.  And and so they're set up to do that.  But in this case, you know, Apple is kind of I guess  is going to have to learn from scratch.

Start time: 945.72

Transcript:  Kevin, do you have a lot of Macs that you support?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're starting to across the university. There's quite a few.  We've been a kind of a PC only support area.  So you have a lot of malware experience.

Start time: 956.64
End time: 963.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you what do you do?  I mean, you've got to support students, professors and their computers.  Do you have do you protect them?

Transcript:  That's what Apple's telling their their customers is get so close or,

Start time: 972.42
End time: 996.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, for the students, we don't do too much because they own those devices.  So we send them to a local service provider.  We do provide them some guidance.  But in most cases, it's not worth your time to muck around with it.  We just make sure the data is backed up, check for identity information  and then just wipe the hard drive, wipe the boot sector and drop a new image on it.  It's much faster. And, you know, you got it.

Start time: 997.50
End time: 1029.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But said that his anonymous Apple  care representative told him that our call volume here is four to five times  higher than normal.  And the overwhelming majority of our calls are about Mac Defender  and its brethren and Tigo, who discovered Mac Defender, said the same thing.  Now, don't forget,  Apple folks, in order to do this, you have to enter your password.  Apple's always been that way.  It's kind of like Windows, UAC only.  Even if you're logged in as an administrator,  you still have to give it administrator credentials to escalate to administrator.

Start time: 1030.56
End time: 1093.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And, you know, there's this kind of this reaction from  some of the Mac diehard users,  longtime users who are saying, well, this isn't really,  you know, the macpocalypse that people have warned about  because you have to enter your enter this information.  And it's an installer.  You know, you actually have to take action to put it on your machine.  But the thing is, this is what most Windows  malware is now.  You know, the vast majority of spyware programs are these fake,  fake anti spyware programs that trick you into installing them.  And so this is exactly what Windows users are facing right now.  The old paradigm of the virus, the, you know, the idea that you install  something that has something else embedded in it, that that's kind of gone.  And now you have these this social engineering based malware  and Mac users are facing the same thing.  This is created by a software kit that's selling among hackers for about a thousand bucks.  You could just like a couple of clicks and you build yourself some Mac malware.

Start time: 1095.84
End time: 1127.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brian Krebs, the former Washington Post security guy and still a very good security guy,  said, oh, well, just Mac users just have to remember, don't install software  you didn't ask to install.  But I don't know if that's really adequate.  I mean, this is why this works.  It's social engineering.  They're tricking you into installing software.  You do want to install it.  You specifically click the button and said, yes, install it.  It's not that's not the issue.  The issue is, do you believe this warning?  And obviously people do.  So they install it.  How do you teach people, especially Mac people who've never had this to do this before, not to do this?

Start time: 1129.72

Transcript:  Well, I guess it's difficult, you know, you need to get, you know,  touch the hot stove a couple of times.  That's it. Burn them.  Well, not burn them, but you but you learn that you need to read and question.  We always tell our folks that if something funny happens or have any suspicious,  give someone a call before you click on the button.  But then people click so fast to make the screens go away.

Start time: 1153.34
End time: 1179.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I tell people Google it.  I said, you know, I say, look, and I tell Windows users this and I tell Mac users this.  I say, if you see something that says Apple Security Center,  you have a problem, buy this or download this.  Just it's one step.  Type just Google in Apple Security Center, because if it is malware,  you will see a thousand entries on Google saying, oh, no, install it.  Don't install it. It's terrible.

Start time: 1179.58
End time: 1186.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess if they're asking for your credit card number.  Yeah, the minute you get that.  That's when you close the screen out.  And if you didn't initiate it.

Start time: 1187.34
End time: 1246.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, well, one of the one of the problems with this is that there actually is a software  program that's legitimate called Mac Defender.  Well, I think it's based in Germany.  It's a German company.  It's not an antivirus, though.  It's I don't think some of the security program.  Right. Right.  The other thing is, is that at least with a lot of Windows programs,  when you get these pop ups that say, you know, you need to scan and click here to do it or no, thanks.  A lot of times the no thanks button is also a yes button.  And or the whole window pop up is a yes button.  And I don't know if that's how this particular thing is working.  There are some reports and also dug up about 200 different threads in the Apple discussion forums  in which people were saying that they that they didn't think they actually installed this,  that they just began getting these pop ups.  And of course, if you have Safari set up and automatically launch friendly files that you download,  so that may be what's happening.

So you do an image search and the website that's serving the image, not Google,  but the website where the image lived has been hacked and pops up this this warning.  But I mean, we can look, anybody who listens to this show is not going to get bit by this.  I don't think. Probably not. Right.  It's more like on the radio show or when you do your radio show, Dwight,  where those are those those are the people we got to reach out to and say, hey, just Google it.  You know, be smart.

Transcript:  There's also this there's also this large group of Mac users who are former Windows users  who came over to the Mac side because they were running away from viruses.  They got viruses all the time.  And and the reason they got malware, spyware and viruses, to a certain extent,  had to do with their behavior.  And so they get on the Mac platform and they think, oh, I don't have to worry about it.  Yeah. You know, and so the effect I have had Mac users.  Who used to be Windows users tell me they switched because they could surf porn safely.  And that's just like astounding to me.  So so you have this kind of setup where people are going,  you know, oh, they're doing the same things that they did when they were Windows users  and then they're they're vulnerable.

Start time: 1331.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, and I think, you know, just like Dwight's saying,  one of the problems is that, you know, Apple kind of leaned into that, right?  They they didn't discourage people from thinking that Macs were a lot safer than,  you know, than Windows PCs.  And by and large, they are safer.  I mean, there are obviously fewer viruses and things like that for Macs.  But they're not nothing, you know, no platform is foolproof.  And I think if people don't become more vigilant in the way that they use their computers,  you know, eventually you're going to have similar issues come up.

Transcript:  Well, it's the end of the age of innocence for the Macintosh.  There's no no doubt about that.  There was an interesting article in the unofficial Apple Weblog.  I think it was that that's where I saw it, where the guy did a little calculus,  because the question has always been, are Apple somehow safer because they're more secure  just because they're under attacked?  And he said, you know, it's pretty obvious that just like Willie Sutton went  robbed banks because that's where the money is.  Bad guys are going to go where the opportunity to make the most, you know,  effective attacks are.  And you just looked at the raw numbers of Windows users.  It was always Windows. It was not only was it easier, but it but that's  that's where you make the money.  But he says what's happened is as Windows has become more secure,  as users have become more sophisticated, he said, you know,  an estimated 80 percent of Windows users are now running antivirus software.  They're they're updating regularly.  They're no longer really that easily attacked.  That leaves only 20 percent.  Whereas virtually no Mac users.  Are protected in any way or know anything at all about security.  So that what's happened is that 20 percent of Windows users  that are vulnerable is now roughly equal to the number total number of Mac users,  which about 17 percent of the total.  So he says there's a line you cross, at which point it becomes

Transcript:  I think the reason that you might say the Apple's more  secure is because it's based on operating system that was multi user from day one.  Whereas Windows was really never designed around security.  And that was an after the fact add on an XP and NT,  which is now truly a multi user operating system.  And I think over years, Windows has become much more secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is a little bit different.  It doesn't matter how secure the underlying operating system is,  because the user lets them in the door.  And once you're on the other side of the security barrier, anything's possible.  Right. Especially when you ask them to put in their credit card and their password.

Transcript:  You know, one of the things apparently that this program is doing is  is you enter the credit card and says, no, no, that's wrong.  Try another one. And then another credit card says, no, that's wrong.  Try another one.  So the idea is to try to trick you into entering multiple, not just one,  but give them all your credit cards.  And I think I talk to people on the radio show all the time.  It's not that they're dumb.  It's just that they're not thinking.  They're they're they're trusting.  And they they do it and they give them the credit card.  I had a guy last week called the show.  He said, I'm over at a friend's house.  Her computer was hacked.  She's running Windows. I ran the Windows scan.  And then I got a message saying, you need Windows,  the Windows advanced module.  So I I download about that and download it and installed it.  So am I OK now?  And I said, the Windows what? He said the Windows.  I said, there's no Windows advanced module.  What are you talking about?  I said, did that cost seventy nine ninety five?  He said, well, as a matter of fact, it did.  And everything started working again.  I said, I felt bad because his his friend that he came over to help  is sitting right next to him.  And what I have to tell her and him right now is  your buddy just downloaded the virus and put it on his computer.  You just emasculated.  You just yeah, the poor guy.

If they find a cell phone and turn it over, they get paid more money.  If as soon as they find the cell phone, they pull the battery.  So you can't wipe it or you can't wipe it.

Before we go on, I want to talk a little bit about our friends at Ford,  the Ford Explorer and our show Mostly Photo.  I'm really glad I can give you a little plug for our Mostly Photo show.  It's every Tuesday.  We do it live 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern at live.twit.tv with Lisa Bettany.  Chris Marquardt will be our guest.  What we've been doing is we've been bringing in great photographers to show you their photos,  give you tips. It's just I just really enjoy it.  And I really am glad to have Ford as a sponsor,  the brand new 100 percent reinvented 2011 Ford Explorer.  I think one of the reasons Ford wants to be involved  because the Explorer is just like the perfect family vehicle for photographers  and people want to go on adventures and go on treks.  It is a sweet, beautiful vehicle.  We've been driving explorers at all our photo walks, of course,  has the available sync with my Ford Touch with the big eight inch screen  in the console, the two screens behind the steering wheel.  Simply the best in car entertainment, navigation, phone call system out there.  And we also want you to go to our Mostly Photo Adventures website,  Mostly Photo Adventures dot com, because every week we have a little vote on  a vote on our pictures submitted by our listeners and viewers.  And you get to vote as well as the judges get to vote.  If you go to Mostly Photo Adventures dot com and click the link that says finalists.  You can find out about how to submit your picture,  you see who the finalists are and then see the Twitter tag that allows you to vote.  This week, we've got Tress Chapin, CMR, Teigen Visual Ideas,  three amazing landscape photos, and we want you to pick your winner.  Lisa will pick her winner and each of you will get a hundred dollar  gift certificate from Amazon.  Thanks to Ford and the 2011 Ford Explorer.  This was our winner last week.  This is a really sweet picture.  Just just love it.  Just just love it.  That's a great isn't that great?  And the one the week before was, I think, a prize winner from Kenny L.  This was this was actually taken at our New York photo walk.  Lisa did a photo walk that started at the Fifth Avenue Apple Store.  These guys are at a wedding.  The photographer was on the photo walk, ran over and took this picture.  I just think it's it's a it's a classic.  It looks like a straight out of Vogue.  Just a really fun picture.  Mostly Photo Adventures dot com.  And thanks again to Ford, an invitation to visit your local Ford dealer  and try that 2011 Ford Explorer.  Best in class V6 highway fuel economy.

Transcript:  I already sent a Twitter tweet to Scott Monte at Ford  because I already said and I'm but I'm waiting  because I want to get the 2012 electric focus, right?  So I'm really excited about that.  That'll be out probably end of the year.  And so I already sent a tweet to him saying, can you, you know, can you help me out?  And he said, well, we might have some for select editorial to drive in the summer.  So I'm holding I'm crossing my fingers, but it's a nice car.  You got the gas one, but they have gas.  They have a hybrid. They have a plug in hybrid coming.  And then they have electric coming.  They've really done a nice job.  We're really glad to be associated with Ford.  I mean, not only is it prestigious,  but I just think I like what they're doing.  I think they made a good they did the pivot.  And so few companies are able to do that, you know, to go from being a 20th century,  even a 19th century industrial company into the 21st century is not easy to do.  Not at all easy to do.  Speaking of cell phones, this is not this is not a tech story.  But I but I got to mention it anyway.  A woman on a train ride from Oakland to Salem, Oregon.  Should I run the video?  You're laughing. You already know what I'm going with this.  You already know what I'm going with this.  So she gets on the train.  It gets in Amtrak has a kind of quiet car  that you can go into.  She goes into the quiet car, pulls out her cell phone.  And for the next, get this 16 hours.  Blabs loudly on the cell phone in the quiet car.

Go down here.  This this woman, they they announced in the car several times.  You're in the quiet car.  She apparently got in a verbal altercation  with the people in the car who said, shut up.  She said, you're disrespecting me.  She stayed on the phone talking loudly for 16 hours at Salem, Oregon.  They took her off the train and arrested her for disorderly conduct.  Poor woman.  Well, I got to say. Right on.  Why is it Peter, maybe, you know, why is it people talk so loudly on cell phones?

Start time: 2173.30
End time: 2208.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's because they think that it's because they're having trouble  hearing the person they're speaking to.  I think that being louder themselves will make it easier to hear the person  they're talking to.  But you know, the funny thing about about cell phone conversations is that  they actually did some studies and found that what makes them especially  irritating is is hearing just one side of a conversation  is will bother people, whereas you are just hearing both people talking together.  It's much less annoying.  And I think it's because of the discontinuity of hearing someone talk  and then it pauses. You're only hearing half of it.  You're only hearing half of it.  So if you were if you were eavesdropping on a conversation,

Start time: 2208.66
End time: 2209.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 2210.46
End time: 2216.54

Start time: 2225.58
End time: 2249.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think one of the reasons why people talk louder, I've I've heard this,  is that on a cell phone, you don't have the feedback from the  from your speaker, you know, hear yourself here.  If you're on a landline, you know, you can hear your own.  It's like having headphones, you know, when you do a radio  and you can hear yourself.  And so you're able to modulate better.  And I think you don't get that kind of feedback on a cell phone.

It's something Bell Labs did many years ago when probably for the same reason,  for the same reason, because people were shouting, what?  I can't hear you.

Start time: 2301.42
End time: 2333.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, it was less like suggesting that they do  and more sort of trying to think about why they might do it, because  you know, the rumor went around earlier this week.  And I actually did hear from some people that they're the two companies  have been at least talking about the possibility.  I don't know how advanced it is.  How much would Nokia be?  It'd be like thirty five billion dollars or something like that.  It'd be it'd be doable.  I mean, they would have paid a similar amount for Yahoo at one point.  That's right.  I don't know if that's a recommendation, but that's right.

And that's right.  Microsoft just doesn't, you know, I mean, getting Nokia to adopt  Windows Phone is a big win.  But but otherwise, I mean, they haven't gotten a lot of traction for Windows Phone  and they don't have a dog in the tablet fight really at all.

Start time: 2421.42
End time: 2461.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's possible. I don't think it's probable yet.  I think it's a huge amount of money to spend.  I think that, you know, Balmer, I don't doesn't really have  that sort of big strategic vision.  And it's also not really clear whether there would be enough value  in buying Nokia when they already, you know, have them agreeing to use the OS.  One of the scenarios that I sort of was thinking about,  I actually didn't talk about in the newsletter, but is maybe they split off  the dumb phone business from the smartphone business.  And, you know, Microsoft just buys the smartphone business  and then sells the the dumb phone business to like ZTE or some,  you know, rising Chinese manufacturer. Right.  And then it's a smaller deal.

Transcript:  Well, maybe, you know, I don't know, Microsoft's got to do something.  That's I think that that's really the bottom line of your article is  that's why these rumors are flying around.  Microsoft is just kind of dead in the water and they're talking about Windows tablets.

Start time: 2494.38
End time: 2511.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I mean, it's things are going to get ugly there.  I think, you know, Intel obviously is sort of feeling challenged by all this stuff.  And someone just posted in the chat room, Intel 2 is dead in the water.  And, you know, Intel has been kind of left behind when it comes to mobile processors.  You know, ARM is really kind of dominating right now.

Start time: 2512.86
End time: 2550.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and Intel would very much like to get mobile.  But the thing that scared them was the idea that Windows 8 might run on ARM.  Paul Adelini, talking to analysts,  said that Microsoft would have four versions of Windows on ARM.  He says, I believe Intel is still the only architecture at the chip level  whose silicon runs every major operating system out there.  The ARM guys are getting a port to Windows.  But what the ARM guys are getting is four ports to Windows.  Every operating system has to write to the chip.  And with the writing of Microsoft,  Microsoft is doing it for four versions of ARM vendors  is like Android writing a multiple versions of the ARM chip.

Start time: 2551.44
End time: 2555.58

Start time: 2557.34
End time: 2580.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess what he's saying is because there isn't one ARM processor, right?  So they'd have to write for different ARM manufacturers.  OK. And you'd have to you'd have to have this is Windows for whatever.  A cortex, Windows for.  I think this is fun.  In fact, Microsoft dismisses.

Start time: 2581.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. It make what makes it interesting is as if  let's say that Peter's idea comes to pass and you end up buying Nokia.  And then you also have this strategic deal with ARM.  That could be very interesting for both the Windows Phone 7  and the Windows 8 operating system.

Start time: 2621.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a 680 megahertz ARM 11.  So it's kind of a low and slow.  It's not a very fast processor.  But it is an arm. But it is an arm.  That's why I'm amelad capacitive touch, which is part of the problem.  You can really feel that.  It has a great camera.  I mean, it's like it's really what it is, is a great.  It's a point and shoot camera that happened to have a phone in it.  But the operating system is just it's 12 megapixel camera in here.

Transcript:  The thing about Windows Phone 7 is it really is a nice operating system.  It's very fun and cool to use and it's very satisfying to use.  It's still somewhat incomplete, and hopefully that'll get fixed  faster than Microsoft is fixing it.  But it kind of deserves a chance, I think.  That's very, very free.  You like it, too.  You know, I like it. It's it's it's actually,

Start time: 2674.28

Transcript:  you know, Microsoft went back to the drawing board and they actually,  you know, created something really nice.  It's a very intuitive user interface.  And it feels kind of fresh in a lot of ways that even iOS doesn't feel fresh anymore.  And, you know, I think the problem is they just were a little late to the game  and, you know, haven't been able to get the kind of, you know,  support behind it that that just some of that just takes time.  And I think they've also done a kind of a little bit of a little bit of a  kind of a mediocre job of marketing it, just like they did a mediocre job  of marketing soon.

Transcript:  Tuesday, Microsoft's got a big event in New York.  They're going to apparently show nine new Windows phones.  They'll finally get the Windows phone  on Verizon and is a sprint that they're missing.  Yeah, Verizon and Sprint.  And also, they supposedly be talking about their mango update.  You know anything about this, Peter?

Start time: 2780.60
End time: 2833.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's going to have a bunch of cut and paste.  Yes, I feel like, yeah, stuff like that, like coming to it.  You know, I think, you know, to me, the the the bigger issue is less  what is going to be in the updates and how are they going to start  rolling them out successfully?  Because one of the whole ideas behind Windows phone  is that Microsoft would have more control.  And so you wouldn't have the Android issue where phones are coming.  I mean, Android 2.3 has been out for, you know, six months now or something like that.  And like people are still putting out phones on 2.2.  And and then phones are not getting upgraded.  And I think one of the things that Microsoft sort of promise  with Windows phone is we'll have more control.  It'll be tighter distribution.  And so we'll be able to roll out updates more quickly.  And that hasn't really happened as much as it's supposed to.  So that was that's the thing that I'm more curious about is  when they announce this, what's the plan to get actually getting the update out  to as many phones as possible?

Start time: 2833.76
End time: 2876.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's a double edged sword.  If you know, I think Microsoft was smart in in in saying  these are the hardware standards.  So most Windows phones are very, very similar,  but they all reach a certain level of functionality.  I think the amount of memory is about the only difference.  And of course, form factor.  So they they but that's a double edged sword, as you said, Peter,  if they don't if they don't take advantage of it.  The disadvantage is there's no excitement when we've got new nine  new Windows phones coming out in Tuesday.  But so what?  It's it's going to be very much like the existing Windows phone.  There's no excitement, whereas every time an Android phone comes out,  there's a lot of buzz about, well, this one's going to have, you know,  dual processors or a bigger screen or higher res screen or whatever.  They're not going to they're going to have to start.

Start time: 2877.08
End time: 2890.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they have they did promise way back when they announced  Windows phone that they would eventually offer more flexibility  to manufacturers in terms of what they can do, what they can,  you know, the processors and screen resolutions and that sort of thing.  But right now, they're very similar.

Start time: 2890.64
End time: 2891.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that is intentional.

Start time: 2892.38

That's it. Forget it. Nobody's going to buy it.  Did you see Rovio announced that?  What was it?  Two hundred million copies of Angry Birds have been have been downloaded.  That's amazing.  Several hundred million minutes a day.  And the CEO said, well, those are minutes.  You probably would have been doing anything with anyway.  Yeah, right.  That's time you would have wasted doing something else.  Two, two hundred.  I can't that's mind boggling that that many  copies of anything have been downloaded.  That's that's like Windows numbers.

And it isn't, you know, I tend to use the phone the same way each day.  So I'm trying to figure out what the issue is.  But it's so light, given the size.  It looks really thin when Dwight was holding it up.

But the Infuse, I mean, it fits in your pocket really well.  Typing on it is really nice because the screen is so big.  I put it next to somebody's iPhone the other day and the iPhone honestly looks like a kid's toy.  It's dinky.  Next.  Like I think Apple is going to have to come out with a bigger screen.  I think this is pushing them that way, isn't it?

These aren't.  I'm a tech journalist.  I cover computers.  But the thing is, everybody, a cell phone was something always that you could talk about.  In fact, it was one of those things.  It was, you know, normally you walk around in the real world, people don't talk about  tech.  Only geeks like us talk about tech.  But when you go like into a radio station sales department, the one thing that we could  talk about besides basketball games was your cell phone.  What do you got?  Well, I'll tell you, I get this.  And this was even before smartphones.  Now that these things are actually computers, I'm much happier covering them.  There's something to talk about.  And it has exploded.  I mean, who cares about computers anymore?

And, you know, you look at like a lot of the phones coming out now, like the Atrix 4G and  this HTC sensation have the QHD, which is kind of the numbers on those.  It's similar.  It's like I wish I could.  I should know this by heart.  I should too.  You, me both.  The QHD someone chats can say 960 by 540.  Thank you to everyone in chat.  This QHD.  And that's almost the same as the the iPhone.  And so like the HTC sensation and the Atrix 4G have that higher resolution display and  it looks really nice.  The infuse has that 4.5 inch screen, but it's 800 by 480.  And so the fonts just don't look as good.

Don't get too attached.  No, I know, I know.  The G2X though, I really love it.  But as with all these smart Android phones, battery life's an issue.  Although one thing I know is it's interesting.  This display is never anywhere near the, it's very, very, I think it's an IPS LCD display  and it is very low power.  And I think that that's interesting.  It's always, you know, 5% of the total battery usage compared to any of these Samsung phones  where it's almost always 50% is this screen.  It really uses up a lot of screen.  So it's a nice screen, but battery life is terrible.  So what I bought was an external charger and a second battery.  And now I carry, I carry my pocket.  Battery number two.

If you're going to have capped data plans, if you're going to give me five gigs a month and not unlimited,  then I should be able to use that five gigs across as many devices as I want, whether it's a tablet, phone, whatever.  I should be able to, I should have the option to allocate those five gigs across as many devices as I own.

I think it's one of those things where they've just never really, you know, delivered quite yet,  but it still feels really promising.  You know, WebOS seems like a really good user interface for a tablet device.  So I think a lot of people are looking forward to that.  You know, HP, you know, just for the same reason that Microsoft might be looking at Nokia,  I mean, HP bought Palm for the same reason, which was if mobile is the future of computing,  then you need to have a dog in the fight and you need to have more control of your own destiny.  And I think that HP saw the success of the iPad and didn't see anything in Microsoft's pipeline  that they could use as an operating system and said, well, you know what?  Screw this.

Get a little heated. Typically, you know, you'd divvy up into teams and each teams would get one of the areas that they're awarded to speak for.  And so your team picked their winner and then each team then presented to the group as a whole and advocated for like a best in best in show.  Right. So it was a lot of fun. Very often, Peter Coffey, you know, Peter Coffey, Peter Coffey would run the judging.  And so he would bring in the hair voting system for proportional voting.  What's that? The more hair you have, the bigger your vote.  No, it's where you rank. It's ranked voting where you rank one through ten.  So you really only need kind of one ballot to rank your winners.  So if your primary one doesn't rank, your vote still counts because you may pick a second one that ends up at the top.  So, yeah, it was a lot of fun seeing some of the small companies that started up and their various strategies.  Guys would come in and say, we got a neat product.  We figure we've got two years before the majors see what we're doing and, you know, what I run us out of the business because the cost.  So we're going to do what we're going to do.  We're going to make as much money as we can.  And when the it gets to the mass market, we're going to fold our tent and go on to our next idea.  So they weren't looking to build an empire.

Transcript:  We're going to talk more. I've got some big news about, you know, it's turning into this week in cell phones, more cell phone news than Android news and more.  But it is after all, that's where everything's happening.  Before we get to that, though, I would like to thank our friends at Carbonite for sponsoring Twit.  Carbonite is that great backup solution backing up to the cloud.  And, you know, any backup solutions going to have a few, in my opinion, a few features.  Absolutely critical. First of all, it's got to be automatic or you, you know, you just won't do it.  If it doesn't happen automatically, you're not going to remember. Carbonite is always backing up.  I really like that. So you're you know, once you do that initial backup of all your data.  And by the way, it is every bit of data on your personal, you know, your personal data on the internal drive at the same price.  No tears or anything. You don't have to worry. Oh, I might be backing up too much.  Fifty nine dollars a year, less than five bucks a month for everything on your internal drive.  And then once it's backed up, it's just kind of constantly kept backed up every time you're online.  I love that they allow encryption. Of course, it's encrypted 128 bit SSL.  So you don't have to worry about being in an open access spot or anything like that.  But they allow additional encryption using strong encryption.  Only you hold the key. So your data is private.  And here's the beauty part of it. Your data is always accessible.  It's cloud storage as well as backup. So wherever you are, you don't have to wait for a disaster.  You can log into your carbonate account on any PC or Mac, any iPhone, Android phone, Blackberry, Blueberry, Yellowberry.  And there's your data available to you so you can access it, edit it, download it.  If the worst should happen, you lose a hard drive, you lose your computer, your data is still good.  And you just get that new computer, log into your carbonate account, say restore, and it's all there.  It's really kind of miraculous. And it is the most affordable, most effective solution out there.  Mac or PC, just $59 a year. Somebody did the math. That's 16 cents a day for peace of mind, for sleeping well.  You try it for free for the next two weeks. Go to carbonate.com, use the offer code TWIT.  And if you decide to keep it, you can sign up for the 12-month subscription and get 14 months when you use the offer code TWIT.  Carbonite, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com. You got to back it up to get it back. So do it right with Acarbonite.

You'll end up being tiered because of it, and people who do more video are going to end up paying more.  And that'll help pay for the infrastructure.  I think that's ultimately where things are going.  All of the ISPs have said that they're looking at that heavily, and usually when they say they're looking at a way to make more money, they're not kidding.

I think the studios are recognizing that if they don't want to have one dominant player, have so much control over the market, because then they're going to start to have...

The reason why Netflix works is because you pay eight bucks a month or whatever it is for monthly streaming, and you have that service.  It's one application that you can use across lots and lots of different devices.  You don't want to be a situation where I have to go and use each filmmaker's or studio's app to be able to watch the movie I want to watch.  You want a single point.

Transcript:  Interesting. Really good article that I recommend from IT World.  Kevin Fogarty writing in here talking about whether Netflix is swapping the internet.  ISPs of course state that they are highly congested because of all these people watching things like Netflix.  That's why AT&T has 150 gigabyte a month cap on its DSL 250 on its universe.  It's why Comcast has a 250 gigabyte a month cap.  It turns out, according to this, because of the way Netflix does it, Netflix content is cashed, distributed and cashed ahead of time.  So in fact, it doesn't hit the ISPs anywhere near that much.  It turns out Netflix, according to Sandvine, same people who did this original report, Netflix users take up an average of 40 gigabytes a month from streaming media.  Twice that amount of bandwidth used for streaming data to an Xbox or a game console.  So the problem is that if you are watching, I don't know why it's more on an Xbox, maybe it's higher quality.  If you're watching on an Xbox, you could be using 80 gigabytes a month for your movies out of the 150 gigabyte cap.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, the ISPs have incentive here, right?  Because they want to be able to say we're getting slammed.  Our users are using so much bandwidth.  We have to charge more. We have to offer tiers.  We have to start instituting caps and things like that.  You know, when there is an argument that, yeah, you guys just need to be managing your networks better.

Start time: 4820.84
End time: 4882.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It eats up the bandwidth quickly, but your ISP will be there to make sure you don't go over.  You pay $10 for every 50 gigabytes you go over the limit every month.  That's the cost of allowing the FCC to avoid limiting the price gouging plans ISPs impose on consumers and small businesses rather than seeing through the smoke and realizing it's not compensating for Netflix that is taking up most of the carrier's R&D and network upgrade work.  Basically, it seems something I've said a long time, which it doesn't cost the ISPs that much.  They're using it as an excuse.  It's a little complicated.  I'm not an IT guy.  If you're an IT guy, read the article and you can tell me what it means because I don't understand it.  It sounds like he's saying conflicting things here.  Let's see here.  The playbook.  Anybody excited about that at all?  Blackberry Playbook sales missed targets by over 90%.

But even though there isn't a lot of overt enthusiasm, I see a lot of people on our site on Gadget who are enthusiastic about it.  And there are definitely people who are really, really passionate about Blackberry who are waiting to buy a playbook.  I'm not sure how you know, I'm not sure it's a huge number, but it definitely has a core group of people that are passionate about it.

It looked like it froze the original program.  And I was saying, well, that's kind of not real multitasking.  It's pseudo multitasking.  Somebody sent me an email saying that's a setting in the settings.  If you are willing to kill your battery, you can have true multitasking where this will continue when the next program runs.  But it's off by default because, of course, why would you want that?  So I don't know.  I mean, yes, OK, it can do it.  But why would you want that?

Transcript:  You know, I mean, we could talk about some of the problems with rim for another hour.  But I think one of the biggest issues I have with the playbook is that first of all, it shouldn't be called the playbook.  I think that it's a business book, supposedly the workbook or something like that.  I mean, you keep saying this is the first enterprise class tablet.  Yeah, but OK, fine. Don't call it the playbook.  I mean, I think there's actually something, you know, I think there's actually an opportunity to, you know, kind of market an enterprise class, you know, super secure tablet.  But I think that rim just is trying to have it both ways.  And I think that it's, you know, kind of mudding the waters.  It's kind of confusing people.

And the idea that, you know, that he OK, you can do your plans on this.  You can build your playbook.  And so I think that that they're they're trying to imply that you can use it both for entertainment and for and for work.  Yeah, it's another one of those frustrating things.

It's frustrating on all of these tablets, even the the honeycomb tablets, even after the three point one update on the zoom.  They all feel unfinished to me.  They all feel like there's something not there that I wish was there.  And compared to the iPad, compared to the iPad, which is, you know, Apple hit it out of the park, you know, with the first version.  And these guys are still struggling trying to figure out who they want to be.  And they're not they're not doing it for me yet.  But all of them have potential.  I'm really interested in the WebOS tablet.  I think, you know, if HP does it right and can market it half decently, which is a question with HP, I think it has a lot of potential.  But it could just be another tablet with potential.

In fact, there's a quiet I didn't know this is a quad core Tegra called Kallel.  So that's kind of interesting.  Yeah, you know, I love this tablet.  I just software is not really very mature.  It's little things like this.  And somebody told me it doesn't happen on theirs.  But watch when I rotate, maybe it's because they have all these widgets.  It takes forever.  That has to rebuild the screen.  That's a little that's too slow.  Yeah, yeah.

It's the it's the federal government that prevents or restricts the kinds of information sites can gather about kids under 13.  So Facebook, in order to do this, would have to have some sort of special dispensation from parents or that kind of thing.  But you got to figure there's so many sub 13 year olds using Facebook.

Now, you know, you could provide parental controls and, you know, give people the ability to kind of have control of what the kids do.  But you can't control what other people do.  And that's kind of the problem. It's by definition social.  And you have to you have to worry about what other people are doing on it, not just what your kids are doing.

And they they thought that the IPO would go at about forty five dollars.  That was what they priced the shares at.  By the end of the day, they were twice that.  And a very interesting opinion piece in The New York Times by Jonah Sarah, in which he says the bankers scammed LinkedIn.  And it happens all the time. And I'm very curious what you guys think about this.  We'll talk about it in just a second before we do, though, like to say hello to our friends at Citrix, makers of the great go to assist.  If you're in the support business, I know a lot of you is a lot of you has got to get get on the phone there and tell if it's not family and friends, colleagues, clients or maybe you're actually an IT or software support person.

Maybe they're down the hall across town or even across the world with go to assist Express.  You log in to their computer and fix it yourself. Now, I know there are many choices to do this, but this is the one that you want to take a look at.  You could try it free for 30 days. I'll tell you how in a second for a couple of reasons.  First of all, it's Citrix. So, you know, it's 128 bit SSL 24 7 support for you and and the fastest back end.  I mean, they really know remote access.

They always have to download the go to assist software and that's to keep it always fresh, always up to date.  They 30 seconds later, though, they're ready to go and you're fixing their system. There's chat.  You can do eight sessions at once. You can do unattended sessions if your clients allow you.  That's nice. You don't have to wait till they're there. You can find out what operating system they're running, what software is running in the background.  There's so many nice features for anybody who's doing support remotely. I want you to try it free for 30 days.  They have day passes, too, for those those of us like you who have to fix mom's computer from time to time.  Visit go to I use this with my mom. It's great.

And and I think it's a it's a big deal. But I just I don't think necessarily that it's not Facebook.  And I think that that's what people are waiting for. You know, it's talking about stock picking.  I bought Apple when an IPO. This is back before I covered tech.  And a few years later, I thought it was such a stinky stock. I sold it.  And you were right. A few years later, it was just after it came out.  But I wish I had held on to it. But that's the part. That's exactly the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you look at information, if you look at professionally managed funds, they don't do that.  Well, they often don't do as well as the market as a whole.  So here's some numbers. This is from Joan Ossera's column.  First of all, 16 million in profit last year. 16 million in profit.  So it's not a hugely profitable company.  They hired Morgan Stanley and the Bank of America's Merrill Lynch Division to manage the IPO.  That's what you do. You hire the bankers. They're the underwriters. They have to do that.  They decide, they gauge the market and decide on the price.  They decided that the LinkedIn IPO initial shares would be valued at $45.  At that point, they get a chunk of it to sell to their inside, in-house investors.  They're big fish.  However, you, unless you're one of those big fish, you aren't going to get it for $45  because when the stock market opened, it was already at $84 or $83 a share.  So LinkedIn only gets the $45 a share.  They sold 7.84 million shares, raised $352 million for the company.  So the company's happy. Bankers get 7% of the deal as their fee.  The opening price, not $45, $83.  By the time the clock struck noon, the stock was $120 a share,  then settled down to $94.25 at the market close.  That's 110% gain on the first day.  But here's Joe's point.  He said, suppose your trusted real estate agent persuaded you to sell your house for $1 million,  which is basically what these bankers did.  They said $45.  The next day, they turn around and sold the same house to a new owner for $2 million.  Basically, this is what Henry Blodgett says Marilyn Morgan did to LinkedIn.  They convinced LinkedIn to sell all their stock at $45,  and they were getting $84 when the market opened and $94 by the time the market closed.  He says it's bad behavior.  LinkedIn, of course, gets enough money that they probably don't complain,  but I have to say that is kind of slimy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm surprised that LinkedIn didn't do something similar by the same token.  I mean, I don't think they necessarily expected it, or even the bankers expected it to pop as much as it did.  And they did raise the, I do believe they raised the price.  They did.  I mean, it was lower.

Start time: 5889.80
End time: 5904.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if they had priced it at $83, would it have hit at $120 to start?  Is it guaranteed to pop higher than what you do just because there hasn't been a tech IPO like this in a long time?

The like button, as long as we're talking creepy.  Now, this is Wall Street Journal, and I know Wall Street Journal has kind of got a hair trigger on privacy.  But they say that the like button and Twitter's tweet button allows sites to basically follow you around the web.  Facebook's buttons appear, and I'm curious about this because I just put a like button on my blog.  Facebook's buttons appear on about a third of the world's thousand most-fitted websites.  I'm sure Gadget uses a like button, right?

Start time: 5958.71
End time: 5980.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll be bringing back in the Facebook stuff.  You'd be crazy not to. It drives a ton of traffic.  Is this surprising anyone that if a website, anytime a website has any sort of JavaScript embedded on another site, they're basically tracking you?  Because they can see what's being called.  And with Facebook, since they have your identity.

Start time: 5980.82
End time: 6006.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Facebook is tracking you because they basically have an asset on all those pages.  So if you've logged into Facebook anytime in the last month, and you continue to browse, even if you don't press the like button,  Facebook knows what pages you visited because it's getting its little servlet saying, oh, Leo just visited GDGT.  And so Facebook is essentially tracking you with a like button as long as you remain logged in.  If you log out of Facebook, you're OK.

Start time: 6007.50
End time: 6020.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And logging out is your solution, I think.  That's your relief is you if you don't want them tracking you, then when you're done with your session at Facebook, log out, which a lot of people don't do.  Nobody does.  Right. Because it's convenient.  You do that, Kevin?

Your social graph, all sorts of information about you.  Now they know that. And every time you visit a page with a like button, they know you visited that page.
