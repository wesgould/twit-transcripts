We dragged Alex Lindsay in and he's going to explain in a bit what he's going to do that's a little different for this week's Twit.  Alex, usually the co-host on MacBreak Weekly and of course the man about town with the Pixelcore.  On air via Skype from New York City, Dan Patterson. I think you're in New York, right Dan?  Yep, New York City.  Dan Patterson, he's a broadcast digital journalist.  He just got back from teaching Sudanese media makers how to use Android phones to change the world.  He was in Cairo for the month of March with the group Small World News.  I think that's really exciting. We were talking before the show about that.  We'll talk some more about it. But it's great to have you, Dan. Welcome.  Wonderful to be here.  And I want to welcome into studio with us, Jill Duffy.  Jill Duffy, Jill writes for PC Magazine, has been around a little bit for TNT.  We persuaded her to spend her Easter Sunday with us. Thank you, Jill.

Transcript:  Thank you for having me once again.

Start time: 188.04
End time: 191.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's wonderful to have you. Not your first time on Twit.

Start time: 192.32
End time: 194.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but first time live in studio.

Start time: 195.08
End time: 204.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little different. It's a little different. My head, don't stare at it. It is abnormally large.  So what are we going to do with questions today? This is a little different.

Start time: 205.00
End time: 223.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we have been, for a couple of years, we've been building question engines.  A lot of when we do live shows, we want to find ways that users can interact with us on the air.  And so we've been experimenting with this. This is our newest version, version 3.  And so what you can do here is go to bit.ly. That's B-I-T.

Start time: 224.00
End time: 227.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're watching live. There's no point in doing this if you're listening after the fact.

Start time: 228.00
End time: 252.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's over. This is the reason to watch live.  And so you can go to bit.ly. That's B-I-T dot L-Y slash Twit four five four.  I may have gotten that number wrong. I got that number right.  So Twit four five four. So it's bit.ly slash Twit four five four.  And this is a question system. And what you can do here is you can watch the show.  So you don't have to put this on a separate window. There is a login.

Start time: 253.00
End time: 259.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So instead of using chat, for the time being, if you want to do, you could use this.  It won't be as interactive as chat, but we will see the questions.

Start time: 259.18
End time: 266.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll see the questions and you can vote them up. I can see them right here.  I can give you the login if you want to see them there.  I'll let you be the question.  You can just come over to me and we can answer some questions.

Start time: 266.02
End time: 268.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Alex, you're the one who has the answering power at this point.

Start time: 269.28
End time: 287.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At this moment, I can give it to you too if you'd like. You can jump in there.  Maybe I'd like it.  Yeah, okay. We'll get you linked. Okay. So I'll send you a link and a login for that.  You can just put it in the chat on the Google Drive document that we used.  Just let me know what you register as. Put it next to your thing here.  Oh, you have to register.  But no, I just have my programmer who's watching from London right now add you as an admin.

Start time: 288.00
End time: 296.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And your idea is that you might use this for hangouts and stuff when you do events.  Live streams.  You're doing it right now personally. Ask Alex.

Start time: 297.06
End time: 342.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been doing these kind of flash ones where I give everyone like 10 minutes warning.  I say, if you want to just ask questions about Rwanda or media or green screen, you just jump on.  And it's funny, we get about 20 people and they ask questions. It's a great little conversation.  And so it's an app that you can get up there. You can ask questions.  You can also vote on the questions up and down.  We can answer them. You'll see you'll see us experimenting.  I can answer them offline in text or we can answer them on the air.  So and we can also timestamp them, which isn't useful now, but will be useful in the future when we answer them.  So anyway, there's a lot of little bits and pieces that we're working on.  And it's just designed to keep the online audience more engaged, you know, and have you actually have it.  You know, sometimes with the IRC, everything is going past.  And, you know, we don't know how popular it is.

Start time: 342.26
End time: 367.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just an experiment. My, you know, I'm always looking for ways to make it more interactive.  Because one of the reasons we do stuff live so that people can watch live and interact with us live.  Exactly.  But we don't, you know, we've tried a lot of things, some of which don't work so well.  And we're going to find out if this works.  We tried to Google hangout and that kind of was hard because we had nine people and we couldn't get them all in and stuff.  Right.  See if it looks good.  Yeah. So if you want to participate and you're watching the live show.

Start time: 368.06
End time: 371.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For instance, the most popular question right now is when is Chad getting a raise?

Start time: 371.00
End time: 380.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, there's a typo. So it says when I when I Chad get raised, when I get raised, when I was posted by OMG.

Start time: 382.26
End time: 387.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Weird. Who would have posted that question? Huh?  But it's suspicious.

Start time: 388.12
End time: 405.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But, Chad, even though you obviously put it in there, it's been voted up by 38 people.  Yeah.  You've got some people on your side here, Chad.  Yeah, apparently.  This is not going to work and I'm going to turn it off.  Can you give Chad, one problem is Chad's watching the link that has the feed in it.  Give Chad the moderation.

Start time: 406.22
End time: 413.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So, Chad, just send me your username, your username and I can I can get you upgraded to admin.  We could just do that in the Google Doc.

Start time: 414.16
End time: 424.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think this is a top story. You know why?  Because I see a lot of people around here wearing these fitness bands, including you, Jill Duffy.  You wear a Fitbit, what's it called?

Start time: 424.36
End time: 429.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wear everything. I wear a Fitbit Force often. I also love the Basis band.  The Basis Carbons Steelers.

Start time: 430.04
End time: 431.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they just got sold.

Start time: 431.93
End time: 433.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they were bought by...

Start time: 435.03
End time: 436.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody big. Was it Yahoo, Google, somebody Basis?

Start time: 438.15
End time: 438.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I almost want to say Intel.

Start time: 439.86
End time: 443.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Intel. I think it was Intel. Congratulations. Ding, ding, ding. You're absolutely right. It was Intel.

Start time: 444.24
End time: 459.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and that's great for the company. I mean, it's a wonderful product.  It really came out first in the sense of having a heart rate monitor that you didn't have to wear around your chest.  So you could have this heart rate monitor on your wrist. It would count your steps.  It does really cool stuff, too, if you bicycle, which I do.  So if you bicycle...

Start time: 460.00
End time: 466.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because the Force doesn't know you're bicycling.  No.  It thinks you're not exercising.  It doesn't really count anything.  I used to put it on around my ankle.

Start time: 467.12
End time: 509.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Basis, though, when you start to bicycle, it knows your wrist position and the amount of speed you're moving.  And it's like, OK, now you're bicycling.  That's better.  And same with running. Once you start running, it automatically records that you're running.  And a lot of other devices that have that capability, you have to enable it.  This one just does it automatically. It also does your skin temperature.  So between the heart rate, the skin temperature, and the movement, it can tell when you're in REM sleep versus light sleep versus deep sleep.  So you just keep it on all the time?  Yeah, you just leave it on all the time.  Is that your favorite?  Carbon steel edition. Yeah, it is.  It kind of looks like a watch, too.  It does. It has a wonderful display on it.  It's $199. So it's more expensive than a lot of the other fitness trackers out there.  But that's by far my favorite one.

Start time: 511.31
End time: 512.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dan, you sound like you bought into this, too.

Start time: 514.86
End time: 548.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's been said before, but it's worth saying again.  The wearables market is kind of waiting for its iPod.  But having said that, the Fitbit has really helped me do exactly what the silly hyperbole would lead you to believe,  which is to bend your data curve in a positive direction, right?  Simply having access to this data.  You know, I did the same thing when I quit smoking.  I just made a spreadsheet and having access to this data helps you understand what you're doing.  It helps you identify positive trends in your own usage.  Which model do you have, Dan?  Which Fitbit do you have?

Start time: 548.20
End time: 549.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry?  Which model of the Fitbit?

Start time: 550.64
End time: 574.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have the, oh, what is this? The belt wearable one. What is this model?  The one, Fitbit one.  Yeah, the Fitbit one.  Yeah, yeah.  Super accurate.  It's fantastic.  The only danger, of course, is that it's waiting to be thrown into the laundry.  But it is really in the last year or so that I've been using it, I've really bent my data curve in a positive direction.  I get a ton more exercise and I see the beautiful city.  I have lost every one of these several times.

Start time: 576.04
End time: 623.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I killed my Nike Phil Bend by accident.  Well, that's where the story begins because according to CNET, and they published this two days ago on Friday,  Nike fired the majority of the FuelBand team and will stop making wearable hardware.  Now, Nike has responded saying, no, absolutely not.  They told a recode, the Nike FuelBand SE remains an important part of our business.  We will continue to improve the Nike plus FuelBand app, launch the new MetaLux colors,  and we will sell and support the Nike plus FuelBand SE for the foreseeable future.  Nevertheless, I think it's pretty clear that did lay off a lot of people.  And what it made me wonder is, are we about to see the big shakeout in this area?  I thought the FuelBand was the best device out there.  I totally disagree. I really do.

Start time: 624.00
End time: 630.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's wrong with it? It told you what time it was.  It did. In a hard bangle that wasn't going to bend or move at all.  I found it uncomfortable.

Start time: 632.56
End time: 634.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you have smaller risks than I do. It fit me well.

Start time: 637.22
End time: 672.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But for $150, which is what the FuelBand SE costs, you don't really get a whole lot of data.  So a lot of these other trackers will tell you your steps, your mileage, your heart rate, all this other stuff.  And Nike tried to do this thing called Fuel Points.  The problem with it, I actually went and met with Nike.  It wasn't real numbers.  I talked to them. Yeah, they were like, you know how Weight Watchers started Weight Watchers Points.  I was like, because nobody knew what calories were at that point.  We know what steps are. We know what miles are. We know what calories are now.  You can't invent a new standard and hope that other people will know.  My question was, was that related to FDA issues though?

Start time: 673.00
End time: 675.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like telling you exactly how many calories? So it wasn't.

Start time: 675.54
End time: 685.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. So yeah, there is a fine line between what is something that needs to be FDA approved because it's considered a medical device.  And it has to give you a diagnosis.

Start time: 686.26
End time: 723.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the mistake that well, it seems like a mistake that Nike may have made is  overlooking the importance of data in your fitness tracker.  Yes, these are neat little gadgets that we can wear.  But really the heart and soul of this is access to data and having that standards and know what steps walked are.  We know what miles are. We know what calories are.  And that is what I really care about is access to the data and how that can be.  The value proposition is how this data can make my life better.  It is not having a gadget that is flashy, but isn't standard and doesn't work in a way that I would expect it to work.

Start time: 723.26
End time: 736.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I focus a lot on the software side, the app side, the usability of...  Because exactly what you're saying, Dan, is that if you don't understand all the data it's collecting, then there's no point in having that data.  Right.

Start time: 739.04
End time: 779.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so I bought the basis while you were talking.  I'm getting it.  I need another thing to lose.  But it shares with everything else kind of this clunky, ugly form factor.  And I'm real thrilled to see that I can order even more ugly straps.  So that I think is part of the problem is that while I see every geek I know wearing one of these,  or maybe less so now, but for a while everybody had a jawbone up, then they had a recall, and then they had the Fitbit, and blah, blah.  But I think that even the geeks are not wearing them as much anymore.  And I don't think I've ever seen a normal person wear them.

Start time: 780.42
End time: 801.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I wore my Nike FuelBand pretty religiously until it broke, and then I was like, oh, and then it was out of stock.  Nobody buys another one.  And then I dropped out. Yeah, exactly.  And I guess the question is, of course, it's surprising that not all the smartwatches are just incorporating this into it.  They're going to.  They're going to, though.  Obviously, we've seen Apple's meetings, heard about them at the FDA.  I mean, they're definitely thinking about it.

Start time: 802.00
End time: 847.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I had a chance to really test the Samsung Gear Fit.  What did you think of that?  That's the pretty one. It's curved.  Yeah, it's curved.  It has this sort of rectangular-shaped display.  And the display itself is beautiful.  The functions as a smartwatch are pretty good.  So you get notifications from your Android.  You can quickly text somebody back with like a canned response that are all saved in there.  But if you're actually using it as a fitness tracker, it was not ideal because that touch screen on it was so sensitive that I found like if I'm moving around and I go to touch it, I had to like stop what I was doing.  Sort of like the biathlon.  You have to slow your heart rate and get your motor skills back.  So I found for that it just didn't really have an active person in mind.

Start time: 847.55
End time: 849.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and you're an active person.  I'm a pretty active person.

Start time: 850.00
End time: 854.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be perfect for me because I know I am.  Now, do you want that to be voice-activated? Would that make it easier?

Start time: 855.14
End time: 901.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now we're starting to get into the idea of like the true one wearable device.  And I think, I mean, there's so much that I want to see out of that that we're not quite there yet.  I want to interact with it not really by voice, but I want to interact with it through passive gestures.  So there's some experimental pieces on the market that are coming to market soon anyway.  One I saw at CES that I really loved was called Kiwi Move.  It looks like nothing.  It looks like a little chip, a little box that you can wear on your lapel, you can put it in your pocket.  But you can teach it to learn from your passive gestures.  So, for example, every time I lean down to tie my shoes, activate my running sensors.  Every time is so if you have a connected home, you have your doorway set up.  Every time I leave the door, you know, lock my house.

Start time: 901.32
End time: 904.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do you teach it? Does it say I notice you bend over a lot? What are you what are you up to?

Start time: 904.64
End time: 929.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so the guys who are making it have an app. It's not out yet.  I'm on their early list, so I think it's going to be coming out in like July or August.  You would train it with this app so you can do active gestures too.  And the one that they would show at CES was when I draw a music note in the air.  That means, oh, that's cool.  Find out what song is playing and then offer for me to buy it through my store of choice.

Start time: 930.26
End time: 932.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a little weird gesture. But I guess you could have other gestures.

Start time: 933.00
End time: 943.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's neat because other people can't mimic your gestures.  Right.  Because there's very specific things that humans do.  It's a wonderful pairing of like humans and computers, I think.  Right. I mean, Chad's a big pebble guy.

Start time: 944.18
End time: 967.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He just I gave him my old pebble because I that's another one I got tired of.  Right.  And that's a different category.  So you've got right now a big division between the health stuff like the Fitbit Force and then the notification stuff, the phone extension like the pebble.  And then I guess Samsung is kind of mixing a little bit of the two in together.  But what's interesting is the pebble also.  Do you wish you had health features in the pebble?

Start time: 967.02
End time: 996.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can go install that from the store.  Oh, so it does do that.  It does. Yeah, it does some stuff.  So like Runkeeper is one of their most popular ones.  It's basically just pedometer, just like the other ones.  It's not doing any of the cool heart rate or skin temperature stuff, but it's still a pedometer.  And I one thing that I got really excited about, I haven't tested yet, is a sleep sleep tracker.  And that's all built into the pebble because it's just a smartwatch at this point.  Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 997.85
End time: 1002.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why you don't get raises, by the way, Chad.  I just give you my old crap.  Right. Exactly.  That's kind of like a raise.  Yeah.

Start time: 1003.54
End time: 1020.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't have to spend a hundred bucks on the pebble.  The wearable movement in general, you know, there's a lot of stuff that I think we're going to jump over.  So I always talk about Google Glass and the problem is you're still looking at a screen.  And I think that's something we need to jump over.

Start time: 1020.28
End time: 1021.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What would you have instead?

Start time: 1022.91
End time: 1024.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So like I was talking about passive gestures.

Start time: 1025.00
End time: 1026.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think something that you need a screen to read.

Start time: 1027.30
End time: 1032.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So eventually you will look at your smartphone.  I think the smartphone is not going to get rid of the smartphone.  Yeah.

Start time: 1034.00
End time: 1072.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but I think when you look at Google Glass and you look at the context that they're building,  it seems that they're probably Google Glass is kind of an early version of something that's going to be a lot more embedded, you know, into what we're doing.  Yeah, I hope so.  And I think I have Google Glass and it's not something I wear every day.  I use it a lot for video, you know, so shooting videos and having that screen becomes super important.  There's a lot of other like wearable devices that I can put on.  And what I use it for a lot of times is instructions.  We have a lot of technical stuff.  And so I'm like, this is how you do this.  And this is what I, you know, this is and send off a little video or capture a little bit of moment.  And I can't do that with anything else.  I mean, like effectively.

Start time: 1072.00
End time: 1075.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds like you guys think that this is a fairly useful category.

Start time: 1076.10
End time: 1105.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder if there are market projections for the size of this market,  if it is only fitness based versus if the value proposition comes from being able to do what Chad just described,  install, just like we do with our smartphones, things that do add utility to our life.  And if we can, you know, like Jill said, jump over that screen and really embrace something that that adds value to our lives,  then that market must be pretty massive.  Right.

Start time: 1106.00
End time: 1120.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you guys have an overdeveloped imagination.  You're fantasizing about something that doesn't exist.  You agree, right?  This is kind of well, someday this is going to be a useful category.  Right now it's a pedometer.  You know, basically it's a pedometer.

Start time: 1120.18
End time: 1120.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless it does heart rate.

Start time: 1121.64
End time: 1146.54

These things, they're very, very limited use.  But I think I think the convergence.  And the problem is that this is the elephant in the room, which is Apple.  Like, well, is Apple going to do something as they have done in the past that puts this on the map?  Or I don't I think Apple doesn't have the mojo anymore.

And then there's and it's kind of part of quantified self.  But it's the more advanced quantified self that's the health category.  So I think if you could make one device, I don't know, are you going to have one device that does all three and then also understands it when you go like this?  I mean, what what are we going to is that what you're fantasizing about?  Well, I mean, isn't that the beauty of tech is that we dream big and we think about the things that we would like to see and we would like to have and this wonderful creative future.

Transcript:  And this was posted and not by one of my friends earlier this week.  I think a secret is the app on iPhone that allows you to share anonymously.  And it's really it's I we've addicted.  I have mixed feelings about it.  Do you post anything on it?  I've posted once or twice.  Mostly, I just read in which of my friends is doing that.  But this one was posted this week.  The douchebag execs at Nike are going to this came out before the story are going to lay off a bunch of the engineering team who developed the fuel band and other Nike plus stuff.  Mostly because the execs committed gross negligence, wasted tons of money and didn't know what they were doing.  Bitter. Ouch.  Ouch. And I have to say, because this came out before the story and then the story came out, I have to think maybe this is somebody on the inside who has a little information about it.  A lot of times on secret, there's stuff that's just like it's made up.  Right. And I shouldn't really even be quoting secret at this point.  That's pretty lame. It's a new level of first.  It'll be a first time. Yeah, exactly.  But it might lead might speak something to the problem.  It's not it's an internal problem.  It's a Nike problem. It's a management problem rather than a problem with the category.

I think the category just needs to find its sounds like you guys agree on iPod.  Yeah, it's like the iPod.  There hasn't there hasn't been enough phones were horrible until the iPhone.  Yeah. You know, can Apple do it again with the magic touch?  I think we're going to find out this year if they can do it.  I don't know that they can or not.

Transcript:  Atlassian is a Australian company that I really like.  And it's like one of those companies that you've never heard of.  But they're doing two hundred million dollars in annual sales  because they help developers develop great products.  And I think we see these days that the the project management is so important to the success of a product,  to the security of a product, to the well-developed product.  Atlassian's Jira is the project management solution for teams that are planning,  not banning, planning, building and launching great products.  It is a really neat company that is kind of snuck under the wire.  I want to tell you about Jira because you can try it.  Forbes wrote Atlassian is to software as Apple is to design.  I like that Atlassian.  And this is a little complicated. So if you're not a software developer,  this may not make a lot of sense.  But if you've ever worked on a team developing software, you will probably recognize the issues.  You would love to easily capture, organize and prioritize your team's issues, tasks, features and bugs.  Give that team a simple intuitive interface so you can collaborate in real time.  You could integrate all your planning documents wherever they are, your backlog, your issues and your code repository.  They've got great integration, allows you to follow your code from development all the way through delivery.  They have REST API, so it's very easy to code your own tools to use with Jira.  Everything from the planning doc, the files and chain sets and the repository all the way through to deployment.  You even have notifications via email chat, at mentions, RSS.  You can monitor streams of activity, self updating reports and dashboards.  It's pretty sweet, pretty slick, pretty modern.  70% of the Fortune 100 use Atlassian Jira. NASA uses Jira. 25,000 companies use Jira.  If you haven't tried it, go to Atlassian.com slash twit for more information.  Monthly plans start very affordably.  Ten dollars a month for up to ten users and it's free for 30 days if you visit Atlassian, A-T-L-A-S-S-I-A-N.com slash twit.  We're really thrilled to have Atlassian part of the family.  I just love this ad.  I think this is from an Australian marketing for engineers.  It's I guess a billboard ad from Atlassian.  If your wife were in labor, we would think and it's got the bash shell prompt, get push.  Okay, it's kind of geeky.  Just like that.

Let's look at a little more Google news, in fact, Heartbleed news.  Most of it, we were talking last week, I thought, a very interesting conversation if you missed it, with Bruce Schneier about Heartbleed.  He had originally classified at 11 on a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of severity.  He says not so bad as we thought.  But I guess the patching process is a little slower than we might have liked.  He said most of the big sites now have patched, most of the top 10,000, almost all of them.  It's the next 10,000 that are not moving fast to patch.  And I'm just reading this blog post from Google on Wednesday.  As a perfect example, Google, which knew about Heartbleed before anybody, they had a lot of advance notice.  They've patched most of the big services, Search, Gmail, YouTube, Wallet, Play, Apps, App Engine, AdWords, DoubleClick Maps, Maps Engine, Earth Analytics.  Tag Manager. But Cloud SQL, Google Compute Engine, Google Search Appliance, versions of Android.  I mean, there's still stuff it's hard to do, I guess, to fix it all.  So there, you know, and the message that we've been passing along is wait till the service is updated and then change your password.

Start time: 1809.86
End time: 1827.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Tumblr maybe have been over aggressive.  They said, take the day off tomorrow and change all your passwords.  And there are some people saying that's a little bit over just because you had the problem.  Tumblr doesn't mean we did. For instance, my bank, Bank of America, did not use OpenSSL, so we didn't have to worry about that.

Start time: 1828.64
End time: 1891.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that, again, this comes up every time you see one of these things, that the lesson is, change your passwords off.  It's not a bad idea.  Use unique passwords for all your science.  And really, whether you're using one password, we use LastPass.  What we like about LastPass is that company-wide, I can share passwords for specific things with everyone.  I don't even have to show them what the password is.  I can simply give them the login for a specific site or whatever.  And then I love just using, almost everything now is all hashes.  I just don't know anything about my passwords, which makes me a little dependent.  If I don't have LastPass, I'm in a little trouble.  But I change them pretty often.  And I think that's how most of us don't get ourselves in trouble.  It's just using password or 12345 or all the things that we think make it easier.  It's hard to get used to something like one password or LastPass.  But once you start using something like that, it becomes...  You rely on it.  I don't even know what I was like before that.  I have to say, since I've really gotten into technology, that is the thing.

Start time: 1893.77
End time: 1927.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had no idea I was so passionate about.  And once I started using a password manager, I really wanted to spread that message to the people in my life who are not technological.  Because I don't think they understand what password managers really do and how simple they make it to use the web and websites in general that require a login.  So if you are a tech evangelist, go and tell everybody that you know to use a password manager and show them how easy it is.  Because I think people have a misconception about what it is and what it does.  Now it is important...

Start time: 1927.04
End time: 1951.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spreading the word, like you just said, may be one of the most important things to come from Heartbleed.  Well, yes, there are things you can do.  You can change your passwords.  You can change your passwords.  But really making more evangelists of normal people to say, look, change your passwords regularly.  Use a password manager.  This is why it makes the web easier to use and how your life will be better by simply doing these small steps.  That's the best thing that can come from something like Heartbleed.

Start time: 1952.04
End time: 1979.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now the one thing I will say is that you do need to teach people a little bit about...  With great power comes great responsibility.  And, you know, like for instance, we had to train people in our office to have it auto log off if it's not being used for a certain period of time, like LastPass.  Because now if you leave it logged in, you walk away from a computer and now you literally every password in your whole life is opened.  So you do have to keep in mind that there's lots of little nuances to turning that on and off to make sure that you stay safe.

Transcript:  You probably you probably wouldn't want to do what this guy who reads the Washington Post did.  This is from the Washington Post, the Switch blog.  One of the Switch's readers posted in comments, I couldn't give a flying fig about the Heartbleed thingamajig.  Two years already, the thing's been running loose.  Not a word of somebody crying over its damage.  Say, does anyone really know its origin?  Russian crackers, Seattle high schoolers, the NSA, Yahoo's marketing department.  So he gave out his two passwords that he uses on all his accounts.  He said, read all the email I have, sneak into my Washington Post, New York Times or CNN accounts, go crazy making comments on my name, break into my Facebook or Twitter profiles.  Go ahead. I don't care.  And so what happened? His account on Tumblr, WordPress, Twitter and Facebook all appeared to have been hacked almost immediately.  His location on Twitter now reads Gas City, Indiana.  And people have been tweeting things like, I am really stupid.  I am really stupid.  OK, so maybe putting your password on a national news site.  Such a good idea.  Our friends over at ITProTV have done a how to.  I did a how to last week, which is on our twit specials feed on how to use LastPass.  They've done a how to on Heartbleed, how it is, what it outworks, how to fix it if you have a.  A server that you might think is vulnerable.  So I'm going to give a let me do a bitly link to this so you can you can get it.  Link saved a few seconds.  How do I make a custom link?  Just too much trouble.

And don't folks give your password.  I was just looking you asked the question, Jill, and I think it's a good question.  Did I get a lot of emails?  And I thought I did.  I felt like I did.  But you're right. It was Tumblr.  And he do was a handful of them.  Dan, you acted like you got a bunch of them, too.  Did you? Yeah, yeah.

And, you know, I try to be in the best practice or use best practices with with passwords and I've been using one password for years.  Yeah, most of the sites that I use offer two two factor authentication and, you know, regular prompts to change passwords.

Start time: 2162.04

Start time: 2178.16
End time: 2250.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. It's only good for a limited amount of time.  The real issue is if you're using two factor and your password's been compromised, you're really only using one factor.  So it's a good idea to change your password still.  And it would go back to two factors.  The bad guy knows one of them.  Then you need both.  Google Gmail blog.  Actually, let me let me mention this real quickly.  I can't remember. We didn't mention this last week, did we?  I think we mentioned it on Twig that Google had changed its terms of service and privacy terms of service to admit.  Yeah, we're scanning your email like anybody didn't know that.  Yeah. But apparently it wasn't explicitly in the terms of service.  So they have updated their terms of service on Monday.  I guess we didn't talk about it because it was this past Monday saying that, yeah, your incoming and outgoing emails are automatically analyzed by software to create targeted ads.  This we think is in response to the various lawsuits against Google doing this.  They're being sued by a number of different groups.  And Google has always said.  Pardon me?  Is it mostly outside the US?

And that actually made that four tabs across the top very, very useful because if you set this just get in the habit of doing this and training Gmail for, say, a month to say, I'm going to label and filter everything for a month.  And then all of a sudden, I only see the email that is important to me and I only get what I care about.  Those other tabs really filter away the noise, especially during the day.  And, you know, it's a little bit of sweat going into it.  But, you know, a month or so of training Gmail and and all of a sudden you'd be I live it in box zero.

Well, I probably have like five different email programs, but I use three mainly one is for my personal mail.  One is for all of the shopping that I do.  And one is, wait a minute, like junk sign up. Oh, I get it.  What happens is instead of having a tab, I have an entire other account that I'm not tempted to even log into unless I have time or unless I want something there.  Right. Right.

Transcript:  Right. There's a lot of companies who are trying this new push now to get rid of internal email.  Yes. By a certain date.  I think that's great.  I think if you can foster communication among your employees in-house, get them to talk to one another, get them to use something like, you know, maybe an instant messenger system or a sauna, which is kind of like a project management tool, some other way where they can have a clear idea of what they're doing day to day.  Who's responsible for it?  You know, all these things that email doesn't really give you and then you save email for external communication only.  I think that's great.

It's much more complicated than that.  But I think everybody wanted it to be true and thought, well, some people thought as France again and again.  But most people thought, what a good idea.

Transcript:  The deal cited by the Guardian is not a formal law.  It did not affect a million employees.  It doesn't even specify a specific time.  But two groups of employers last week signed an agreement with French unions outlining outlining certain workers obligation to disconnect the obligation to disconnect applied to a smaller group of workers, flexible hour workers, workers that could work more than 35, the mandated 35 hour work week or 10 hour a day limit.  What we call exempt workers in the in the U.S.  And it's basically acknowledgement that because they're always on the clock, they have a minimum daily rest period of 11 hours, which is to say they can work legally no more than 13 hours a day.  So but after that time, that's our minimum.  No, we can't write.

Email choose whether you know we have to choose is no longer that it just isn't available.  It is you.  We have to make choices about what those what those limits are.

Transcript:  That's a that's a very interesting idea that that whether you you love or hate technology or somewhere in that gulf in between that you have no choice but to have technology.  As a part of your life.  So the degree to which you want to interact with it, you cannot just be passive and say, oh, this washes over me.  I don't want to, you know, watch TV or I don't want to listen to the radio.  It's not like that. It's not you must make a decision.  It's not something that is passive in our lives.  And and, you know, if you hate technology, then making that decision probably increases your resentment of technology.

Like when I was they're not talking subway, you know, talking about.  No, I'm talking about Internet like Internet.  No, I hate train.  Internet connection.

Some city Kansas City has a Google Fire.  It was Kansas City and the but it was in Oklahoma.  And but the Kansas City is not.  It is.  Are you in the two states?  It's in two states.

But but I after that, I was like, oh, I wonder if we could open an office.  And, you know, and so for me, I think that when you look at a lot of these protests  we see in San Francisco and when you see when you look at the stuff that we're, you know,  the people being upset, I wonder when these companies start deciding,  we're just going to find somewhere that's cheap.

Transcript:  And then also the money podcast that the NPR does market watch Planet Money does a very good one on patrolling as well.  I am hopeful that all kinds of patent trolling are going to go away because there's there's a move in Congress to kind of restrict software patents.  There's an executive order to change that as well from the Obama administration.  I just I feel like we're kind of we're understanding the problem that these software patents lead to.  So regardless of my own dog in the hunt, and I do have a little bit of a dog in the hunt, I think that it's bad in general.  And I hope that things are going to look up intellectual ventures, which is Nathan Mirvold's company, is one of the worst in this group.  And they were putting together a group of I think who joined it was it Yahoo.  They're trying to they're trying to create another patent fight.  I just dimly remember this story.  Microsoft is investing and Sony is investing, but Apple and Intel did not.  This was a story that ran on TNT this week or maybe last week.  Intellectual ventures, which was started by a Microsoft millionaire, Nathan Mirvold, a guy who really was pro innovation.  But basically it was created to be a patent troll, to collect patents for things they didn't do.  They didn't invent and sue people or license them if they can.  And if not to sue them, Microsoft and Sony have invested in this intellectual ventures effort to raise more money to buy some new patents.  Good news, Apple and Intel turned them down.  So it's an interesting story. And there's Nathan pretending to be a chef, apparently.

I just I'm looking up at her and I'm looking down at him.  But he's really I would say in person he was very soft spoken. He was very inquisitive.

And, you know, here's a guy who made his money as a software scientist, as an innovator at Microsoft.  And he's doing something that is really terrible for innovation, draining billions of dollars from R&D efforts to go to lawyers in court.  And that's wrong. And I so whether it's legal or not, it's wrong.  And so I boy, this is an interesting fellow. You got to wonder about the contradictions of this guy.

I can't wait to read that.  But I'm finishing Dogfight.  There's a new 43 hour biography of the Beatles that just came out.  And that's volume one.  Holy smoke.  I can't wait to read that.  Nick Bilton's Hatchie Twitter.  Just finished that. And Brad Stone's The Everything Store.  I mean, these are all I'm behind.  I got more listening, less working, more working out, less working.  Audible.com slash twit to, you know, first two books are free and then the rest of it.  It's up to you.  So, yeah, I saw this.  I thought this was a very strange story.  Apparently, Microsoft wants you to move along on Windows 8.  Now, Windows update the Windows 8.1 came out a few months ago, I think.  Maybe I would have.  How would it come out? Help me out.  Help me out chat room.  Six months ago.  And really fixed a lot of the issues with Windows 8.  Then they did an update just recently.  Windows 8.1 update one.  Well, apparently they're so anxious that you apply Windows 8 update that starting with the May patch Tuesday,  Windows 8.1 users devices without the update installed will no longer receive security updates.  This is from Microsoft's TechNet blog.  No more updates for Windows 8.1 if you don't apply update one.  You're being nagged by now a little bit about update eight to the 8.1.  And you have, you know, a few weeks to install it.  But that's just bizarre to me.  They will support 8.0.  But if you have 8.1, you've got to get update one.

Start time: 3791.25

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Makes me wonder whether there's something they don't want to deal with there.  It says if the Windows 8.1 update is not installed, newer updates will be considered not applicable.  There's something deeper in there that they don't want to talk about.  But they don't want to.  I mean, that's what it feels like.  Is that there's something because it's not like they're not they're not supporting other more historical ones.  But they're going farther back.  Yeah, absolutely.

They've added the Cortana speech.  They've added the swipe keyboard style that I really like.  And I think that they're giving away windows for sub nine inch screens.

Transcript:  Well, one of the problems with Microsoft very obviously is that it became a conglomeration of different silos.  And the silos moved at different speeds, a different priorities within the company.  And it's going to take a long time to kind of recombine the incongruencies there and get not just a product but a culture that has shifted entirely.  So seeing Windows one update one dot x dot monkeys is we're probably going to see that for a while.  Right.  I don't know.

Well CarPlay can be added to existing systems as the technology works in conjunction with BlackBerry's QNX and that's my car has QNX.  A lot of cars have QNX as the operating system.  It's a real time OS owned by BlackBerry oddly enough.  So Alpine and Alpine's are less expensive.  They're going to debut this fall in Europe in the US with a base price of five to seven hundred bucks.  Pioneer stuff a little more expensive starts at 700 goes all the way up to fourteen hundred dollars.  And I'm not sure when the availability is early summer early summer.  Oh wait a minute.  Now they're going to add this to existing receivers via a firmware update in early summer.

Start time: 4049.51
End time: 4079.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah that's right.  So if you buy it built into a car you'll probably have controls on the steering wheel.  It's a little dangerous if you have to reach for your phone.  Not that I would ever do that.  Yeah.  Marissa Meyer's secret plan according to recode.  Kara Swisher always knows what's up with Marissa Meyer.  She says Marissa Meyer has a secret plan to get Apple to dump Google and default to Yahoo mobile search.  Who knew Yahoo still had search.  I thought that was Bing.

Start time: 4089.70
End time: 4128.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess I don't understand why Apple would go to Yahoo rather than go back to develop like for instance developing their own solution.  I mean they just got out of Google Maps so that they wouldn't have to be dependent on a third party.  Like it seems I mean I didn't go so well for them.  Yeah that really worked.  Yeah.  But but but but it's still becoming I mean it actually did go really well for them.  I mean it didn't go well from a PR perspective but they are.  But what happens is is that you're an iPhone user and you and you and you hit a link and you're in Apple you know maps.  Which is getting better.  It's still a little funky but but but it's good.  I admit the UI is better than Google Maps in my opinion but the accuracy is not.

End time: 4176.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know so so so I mean but but I noticed that like but what happens is I I'll click on something and I end up on Apple Maps and I'll just use it.  You know just and I think that a lot of people are just that way.  What really gets confusing by the way is if you have voice activated on one of them and you open up the other one for some other search and then you see one telling you I got into this trying to get to Coachella where I had one telling me to go one direction and the other one telling me because I had given two different searches.  So having both on the phone has got its own own problems.  How was why is it telling me that Coachella.  Yeah.  Amazing.  It was so what are you 18.  I was working.  Oh OK.  I was working there.  The best thing to do it at Coachella or any of these big things is work there because then you get the film pass which means you can go anywhere.

You know like I went to.  I went to the early Lollapalooza.  I was in the industry back then and the the Coachella is a much more laid back really cool.  People are just you know people running over each other.  You don't have people.  The biggest problem you end up with is people taking too many drugs typically and in the sun.  It's in the desert.  The desert is pretty unforgiving.  Yeah and we had I was there last weekend.  So what we would do is we work all day and then about eight we'd finish what we were doing and and then we'd wander wander into Coachella and watch the Pixies and and what's the what's the working angle to it.

Transcript:  I think it's funny I mean South by Southwest is probably the best example but these festivals that have kind of come up as music and film festivals that grew into something else because people were interested in tech or food or something else.  And it's just funny because it's so different from the days of a Woodstock or just as much more like that.  Or even Burning Man you know where it's it's sort of about the music it's sort of about this creative community.  This one's really about art festival.  This is a missus music.  Yeah.

Start time: 4335.18
End time: 4383.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a little bit of art here and there but this is really is five stage four or five stages really cool installations really cool location.  The only thing about it is like for instance if you weren't working there getting in and out like people are walking for miles to get to the parking and everything else.  But it's great bands as I said really.  It's like everybody plays there right.  I mean and what's crazy is just people just show it's the cool place to go.  So people just show up like we were when we were watching Pharrell and then you know Gwen Stefani just pops out of nowhere.  She's not advertised she just kind of comes out and sings a song and then and Snoop Dogg just shows up on stage and I think Beyonce showed up at her sister's concert.  And so you get a lot of these kind of impromptu you know collaborations that just kind of pop up and impromptu from the fans perspective.

Start time: 4384.06
End time: 4387.98

And again it's a it's pretty surreal especially at night it was it was a pretty surreal experience and the replacements played which was I was like wandering around going I think that's the replacements.  I'm old enough to know who that is.  And so anyway there's a lot of mixture of old old bands and new bands and so you really get ones from the alternative you know the Pixies were playing and so you get these like 80s alternative rock and then you also get Pharrell you know in the outcasts so Arcade Fire.  Muse.  Muse was like the worst band.  But that was the that was the one that had the that was supposed to be one of the best concerts there.  I mean I didn't see it I was seeing something else but it was that was the.  Yeah I wasn't at the time actually I was not I was he ate the brown that's something else yeah.

Start time: 4476.00
End time: 4512.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You picked this as your pick of the week.  It's the best camera.  This is the best the coolest camera.  You know it's pretty cool.  My kids want me to make them aliens all the time.  There's this thing we can enhance the eyes make the eyes really big.  I'll show you what I did.  It's like alien alien alien like today I literally had to make like three alien shots for them while I was at home.  You know what.  Well we were Easter Sunday.  So but but the idea of being able to short depth of field and and you know automatically and then be able to post it.  There's not really any other phone right now.  And the reason I picked it specifically was was because it was you Hasselhoff.

Start time: 4514.28
End time: 4525.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I Hasselhoff but I don't I'm trying to find the alien more.  You know what Google decided that the one with alien eyes is not a highlight.  I think it was.  Oh there's this case.  So this is built into the camera.  What a thrill.

Start time: 4526.04
End time: 4534.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah my kids think it's awesome that you can do that.  But it's also the short depth of field.  That's not really what you use a lot.  It's it's using it.

Start time: 4535.20
End time: 4556.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's what you can see is a pretty crisp even those four megapixels.  A lot of people give it negative reviews because David Hasselhoff seems to show up from time to time.  But I think it's a very good camera.  I like it.  I like it.  Now the times have changed a little bit because Google has released its official camera app to the Play Store.  So you could put it on.

Start time: 4557.32
End time: 4574.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact you can use it on the you can do is you can take a picture and then move the camera a little bit to give it parallax.  Yeah it's kind of interesting.  I think it's fine.  I mean I like the idea that I can just take photos and it's just this.  I mean I think the reason again the reason I picked it was because I love the idea of having something that is just automatic.  And I think everyone's going to have it in two years.

Start time: 4575.18
End time: 4610.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know this is early on but I think it was very very interesting way to implement it.  So I took a picture for instance here's a picture of the microphone that I took.  Actually the first one was with everything in focus and then I went and I made the background a little bit blurrier and they made even more blurry.  And this looks like a fancy SLR shot.  And you can by the way make the foreground blurry in the background out of in focus because it has enough information to change focal planes.  It's actually a little more flexible than the built-in application on the HTC One.  And it's free. Google's given it away.

Start time: 4611.02

Transcript:  What do you think about Project Aura if I may.  Let's talk about Aura. I like that idea.  So this is the module phone that Google is announcing as sort of a playground piece.  And this week they announced that they were going to give a hundred K prize to somebody who developed the best module that will plug into this phone.  So I believe it's just going to be one piece of glass and then the flip side of it will be ports for different components that you can plug in.  So do they intend to sell it that way? It feels like it might fall apart in your pocket.  Well you know I think they had a demo of it that actually didn't work because the screen was already cracked.  They dropped it in the screen and it already cracked.  But you know the idea is that we get away from some of the issues of fragmentation because you would have these swapable pieces.  Like Lego block.  You would just be able to update the component that you wanted.  And I think it's interesting you know instead of screwing on a lens to your camera you could swap in a different camera.

Start time: 4662.08
End time: 4668.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 4700.42
End time: 4718.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well in fact it was a Motorola experiment which Google kept when they sold Motorola Mobility.  Actually this is Dieter Bohn from The Verge visiting the Project Aura team.  So this is an R&D team that will stay with Google after the Motorola Mobility sale goes through to Lenovo.  But the idea is look at this. This is really interesting.

Start time: 4747.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh and there's a parallel trend with gaming PCs.  Razer just released a modular PC with swappable components.  I think there is something to be said for that.  If you care about a particular spec and want to tweak that then it's interesting if it's not mainstream.

The Galaxy S5 really isn't much better than the Galaxy S4 for instance.  The HTC One M8 is a little bit better than the M7.  But maybe there is still a lot of room for improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there's still a lot. Even though this HTC is really great.  I think there is an enormous amount of improvement in low light performance for cameras.  And I think that cameras are still the number one thing that people use their cell phone for.  Over voice, over everything else.  And the only thing that people should be focusing on, in my opinion, at this point is low light.  Because that's what people, really the average person is doing a lot of that can't...  Low light flies like you're sitting there with one candle.

Transcript:  That's where Apple has always focused with the photography in the iPhone.  It has been to de-emphasize the hardware and to talk so much about what the software is capable of doing.  And that's really the thing that differentiates them and Android.  I mean, this new Android app, the actual camera app, may make some difference.  But that slow shutter speed and the slow processing speed in Android is just...  I don't care how many megapixels you throw in it. It's incomparable next to an iPhone.

Transcript:  I have a new metric for rating cameras.  Because it doesn't make any sense anymore to talk about pixels.  I have a new metric. It's called pleasingness.  Right.  Am I pleased by the photos I get?  Actually, this is the HTC One camera.  By the way, you know what the number one problem with this camera is?

Transcript:  What?  The fact that they put it on the apex of a convex surface.  So you're most likely to scratch everything as you set it down.  I'm always careful now. I actually find myself setting my HTC down face down all the time.  Because I don't want to scratch the camera.  But it's become kind of... I don't know whether it's really a real problem.  But I can already see tons of micro scratches that are in front of my lenses.

Transcript:  No.  I think it made it out of focus.  Does it just do it? It does. The background's out of focus.  It looks pretty accurate.  I think this to me is pleasing.  So it's not the most megapixels.  It's not the... I don't know what the numbers are.  But I find the image is pleasing.  And I find the iPhone image is pleasing.  And I do agree with you, Dan, that the iPhone is the...  That's the standard for all of this.  But I think we're getting close.  I think the S5 camera's very good.  Obviously, the Nokia cameras are extremely good.  You still think... Have you played with the 1020 or the other Nokia cameras, Dan?  Do you still think that the iPhone bests them?

Well, we'll see.  I mean, I think what the good news is, at least at the high end,  the picture... the capability is getting pretty good.  Yeah.  Across the board.  iPhone probably still the best, although I think there are those who argue the 1020 is better.  And Nokia, by the way, also has that focus choice stuff.

Transcript:  I think that, for me, again, low light performance is something I don't see on any phone.  And only recently do we see... I think part of it is now we have cameras,  Nikons and Canons that do incredible low light.  So you know that it's possible.  And so I think that's frustrating.  I think that I want more interaction of my phones with other hardware devices.  But I'm kind of a pro user, so I'm a little frustrated about how hard it is to get, for instance,  an iPhone to interact through the Lightning connector to lots of other things.

And while a little limited, it is an incredible idea of having manufacturers stop making...  stop trying to do the interface.  Like literally just stop.  And create a hull and let it be Apple or Android or whatever.  I think that is something that we're just seeing the beginning of.  And I think a lot of manufacturers, when you see CarPlay,  I think what you're seeing is manufacturers starting to realize that they're just not very good at that.  And that's really hard.

And by the way, somebody in the chat room, he says,  I just popped in to mention that the sensor used by the iPhone, the Galaxy S4, the Lumia 920, all are from Sony.  It's true, they make the sensors for most of these.  And he says he believes the Xperia Z2 has the best camera of all.  That actually is not my experience.  But he does quote a review at a site that really is pretty good on this stuff, DxO Optics,  where they talk about optics involved in this and sharpness.  Because that's what they do.  They measure this stuff and they say it's a very accurate camera.

Transcript:  I did have a Z2 for review. I took a bunch of pictures with it. I was underwhelmed.  They weren't particularly pleasing.  But it goes underwater.  Almost everybody goes underwater now except our phones and Apple's.  I have a case for that.  Don't dunk Apple's.  I can do 300 feet.  But see, on the graph, the Z2 is ahead.  There you have it.  And that's all that matters.  There is a very big class of geeks, including obviously this fellow in the chat room,  who look at this, they look at specs, speeds and feeds, as you said.  And they say, well, I can see on the graph it's better, so it must be better.  And that's pleasingness does not take that into account.  It is a purely, a totally subjective measurement.

Our show today brought to you, also waterproof, but I didn't dare dunk it  because I have a bad history with that stuff.  Our show today brought to you by Squarespace, the all-in-one platform, hosting and software  that makes it easy for you to create a gorgeous website.  I'm not going to say InsideTWIT is a gorgeous website.  That's our blog site running on Squarespace, inside.twit.com.  But I'll tell you what, you can't bring it down.  If every single person watching right now went there,  we could bring almost any site down, but not Squarespace.  Noo-siree!  That's because Squarespace so tightly integrates the software with the hosting  that they have capacity, virtually endless capacity.  They could fire up more bandwidth like that.  In fact, it happens all automatically, transparently, and instantaneously.  So what the effect is, you always have a highly responsive site that looks great,  that's always secure because they apply the patches for you.  And it's easy for you. You don't have to be a web guru to use Squarespace.  You start with the 25 gorgeous designer templates.  Use the Logo Creator tool to create a great logo.  Use their iOS apps to post, to check metrics, to approve comments.  You can always use the designer and do some more heavy duty stuff  because they do have a great developer platform.  If you're a CSS guru, for instance, look, Chad's making us a new logo.  I love it!  You have access to more than 300 Google fonts.  I mean, it just is really great and getting better all the time.  Now they've added e-commerce to all subscription plan levels,  including the ability to accept donations.  So if you're a nonprofit or a school fundraiser or whatever,  it starts at $8 a month.  That includes the free domain name when you sign up for a year.  All the sites look great on all side screens.  They're automatically mobile ready.  Even the code underlying is beautiful.  And while I don't think you're going to need help because it's very intuitive,  they do have the best support in the biz.  24-7 from their Squarespace offices in luxurious Chelsea.  Actually, I think they're in Soho, south of Houston.  They are.  Oh, you know! What am I saying?  Dan, you used to work out of their offices.

DSL Report says, cord cutting on the rise, especially among the young.  This is actually a study by Experian Marketing Services.  The number of cord cutters, and Experian defines that as people who have broadband but do not have cable.  It's gone up 44% in the last three years.

End time: 5599.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's up 50% from 2010. 44% from 2010.  The number increases for users who subscribe to Netflix or Hulu.  A fifth of Americans who use those services don't subscribe to cable.  So there's a strong correlation between using Netflix or Hulu and not having to use cable.  That makes sense.  One quarter of adults between 18 and 35 who subscribe to Netflix or Hulu don't pay for TV.  That makes sense. You don't have the money. You don't want to spend the money.  And you're used to watching on a screen.  And this goes back to interface and user experience.

Transcript:  I'm going to do a review actually before you buy, I think tomorrow, the TiVo Romeo Pro.  TiVo is another company that hasn't evolved as much as I'd expected by now.  We were using TiVos in 2000.  But it works with a cable card, so I don't need a cable box.  I can do, at least in some areas, in this area, we can do on demand from Comcast.  So that means I don't have to listen to...  You know what? On demand in this area, I don't know if this is everywhere.  Maybe it's the same in New York.  They have these e-hostesses who just blather on about programs.  When you're in on demand.  And you can't get out.  And if you stop a show or pause a show, they come back.  It's quiet and you leave the living room, and then all of a sudden you hear voices coming from the living room.  And it's the e-hostesses trying to get you to watch The Good Wife or something.  And I don't want that.  Anyway, that's not on TiVo.  You can cross channel and service search.  So they have Netflix, Hulu, Amazon streaming, and of course on demand, plus whatever's on your channel guide.  And you search all at once.  So it'll say, oh, you can watch that show.  And it'll show you all the different ways you can watch that show.

Start time: 5700.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you're right, TiVo really kind of blew that first mover advantage.  But what they did do is them and Slingbox really helped prime the market for what we're seeing now.

Start time: 5709.50
End time: 5735.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And in fact, with the high end TiVo, I think the Romeo Pro and the Romeo Premier or plus whatever it's called.  It has Slingbox style features.  So I can watch on my iPad here.  I can watch my TiVo at home or anywhere in the house.  That is kind of cool.  And control it and have all that stuff.  It's very much like a Slingbox.  So I think there are better solutions.  I wish it were a little more elegant.

Transcript:  By now it should be.  I'm curious to see.  This is my big theory for Apple.  Is that the safest way for Apple to experiment with this would be to incorporate Apple TV into a 4K monitor that's designed for the Mac Pro.  So they just have a 4K monitor.  And oh, by the way, the 4K monitor has a 32 inch or 30, 40 inch or whatever.  And oh, by the way, it has a Apple TV built in.  What?  Oh, they don't?  I'm saying that would be.  You got me excited for a moment.  But that would be the safest way for them to continue the hobby.  You know, just because it's a chipset that they just add.  It would be simple for them to add to it.  And then it's just a, you know, they're not selling it as the Apple TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think that idea and you add a webcam to it, you add a, you know, whatever, with a little slide thing and whatever.  But the point is, is that, you know, that's something that I think would be very, you know, very interesting to see, you know, Apple kind of safely.  I mean, I think we know the difference.

End time: 5866.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, the user interface will stop you.  But the real matter is the content. Right.  So I don't want to watch regular TV with commercials.  I don't want to have a DVR that I have to set up to record it.  Then fast forward to a lot of work.  I want to be able to binge watch shows when I'm interested in them.  I want creators who are making content that is more suited for online distribution and streaming.  So I want somebody to be writing a three part series or a three season series where they know the end of the story.  They can plot it all out.  Have a good arc.  Yeah. And I think that's really the more important revolution that's happening with TV is how we're writing differently for it because the distribution model has changed.

Start time: 5867.08
End time: 5890.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and also this stuff can be smarter and kind of by it needs to be smarter.  And as a result, you know, you get a smaller audience.  But because this new model works with this, you can have Mad Men has a million viewers is not a huge show, but it can succeed for AMC in these new models.  And that's kind of critical as well is that you have a model so you can reach out and you can make better, smarter programming for the smaller audience because you have a way to monetize it.

And then the forty two minute show, which is the hour long show with commercials that we've become accustomed to it both in watching like what our attention span will hold, how often we expect to have a plot twist happen.  And writers are really good.  Yeah.  And writers are really good at hitting that pace.  So I think I think those formats are fine.  I mean, there's certainly room for a lot of experimentation, but I like those.  I like I think they're great.

Start time: 5946.02

Transcript:  Is there a I think I think there's a really interesting possibility of like eight minute five to eight minute formats.  What used to be a segment, you know, could be really its its own little bit, you know, the network package ranges depending on the show.

Start time: 5974.00
End time: 6003.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but I think like the five to eight minute, I think there's a there's a there's a there's because you could really do it.  You can do small. I mean, I have to admit that I'm I've been working on a bunch of stuff that's like five to eight minutes long.  And so it is you can definitely tell a whole mini story that's connected to a larger series in that in that little segment, because that's what you're seeing when you're watching.  But I think when you're watching something like 24, I mean, you really are seeing it in eight minute chunks, you know, six to eight minute chunks.  You are because of the ad. And then there's an ad, you know.  And so the thing is, it told you a whole story there and then it stopped.

Start time: 6004.06
End time: 6056.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that key. The story is is key.  And what Jill said is exactly right.  As long as we are in the process of refining and getting very good at narrative content and narrative storytelling, it doesn't really matter what the you know,  formats evolve and change and always have.  I mean, if you look at the last 50 years of television, formats have tightened and become more refined.  But what really does matter is the economics.  Like you said a moment ago, Leo, that we can and we see this in web publishing.  We can live in niches and those niches can make money.  But as long as there is distribution and a market for it, this stuff will continue to evolve and we will see changes in how we consume content and what a good package is and that kind of stuff.  But as long as there's a market for it and as long as it's a good story and the distribution is there, then it will continue to evolve.

And yet Lord of the Rings eight hours right before you can see the end of that or nine hours before you see the end of that story.  House of Cards, you know, that was this two 16 hour story arcs or whatever.  For such a short attention span society, we seem to like long form stuff an awful lot.  And a 90 minute movie now is almost seeming too short to tell a compelling story.  The character development we get on modern drama, episodic drama is so rich and deep.

It gives you everything you need to know about what's going on.  I swear to God, last season, remember the show where they're all standing on the pier and somebody's died.  I don't know who's died. And he's in a boat and the boat's going down and they keep shooting the flaming arrow and they keep missing.  I don't know who's shooting. And then another guy says, out of the way, kid, shoots the arrow.  I don't know who any of these people are. And I'm watching this and I'm going, I'm sure this is a meaningful scene,  but I don't understand the meaning because I don't know who the hell they are.

We had a very good I didn't get it in the promo, but I wanted to mention this week in law this week, episode two fifty five, the guest.  And I'm going to try to get him on triangulation.  James Barrett.  He's written a book called Our Final Invention.  And it's well worth watching the first 45 minutes of the show.  Actually watched the whole show.  But the first 45 minutes they talk about our final invention.  The the the basically the artificial intelligence in the end of the human era.  We've talked a lot about this in the last few episodes of triangulation.  The idea that in as little as a decade and Rae Kurzweil and others have said this, A.I. could match then surpass human intelligence.  We had Jeff Hawkins on founder of Palm a couple of episodes ago.  He's the guy who said, you know, he's working on a new kind of artificial intelligence, actually making hardware and software that works the way our brains do.  And he said, you know what I said, are you worried?  He said, don't worry, not it's not going to be a problem.  They're not machines are not going to take over as long as you don't let them replicate.  But if you let them replicate, all bets are off.  But he says, so and so what Barrett's been saying is, OK, don't you think that with, you know, so many people around the machines making the machine, somebody's going to let the machines make machines and then it's all over.

And the king who commissioned it didn't want another one made.  So he blinded the inventor.  That's cold.  It's terrible.  I'm a little worried.  I bought remember I did a review of this.  I bought this Lisey little big disk.  Love it.  Very fast SSD drive for my Manu Mac Pro.  Apparently, the French hardware company, which is now a Seagate subsidiary, says virtually everyone who's shopped on Lisey's website for the last year is at risk.  A year long credit card breach on one of them.  But how could this happen for a year?  The they were informed about the breach March 19th by the FBI.  They think that all transactions between March 27th, 2013 and March 10th, 2014 were affected.  Brian Krebs actually broke this on his Krebs on security blog last month.  He was the guy who discovered it.  And it's it's it's a group of hackers that have broken into dozens of online stores that used cold fusion.

Transcript:  So about a year or two ago, I met with this company.  I'm not going to say the company name because I'm not sure that they're still in business,  but they were coming up with a business solution for handling company credit cards essentially.  And what they did was they issued to each employee a unique card that could then generate new,  unique 16 digit numbers so that they could restrict how and how much each employee spent.  So imagine that you went to make a purchase online and you had a unique code that was only good for fifty dollars.  And once you used it, it was gone forever. It's a great idea.  It's amazing. Why aren't we doing it? Like it's it's kind of cover.

Some cards companies do this where you call up, you say, I want a one time number.  They'll generate a number for you on the website or over the phone.  You use it and there's two choices. You can use one that's merchant restricted.  So this will only be used at Amazon and you can use one that's only going to be used once.  And then it's no good anymore. And that's a great idea.  It is. It's got to be more convenient than that. It's too hard. You're not going to do it.  Chip and Pin is coming in the next year.  So we will get a little bit more secure on our credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is something that's coming up and I don't think it's the end of Google Voice.  God, I pray it's not. But March 15th. Wait a minute, was it March 15th?  March 8th. Wait a minute. No. We're in April now.  May 15th, you mean. So maybe May 15th.  They've announced that they're going to merge voice with Hangouts.  Google's been doing this all along, right?  They took Google Talk made it part of Hangouts.  The concern, and nobody knows, is that some features may get swallowed in that merger.  If they do, I will be very disappointed.  Remember Google bought Grand Central to create Google Voice.  And it's insanely useful for free. You use it, right?

Transcript:  But when it's bad for people like me who use OB-HI or Talkatone,  there are a number of services I use both, that's how I know, that tie to Google Voice.  And so I can, for instance, place phone calls on my iPad, which is amazing.  I always wanted... My iPad Mini is big for a phone, but I always wanted phone capability.  If somebody calls my Google Voice number, rings my iPad, among all the other devices,  using Talkatone, which is a free and paid, a freemium service,  I get text messages, Google Voice text messages and phone calls. I can answer the phone.  It's awesome. That's not going to work after May 15th. OB-HI, same thing.  I bet it will be integrated though. It's working now.

Start time: 7014.79
End time: 7019.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can already do that and add phones and remove phones.  So I would imagine that this is... It'll just be integrated.

Start time: 7020.34
End time: 7047.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Talkatone does something a little weird as does OB-HI.  I think they integrate through Google Chat. They do something weird.  But they sent me a notice that says after May 15th, Talkatone will not work with Google Voice.  There are no exceptions.  But you can transition to a new account, I guess, move your voice number,  but that means it's not going to be Google Voice anymore.  I don't care about Talkatone. I want Google Voice.  So this is just a service that worked with Google Voice.

Start time: 7048.00
End time: 7076.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think one thing that's really missing in the Hangout app in general is that  when I'm overseas, I make almost all my calls with Apple FaceTime audio.  I don't need to do it video. I just want to talk to people.  And I feel like that's one thing that you don't have.  In Hangouts, you can add a number, but you can't just do a voice call.  And I think that that is something that I would love to see.  Because I use...  Obviously, we do a lot of Hangouts, so I use the Hangout app a lot.

Start time: 7077.44
End time: 7119.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But one thing that's going away is XMPP, and that's what both Talkatone and OB-HI use.  It's Jabber, right?  Yeah, it's Jabber. It's what Google Talk was the underlying service of Google Talk.  They killed Talk. They kept XMPP going for a little longer.  But that's over May 15th.  And I guess that really... maybe this was Google's plan, cuts off these third-party services riding on top of Voice.  I would love to see Hangouts add some features.  I mean, one of the reasons I think our audience is particularly interested...  I've been pushing OB-HI for a long time. This was a great deal.  You buy a $40 hardware device. You got a landline phone that uses your Google Voice.  It was really awesome.  But I might as well toss it now.

And I realized it took me a little while to come up with my wife's phone number now.  Because I just know her as whatever I say.  And I haven't dialed her actual number for a long time.  And I think that we're a decade away from not having phone numbers.  I don't think that we're really going to do this for much longer.  I don't mind having one number for the rest of my life.  But I don't think it's going to be one number. I just don't think it's going to be a number.

Transcript:  But I pick my numbers now. My Android phone is a Washington, D.C. phone.  Because that's where they're office. And this one is this.  But I guess for me, I think that that whole global, needing to be specific somewhere doesn't really mean anything anymore.  I think that it's just how to contact me is what's important.  And I like the fact that without a number, now I control completely.  Who can call me? Who can't call me?  And the big problem with a lot of these right now is that the VoIP solutions actually don't manage bandwidth very well.  So that's the biggest problem that I have overseas is that they try to make it really high quality, whether it's GoToMeeting or Apple, FaceTime, audio, or any of these other ones.  They try to use up too much Skype even.  Whereas what you really need is something that I can say, OK, I want low bandwidth. I don't want to use more than 8K a second.  But the phone, you make a phone and then I can get a good, solid connection.

Transcript:  I want to go within Hangouts. You can toggle to voice.  And in fact, I did that yesterday with my Fitbit as I was walking through town.  You do have to turn the you know, within Hangouts, you have to hit the no video thing, right?  Which is OK. I mean, it's not quite a hack and it's fine.  But what that is is just toggling everything over to voice and then all of a sudden voice really improves.  So it's a user interface thing that Google obviously does to push you into video.  But it's just as effective to send voice.

Start time: 7297.02
End time: 7335.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it is. Just as I said, I just think that that for me, I use it so often.  And if it was there, I would never call anyone in my company again.  You know, like I would be just constantly using that as the phone.  You know, I wouldn't. That would be it.  You know, and that's the that's the issue.  And what I love about about Hangouts in general is like so, for instance, for instance, is that I I can have text conversations, video conversations,  and I can do it on my laptop, on my iPad, on my iPhone.  All of those are continuous between any of those.  And I don't have to think about it. And it's just a much better solution.  And my disclaimer, of course, is that we do 300 Hangouts a year and a lot of them are for Google.  So, you know, just to make sure I say that.

I talked to Joe Walsh, who was on Ham Nation a little while ago.  And I said, what do you record at record master at?  He said forty four one twenty four bit.

Transcript:  Well, so for recording the acquisition medium, I think that's crazy, to be honest with you.  I mean, I I love recording.  Well, yeah. And the thing is, is that when you record like I had one where I accidentally recorded forty DB off  and you know, but I recorded it at one hundred ninety two.  And when I when I gave it up information, there was enough information there that it sounded just fine.  You know, now now the so you recorded.  Well, what do you prefer to record it?  Well, for voice stuff, I'm still doing forty four one.  If we're doing music, I record at one ninety two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The big thing is, is what you're committing to in that player, though, is an entirely different scale of headphone and infrastructure.  And quality DAC or you will not hear it, but you definitely can hear it forty four one.  What I will say is that forty four one, you can definitely hear it.  You hear it is when the songs ending in the high tones and you'll hear quantization, you know, so it's basically when you see blocking, you know, blocking.  So it's not golden. It's not a golden years product.

If you take your little earphones that are less, you want to put your iPod headphones in this, of course, the commitment is you're not going to spend less than three to five hundred dollars on headphones  and hear any difference. So that's the other thing to remember is that you're buying this, but you're also going to have to invest in headphones that can hear it.  And really, the ones you're really going to hear it on are these really expensive open air ones that are thousand to two thousand dollars each.  You definitely are going to hear the difference. But that's what you're.  But if it's only because you spent so much money, people spend. You can definitely hear a difference.  Oh, no, no, no, you can. I mean, I don't know.

The company in Japan that owns the rights to Maglev trains says we will give the technology to the United States for free.  J.R.

I don't know if it's a Maglev, but it's a really fast.  It's probably a hundred and eighty, two hundred miles an hour.  And it is awesome.  And every time I'm on it, I'm just like, I cannot believe that we don't have these.  It's so you know, people bring in little things to eat.

It's expensive to build maglevs, but at least we won't have to pay licensing fees.  And True Blood is true.  This is actually a very big story.  Artificial blood.  Welcome Trust.  Welcome Trust funded stem cell research has produced red blood cells fit for transfusion,  paving the way for mass production of artificial bloods in factories.  This is in the UK.  That's why it's got a strange name.  Welcome Trust.  Limitless supply of typo blood free of disease compatible with all patients.  Currently it costs about 120 pounds to transfuse a single unit of blood.  If you could actually manufacture blood using this technique, it would be a lot cheaper.  So this is very exciting news.  This could be a big breakthrough.  And it means the vampires, you can come out of the closet.  Come on now, guys.  It's OK.  We've got blood for you.  All right.  I think I'm going to wrap it up after that bad joke.  I think no reason to go on.  Anything else?  No, I'm just looking.  Hey, Jill, I want to thank you for coming all the way out here.

Because I like the idea of being able to take questions.  Yeah, so we'll figure out better.  We'll figure out how to integrate it into the flow of the show.  And then we'll watch live because we like that interaction.  But if you can't watch live, of course, we make on-demand audio available  and video too, after the fact, on our website, twit.tv  and wherever they aggregate netcasts like iTunes and the Xbox Music Store  and Dog Catcher and Instant Cast and Pocket Cast and all.  There's a lot of cast apps now.  Thanks for being here.  Did I do everything, Chad?  Did I thank you, Chad Johnson?  Sure.  Underspaid employee, Chad Johnson?  You just didn't you just get a raise?  Am I wrong?  I didn't hear of that.  Well, I'll go talk to Lisa and we'll get you a raise.  Yeah.
