Start time: 262.94
End time: 315.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's been a great week. Well, we have a lot to talk about that's for sure. Let's start with Monday and  WWDC the worldwide developers conference  Apple had in my opinion kind of a fragmented talk lots of different stuff. Of course, you're talking to developers  Although it's a little it's a little weird because this is one of only three kind of big public events that Apple has so it  Can't just be for developers people are paying attention as we were  They did announce iOS 9 which will come out this fall and some new features there  They announced Mac OS 10 10.11 El Capitan. Yes, mon Capitan  Mon Capitan would have been better. I like that  Mon Capitan and  They talked to and they for the first time named the operating system for the Apple watch. It's called watch OS  Harry your thoughts

Start time: 317.09
End time: 338.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well  If you're expecting surprises or great leaps forward  It was a disappointment partially because almost everything was leaked  I think and just in terms of useful stuff that might make your life better. It was not a bad event  It was pretty dense with new features on the various platforms that the watch OS stuff means that for the first time  Apple watches will actually be able to run apps, which is a big

Start time: 340.60
End time: 367.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  At this point the Apple watch to me is kind of a gadget that doesn't have a whole lot of utility  although I talked to a blind guy on the radio show said, you know don't for the blind community, this is great because  It can it's a talking watch you could turn on voiceover. It'll talk  Somebody said I was sitting next to a guy on the bus. He asked his watch  Where are we now? What stop is this and the but the watch told him so there's a lot of value for that  But for the norm for normal I want to say normal but for the vast majority of us, it's just a gadget

Start time: 368.54
End time: 395.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it will get way better quite quickly once developers have access to stuff like the digital crown  Yeah, and all the sensors that was great  The other thing that I thought was interesting personally was the iPad is looking more and more like a PC operating system  Yeah, I've been asking for multiple apps on screen at once  You're finally getting that and I think it is not unreasonable to assume that we will see future devices  Running iOS to start to look a little bit more like a PC whether it's a larger screen

Start time: 395.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Merlin, do you like that idea? The yes the ability to do two windows on an app iPad

Start time: 401.52
End time: 441.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah, I do I have an iPad air 2 and  As I sit here today, I think that maybe next to my sc30 I had in the early 90s  It might be my favorite Apple device ever  I mean, I love my iPhone but the iPad air 2 you really get the power of what that thing can do and  I'm really looking for in fact  I'm not really those guys who runs around doing betas anymore  But like even just watching the keynote and seeing the picture in picture  I immediately feel like an animal having to watch something on YouTube  It feels like the 1930s I'm like come on I can't get this fast enough but now I think it's really exciting  I think the OS 10 stability and the iOS announcements were for me the two most interesting things

Start time: 441.66
End time: 446.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Isn't there a risk Dylan though of making the iPad too complicated? Yeah, I was just thinking that I mean

Start time: 448.36
End time: 461.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On the one hand you've got features like the split-screen view  Which you know Windows has had for years right and Apple's like hey look we invented  You can look at two apps at one time Wow and the rest of the world is like, uh-huh

Start time: 466.46
End time: 491.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, but I mean the thing is like one of the things I think that is appealing about the iPad and the whole tablet  Interface is that is very focused. It's like one thing at a time and  You know they have up till now struck a very good balance between  That that sort of extreme simplicity and the use, you know, the sort of usability that that engenders  I just wonder like as it gets more and more PC like is it going to become more PC like and usability too. Yeah

Start time: 502.16
End time: 526.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was actually in a video so Neil deGrasse Tyson right world-famous  Astrophysicist host of Cosmos  Director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York, like he's an awesome guy. He's a hero to many of us, right?  But he had a little cameo in a video about the App Store where he said  Apps plus hardware is you know water apps plus handheld hardware is a watershed moment in civilization

Start time: 526.44
End time: 529.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know when Neil says it though you go. Yeah. Yeah, I think he's right. Well, right

Start time: 531.50
End time: 580.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did he really just say that about the App Store so I called him up and asked him about that  Yeah, and yelled at me for like 20 minutes. What he was like listen to my words. I did not say the App Store. I said  Handheld devices plus apps. He never mentioned Apple and he never mentioned the App Store and it turns out that  Apple interviewed him for like 45 minutes  I spent the entire time raving about  hardware in general and like the kind of sensors that are in smartphones and how that enables people to be scientists and  Connected to the internet gives you all this information and like the one second that he mentions the App Store  That's the clip that they pull out put into their video about the App Store  So it sounds like he's saying the App Store is a watershed moment  But he really meant, you know  This whole like tiny computer and all of the internet in the palm of your hand is a watershed moment

Start time: 580.80
End time: 582.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you think he yelled at Apple like he yelled at you? I

Start time: 584.49
End time: 598.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hope so  They paid him he told me so I you know  he probably cashed the check and like shook his head and went his way, but  Yeah, he sees he was real concerned that we get that right and this my friends is why even if Apple asked

Start time: 598.72
End time: 604.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Platform as the CPU at least he got a plug-in for the book  That's what Neil missed in the cosmos. This is a watershed moment

Start time: 630.21
End time: 637.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then maybe it'd be worth  There's you know, there's also the side problem anytime Apple writes a check, you know, yeah, they only give you 70%

Start time: 642.74
End time: 683.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know it actually was a decent presentation they had a lot  I don't know why they spent so much time they do this their want to do this on the note  Updated notepad app like that's a big deal. They did I remember they did that with a card store  They had a card app and they spent like 10 minutes talking about it and then they killed it like a year later  So they're want to do that I guess they get excited, you know, this is gonna be a big deal  You're gonna have a to-do list in your notepad, whatever  But then the thing really went off the rails Jimmy Jimmy Iovine walks out and I feel like it's an it's a New Jersey  moment between Eddie Q and Jimmy Iovine, I feel like the East Coast is  The LBI is being represented right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's I mean it's I think Apple events these days are almost more fun than the old days just because more weird stuff  Goes on you can see people you can see people actually having fun on stage  But as you know, they had who knows how many people trying to explain Apple music Drake  And none of them actually succeeded other you know  I know that Apple music is an upgrade to beats music  Which is not a bad app and I know that Apple is doing a radio station  And I know that they're saying that human curation is better than an algorithm  But it's still not clear how Apple music is to come into this category that is crowded with streaming music apps and be something all that compelling  Well, the pricing is good. That's almost the thing that I found the family plan, right?

Start time: 749.10
End time: 768.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you know that Spotify and everybody else are gonna come up with a similar 1599 for six people plan  I mean, that's why wouldn't they music industry says yes to Apple. They're gonna do the same thing  In fact spot if there it is on the verge. I don't know if the verge  This is not a scoop exactly because they didn't get confirmation but they say the Spotify does plan to match that

Start time: 769.02
End time: 802.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They pretty much have to well, I'll say no, right. Yeah, they raised like a half billion dollars  There's a I mean it's interesting also, you know as this is going on all of the lawsuits are starting to come out about whether or not  Or the investigations but whether or not Apple  You know was coercing music labels into trying to remove free streaming and other platforms Apple's spending money  Apple's so desperate to get into this market. I don't think it was as tone-deaf as the title announcement  Because there was something sad about seeing some of the riches Jay-Z brought all these people out  We're not making enough money off of streaming music  Then your lawyer should have done a better job with the record then they signed a weird document

Start time: 802.62
End time: 857.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Which nobody told them what it was, but they all signed it for some reason  And lady lady Madonna, I don't know. I call her lady Madonna lady Madonna put her foot up on the table while she signed it  Or was that Lady Gaga? I don't know one of them did that  Yeah, that was weird  But that but this reminded me this thing at the end of the normal napple Apple event did remind me a little bit of  A Samsung event kind of singing and dancing and there she is  Thank You Madonna  Interesting point of view from Panda Daily David Holmes running a Panda Daily says is Spotify doomed because of Apple Music  No, Spotify has been doomed from the start  We kind of focus on can Apple Music beat Spotify  But the real question is is there a future at all for these streaming apps because the music industry hates them  right  You think it's the it's the music industry that artists hate should hate the music industry

Start time: 858.74
End time: 870.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Getting a better deal from Apple than they got from I mean  It just doesn't the economics don't add up if you're paying $10 a month  Apple's not gonna have that much more to give the artists than Spotify is

Start time: 872.90
End time: 894.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean if they want to I mean they could just subsidize. Well, yeah, this is this would be like a classic proctor and gamble movement  We're gonna go in make the cheapest detergent on the planet  We're gonna put everybody else out of business then we're gonna put a premium brand in and eliminate the cheap detergent  I mean, that's that was kind of their their their thing for decades  But you know Apple could be doing that or maybe Apple's just desperate to to to stay relevant

Start time: 895.56
End time: 931.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's there's this funny scenario that the music industry finally set met somebody that was more of a shark than they were  There's a quote in this Panda Daily story from an unnamed music industry source  Actually, it's from The Verge all the way up to Tim Cook. These guys is cut throat  But when Jimmy I have been takes a stage he seems a little more street smart little little more little more tough  Just maybe that's just this persona  He from the very beginning of beats but long before Apple came along said  We got the thing that's gonna save the music industry or streaming music is human curation, right?

Start time: 932.76
End time: 954.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be interesting to see how well it scales  It makes a lot of sense if we're talking about a few songs and a fairly small number of people  But if this if they're doing this on Apple scale and they're trying to appeal to people of with all sorts of different tastes in music  How many human curators do they need to do that and how do they keep it interesting a year from now  Yeah, the playlists say like now I won't care about a year from now. I

Start time: 955.18
End time: 961.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mean, it's not like human curation is untried. We we still have FM radio and that's curated. That's what cracked me up Apple

Start time: 1003.42
End time: 1078.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mean, I don't know. There's a time when I've tried the other ones. I tried Spotify for a while  I just beats made sense to me, you know, I like the way it works. I wish you would keep me logged in longer  I have a I mean, I don't have that much  I don't know that much about the streaming music business  But I I have a theory that I share with a few other people that it kind of feels like I don't know  I felt like the first two thirds or however long of this was a pretty good show  I mean, you know, it was it was there was not any of the giant bangers. Yeah  Yeah, but the music part felt and I don't mean to sound critical or pile on but it really it was a  Something show it was it was a mess and it really felt unrehearsed. It felt not ready. It felt really I  Enjoy the kind of unrehearsed moments  But I don't know  I share the theory with a few other people that it kind of feels weird to end first of all to invoke the  Semi-sacred one more thing to announce a consumer facing service that has zero to do with developers  And there's this part of me that wonders if maybe they were like this close on something like an Apple TV announcement  It just wasn't there yet. And I wonder if maybe this event which was not, you know a particularly  watershed event to call a one more thing there's a part of me that just kind of wonders if maybe they had to put that in at  the last minute and

Start time: 1079.24
End time: 1130.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what they had. I'm convinced that that happened  The fact that the HomeKit announcement was so short and I know they had so much more to say  Told me that that felt like that's where they would have said. Oh, and by the way the hub for your HomeKit will be  the brand new  Apple TV so but that's still to come. I apparently that was if that was delayed  It's delayed because of deals that weren't made  But this is but this is kind of the overall point of this and the point of the Pando Daily article is that Apple's now  going into areas like the music business where  They're bringing a knife to a gunfight. These guys the music industry is gonna eventually kill Pandora  They've been trying really hard this is gonna eventually kill Spotify now. It's suicide  It's stupid because there's no alternative the music industry is proposing  Well, I mean what they want is for you to go back and buy CDs some more

Start time: 1130.58
End time: 1134.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean they're gonna kill Spotify by just raising the rates and raising the rates and raising the rates

Start time: 1134.52
End time: 1169.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's no yeah, but Spotify is not making money  Spotify is raising money right but Spotify is not profitable and never will be because the music industry determines  How much money they make you could they could have every person in the planet sign up?  They still take home less than they spend  So how is that a business?  Where does that flip their county?  I presume they're counting as Tim Westergren at the Pandora's counting on the music industry giving in right saying, okay  We'll take less the music industry doesn't seem to have any will to do this and Spotify is expanding to video and other stuff, too

Start time: 1169.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Disclaim that we are one of the podcasts on Spotify  Our audio and video is on the new Spotify and I'm thrilled about that and that's a smart move because I don't charge them  Right from putting to it on Pandora. I mean on Spotify. That's a free  People have said that one advantage Apple has  Is their massive clout the fact that they're gonna put beats on every single iOS device come the end of the month with a 8.4  that they have a  multi-billion dollar  Slush funds they've already started buying ads like crazy. But have you seen the Apple music ads they don't I  Don't think that this maybe there's gonna be more to this campaign. They're great ads  This is the video they showed at the at the event as well  Love the ads. It's kind of the history of music

Start time: 1221.84

Start time: 1227.18
End time: 1242.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  in fact all they say at the end is it says Apple music and  I think most people seeing that will say oh, yeah Apple music iTunes. I know that I already yeah, I'm a big fan  I use it all the time  Merlin is it maybe this is the beginning of a campaign that will do more

Transcript:  Just I don't know the phrase John Syracuse from accidental tech podcast uses sometimes  you can really tell when a company is putting wood behind the arrow and  And it's funny because there's there were several things that came up you you had mentioned  What was the one you mentioned like the cards app a few years ago?  It feels like sometimes Apple will have these things that they toss out  That seemed really just a little bit north of a trial balloon where you're like, this is no trial balloon  This has to work right I guess so I guess so but it just seems it seems incredibly fragmented  It really it really feels like they got a box and put three things in it and called it a service  They got a minute. It's a me too, but they showed I guess so  But I mean, I guess I'm saying that if you show that they show the setup for setting the app up with that  I was yeah, that's beats. That's you're setting up a beats account. You do exactly the same thing. There you go

Start time: 1294.02
End time: 1347.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so I don't know  I mean, it's I guess I just would have liked as a consumer who is super interested in this kind of stuff and does like  Music and doesn't mind paying for it  I wish there had been a little bit more clarity about what this was replacing, you know in the same way that for example  You know  I don't know it just feels like they come up with these things that are that are partly break partly baked and  They do enough to kind of put some people out of business, but don't really  Changed fundamentally how things work. So like reading lists came along and heard a lot of relate later services  But I don't know that many people that change anything. Yeah, I don't know anybody  The notes app stuff. I think those are great. Those are great additions  But in the case of stuff like that news app, it's like I mean is that gonna be there a year from now?  I mean, I realize they kind of have to do that to compete with Facebook  But I just I that there are certain kinds of things where I would like to have a little more clarity on exactly what it's  Meant to replace so is newsstand really dead?  I have friends that put out magazines for money that have not officially been told that yet

Start time: 1347.66
End time: 1363.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Which seems really weird that like that was the assumption is that they're gonna get it rid of the newsstand which was kind of lame  Which is kind of like a folder that is in a folder that holds that holds publications  That's gonna go away and that this is but this news doesn't replace that is something else

Transcript:  Well, I can't say for sure but up actually this old podcast to do a Jim Dowd Ripple which will come out tomorrow  Are this week's episode he does something for loop insight on?  As a magazine and according to him he hasn't received any kind of notification from Apple about that  it's just it's just you know, I don't know and there are just times when Apple comes up with stuff and  You really kind of hope sometimes it feels like a gamble with any company. This is true for Google  This is true for anywhere, but especially with Apple  You really hope that they're gonna see it through to completion and as they say put that wood behind the arrow to make it something  That's gonna be really awesome. It's just in the case of that music app that smelled more like ping to me than  Well, no in this sense. Yeah, let me understand  So Drake's gonna send me lyrics in the app where I where I listen to REM, you know  This is the problem with stuff like iTunes is this too much junk in one place  This feels like a different way of organizing that junk  Around beats plus something they did not clarify the iTunes match thing iTunes match  I think you still have to have a separate iTunes match account to keep using iTunes match  Even though iTunes match selections appear. I don't know. I just thought it was pretty modeled

Transcript:  This and that and they just kind of shook it up. It feels like a me too. The problem is I don't see any any I  Don't know if there's friction to switch from Spotify. I'm a Spotify and Google music subscriber around all the time  You just jump around so that's not a hard thing to do, right?  So and and because they're gonna give people free three months. It's the same price  It's ten bucks a month, but they're gonna and it's I presume 30 million the same 30 million socks that everybody else has so  The selling point solely is well, this is but it's Apple  I mean, I think the example the big question is

Start time: 1489.12
End time: 1508.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they have plans for something that is newer and more interesting and more of a great leap forward  Which is Apple music 2.0?  Maybe the first step is just to get it get it onto the devices and then to do something cool and interesting  Which of course Apple and other companies all the time really something kind of half-baked and then get around to doing something more impressive

Start time: 1508.30
End time: 1552.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that that's another part of this that it feels like a little bit of a sleeping giant  I know this is true to an extent with Google  It's certainly true with Amazon  But you know there was that number that came out in the last year or so about how many like active credit cards?  Apple has on file like how many people are comfortable buying stuff from Apple  One way or another but it's a super interesting metric to me that there are so many people that are okay buying stuff with Apple  And you know ideally they want to find a way to run that card more often  I'm just kind of surprised because yeah, I guess but I mean also I don't I don't know the you know to me the big  Hit would be eventually getting something with a dev  Where developers can put stuff on an Apple TV because then you can buy apps you can buy a thousand dollars worth of apps in a  Month you can only spend ten dollars a month on streaming. It feels a little capped out to me

Transcript:  I have a product that probably looks a little bit like this kind of Apple TV  It's called the Android TV the Nvidia shield TV. It has an app store has games  it works great with Google music at which I am a subscriber of and my the nice thing that Google music like Apple music all my  Whatever I bought including Beatles music is on it plus the 30 million songs that I don't own  And it plays through my stereo plays through my TV. I could see an Apple TV being great  But again, it's also an also ran it Apple is I think Apple's got trouble if the only thing Apple can say is but it's Apple  They have to offer  something of value beyond  What's out there to me and it feels like Apple's merely saying oh, but but it's Apple  Now the other thing and you bring bring this up with the with the new news program is  And they've definitely said this on stage and we're Apple and we unlike those other guys  Protect your privacy  Sorry. Well, but that's a question mark because how can you for instance and this is a great post on Google Plus  I don't know who Thomas baked Ella is but he makes a great point. He said if in fact  As Craig Federighi said Apple News is anonymous not associated with your Apple ID  Not linked to other Apple services not share with third parties. You're gonna you're in control  There's some negatives to that. For instance, my iPad won't know what I've read on my iPhone because it's not shared  It any it says it gets smarter as you use it  but only it only that one app will get smarter if I reinstall or  Or use a different device. It won't know cuz right cuz it's not tied to my Apple ID  So there's an advantage Google has  There's advantage other companies have to not saying oh, but don't worry. None of this is connected connected sometimes is what consumers want  Dylan you agree. I

Transcript:  That's not to say we shouldn't be concerned. I think there are  Absolutely legitimate reasons to be concerned about privacy  But most consumers don't agree yet because knows most consumers haven't experienced anything  You know that that would lead them to to feel like losing their privacy was anything bad.

Transcript:  I have to say though our audience is outspoken in that and privacy privacy advocates tend to be very loud, right?  And so people get the impression  That the American public does I think the American book does care, but I think they also acknowledge look  I go into a Target store. They know exactly what I'm gonna buy. They know exactly what coupons to feed me  There is no advert advertising privacy. This is again from this incredible post from Thomas Begdahl. He quotes Tim Cook  Saying they're gobbling up talking about other companies everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it  We think that's wrong says Apple and it's not the kind of company Apple wants to be we don't want your data  And then at that very same event they launched three new services Apple Wallet  Apple music and Apple news both featuring individual targeting tracking and tailoring  Integrated directly into I ads Apple's ad platform.

Transcript:  But that's also what was so interesting about that study  There's a really it's a good summary of it up on on CNET it's Americans resigned to giving up their privacy  But you know in the survey they found out 65% of Americans believed the mere mention of a privacy  Policy meant that your privacy was protected by that company or that you know Expedia and orbit  Are legally required to give you the lowest possible price when you're searching  For a no, it's a really I mean, it's a really good write-up.

Oh, why are you so hard on Apple?  Are we being hard on Apple?  Are we asking we asking Apple just to do what everybody to be straightforward and I do see problems ahead. I think  I  Know this is very dangerous territory is Apple Merlin you're an Apple fanatic  You're am I you seem like you're a little negative on the is Apple stumbling. Oh, no, I'm I'm just I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just very critical of stuff that I love. Yeah, I agree notice how many things I don't have a comment about I  Expect more of that. I only get mad at stuff. I want to get better and I really I believe that I don't know I  Hmm, I guess I'm a little less  Skeptical or cynical about Tim Cook's Apple. I really think he does want to do the right thing  I think part of the problem is that we as consumers  I mean you hear those numbers about how you know jobs are created jobs are not being created how many people are applying for  You know trying to get new jobs  There's a certain point of fatigue that people reach in a down economy where they're not even trying to get a job anymore  I think it's kind of where we are for the moment with privacy where it feels completely out of people's control  I don't know who you blame for that  But if you start reading Krebs on security every day  Oh, you can your eyes a little bit and you start to realize what all is out there. Maybe you can't control it all  Absolutely, but I'm glad somebody's out there at least showing that there is a value proposition to be made for taking a stand on this  So with I use lots of Google stuff and I like lots of Google stuff  I'm not a Google like tinfoil hat guy because they do deliver a lot of value for what I perceive them taking away  I think what drives people nuts is when there's opacity  To these processes and and even people who try to look in a bone up and do the right thing  It's it's difficult. It's difficult to have two-factor authentication on everything and do it  It's difficult to enter a military-grade password using an Apple four-way dingus on an Apple TV  Steve jobs live long enough to enter a three trillion year password using one of those things  So but I think it's in the trouble is there's in not to you know blame the media as most is lack says  But you know part of it is in the way that this is always presented cyber security and cyber threats and cyber problems like no  This is just our life now and there has to be some more sanity brought to like what we can all do on this together  So how much of the stuff that happens is just pure social engineering at what company you're gonna blame for that?  I don't know  I guess I just feel like there's still so much we could all do better and I'd like to see a company  In lip service, maybe not so great  But I do feel like Apple does care about that and they wouldn't be saying it unless they thought that they were doing it better  They have to find a way to differentiate themselves, so I'm not I wouldn't say I'm an Apple fanatic  I I apples the stuff that I use so I have to be cynical about it sometimes  And I don't know  I just I hope that we all get to a place where we can evolve and adapt  Beyond the way we've done stuff essentially for 50 years  I mean it's time for some really new thinking about stuff like name password pairs as the way we deal with life  And so anyway, yeah, I hope that's a conversation  We I would hate I guess what I want to say is I would hate to get to the point  We all just throw our hands up in the air and say nobody cares anymore  Because I mean I I care even if I can't be perfect at it  I still care and I hope that I hope that the generation the younger than us will care too  They're the ones that matter. We're all old. Nobody cares what we think  I hope they care and I hope they hold people to a higher standard of you know taking care of us

Transcript:  Let me wrap this up with two questions related one is how important is it to Apple that Apple Music succeeds is it in fact?  Gonna be enough to replace iTunes sales, which are clearly declining and  On the other side how how important to the music industry is it and what does the music industry do you?  Merlin gave us an article from a pitchfork that shows how little bands make and we know this from Pandora and Spotify

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember talking about the industry really no no no it's about artists. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I mean  If you're an artist you may have a hard time making money the traditional music industry ways  But like isn't it true that you can reach a bigger audience than ever before if you want to go on  YouTube or you want to you know I mean isn't that aren't there more ways to build a fan base and build a following  Yes, and ever before I mean you can't make money by selling CDs  But maybe you can make money by but nobody ever made money selling concert tickets

Start time: 2234.68
End time: 2246.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There was a small group of people that made a lot of money off CDs  It's always been a small group most artists even the huge artists made their money off of the tours and the merch on the tours  Certainly, so that's not much of a change that hasn't changed that much

Start time: 2247.60

Transcript:  We want artists to succeed and we want young people coming up as musicians as performers to be able to make a living  Yes, it would be nice and the it sounds like Dylan you're saying the good news is that is doable  You just can't do it the old way well

Start time: 2262.28
End time: 2279.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean well  It's easy for me to say I'm not trying to make a living as an as an artist of any kind  But it does seem like there are some possibilities  So for making a living as a musician if you're willing to look outside the sort of I need to get a big  Contract you're not a platinum artist probably not but yeah

Start time: 2279.80
End time: 2296.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean there's I mean  But this is this is not this this situation hasn't changed much in the last 30 years because I can remember interviewing people  Where all they wanted to be was like you know we're looking for a big record deal  And I'm like you need to talk to people with big record yes, because they're not making money  I could even records right yeah, you know I think it has changed in one way Patrick

Start time: 2296.76
End time: 2311.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it has changed which is that you can build a following on Twitter you would have but that's what I'm saying  You look at Zoe Keating like there are a lot of artists out there who have sort of they're not huge  They're not getting rich off their music, but they're supporting me. Thanks to you too

Start time: 2312.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean nobody's been rich off of YouTube  You know patrons been amazing you know patronus is supporting you know tech thing and there's all these other people doing it  And I'm not saying there's not a thousand other ways  but I find that ironic is there still people that want a record deal even when they know because  Everything is so public on the internet now  That they're probably not gonna make any money and get screwed by the record label  I mean I can remember having been you know I have issues with record companies because I've there's nothing more unpleasant in the world  Than being in a meeting with a pissed-off PR person for a record company at least you know  When when the record companies were making money hand over fist they were nasty they were vicious they were manipulative  No, they handle things you won't have access to this artist  If you don't put this artist on the cover of your magazine this month

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Companies in power tend to do stuff like they tend to do stuff like that and and you know and and they were making money that  The artists weren't seeing and it's always been like that you know and it's I think it's disingenuous  For people to blame say Spotify for them not making a lot of money when the record companies cashing larger checks and just not  Giving them a cut that's a contract problem. That's an industry problem, but yes  There's so many better ways to make music so so question one two was

Start time: 2379.16
End time: 2394.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Music industry so we all are in the affirmative that there is a future going forward  It's just not gonna be the way the record labels want it to be or maybe even Spotify Apple music and Pandora wanted to be  But artists do have an opportunity if they know how to work the system properly right and I don't think and when all sudden done

Transcript:  It's all that essential to Apple that Apple music do well, so that's the second  Spotify Spotify definitely has to figure out music because if it doesn't have that it has very little for Apple  I mean music was great to get people to buy iPods in the first place  The great thing about the iPhone now is it's a great platform for all these third-party music services  and I'm still buying Apple's hardware and  Apple is never gonna be all that dependent on revenue from selling music so you could probably make the case that it's more important for

I think the professional iPad might be something to look at  I think the Apple watch has some potential. All right, we're gonna that's anything Merlin one last final word on the  Apple event anything else to say are you a fan of Drake? Oh

Start time: 2473.66
End time: 2542.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huge fan. Yeah, I'm just happy that he knows so many famous people  I agree with you guys. I don't think I don't I don't see I don't know  I don't know anything about business, but I don't see how this needs to happen for Apple  It sounds like another one of those things where somebody up in the peanut gallery is screaming about what Apple has to do in order to  Be successful  Look at what they've done well with and what they what they have done  Well with is finding a way to take something start with something that everybody thought was a lost cause  Find a way to make it beautiful sexy and costly find the people who want that and then give them a way to buy  Huge amounts of more stuff with that  So I think the thing is I mean having a commodity music service where you're competing on price  That does not feel like Apple to me. So I think I think that's why I feel like this really feels like an out-of-left-field  Thing I don't know. I don't think that's a big part  They were part of the undoing of the way the music industry worked and now I think that's probably harming them a little bit  Too. Yeah truth is though. They don't have to sell I thought it's not the most important thing now  They're selling iPhones and they want you buy an apps, right?  so anyway  I'd love to be back sometime to talk about the Apple TV because I  Think that's a really interesting place.

Transcript:  Really fire TV really does fly. I love my shield and you know  The thing is that when I talk to my friends who have just an Apple TV that sounds really crazy  Like how could there be a performance difference and it's like well the fact that it like it wakes like the second you hit it  It's crazy. But anyway all that aside. It's just that I don't know  I just feel like it's a there's a big opportunity out there for some kind of a device  Where I sometimes feel like again, I said this on another show recently, but I feel like sometimes our biggest  Constraint of mind is that we call it an Apple TV  We think of it  I mean we became to know this little puck as a way to buy things on the iTunes  That's what it's become and and that's I think something different is gonna happen with that and maybe it gets mixed in with a router  Maybe who knows what it could be?  But I guess you know my if I had many you know what?  It's been a while since I've done a done a really dumb prediction on on a twitch show  My dumb prediction is gonna be that they're gonna have an amazing pivot in the next two years  Where they their company that has typically said we'll take it in the shorts on content in order to make it up in hardware  There's a part of me that wonders if they'll take it in the shorts on hardware in order to make it up on content when it  Comes to things like movies and apps  So I would love to see a future in two years where you could walk into a Walgreens and pick up whatever  Replaces the Apple TV take it with you anywhere have a service that's portable like Mary  Marriott just announced the service where you can get your Netflix inside your room  You know if they really are gonna move this stuff into the cloud  The Apple TV just becomes the way that it gets from the tube onto your TV  But that up store becomes so important in that scenario that said having a device where you could do home kit stuff  Would be would just be giant. It just seems like the most obvious thing in the world  So if any like one or two of those things are what was planned or what is being planned for the Apple TV  I'm not surprised that it's taking a while because that's a whole lot of stuff in a company that has not done great with services  In the past so

I mean  Only thing less his job really is to do is make sure that the money's there  Yes, how many billions are you gonna give us speaking which I I'm stunned by what you just told us Merlin that  Marriott which makes a ton of money on in-room entertainment mostly porno is gonna let you watch your Netflix  They must have been forced into that there's no way I mean they're giving up why would I ever rent a $20 movie on

Transcript:  Okay, have you read any of the articles about how they how many hotels are not doing mini bars and in in their rooms anymore  Why is that?  There I've read a couple things about it.

Transcript:  Laptop so but somebody wrote this like comprehensive history of the mini bar and what's happened to it over the years  As you know you yeah, you've certainly done the thing where you're like go do I want this and you move it around you get  Charged. Yeah, but basically the idea is that it's it's not nearly as profitable as you would guess it takes a lot of resources  I mean hotels are pretty under resourced  In a lot of ways. It's very costly to keep up. They lose a lot of money on it  They have they end up having to give a lot of money back on refunds and stuff like that  I guess what I'm wondering is like it seems like selling movies in a room would be would would be pure profit  But maybe the margins on that are not that great

Start time: 3277.42
End time: 3292.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, the systems were always really clunky and and always almost always third party. It's funny. Like I did a quick searchers, you know  2010 2010 LA Times article talking about how hotel revenue from phone calls and in-room movies was drying up  Here's the economy

Transcript:  It's it's funny like this this LA Times article revenue collected by US hotels from phone calls dropped to an average of a hundred seventy eight dollars per  Room in 2009 from  1252 in 1999 well so an 86% drop part of the problem is theft

Start time: 3363.36
End time: 3415.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then what they did was that I remember when they started doing this as a drinker  When they started making it so that if you even move the thing they would charge you  Yeah  And if you don't check your bill people don't check the bill and they there'll be all this stuff on there and they had to do  These cheese charge backs anyway once again. I there's a reason I am NOT in the corner office, but  But I mean there's I think that it feels like the industry  There's always ways they're trying to make a buck but more and more if as a occasional traveler  It feels like they're really trying to save money  Like if there's not a clear winner and a way to like make pure profit is really more about  Minimizing costs like have you noticed like not selling Jerry Seinfeld? What's the deal with garbage cans?  Is it just me or like is there like one tiny garbage can for the entire room there is?  Yeah, well there must be a reason I bet there's an economic reason for that  They probably don't want they want to clean that room and flip it around as soon as possible because that means fewer staff  You know, I don't think hotels do as well as it seems anyway

Transcript:  Well, this is like the smaller hotels in Vegas seem like a cost-saving by the way  Well, it depends on this it's it's funny though, but for the larger hotels  It's a big deal for the smaller hotels in Vegas  it turns out like they the the people are brought in their independent contractors and  They're the number if they step into your room and and give you towels  They make like three dollars if they're not allowed in the room  They make nothing and there's this there's a there's a person watching and queuing them see which room they go into  In the case of the larger hotels when you have in Vegas  It'll go from 80% occupancy during CES and maybe spend 80% of its time at 20% occupancy  Keeping staff online for that is a nightmare  So in that case robots may actually be less expensive and robots don't expect retirement that'll have health insurance policies  You know, it's usually yeah, but I bet the tiny garbage cans is probably about minimizing the amount they pay  Just because people I've walked into a hotel room with somebody had like emptied out the back of their entire truck into the garbage

Start time: 3484.74
End time: 3493.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why I think you'd want garbage cans to encourage people to take the trash and put it in a garbage can if you don't  Give me enough garbage cans. I'm gonna leave it on the floor. I

Why why do we not have more garbage cans here in the park because it seems to me that all the high school kids who?  Are monsters throw all their trash and swisher sweet things on the ground  Wouldn't it be  You know like a nice thing for the park if we had more garbage cans  Leave them on the path on the path people can put the garbage in them and she goes  No, we just have to empty those  The city gets the switch your sweet stuff there's a reason I'm not on City Council  It seems to me that would be easier than picking it up off the ground later.

Transcript:  I'm so deeply out of the loop. I did I did a talk at Twitter about meetings. You can find somewhere on the internet  Probably about two three years ago and I remember going in there and I was something like yeah  So this must be really crazy like, you know, really difficult you're growing like yeah  Yeah, like in January we had 150 people and then in that fall they had 300 people and now today  I mean how many do you guys follow this? How much do they have? How many people they have today? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They were 30 people for an amazingly long time. Yeah. Yeah, so I I don't feel like dick did anything wrong  In fact to me he was of all the CEOs the one who was most interactive with his its users  It was most forthright. He was the guy wrote the memo said we screwed up  We're gonna do better when when harassment became a problem. Thanks to  Robin Williams daughter who was basically chased from Twitter. He said that's our fault and we're gonna fix it and I admired it from for that  Wallstreet's problem is that Twitter is not growing as fast as it used to they wanted to be Facebook and it's not making money

Start time: 3757.14
End time: 3784.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's losing money. I mean, that's the real issue grows Twitter's actually growing pretty quickly and it's doing you know in terms of  Metrics it's not bad for being a distant number two to Facebook  Yeah, but in terms of revenue, I mean the question is like they could be doing it could be making so much more money  they could be doing such a better job of engaging people and keeping them sticking around and  And I think Wall Street is just like, you know, we've had too many  lackluster quarter quarters and

Start time: 3786.50
End time: 3815.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And we've had enough by the way, here's the Jack Dorsey's beard account  It's it really does exist  But it's funny because it feels like Twitter has kind of cracked the monetization nut. They've got these promoted  Accounts, they've got I see an ad now every time I look at Twitter on the web. I see this is a New York Times  promoted a tweet so that's an ad  Why can't they monetize they seem like they have a very kind of a great monetization strategy?

Start time: 3817.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think I think that's it. I mean you they're almost overdoing it in in promoted tweets  I see way too many in my stream  Yeah  I think the issue they have is one with engagement and just getting people to stick around and to come back and you know  Chris Saka who is one of their big shareholders one of their big investors from early on penned this gigantic  10,000 word essay  This week about all the things that Twitter could do better and it's it's way too long  But his point is that they could do much better engagement and it's sort of building around events, right?  So like you're watching the Warriors play  You know the Cavs and in the NBA finals and like if you want to actually do that right now  You have to figure out which hashtags to follow you have to like there's a handful of them  There's some key accounts you have to follow  You have to set it all up and you have to kind of be a power user  To actually make use of what's going on on Twitter around a sporting event, right?  And so they could they could way easily put together these channels where people could just be like, hey the playoffs are on tonight  Let me you know  Follow this channel on Twitter while I'm watching the game and it will enrich the experience  And they just haven't done a lot of that kind of thing to bring people in and get them engaged who are not power  Users like you know, like all of us talking right here, right?

Maybe that's just because it's a habit, but I go right to Twitter  That's where the conversation breaking news. Yeah. Yeah, that's standing for that now  You don't stay there  You don't get you know, but if you want to know what's going on when Ferguson was hot Twitter was where it was you would find out?  about it  Probably better than CNN effect that for a long time CNN would just report Twitter until they don't like got anything better  Till AP had it  Well, that would be sad, I mean, I don't know why I so closely associate you with Twitter Merlin, but I do

Transcript:  Well, I was a I was a I was a cool. I originally was a very early adopter  Yeah, you know, I was well, I was yeah  I mean I was one of the very very first users and then I demanded they take my this is that couldn't was just texts and  SMS and I was getting SMS at 5 in the morning about somebody's great run and I was like  That's back in was back. It was just Twitter  But no, I've enjoyed it a lot. I've met a lot of really good friends through it  I don't have anything really to offer here except except the most obvious kinds of observations  Which is you know, what makes Twitter great is all the stuff that you can easily corrupt by trying to  And I'm not don't see by trying to make money with it  But there's so many things where even just a tenuous bit of corruption about the simplicity of Twitter  Totally screws up huge aspects of why people like it  I mean, I think I think the thing that has made Twitter Twitter are just the fact the rules are simple, right?  It's you get 140 characters and of course that's changed now  There's cards and there's different stuff in and out of band that you know, I'll add more flexibility  But the rules are still pretty simple. You follow who you want. They follow you if they want there's 140 characters and  You get to decide how much you want to be involved in any aspect of it  Like why is Twitter different from email?  Because you don't really have to read Twitter in the same way that you have to read your email and like you say I mean  For us it's like, you know  If we have the slightest inkling whether there might be an earthquake  Well, that'll be on SF gate in two hours, you know, I have some celebrity bikini story  But like if I want to find out there's an earthquake I'll go straight to Twitter  I guess all I'm saying is like, you know and over time  I think they've actually done a pretty pretty good job of not screwing that up in a thousand ways  They could have screwed it up. That sounds like I'm damning them with faint praise. I'm really I'm really happy  I'm the reason I'm still there and the reason I see my friends are still there is it has not been corrupted in a super  Weird way. Yeah  And but you know, like you say when you get these kind of weird mystery meat things with like, you know  Did I really follow that person? Like why is this here? What is what does this mean?  I don't I don't know. I don't know what the answer is. I have to say as I sit here  I don't understand why Google hasn't bought them three times over  it just seems like the most obvious fit in the world so many of the folks at Twitter are Google alumna and  I guess I'm just kind of blown away that that hasn't happened yet. I'm surprised they've made it this why would Google want them?

The reason why I like it  Nobody has to use  Nobody has to use Twitter the same way nobody know two people have to use it that way and for folks like me  It really the constraints of Twitter are what made it interesting like app.net should have been a giant hit  But I don't I don't want to see something with that many characters  I like this, you know  And then you know and if you want to follow people who are doing like my commentary part 7 of 85  It's like I don't follow that but if you want to that works great for some people aren't Andreessen is like that

They were  Okay, we got it  We got to raise some money for this site  Whatever it's called and they're starting to like come on send us some Bitcoin and they're all running around going like wait  How does Bitcoin work again?

Transcript:  One thing that makes this challenging in any growing community is you know  If you ask anybody about what they believe in everybody's gonna say something that sounds really good  You're gonna say yeah, I believe in free speech like because because we do I think part of the question becomes  I mean I'll speak for myself  There was a time for example where I decided on a pretty popular side of mine back in the day  That I just wasn't gonna I couldn't do the comment thing anymore  People were actually by and large fantastic and really great and some of the best commenters in the world came to 43 folders  Like it was a great community  We had a forum  But I kind of got to a point where I think a lot of people get to which is  You get kind of damned by your own success in some ways where once a place gets big enough  There's gonna be a whole bunch of different people there. You got a whole different scale issues  I mean go talk to Matt Howey talk to anybody who's tried to run a rusty  He may have tried to run it like a big site and you have fundamentally different problems when you add a zero or a couple  Zeros to the number of people that are out there. Here's here's I think one heart one problem. That's the heart of this  This does not solve the problem  But I think it helps to identify the problem if you've got a site that you and three of your friends write for you  Let's say you share a tumblr  There's this sense of what I'm gonna call the living room effect where you go  Oh, this is our place like this is our living room and we we don't drop a deuce on the couch  Like we treat this as a place that we're gonna have respect for you're welcome  Please don't pinch a loaf on the couch, we don't even need a sign for that  We just know the problem is like when you get to a place that has ten thousand or twenty thousand or however many thousand people  Everybody still feels like it's their living room  So on the one hand there's one group of people who say hey  Can we try to like use a coaster here and take care of this and other people going you can't tell me what to  Do in my own house?  Because every if you listen to what's behind what a lot of those folks are saying whether I personally agree with them or not  It's the same sentiment. We've heard from a lot of people which was we heard of this with dig however many years ago  Hey, we're the ones who made this site  You know being provocative about telling us what we can do here is is that beyond the pale  In their point of view because now it's our living room. It's your living room  You know, like, you know, you can't just call this your place by Fiat  We're the ones who built it you would not even have anybody to throw off of here if it weren't for us  So like I say, I don't think that solves the problem  But I think it helps frame the question whenever we try to understand how somebody feels about these things  It helps to remember that also everybody thinks some places their living room and read it more than most places was defined by having
