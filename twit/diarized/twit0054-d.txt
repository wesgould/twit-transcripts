Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is TWiT This Week in Tech, episode 54 from May 14th, 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we have an unusual panel today once again we're glad to welcome back John C.  Dvorak. Where were you last week John? I was in Brazil. Oh no, last week. You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what? I missed the show because I just lost track of the day. Oh that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's okay. Next time all. Brazil is a better story. I was in Brazil the week  before. That was two weeks ago. Well we're glad to have you back John C. Dvorak of course at  Dvorak.org slash blog. Mr. Patrick Norton from DLTV he's back again too. Good to  have you back. We were both much missed. People said hey it's not TWiT without

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John and Patrick. Oh well we argue together so well. Yeah that's sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We've got Jen Cutter with us in honor of E3. She's been on once before. She of  course hosts OpenAlpha.TV which is a great video game oriented podcast. You  get more than that. Of course it comes on the call for help regularly in Canada  showing us her hacks. She was at E3 and she's talking to us from Southern  California. Hi Jen. Hey Leo, good to be back. Welcome back and Al Lowe is here and I  know you know that name. He's the guy who created Leisure Suit Larry. One of one  of the most famous game designers in the world. He was at E3 announcing his new  game Sam Swade and we'll talk about that in a little bit. Al it's good to have you  on the panel. Well thank you. So real quickly since Jen and Al were there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  your thoughts on E3. What was the big story at E3 Jen? I think far and away for me and a lot of others was definitely the Nintendo Wii. Just finally getting to play it and see it in action and wave around the controller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really the Wii stole thunder from the Xbox 360. I guess there wasn't much to say about the Xbox 360. It's been out for almost a year and PlayStation 3 which is kind of a surprise. Al do you agree with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Al do you agree? Does the Wii get you excited? The Wii went in as the underdog and came out as the winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah kind of a surprise. What made the Wii so interesting to the attendees Al?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well I think the controller, I think the integration of the software with the  machine, just the general buzz about the whole thing. Everyone that I talked with

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  said that was the big story. Isn't that funny? If you'd asked me a year ago is Nintendo out of the game? In fact I think I might even have said this. It's now between Microsoft and Sony and nobody cares about Nintendo anymore.  I did say it and a number of people said oh wait a minute the DS is a great product. Jen did you ever count Nintendo out or was I just misguided?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I'm one of the people I started playing games on television and then NES so I do have a soft spot for Nintendo but the DS had been going strong since pretty much day one and the Wii is kind of capturing that same market of people who don't really play video games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does that surprise you John that Nintendo is still in the game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well you know I actually stayed pretty close with this company and I was a fan of the DS when it first came out.  I remember that.  At first I thought it was a little bigger than it could have been but then I realized that it had all this potential with this touch pad. You thought it wasn't even doing well I think at one point for some reason.  But this thing has been a runaway success and these guys, these Nintendo folks have done a wonderful job of coming up with new concepts which nobody else seems to be doing.  If you looked at the PlayStation versus the Xbox you have updates of football games and updates of race car games and yeah they look a lot better but this is the same old stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think maybe it comes back to, and Al you can probably comment on this, gameplay versus how it looks. A great looking game will lose out to a great playing game every time. Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not true every time. No I think many people fall for graphics.  Yeah you see the graphics and you just fall for it. However I think the second game sold is dependent upon gameplay.  Oh that's good.  In other words you only fooled once.  Right exactly. So a lot of people fall for it.  Yeah on that note I thought John Woo's Stranglehold looked tremendous from Midway, a game from Midway for 360 and Crysis too.  Both those games were just killer graphics but the same gameplay that you've seen many times before.  So are they going to sell? Yeah I'm sure they will. But will they be a breakaway hit? No and I think the other games that are original have a chance to break away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't there a good market though now for especially good looking games because we're starting to see these machines hook up to HDTVs and people want to show off what they've got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely. I know games don't look as good on TVs as they do on high def TVs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well there's also one other element which, there's another element to the HD thing. If you have like a big projector or something and you run one of these, because we've done this here.  You run a 360 game through the HD system and you can get a split screen on a race car game which is actually usable by two players because you can really see something.  That's true otherwise it's useless. It's useless and it's too small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's an issue anyway. Are any of these machines going to have, remember what was that, the game length idea where you would have multiple machines and multiple screens and you could play against each other that way?  I guess that's what online gaming really is.  I think that's called online.  That's what live is all about. And that's one of the things all three game machines are focused on is this online all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well not only the three game machines but now Microsoft is integrating PC games against Xbox 360 games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's a big hit for Microsoft because there's one area where they have a real lead is in PC gaming.  If they can take that success in PC gaming, hook them up with the Xbox 360 gamers, I think that makes their market a lot more attractive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah I think far and away really. Shadowrun is the first game that's really going to take advantage of this live anywhere service so that the controller players can finally play against keyboard and mouse and see who's going to win.  But it isn't going to launch until later this year because it's dependent on Vista. So you have to wait for Vista to come out, get that running, then get Shadowrun, then you can play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft still has a big head start against Sony specifically for anything online.  It looks like, I mean from people who, you guys can tell me if I'm wrong here, but according to everybody who looks at this carefully, they say Microsoft really is set up to take advantage of online where Sony is still kind of a kludge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah well Xbox has the huge advantage having come from their first generation that had the live service. So now they're just building upon that while Sony's trying to catch up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did Sony have anything important to announce? I mean they had a big press conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah they did. They announced the price, they announced the date, and they spent an awful lot of time talking about SingStar which is bigger in Europe than it is here because here it doesn't exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is SingStar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's basically like a more advanced version of Karaoke Revolution with a lot of licensed music.  I'm excited.  Yeah I know, I think I've been talking about how the menus and Gran Turismo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Al was being sarcastic. Are you really excited at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When is Karaoke dead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually that was Patrick Al.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Al's enough of a gentleman to hold his tongue on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Al fell asleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well Dance Dance Revolution is huge. I understand what Dance Dance Revolution is. What is Karaoke Revolution? Is that the same idea? You're competing against each other in karaoke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah it's the same kind of idea. You can actually use a dance pad and the mic at the same time for a revolution party.  But yeah it basically just keeps track of your pitch more than the actual notes because a lot of people can't sing but they can still play this game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know that CBS is doing a morning television show called Dance Dance Revolution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know I'm actually kind of happy about that because anything that gets kids active and moving around I will hardly support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess you might be right on that.  Patrick do you play any games? Is this conversation completely beyond you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've actually played up a PSP and was so terminally disappointed with the games on that I just gave up on gaming again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know I have a PSP too and I really was excited. I thought this is going to be the greatest thing.  Compared to the DS it doesn't seem to be getting any traction. Is that right?  Yeah that's the general consensus.  Maybe that's what's going to kill PlayStation 3. Is it $600?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think the PSP is...oh no! Squik Toy!

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Squik Toy returns. Perfectly timed I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The price of the PSP wouldn't be so bad if you were looking left and right and going look at all these amazing games.  Which is everybody that's got a Nintendo DS is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah I have to be really careful with games because I'll sit down and play something and look up and it will be 14 hours later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll keep this in mind if you're going to make a game that can't consume our lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually I want to know...I looked up some pictures. Is that a wedgie being given in Sam's Way down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The first place of a wedgie in a first person shooter goes to Al Lowe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As someone who nearly flunked out of college thanks to Al in my sophomore year, I want to know.  I'm willing to invest in this one and risk my marriage and my career if I can give people wedgies in it. It just looks like fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well not only wedgies but uber wedgies.  Super atomic wedgies!  Super atomic wedgies!  What we did was look at action gaming and try to take a different approach and not do the same old thing that you've done before.  So everywhere there's violence in a game we just substituted laughs.  I think that sounds great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's still the kind of thing where there's a lot of puzzles and challenges and things you've got to figure out and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah absolutely but it's not an adventure game.  There's no inventory, there's no mix and match, there's none of that stuff.  It's a detective game but it's not one where you have to take notes and figure out who did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like a game that's like that. It's fun to play but there's stuff going on and you have to use your mind.  But it's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well we looked around for a genre to put it in and we came up with action comedy because there was no genre.  So that's what we're calling it. We're calling it an action comedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm excited about Spore. We talked about it a little bit last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am too. That's the game that I'm looking forward to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, of course, the guy who did The Sims, SimCity, really an amazing designer in terms of simulation games is doing this game where you start as a multi-celled creature, actually a single-celled creature, and you create and then you eventually conquer the stars.  Did they, Janet, show any more about Spore or talk any more about Spore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they had a theater and just showed some amazing gameplay footage.  You could really see how it just covered, the progression is really amazing, how you start and it's this 2D game and it turns into this 3D game and it turns into a pseudo-MMO. I'm really looking forward to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He calls it a massively single-player online game. I'm not sure what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well yeah, apparently everyone else who's playing winds up making these contributions to the world.  So even though your world looks like one thing, it's going to be altered by what other players are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So basically all of the individual games add up to the gaming environment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Something like that, yeah. I'm still trying to figure it all out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it was not at first. I thought you built your world and your environment and then you could go off and explore other people's and they could come explore yours. That was pretty far into the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you're not fighting against each other. You're not trying to conquer their world.  I think you can fight against each other.  Interesting, because Sam Swade isn't going to come out for a year, right?  Right.  Same thing with Spore now. It's sometime in 2007.  And yet when I look at the screenshots, these things are very advanced. What takes so long?  It seems like, Spore especially, it seems like it's almost done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think a game like Spore must have some pretty intensive QA to go through, just to keep track of everything and all the monsters you can create and all the pathfinding.  The bug testing.  Yeah, the motions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, more than that, I think the gameplay balancing on that game would be a tremendous project. I could see allocating a year's work just for balancing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the engine may be done, the art and the collateral might be done, but they're still figuring out how the game plays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's all the algorithms that determine whether or not you're being successful.  Just like in The Sims, you know, there's all those rules that you have to make up as you play. That's not graphics. That's not the engine.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's just balance.  Wow, that's quite an achievement. So even as a competitor and a game designer yourself, Al, you can respect what Will is up to.  Oh, absolutely.  You probably more than many understand what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I first saw that video, I thought he was crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding. Yeah, I mean, that's maybe a masterwork, maybe his life work, you know, that's what he's been leading up to all this time.  I believe that.  And it's going to ruin my life because like Patrick, I'm going to, you know, of course, I can't drop out of school now.  I don't know what I'm...  There was a three or four week period when the podcast production slowed down considerably when I played World of Warcraft.  I have a feeling the same thing might happen when sport comes out.  It's going to be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to...  Well, you haven't gotten to, Leo, you haven't gotten on the DS's that new brain game that comes on the DS yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I want to get that. Tell me about that. That sounds really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is going to be everybody's worst nightmare in terms of addictions. I'm telling you right now.  Really? Have you played it?  Yeah, I have. I played it, actually a demo version, but I got...  When Nintendo was doing a dog and pony show, I got to take a run at it and it's finally been released and I have a copy.  And everybody in the family is like playing it all the time. My wife can't get off of the thing if she's on it.  She has to actually leave the house.  But she was kind of addicted to Tetris too. She just gets into these things.  Kind of like Patrick, I believe, you know, where you just get involved in the thing and you just can't stop playing it.  What this thing is supposed to do, of course, is improve your IQ.  So that's even better. You feel like you're actually doing something important.  Yeah, you're accomplishing something.  So I have actually avoided it as long as I can.  Now, this is for the DS. This is not for the Wii or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Avoided the DS or avoided the intelligence increasing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm already an idiot. I don't need to be shown, you know, I don't need to be any smarter.  It turns out to be kind of stupid helps a lot in the job I have.  A writer, you know, you don't if you have too much brains, you tend to write boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I need this because I feel my mind is going. I feel like Hal in 2001.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we felt that way about you too, Leo.  Yeah, Daisy, Daisy.  I don't think you're going to find that this is going to be a problematic game for you. I'm telling you.  Have you played it, Alan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did. I found the only way I could beat the color naming thing where they put up the word yellow in blue color.  And I'm supposed to say blue, even though the word says yellow.  Oh, that's ridiculous.  It was terrible. I found the only way I could win at that or not win, but at least get my age down below 80 was to turn the machine upside down and unfocus my eyes.  So I can read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're showing your brains there.  I guess that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's that trick. And then you can also put just a sheet of papers.  You can only see like the top little bit of the word and not the entire thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sounds like you're all very good at cheating at this game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's probably part of it. My son said, or my youngest son said that he's got some memory tricks that he's used and has improved his score quite a bit. He's down to 30 or something like that.  But I should mention to people out there who get a hold of this game that when I was looking at it, the Nintendo folks themselves say that almost everybody gets a score of 80 when they first attempt to play this.  So your brain age is 80 when you start.  Right. And it's not a Bertrand Russell 80, I don't believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But what is?  It's more like a Pablo Casals.  It's more like a Grandpa Simpson 80, I think.  Exactly.  Where's my soup? Where's my pants?  Brainage.com. So would you say, all right, I'm going to ask it now, should I buy a Nintendo DS just to play Brainage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you should buy a Nintendo DS because it's really a great little machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Definitely. Just wait for the DS Lite to come out because it's quite an amazing improvement.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah, far and away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When will that be out?  I believe it's like June 11th. I wish they could have brought it out at the same time as the new Super Mario, but they just couldn't meet the quantity so they had to push it back.  I think so, yeah. Just the screen brightness, the battery life. I like the new placement of the buttons in the microphone, which was very handy for Brainage because you're going to need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See, I had a DS when it first came out and I was underwhelmed. My son was underwhelmed, so I didn't hold on to it.  But now there's something for me to play besides Nintendo dogs.  So Nintendo's back, baby. We thought they were history.  Moving on to the actual tech news of the day. We'll do a soft segue because it is still a game story.  A judge in San Francisco heard hearings on Friday to overturn California's law against selling violent video games to minors.  Now this law never went into effect. It was signed by Governor Schwarzenegger. It's supposed to go into effect January 1st.  Illinois, Washington State, I think Michigan have a similar law, all of which the courts have thrown out.  The idea is that if the violence against humans is heinous and atrocious and serious, that the game cannot be sold to minors.  The judge said that it violates the minors' First Amendment rights.  When did minors start having First Amendment rights again?  I'm surprised to hear that. I know. Especially how is fighting a violent video game free speech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'd also like to say, as somebody who remembers having free speech issues in his high school before I get a bunch of emails from angry teenagers,  the Bill of Rights is suspended inside of high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They say you can't wear whatever you want on a t-shirt. You can't. No, of course.  Anyway, this judge said the only thing that would keep this law in effect is if there is compelling evidence that violent video games create violent kids.  And I think actually all the evidence is to the contrary, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you guys are confusing school rights with age rights or things.  I know that teenagers that have put up websites that have been opposed to local schools or to their school have been upheld under freedom of speech.  But now you're right, you can't wear any t-shirt at school because that violates a school regulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you don't have rights in school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you can't play violent video games in school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, well that would make sense. Nobody's protecting that right.  All right, well that makes sense. Okay, I feel much better now.  John, you had a story you wanted to mention. Is that the cab driver?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I talked about this before, which is, you know, if you can, there's no evidence to show that playing violent games makes you violent,  but it doesn't mean that if you're already predisposed to being violent that you won't be, you know, either it may hasten your predilection or who knows what.  But generally speaking, these things are simulations and they do train you if nothing else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So watching The Office will make me a worse boss?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Only if you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're watching The Office, not playing The Office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if there was an office game, you could be a worse manager as a result of playing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, there's a lot, there used to be a fad about, I don't know, mind me, 15 years ago, there was a whole bunch of these office simulations that came out.  Oh, God.  How boring.  Which indeed were designed to teach you how to do mergers and acquisitions and stuff like that.  I can't imagine anything worse.  Yeah.  It all stemmed from that, remember that game that came out some years ago, I think it was just at the end of the games where they were all, where you do a lot of text,  which was, you floated around the universe and you collected stuff and then you started a business and does anybody remember that game?  Was it a game of some sort, like a game of some sort?  Homeworld?  Like an adventure game of some sort.  But that, that I think triggered a slew of these business simulations.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Were you a telephone sanitizer in the game?  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure that playing Trauma Center in the DS does not make me a doctor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dude, I play a lot of Mortal Kombat, I'm going to get into a bar fight.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If I ever get a sucking chest wound while doing call for help, Jen, I will be, I'll immediately call on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll be on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't care, I'm calling on her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Show us what you've taught us.  I'd dial 911 first, not to take anything away from your medical skills, Jen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This isn't really a news story, but I had to comment on the, this is the top story in Dvorak's blog right now, dvorak.org slash blog.  The cab driver who's pulled in to do an interview in the BBC, what happened there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the funniest thing I've seen, but if anybody who is an Anglophile likes to go to England and go to the Haymarket Theatre and watch Farsas,  this is like a classic English Farsas that you would be impossible to write,  but apparently some cab driver from Ghana or some French Congo or some place was standing out in front of the studios,  and he was going to take Guy Cuney, who's a very famous journalist out of England,  he was going to take him home after he did the interview because it was supposed to be around him.  And I guess somebody came out and said Guy Cuney, you know, looking for him,  and this guy waved his hands thinking he was going to pick Guy Cuney up.  The guy rushed him into the office, put a badge on him that said Guy Cuney,  so when Guy Cuney was like called up to do the show, somebody looked around and saw this guy who can barely speak English,  and said Guy Cuney, and he says, yeah, yeah, Guy Cuney, because he's going to give Guy Cuney a ride.  He's on the stage doing the interview, but you've got to watch the video because when the guy is sitting there,  I mean I have a link to the video on my site, you click on it, and the guy has this crazy look on his face,  bites his lip, looks around, and he says, okay, I'll be Guy Cuney, and he does this interview as an expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're talking about Apple, does he say anything coherent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At one point he does, about halfway through, the woman says something and the guy says exactly,  and then he goes on to buy internet cafes, it's hilarious.  But he's nicely dressed.  The funniest part of this is that Guy was in the green room the whole time watching this.  Oh my God, why did he come running out?  Well, apparently it was not trivial to get onto the stage from the green room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's live TV at its best.  As far as I know, we never did that on the screensavers, but it could well have happened.  Actually, there was one incidence.  There was? Of somebody appearing on the screensavers that wasn't who they said they were?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but it's fun to make that joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You just try to figure out who it was.  So somebody who was on the screensavers a number of times, Adrian Lamo is in the news again.  Remember, he was the, they call him a grey hat hacker.  He was the guy who would break into banks and so forth to demonstrate their bad security.  And immediately, he wouldn't do anything, he would immediately show the bank, look how easy it was to get in.  He never had a place of residence, he slept on his friends' couches, he was always mobile, they finally caught up to him.  They did a little plea bargain to one count of computer crimes and got a felony conviction of six months detention in his parents' home  and two years of probation.  Apparently, I didn't know this, but as a condition of probation for a federal crime like that, you have to give them a sample of your DNA, a blood sample, and he's refused to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he's refused to give them blood. He's off, he's been willing to do other forms of DNA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can take my hair, but I won't give you blood.  So it's not really a privacy issue then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he's claiming it's a religion issue. Basically, he says he has religious issues against giving blood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there are religions where that is considered not acceptable.  Interesting. And why don't they just take a hair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the law is that he's supposed to give blood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how they're supposed to get the sample is by a blood sample.  The DNA sample is supposed to come from a blood sample.  So his parole officer is apparently filed that he's violated his parole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I support him because after all, he's not likely to commit a crime where DNA evidence is going to become involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just like to build up the database in any way they can so they can have everybody's number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My father-in-law had... you can go to commercial services and get DNA analysis, and he did this.  And he's really excited about it, and he sent us all the paperwork, and you can tell who you've got, what you're descended from and stuff.  But the problem is there isn't a very big database.  This company can only compare it to other people who have submitted data, and they're kind of tied to what the other people have said.  So my father-in-law, some of his genes match two Israelis.  So it's like, do you have Arab genes?  Well, probably not. It's probably these Israelis are from Scotland, but they self-identify as Israelis.  So it's completely useless. So I can see why you might want to build a big database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's an interesting database. It was originally the combined DNA index system. I think it was called CODIS.  And in 2004, it was expanded from violent criminals and sexual predators to every convicted...  What's it say? All newly convicted federal felons, including drug offenders and white-collar criminals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do they take DNA from... if you served in the armed forces, do they take DNA from all the servicemen?  I mean, I would think that would be helpful in identifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but whether they do or not, Leo, I'm sure anyone listening to this podcast will think that's a great idea.  Oh, I'm sorry I mentioned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I mean, a dog tag isn't always the only way to identify somebody, right?  Yeah, that's true.  If it weren't for DNA, I don't think many of the victims of the World Trade Center bombing would be identified.  Oh, well, that's a real downer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's another depressing story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you see Flight 93?  I will not go see that. I will not go see that. That's just too sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did anybody see the Bird Flu movie?  There's a movie about the Bird Flu?  Oh, it was like last week or something and it was just apparently...  Terrifying.  Every comedy show on TV made fun of it. Apparently, the thing was just a ludicrous joke.  So bad.  Yeah, well, I mean, you know, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You've talked about the Bird Flu on Cranky Geeks, I know. Is it inevitable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stories on Bird Flu on the blog, too, but now it's become so popular to talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like Killer B's, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe a little more popular than that.  You've got the Martin Sargent skewing on the Killer B's concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, he really went off on Killer B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Over and over again. Martin is terrified of Killer B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, now he's got something else to be afraid of.  Avian Flu.  Apple's no longer afraid of two things, the Beatles and France.  Apple won their case in British court.  The Beatles were suing, saying the use of the Apple logo on the iTunes store  infringes the Apple Corps copyright.  The court said, no, no, get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've been nicking poor Apple for years with these chicken lawsuits.  I'm glad Apple finally won one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They won it. And the judge said, you know, there's no...  Apple sells music. The Beatles make music. People know the difference.  I think it's about time.  Apple also kind of won in France where that law,  the controversial copyright bill that would force Apple, among others,  to open up their copy protection technologies to competitors  was amended with a way that the Apple could keep the copy protection secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it still wants them to be interoperable,  but it's allowing them to keep the copying scheme private.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apple would only show it to Bill Gates for five seconds,  and then that'd be it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, everybody could just go to DVD John,  because he's cracked all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right.  So I guess Apple will stay in France, maybe.  I imagine that was a compromise that Apple had some input on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I understood it was a bunch of lobbyists that got the French to cave in.  Well, the lobbyists from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apple.  Apple, right. That's what I meant.  Not a negotiation. They lobbied.  Wow, this is going downhill fast. How about this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we really have to come up with some real stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Home recording made legal in Australia.  You mean it hasn't been?  Music fans will be able to legally record their CD collections on iPods and MP3 players.  Apparently it hasn't been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aussies have some brutal copy protection laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't rip a CD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apparently there will be new enforcement measures to combat piracy,  so it's kind of one of those trade-off bills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they also made parody and satire legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's about time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Using copyright material for parody or satire.  Well, it's funny, because in theory now, if you ripped your entire CD collection...  You'd go to jail.  Yeah, and Warner Brothers snuck into your house and found that out.  They could sue the bejesus out of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting, because I think the record companies in the states also want that to be the case.  I think they really feel like it should be illegal to rip a CD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if they could, they'd get first sale repealed,  so it would be illegal for you to resell your CDs or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just keep buying it. That's the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does anybody blame these guys for wanting these kinds of privileges?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I blame them because I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm talking about the music industry.  Or maybe it's going to be in the magazine or online.  I'm not sure yet.  But over the years, you've noticed how everybody likes to point out things like,  well, gee, you know, the movie business, they tried to ban the videotape recorder,  and now they make most of their money from the videotape recorder.  And there's example after example as how a new technology comes around,  and it makes them more money, not less, and they should embrace it, right?  Why are we consulting for these guys?  If they don't want to embrace this stuff and go broke, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because they want to get laws passed that keep us from doing what we want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what we want to do with their stuff.  As far as I'm concerned, why don't we just go find a different channel altogether

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and just leave their stuff to languish.  Stop buying the Britney Spears records.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And ears perked up at all of mp3.com, and they yelled out,  John, John, via ve of doing this, just come to our download site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, I think what John's saying is place like Magnatune,  where you go and these are artists who say, we're not going to be part of this system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the problem is, with all due respect,  I mean, as somebody who owns probably more obscure bands on CD than anybody else  in this podcast right now, there's times when going, you know,  an ambient case in point Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, right?  I'm sure there's an alternative band that sounds just as good as the real thing.  We substitute Leo Laporte's Beatle catalog with Folgers crystals.  Let's see if he notices the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but The Beatles were then, this is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, then and now, I mean, it's still a lot of Beatles albums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bought one Beatles album in my life, John,  The Yellow Submarine, so I could revisit my childhood fascination with that movie.  Other than that, I don't own any Beatles albums.  I don't own any Led Zeppelin albums, but I know lots and lots of people of many ages.  I own both. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I bought the albums. I bought the cassette.  I bought the CD and I've downloaded them.  I've paid that for the same song six or seven times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you'll get the next one free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Buy six get one free.  Press kit thing and have them send you this stuff for nothing.  If you're buying that many copies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't do that.  I'm too lazy. I just end up buying it.  So apparently Terry Semel admitted that Microsoft did come to them,  come to Yahoo and offer to buy into the company.  And furthermore, he says, we turned him down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hostile takeover. Microsoft's got the money.  Do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They couldn't buy Google, but they could buy Yahoo.  Yahoo's cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. What's the market cap on Yahoo?  It's got to be pretty high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not as high as Google.  I was at the Google campus doing a podcast with Chris DeBona this week.  That is nice.  Oh yeah, it's swank.  And you know, you go into the restaurants and you know,  there's incredible food of all kinds.  You just get what you want.  I kept looking for the cashier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's all part of keeping you there 24 hours a day so they can work you.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If I were a single guy, I'd eat all my meals there.  I'd stay there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they also was talking to the, you know, they've got shuttles that go  everywhere from like Santa Cruz, probably to Santa Rosa, driving people to the  office and mornings and home in the evenings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the campus has gotten so big that they have little electric motor scooters  in all the lobbies of the buildings so you can just hop on one and go to another

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  building if it's too far.  OK, not to interrupt, but I'm going to interrupt.  If you took Google price now, of course it would run up if you tried to buy them  out, but the market cap is $43.4 billion.  I don't think Microsoft can afford that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can probably buy 10 or 20 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's Yahoo's net worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's what I meant.  Yahoo's is $43.4 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll look at Google now.  So I don't think Microsoft has enough cash to lay down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but what if they could buy enough shares to do some interesting things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that would run up the price of this stuff.  It probably still cost them too much money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's too expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, there's money there, boy.  There's money in banks, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, we carry the money, but we don't get to see a lot of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's let me rephrase this.  There's a lot more steady employment in banks than there are at any of a number of search

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  engine companies.  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would have been very interested.  I got the market cap number for Google.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  $111 billion.  That's hilarious.  That's what happens when your stock gets $400.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's down to $370.  Is it target price $500 still, John?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  I don't know if I can say it.  Because no one listens to this.  Well, you know, I've had it.  until it started getting up there.  But I'm not going to put this in the column, but I think $2,000 is probably achievable over  the next five to six years.  Actually, it would be split a few times.  You never know.  But I say $2,000 and it actually would, if I was going to put a date on it, I would say  probably by late 2009.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you agree with those who say there'll be a crash towards the end of this decade?  I'm one of the promoters of the crash idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, I'm writing it up.  I'm going to make a monograph and probably sell it off the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It should happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's what I just say to people.  If the Dow Jones hits $30,000, which it will, sell everything.  I mean, I would also say sell your stock.  I think this is going to be the beginning of a long downturn.  And I was looking for an upbeat story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But we'll discuss this at length after I finish my monograph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be a good, let's do a twit special, a triangulation special, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'd like to do that.  Sounds like a winner.  The stock market crash to come.  I'm not the only guy saying this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, a lot of people, but most people don't take it too seriously.  But my thing, which I call the insurance bet, I say, look, you don't have to believe it.  But when the Dow Jones hits $30,000, which doesn't look too likely tomorrow,  but when it does, I would be very leery about being in the market at all.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's just, you know.  Here's an upbeat story.  Three Australian men who were lost at sea for three weeks.  They were living on raw squid and rainwater, but they had cell phones.  The problem is they were too far away for the cell phones to work.  So they would turn it on every morning to see if they got a signal.  Finally they did.  They conserved their batteries all three weeks and they sent a text message to their families who rescued them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that a great story?  I love that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The authorities found them several kilometers from Murray Island.  They sent a helicopter.  They were treated for significant weight loss, 20 kilograms.  That's a lot.  But other than that, they're fine.  SMS saves lives.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  SMS and brains, like reading the story, they were really thinking they had Kansas helmets so they didn't get sunstroke.  They made paddles.  They got lost in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It looked kind of funny though with their little buckets over their head and using Kansas paddles,  but their cell phones, they kept them protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just impressed that they were smart enough to save the battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that great?  They're calling, right?  No signal, no signal.  Well, maybe I could play some Tetris online.  Anybody want to play Bejeweled?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder what kind of cell phone they were using.  I think the company should find out or no guess should look into it and see if it's theirs and give it a promotion.  That's advertising written all over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, I just saw this story on Ars Technica.  Sony says the price for the PlayStation 3 is too cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they spent some time defending it before E3 ended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're giving it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if you subtract that cost of a Blu-ray player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess in a way that's $600, but you get a high-def DVD player.  That's the rationalization I'm going to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the rationalization...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's tax deductible, Al.  You're in the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those game machines have always been sold at a loss, so what's new?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you read Kudagari Kudaragi's quote on the justification for the price?  No, what did he say?  Of course, we don't know what context this was taken in.  For instance, is it not nonsense to compare the charge for dinner at a company cafeteria with dinner at a fine restaurant?  If you can have an amazing experience, we believe price is not a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I see the ad campaign now.  The PlayStation 3 like dining at a fine restaurant.  Worth more because of the service.  Well, he's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Except for the fact that people don't eat at a fine restaurant day after day after day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the best thing that can happen for Microsoft right now, because this makes the premium 360 look cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right.  I'm going to get a DS light, I've decided, because I need brain training.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel bad for all the parents that are going to get hammered come ship date for the PS3.  Howling, screaming, whining, children begging for the next generation gaming console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like to tease Henry, I asked him.  So, come Christmas should we get you a Nintendo Wii or a PlayStation 3?  3 or Wii?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or a herd of goats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Start your farming empire now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll take the goats, dad.  Real estate, that's what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the story, Intel touts developing world laptop, and they have pictures of it here and there on the Reg hardware segment.  Has anyone looked at this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is their response to the MIT $100 laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a white box design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a $300 thing with a crazy looking machine.  The thing that I think they overlooked is that MIT machine uses that little mechanism that creates energy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little battery charger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They basically said, Intel's response is they're dropping billions of dollars into bringing the third world onto the net.  It was part of the announcement.  People deserve to have a real computer with a real screen and they're not going to sit there cranking for power.  It's a total PR contest with the guys at MIT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can make a mention of this hand crank.  This mechanism, which came out some years ago and first appeared on some radios, is now available on some flashlights you can get at Costco.  It's a really good device.  I've actually tried to track down who actually manufactures this little mechanism.  It really works. It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's one thing to generate enough power to keep a flashlight going, especially something like an LED flashlight that doesn't have a lot of power demand.  But cranking enough to keep a notebook running?  You're going to end up with one arm that's twice the size of the other.  Crank for 20 minutes, type 8 paragraphs, crank for 20 minutes, log online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what do you crank to get the Wi-Fi to work?  There's no electricity. Are you on the net?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you're in a place where you don't have enough electricity to run the computer, you kind of wonder what is it, a calculator?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What are they dealing with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll tell you what they're doing.  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Porn.  Porn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What else would you do with that thing?  Hand-cranked porn.  I was hoping you were going to say game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jen, I'd like to apologize on behalf of the entire team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's all right. I'm a hockey player. I've heard it all before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Speaking of which, the adult industry welcomes the rejection of the XXX domain.  They didn't want a XXX domain.  Of course not.  I guess it was, I don't know who it was lobbying with ICANN.  I thought it was the right-wing anti-porn activists.  But in fact, it was both them and the porn sites. Why not, Jon? Why wouldn't they want that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, because they don't want to be turned in. They don't want to be segmented, pushed into some little arena that they can easily be filtered out.  They can push their junk onto everybody, whether you want it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ironically, like the Family Research Council said, it would have been a land grab for pornographers.  They thought the pornographers would like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Larry Flint joins the Family Research Council.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got into a beef with these guys once before and I wrote about it.  I've discussed this XXX thing for a long time and it's baffling to me.  It's almost as though this group, this family, there's a couple of them actually, these right-wing family-oriented groups are against the XXX thing.  Their argument is that, well, now you can just type in anything .XXX and you'd get porn automatically.  It would encourage porn. The porn people don't think so and I don't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Obviously they've never used Google.  If you type in sex in Google, you'll find all the porn you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not hard to find porn, but the people that were for the XXXX, the idea was that once you establish it, it might take a long time,  but if you start pushing people into that little niche, then you can do some serious filtering and keep them away from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe I'm giving the porn merchants too much credit, but wouldn't they like the idea of a red light district where they could go and people who wanted it could see it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you've spent years putting together a highly integrated network to make this stuff available all over the place and the promotions and all the weirdness,  can you imagine how annoying it would be to try to stuff all that under one domain, plus having to repurchase your domains, getting into funding battles for all that stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all pretty bizarre.  Does anyone think they'd give up the domains they have already?  No, but I mean, over time...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With legislation, you can make them give up the stuff that they currently have, because the pendulum on porn swings back and forth, especially in this country,  where we don't even like bare breasts and advertising.  I think that over time, it would have been a beneficial thing for filtering mechanisms, but it's never going to happen with these do-gooders who are actually on the scene.  I don't know why they don't realize, if you're on the same side of these pornographers, they both think the same way about it.  Something's wrong with this picture. Get a clue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of them's wrong, that's for sure.  ICANN has voted against the proposal, so once again, it's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm more worried about somebody stealing all my phone numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're talking about the latest NSA revelations that, in fact...  Isn't that ridiculous?  The NSA has been recording phone numbers.  It's interesting, because they requested and got the information from SBC, Verizon, the big companies, but Quest, of all people, one of the smallest telcos, said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was so proud, I almost wrote a thank you letter to my phone company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They said no because they said it didn't go through the FISA court. There's a secret court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Quest did the right thing, but I wonder if there's any coincidence with the fact that the Quest CEO is turning out to be not the world's most honest person.  They didn't need to have any more of this evidence show up.  He was hiding his own information?  I don't know, it just seems like a coincidence to me that all of a sudden Quest, which has always been considered coerced by people who are up in the Pacific Northwest and are stuck with these guys,  they would be the guys on the white horse telling the government to stuff it. It just doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  On the other side, people are saying there's no real information here, they're not listening to phone calls, they're just getting what number called what other number and sifting through it, doing data mining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can do a lot of interesting data mining. Some years ago I was in England and I got a briefing from Interpol showing how they use these phone call mechanisms where you can just see who's calling who the most.  They could actually put together who was in charge of a mafia organization and who their lieutenants were, you could figure out exactly the structure of an organization with phone call records, just who's calling who, when and how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. It does seem like a little bit of an invasion of privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the whole idea that the US is doing, it's really spooky too, because they're not supposed to do anything inside the borders of the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think ultimately I'm not so concerned about privacy, it's just the bypassing, there are good means to do this, there is the FISA court to completely bypass that and just go ahead and do it.  It strikes me as a little bit arrogant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it used to be I'll do it now and ask permission later. Now I'll do it now, I won't ask permission and I'll claim that I was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll deny it. And then when you catch me I'll say, well, it was my right anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the big fear I think is that people are worried that a political organization can get a hold of this data, do the data mining, see who people are affiliated with, who they're calling.  I mean, you don't need the phone calls, you could put together kind of an interesting, or maybe some guy, it's obvious that some senator is having an affair, you could use it to blackmail people.  I mean, this is just not a good thing to allow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Word 2007 is going to feature built-in blogging. Microsoft jumping on the blogging bandwagon.  Okay, that's not much of a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Microsoft takes credit for being the biggest blogging site in the world now with MySpace or whatever it is. I find it hard to believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's spaces, Microsoft Spaces.  Spaces, right, MySpace is the other one.  The more I experience MySpace, the more I realize it's just a thinly disguised marketing site.  I mean, it's really all about getting people's information and marketing to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of bugs me.  Yeah, MySpace is amazing. But yeah, Microsoft claims it's got the most blogs and blah blah blah with Spaces.  I don't know, does anybody believe that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Spaces is tied into MSN, right? So all the kids in high school who use MSN to talk to their friends kind of just put their data in that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In Canada they use MSN. I don't think kids here use MSN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's right. All my American friends are on AOL. My Canadian friends are on MSN. My Australian friends are on Yahoo for some reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a cultural, a natural, natural cultural thing. I think MSN is actually very popular globally. Not so much here in the States though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what's this blogging software going to do in Word 2007?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess you'll write something in Word and then publish to blog. There's software to do that right now. It's very easy to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a cut and paste mechanism that's available too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's sensible. If you're going to have a word processor, what does a word processor do? It creates text and then you have a printer or you have email and various ways of distributing.  It makes perfect sense to publish it to the web as a perfectly reasonable menu entry.  Yeah, it's called lame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you imagine what those entries are like? You can't put photos in, you can't do block quotes or can you?  And you can't do anything that most bloggers want to do.  Excerpts, does it work with their RSS properly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's true. It'd probably be better if it were built into an RSS. A good place for it is an RSS reader or other things like that.  Any other stories you guys are talking about? I suppose we should cover net neutrality and the EOLAS patents and all that stuff. I can't get excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I finally got my hands on an HDTV player.  It's very pretty, it's very expensive. It's a Linux box and it runs very slowly. We actually show it running on Tuesday's DLTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This isn't the Toshiba. This is the Toshiba.  The Toshiba has Linux in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a Linux box. It's like a P4, 512 megabytes of RAM.  It's got a big old fan on the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're kidding!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I kid you not.  The way you're describing it, Patrick, is a clunker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's saving grace. I'm a huge fan of the photography in Goodfellas.  It's such a beautifully shot movie.  That was when I was watching it and there was moments where I was like, OK, you've got six times the detail. This is neat. This is really pretty.  It's nowhere near as dramatic as the difference. And Blu-ray won't be either.  It's nowhere near as dramatic as the difference between videotape and DVDs.  But there's moments where you're just like, wow, the video just looks so rich.  And then you go $500 for a box that takes forever to boot and forever to load a disc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is interesting. In order for them to make an HDTV player, they basically had to give you a computer.  A pretty powerful computer. It has a hard drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not that I know of.  Maybe on Tuesday's show I'll open up the HD DVD player. That'll put some heart attacks on people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  DLDL.TV if you want to see what's inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the OS is running from ROM?  I believe so.  I'm pretty sure it's running from ROM.  You could do a Linux that sits in 16 or 32 megabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's probably why it takes so long to boot. It's got to load it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it takes a while to read the disc too. The density on the disc is pretty amazing.  The other thing I also do is finally get to talk about some of the stuff that's going on with in-phase and holographic storage.  Which is pretty trippy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're getting how much data in a square inch? It's quite a substantial amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's 300 gigabytes on a single disc and it's going to jump to 800 gigabytes I think in 2008.  And then 1.6 terabytes in 2010.  The current players though, we show the video and we did a big thing friendly from NAB.  You kind of have to see the picture of it to realize just how big the current generation drives are.  About a meter long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's early days, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a story that came out just actually yesterday I think.  I put it on the blog on 514 2006.  Which is a Matsushita, Panasonic and Sony decided to come with a new HD video camera spec.  That essentially uses normal DVD media to record HD signals using MPEG-4 or H.264.  And when I ran into the story I thought it was interesting because I've had people say maybe the whole HD revolution with Blu-ray and HD DVDs is never going to happen.  Because you can already put HD on a regular DVD if you use different encoding.  Patrick, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure I understood what you were saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, you can take, there's a new camera spec that Sony and Panasonic want to do which is record on these little mini DVDs, regular DVDs, in other words plus R, minus R, using a MPEG-4 instead of MPEG-2.  And you can get the HD signal on there. You don't need these fancy discs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't that what that Microsoft Terminator 3 was with the Windows Extreme?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's something actually Robert's playing around with right now is figuring out the best way to record HD content onto a disc for playback, onto a rewritable or a write once disc.  But it's interesting. Finding players that will do that that actually have it scaled out to HD is a little more difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Robert, you know, in fact, is the one who first mentioned this to me because he was on Cranky Geeks, which is another plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's CrankyGeeks.com. And John, you know there's flash there. You don't like to download video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not going to bring up the flash issue again.  Anyway, he brought it up that, you know, that he felt, although I don't agree with this necessarily, but listening to your story about the HD DVD player, maybe he's right, is that what's the point?  Why don't we just do it this way, which is now what Sony and Panasonic are apparently designing a system to do.  Although they don't, you know, they're kind of in that, you know, Sony's kind of in both camps because they want to push the Blu-ray.  But I don't know. I mean, you start to make more sense when you start thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what's the amount of time that can be stored on there? How much video are you talking about? One side of disc stores 20 minutes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I, apparently you can...  Well, that's more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It compresses data twice the efficiency of conventional MPEG-2. One side of DVD disc can store 20 minutes of high-res digital video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's good. So my movie won't pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are eight centimeter discs. These are little bitty discs that go on these cameras.  Oh, okay.  So it's not the big disc. I mean, you can do it with a big disc. And I think Robert, you're right, is working on trying to, I guess he's going to do a call or write up on it somewhere.  Anyway, I just thought that was an interesting story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think it's pretty clear that now that I hear that the Toshiba player is really this big old Pentium computer, I think it's pretty clear that HD DVD, either Blu-ray or HD DVD, is going to be a flop.  I just don't see it taking off. There's so many other alternatives. And they sound better, frankly. I just don't see it happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but you know, the other thing, this technique of putting HD on a DVD doesn't make up for the fact that you can get a lot of gigabytes on one of these new technologies, which computer users need more than, I think, people who just want to watch HD movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unless this holographic stuff comes along faster or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm not even believing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sam Swade undercover exposure is the latest from Al Lowe, and it'll be in stores sometime in 2007. But if you want to see screenshots, IGN has a pretty good review of it from their E3 coverage. I thought it was, is that a good place to look to see the screenshots?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are links from allow.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, allow.com. There you go.  You can see, you can see, Swade giving a guard a super atomic wedgie.  So there you go. I mean, where else are you going to see that?  Al Lowe's site is allowe.com. The CyberJoke3000 pictures of Sam Swade and of course all the old Leisure Suit Larry's and incidentally a clip from the Screensavers where Al appeared on our show. So that's kind of neat to see that there.  John C. Dvorak's blog is dvorak.org slash blog where you'll see pictures of bikini clad high school teachers as well as Ghanaian cab drivers, particularly computer experts.  Say that three times fast.  Dvorak.org slash blog. I know I can say that three times fast.  Yeah, hey, go for it. What was that again, Leo?  Dvorak.org slash blog.  Jen Cutter is at openalpha.tv. You'll see her also on Call From Help. Call from Help or Help, whatever we call it.  Plead for help.  Plead for help, beg for help.  Jen, thanks for being here. I appreciate it.  My pleasure.  And of course dl.tv where you can see Patrick disassemble some of the finest hardware in the world.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Busting up the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Busting up the place. It's always a lot of fun.  Guys, we'll see you back here next week. Another twit is in the can.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Doing the twit, all right, doing the twit, baby, doing the twit, all right, doing the twit, baby, doing the twit, all right, doing the twit, baby, doing the twit, all right, doing the twit, baby, doing the twit, all right, doing the twit, baby, doing the twit, all right, doing the twit, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have a deadspot in the middle of that show.  Oh I edit those out.  Oh I'm talking kind of like the boring part you mean?  Yeah.  I think I'll cut that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's going to be actually a fairly short show because after you cut that out there's not much left.
