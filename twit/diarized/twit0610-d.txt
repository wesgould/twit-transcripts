Transcript:  It's not what you want.  Yeah.  Not what you want.  So we were talking before the show and actually we had to stop the conversation because everybody got engaged.  And it is a tech story in a way in this United story.  The passenger David Dow, Dr. United, who was bumped.  United, I guess, has a policy.  It's happened to me, believe it or not, of kicking people off flights once they're already seated.  Now what's part of the story is that this broke on Twitter.  It was a camera phone video.  There were two different videos.  We saw it on Twitter before it even made the news.  Just horrific.  I mean, anybody who saw it knows.  A horrific footage of a guy screaming and being dragged off a flight by three burly police officers.  He then ran back.  We think, again, the reporting on this is so haphazard that it's hard to know what really happened.  But we think that he ran back on the plane disoriented and was bloodied.  We saw the video of that and then dragged off.  He was actually tended to and then taken off.  Apparently, according to his daughter, he has suffered a loss of two front teeth, a concussion and a broken nose.  He certainly was bloodied by it.  United has apologized.  Eventually.  Yeah, at first they said things like, well, he was reassigned.

Start time: 293.25
End time: 296.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've increasingly apologized, right?  Like, it keeps getting better.

Start time: 297.02
End time: 327.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But see what, okay, so in their defense, if you have a plane and you have a passenger on the plane,  it's like if somebody were sitting here and disrupting the show,  I would have a legal right to ask the person to leave.  And if he didn't leave and didn't leave and didn't leave, I could have a police officer come and take him out, right?  Some of the blame lies on the police officers who injure.  Use way too much force.  Way too much force.  But it is clear also from a customer service point of view, this is the worst possible thing.

Start time: 327.24
End time: 352.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also to call the police to forcibly remove someone is a pretty big step to have the police enforce your corporate policies.  And the initial United comment was they had no choice.  It's like, well, they certainly did have a choice.  That's what struck me.  There must have been a better way.  And if I'm the Chicago police, I would like to have a moment of like, why are we involved in this?  Like, this is a this is.  Yeah, it was the airport police.  Nobody was at risk here.

Start time: 353.57
End time: 368.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Blue jeans.  He wasn't.  I mean, I don't know who he was, but it didn't seem like he was a normal police officer.  He was airport police or some guy in jeans.  It was a weird story, but there is a better way, apparently.  There is a tech angle.

Start time: 368.00
End time: 389.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there's a story that I spotted that was I think an NPR story that was about Delta Airlines.  So it turns out Delta Airlines has a lot less of these.  You know, they do overbook flights.  That's part of it because a certain percentage of people don't check in.  And so you want to maximize that.  So if five percent of your people don't show up, you see it's even a smaller number than that, though.

Start time: 389.10
End time: 391.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's less than one.  Yeah, it's a tiny amount.

Start time: 391.16
End time: 394.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they overbook a little and usually that works for them.  But occasionally it doesn't.

Start time: 394.02
End time: 401.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they know which flights people tend not to show up for.  This is all highly computerized data.  Yeah, this is all deep data.  And apparently...

Start time: 402.04
End time: 406.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is data science, but we are people trying to get somewhere on a plane.  That's the problem.  Yeah, that's right.

Start time: 406.00
End time: 408.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When people in data science collide, sometimes the people lose.

Start time: 408.00
End time: 446.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you have to think about it.  So Delta has...  Delta, like any airline, will bump a lot of their passengers.  But what Delta doesn't do is generally forcibly, against the will of a passenger, bump their passengers.  That happens a lot less.  And the reason is that they instituted this system.  When you check in to Delta, to an overbooked flight, the Delta app will actually ask you,  if we need to bump you, how much money would you accept to be bumped off?  Wait a minute. They ask you?  They ask you as a passenger.  A million dollars?  Well, this is the thing.  So you say a million dollars and I say $500.  Oh, some guy next to me says less.  And Liz says $700 and they only need one.  It's a reverse auction.  When do you name your price?

Start time: 447.00
End time: 447.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you buy your ticket?

Start time: 448.02
End time: 465.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you check in for the flight, so it's 24 hours away, presumably, or less.  And they know at that point that it's overbooked and they ask this question.  And then they look at the list and they take from the bottom up.  And so they save money, they get people to volunteer, and they're willing to go up to a fairly high number.  Everybody's got a number.

Start time: 466.00
End time: 471.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Delta has just raised its number because this was also in response to the United thing.  They say that we'll pay up to $9,950 at this point.

Start time: 474.47
End time: 482.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know what?  I was traveling last weekend, though, and my friend was flying home on Delta and all of their computers were down.  So there are other issues.

Start time: 483.00
End time: 483.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That happens a lot, too.

Start time: 484.32
End time: 565.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, airlines, yeah, all airlines could be better.  But it is an interesting thought that data analysis and mobile apps allow an airline that wants to embrace this technology to do a better job of it.  So what Delta has done is they've saved some money and also minimized forcing people off a plane who don't want to go.  You know what? On every plane, there are people who feel they have to go back and there are people who could stay another day or a few hours.  And it doesn't matter.  And it's worth it for them.  And so Delta built this system that lets them do that.  And everybody feels like they won when that happens.  And, you know, United, I just flew United.  I was actually traveling overseas while this happened and my return flight was United.  So I'm thinking, well, they might be very polite to all the passengers on this flight.  And the irony of it is that I feel like after 15 years of the experience getting worse on United, I used to fly all the time and now I try to avoid them.  This trip, I felt like they actually are starting to turn it around a little where they realize they were going too far.  It has gotten better.  And but it's happening in the midst of this PR crisis.  But clearly, like the Delta story is a good example of embracing data so that you don't have these kind of terrible passenger experiences that they obviously the staff didn't even think.  That's the thing that gets me about this story is the staff basically went by the book.  They were clearly terrified to make common sense decisions because they were they had been trained to not do that.  We should point out that it was Republic Airways.

Start time: 566.08
End time: 576.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a United Express flight.  The gate agents were United gate agents, but the people on board the plane, the flight crew on board the plane was not United.  Right. Because they they they subcontract for these short haul flights.

Start time: 577.00
End time: 579.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So responsible.  And put United's name on it.  Yeah.

Start time: 581.42
End time: 597.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I just it makes me not want to ever fly United.  At the same time, I also understand if an airline has the right to say, you know, to anybody, I was I can't remember the airline.  I don't think it was United.  I was Lisa and I were flying standby on a flight.  We'd already once you sit down, they should not.  Yeah.

Start time: 598.30
End time: 600.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Once they give you a seat number and they put you in the seat, that should be the plane.

Start time: 601.00
End time: 607.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The doors almost closed.  They have flight is everybody's sitting down.  They came up to me, said the plane's overweight.  You need to get off.  Right.

Start time: 608.78
End time: 610.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  They should again, they should make that calculation.

Start time: 611.06
End time: 685.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but maybe they had to get everybody on the.  Yeah, I was a little it was like and I by the way, I didn't I didn't scream and I didn't fight.  I just got off the plane as I think most people would do.  They just well, OK.  And then two people got on who weren't appreciably slimmer than I am.  So it was you know what I realized in hindsight, it was it was a lie.  It was a white lie.  It was a lot.  You know, they probably had somebody.  I was flying standby.  My wife and I are flying standby with a higher, you know, this is all this is what the other  somebody else has pointed out.  This really is also a measure of what's happened in this country with inequality.  If you're wealthy enough, you never get bumped.  You never have problems.  And unfortunately, if you don't make that mark, you really everybody else has to survive,  you know, kind of this dog eat dog world.  I realized somebody who had higher flight status than I did, you know, a one K flyer.  Something had said I'd like to get on this plane and they said, well, sure.  Well, let's get a real Leo.  And they lied.  They lied.  They said I was you know, that the flight was over.  Come on.  I didn't have any checked luggage.  That's one of that's the main reason they got rid of me.  They didn't have to take my brains off.  That my bags off.  Yeah.  And Lisa's not heavy.  I'm heavy, but I'm not that heavy.  I'm a pro tip.  Check.

Start time: 686.16
End time: 687.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Check a bag.  Yeah.

Start time: 688.40
End time: 709.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, how would you know so many other things?  The plane sitting on a scale.  I mean, what is it like?  Oh, yeah.  Leo's 10.  We get your 10 pounds less.  Get her on.  That's it.  That didn't happen.  So this is not I don't think it's unheard of.  And I think most people would just say, yeah, fine.  OK.  But Dr. Dow apparently did not want to get off.  And this is this is a chain of things, right?

Start time: 711.79
End time: 721.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is as so many of these of these disasters are.  It's a series of things that went wrong.  That's right.  From the overbooking system to him being given a seat assignment.

Start time: 721.00
End time: 723.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The over military solution of the airport security force.

Start time: 724.41
End time: 726.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  Exactly right.  So it's all the way down.

Start time: 727.00
End time: 763.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a new sense of entitlement, I think, in some cases in law enforcement that anything  goes now.  We're we're back on top.  You're a journalist.  I'm well, you're both journalists.  I'm curious because one of the things I've noticed with this story is it's very hard  to get the facts.  And there's lots of rumors around it.  And you would think this would be pretty straightforward that a reporter could go in and find out exactly  what happened.  And we know what the facts were.  And but even now, days later, there's still was that the same David Dow that was a professional  gambler?  I mean, there's all this confusion around it.  It's still not, you know, why was he bumped?  Well, they said it maybe it was.

Start time: 764.84
End time: 791.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's partly because there was such fixed information at the start.  Like you could see the video.  It was the video.  There's no clear what was happening.  And then you had to figure out every other detail around it.  And those get more fuzzy.  Like we got this huge head start reporters, but video lies to well, you know, lies to  angles.  Yeah.  So it takes some time to disentangle.  Yeah.  And but but every all the reporting around it was catching up to the fact that we'd all  already seen this video and it was pretty obvious what happened.

Start time: 792.18
End time: 841.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.  And then you get into this point where once it's out there and it becomes a phenomenon,  everybody involved is battening down the hatches.  So we heard from people on the plane because they don't have a vested interest in this.  But United is managing a PR disaster and doing it very badly for a couple of days.  And then you have the police where there are the people involved who are now worried about  their jobs and getting tangled in this.  You've got the management of the Chicago Police Department that doesn't like that their people  were being put in this situation.  You've got the the guy and his lawyer and they are obviously thinking now about suing  United.  So then as a journalist, like the core sources are not going to be necessarily very forthcoming.  So you've got kind of eyewitnesses, but the eyewitnesses are very much like the video.  Right.  There's no context around it.  We only know what we saw in the video and what they report they saw.

Start time: 842.04
End time: 849.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But all that's very normal for any story.  It's just interesting that everyone's talking about this one this week.  Well, and you know, right.

Start time: 850.00
End time: 857.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if people felt generally happy about how they got treated by the airlines the last  decade, it wouldn't have.  Right.  I mean, this is this is a symptom.

Start time: 858.00
End time: 859.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Waiting for the latest outrage.

Start time: 861.55
End time: 890.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I should point out initially, United Stock.  I mean, they could have given the guy a thousand, ten thousand, five thousand.  They could have given a million dollars because their stock price ended up tanking by almost  a billion dollars in the first few hours.  As you pointed out, Liz, it came back and went.  Initially, I think some investors and this was also in Twitter on Wall Street said, oh,  wait a minute.  That's good.  They're overbooked.  Good news.  They're buying up the stock again.  Yeah.  It's a deal.  And then it started to sink in and it has as it has over the remaining five or six days

Start time: 891.24
End time: 895.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that this isn't probably very good for like it's still dancing right around 70 bucks a

Start time: 896.04
End time: 907.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  share.  It's 70 sixty nine eleven right now at its peak the day of 72.  So it's three dollars a share.  They've got three hundred fourteen million shares outstanding.  It's almost it's almost a billion dollars.  That's a lot.

Start time: 907.18
End time: 910.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a lot of market cap chart out and see if it really has an impact.

Start time: 911.00
End time: 915.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And really the question is going to be in reservations over the next year.  Right.

Start time: 916.00
End time: 919.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do people say you know because everybody actually worth it to you to pick the twenty  dollars more flight.

Start time: 920.16
End time: 980.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody has a nobody loves an airline really.  It's not maybe as bad as your cable company but it's not like there's huge affection  there in general.  There are occasional brands that break through but they go away like Virgin.  But and I read another story said there's actually another great story that's tech related  about this which is I think maybe the Washington Post wrote a piece about how one of the  problems is unlike things like restaurants where you have questions of their dimensions  to the ratings right of service and the quality of the food and things like that with airlines  all of the shopping options that everybody uses are completely boiled down to price.  In fact even to the point where a lot of those websites if they're hidden fees you often  don't see those.  So you pick a cheap flight and find out it's actually going to cost you fifty dollars more  because you have to check a bag or something like that.  And so there's a question there like is there a product that you could make for people who  are shopping for for a flight that integrates stuff other than just the price because in  the end yeah is it worth it to you to pay twenty or thirty dollars more for a better  airline.

Start time: 981.00
End time: 982.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that what hipmunk does they have their agony index.

Start time: 983.95
End time: 984.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See there is a good idea.

Start time: 985.08
End time: 991.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah but it's more like the flight is it a nonstop.  Yeah but I think they could easily add to the agony.  Yeah they should incorporate some other factors.

Start time: 992.06
End time: 1016.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because imagine if you get data about customer satisfaction on for a whole carrier or for  specific flights and you integrate that wouldn't that freak the airlines out if they knew that  like their their placement was dropping in the shopping rankings because they're doing  a bad job of keeping people happy.  It could be it could help maybe maybe I'm being too optimistic here but it's absolutely  true that if you all you do is sort on price this is the situation you get.

Start time: 1017.21
End time: 1082.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also shows the power of social media and the instantaneous power of social media to  hurt your stock price and hurt your reputation.  In 2008 if all you have to say is United Airlines and people will remember now nine years ago.  Oh yeah that's the airline that broke the guy's thirteen hundred dollar guitar.  Remember that.  Yeah.  Google United guitar.  He wrote a song about it.  It was a thirty five hundred dollar guitar.  The guy shared his upset on social media wrote a song about it.  United Breaks guitars.  And I tell you what people by the way is playing a very nice 17 million views.  Yeah I'll tell you this is the power of social media and on the one hand I celebrate it.  Look at this is consumers you know getting back at big companies and we have a voice  now.  But it can also be misused in some horrific ways as well.  Yeah I don't know if on the balance it's good or bad but certainly thanks to social media  we all have a voice.  He got a new guitar several new guitars I think after he broke his guitar.

Start time: 1098.43
End time: 1120.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with that.  I think if you're in a seat that's the end of it.  That's really bad.  Yeah.  You know that's about the worst thing you can do.  I mean that's they obviously had a breakdown.  Why are you boarding people if you know that you're you've overbooked the flight.  Right.  And then the answer is that they didn't know that crew was going to show up.  And so then they're trying to pull people off.  And the answer there is to say sorry we aren't going to pull anybody off this flight.  But then the crew is delayed.

Start time: 1121.10
End time: 1129.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the flight coming out of Louisville which is waiting for that crew gets canceled.  It's a ripple effect.  And it's a lot of not just United that's disadvantaged but a lot of real people.

Start time: 1130.06
End time: 1137.84

Transcript:  It's like Donnie Darko.  It's just it's just not a good.  This is my favorite one.  Creepy Easter bunnies.  There's actually a whole website scaring the chocolate out of innocent children.  Wow.  That one is that just really bad.  That's just that is just one mangy bunny.  And those kids they're rightly they're really scared.  Our show today brought to you by a great company and I think a company that is often underestimated.  Everybody knows the name CloudFlare.  That's you know what.  And if I asked you if you ask 10 different people they'll get 10 different answers to what CloudFlare does.  Many people know CloudFlare offers DOS protection.  So your website can't be brought to its knees by a sudden influx whether as an attack or just a lot of interest in what you're doing of traffic.  But it does a whole lot more than that.  It really is the operating system for the edge of the Internet.  More than six million websites APIs apps and SAS companies use CloudFlare CloudFlare lets you load fast stay secure and weather whatever the Internet throws at you.  And it's easy to set up less than five minutes.  And there's a free tier.  And I want to tell you why there's a free tier a little bit.  But yes you can use CloudFlare for your site right now.  Absolutely free.  So CloudFlare is also what we call a CDN a content distribution network.  Maybe some of you probably podcasters are aware of it in that regard because they have more than 100 data centers all over the world which cache your content moving it closer to the people who want it.  So it loads faster.  But you can also get real great advantages by using CloudFlare like IPv6.  You know the mobile web uses IPv6.  Your site will load faster on mobile if it's IPv6 compatible and CloudFlare in five minutes can make you IPv6 compatible.  HTTPS rewrites keep you secure.  Your domain automatically configures to use HTTP to that gives you about a 30 percent performance boost without anything else.  End to end CloudFlare speeds up every request to your site.  Performant DNS, it does DNS, caching, content optimization, load balancing and a lot more.  Plans range from free to $20 a month, $200 a month and of course big big big websites.  They've got custom plans for you.  But why you might ask why is it free?  The free tier helps them because it's basically crowdsourcing their WAF, Wide Area Firewall I guess that's what it stands for, WAF.  So they have six million domains on their network.  If you see trouble or you request a new custom WAF rule, they analyze it and then they will then apply it to every other domain on their network.  Kind of like Google does with spam.  When you notify Gmail that you got a spam, it helps everybody fight that spam.  The WAF, the Wide Area Firewall helps everybody be more secure.  So they love having you as a free customer.  It helps them improve their protection for everybody.  CloudFlare's free plan is part of their mission to help build a better internet.  One where builders and makers and writers and everyone with a good idea can reach a global audience.  You're part of the neighborhood watch on the edge of the internet.  We have a nice offer for you.  One of their best guys, one of their best technicians is doing a, their support engineers is doing a seminar you can join for free.  There's Jamison Sundell.  He's awesome.  He's funny.  He's smart.  And he understands better than anybody how CloudFlare works.  Just for twit listeners, this is all, we're the only ones who have this.  We're going to arrange for you to have a free, join a free live chat with Jamison.  If you go to cloudflare.com slash twit and sign up today, do the free tier.  You'll still get it.  Won't cost you anything.  Making the internet work the way it should.  We love these guys and I'm really thrilled that they can be a part of a part of our family.  CloudFlare.com slash twit.  All right.  Enough of scary Easter bunnies.  You know, this was a weird week.

Transcript:  It's, it seemed like there were 18 stories about Qualcomm.

Start time: 1451.04
End time: 1536.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Qualcomm is suing Apple, which sued Qualcomm.  It's a chain of pain.  It's a chain of pain.  So Apple accuses, I don't even know.  Should we do this story?  Apple accuses Qualcomm of overcharging for its license fees.  Everybody uses Qualcomm.  You kind of almost have to use Qualcomm.  But so Apple this time in the iPhone 7 outsourced not just to Qualcomm, but they could start using some Intel chips.  Intel had acquired a company that makes these are the, these are the broadband radio chips, right?  The baseband radios.  And Qualcomm, of course, invented CDMA.  So if you want to have a CDMA phone, if you want a phone that works on Verizon and Sprint with a CDMA network, you got to go to Qualcomm.  Apple sued Qualcomm.  They sued him for a billion dollars for use of their patents and fail and not paying, failing to make required payments.  Then FTC sued Qualcomm, charging it violated any trust law.  Now Qualcomm suing Apple saying you sicked the FTC on us.  And oh, by the way, we're pissed off because when you put the Intel radio in the iPhone 7, you're going to get a lot of money.  And then you're going to get a lot of money.  And then you're going to get a lot of money.  By the way, we're pissed off because when you put the Intel radio in the iPhone 7 and benchmarks showed that the Intel radio was slower than our radio, what did you do?  You slowed our radio down.  Slowed down their radio, yeah.  And you know what? I'd be pissed if our Qualcomm, I don't know if it's.

Start time: 1537.00
End time: 1550.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure there's a financial judgment to be had there, but what Apple didn't want is sort of like phone seeking where people were buying the Qualcomm phone and returning it if it was an Intel chip.  So I have the Intel chip in my phone.  Right. So it's naturally that speed.

Start time: 1551.06
End time: 1559.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's naturally slow.  But if you had the Qualcomm chip, I wouldn't begrudge you.  Yeah, I know.  I'd say, oh, no, by the way, this is LTE.  This is for data.

Start time: 1560.00
End time: 1579.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't this all just part of the grand game of whatever they're doing to fire shots off of each other's bows in this case?  Because right, because Qualcomm, because they have patents on a standard, there's sort of this implication legally that they're supposed to offer them for a fair price.  That's the Frand.  Yeah, which is Apple's contention here is that they're offering it for an unfair price.

Start time: 1580.18
End time: 1607.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Qualcomm says, and this is actually this of all the things in this, these multiple suits is the one that seems to me to be kind of bad.  They say that Apple tried to prevent them from making their own performance claims.  They tried, in other words, prevent Qualcomm from telling people, no, no, our chips are fast.  It's just Apple slowing them down.  Now, if that's the case, then Qualcomm might have that.  That seems to be kind of a nasty thing to do.  Yeah, they are.

Transcript:  People are still impressed by my surface studio.  Hey, speaking of Windows, Windows Creators Update came out this week.  I know you don't care at all.  I so don't care.  Actually, nobody should care.  I have it here.  I don't know as much except that there's a new 3D paint that Microsoft is offering.  And this is this is kind of an interesting story because Microsoft, I think I should just type it in.  I'm never going to find it.  Microsoft is really pushing 3D on Windows.  And this, I think, goes to HoloLens.  You know, they have a holographic technology, the HoloLens.

Start time: 1651.00
End time: 1654.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're going to be creating in paint something that would show up in the HoloLens?

Start time: 1655.86
End time: 1708.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think they want to get people used to see how I just created a flat sphere.  And how do I?  I must have.  OK, well, so I don't really understand this, but maybe that's the point is so that we start to understand, you know, how 3D works.  Yeah, because they want to create a generation.  They really aiming this as kids, a generation that creates and thinks in three dimensions, not two dimensions, because they think and I don't I don't disagree with them that the future,  the future computer interfaces will be augmented reality.  They'll be HoloLens like they have a version of Windows because Windows holographic with the menus float in space.  You can look you can look around them.  Everything is now kind of in space 3D.  So I think the goal with this is to get and they showed a lot of kids they want schools to adopt this.  A lot of kids to be using 3D software to get used to it so that they can generate content.

Start time: 1709.31
End time: 1713.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That sounds like either a really good idea or it would be just totally confusing.

Start time: 1713.00
End time: 1859.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can see if you're not.  Maybe it's because I'm too young, but you can see that I'm completely confused.  This program, they do offer a website, a remix website where you can download 3D models and play with them.  So it'll be interesting.  I think they're really they're really trying to get educators to adopt this.  They're hoping that this will really here's remix 3D.  Maybe I can get a these are people actually you know what if if this is any measure if you go to remix 3D,  they have models uploaded by kids 3D models and stuff like well or somebody I don't know who's uploading this.  This is maybe it's not a kid.  It's just it just looks like a kid did it.  This this ties in.  So that's the creators update.  You will start to get it if you have Windows 10 over the next few months.  I actually had to force the update, but they give you a way to do that in the in the update thing.  But Microsoft also announced a hardware event May 2nd that they're saying well the invite has the hashtag Microsoft edu.  So this is a Microsoft hardware event that I am guessing is targeted at education, right?  Microsoft edu.  This might be a little bit disappointing to people who are looking forward to maybe new surface pro tablets or new.  Some people even dream on have thoughts that they might be doing a new Microsoft phone, a Windows phone.  But no, I think it's going to be edu event.  We will cover it.  We'll be there May 2nd at 6 a.m. Pacific.  I'll be there.  I don't think I can get anybody to join me for this event.  But Paul, Thorotten, Mary Jo Foley from our Windows Weekly show will be there.  Microsoft told the verge do not expect a surface phone.  Do not expect a surface pro device.  What I think we're going to see and I think the consensus is Microsoft.  I think it was leaked out that there's something called Windows Cloud.  And the consensus is Microsoft.  Now that they're starting to be beaten in education by the Chromebook, they were dominant in education.  The Chromebook has started to outsell Windows as well as Mac and education as well as iPad.  And the thought is they're going to they're going to Microsoft's working on a low cost Chromebook like version of Windows and Windows hardware to sell into schools.

Start time: 1860.40
End time: 1861.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 1862.02
End time: 1871.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so, which would be kind of boring.  But but it just shows you how critical the education market is.  You start to lose that.

Start time: 1871.08
End time: 1922.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a challenge, right?  Because schools don't have most schools don't have a lot of money to spend on technology.  So it's got to be low end.  But it's crucial.  It's viewed as a crucial long game by these companies.  So you've got to balance.  I think that's one of Apple's challenges is Apple's entire business is based on generally having products in the high end, medium to high end, not low cost products.  And you can't do that.  And also, or at least it's very hard to do that and also get into schools.  But if the long game is you want people comfortable with your tech and to have your child's tech influence, maybe your home tech, because you want to have them in sync, you need to play that game.  And and it's you know, Apple has struggled with that.  Google has done very well with Chromebooks and Microsoft.  Yeah, I can see how Microsoft is frustrated that they used to be the cheaper solution in education.  And now Google has undercut them.  Everything goes for D.

Start time: 1923.12

Transcript:  So Apple's share on.  So first of all, device makers ship twelve point six million mobile computers as laptops, tablets and smartphones to schools last year.  Twelve point six million units.  That's up from ten point seven million units a couple of years back.  But percentages have shifted dramatically.  It's 58 percent Chrome OS, 22 percent Microsoft Windows.  And I'm trying to find the Mac OS is five percent.

Start time: 1965.95
End time: 1974.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty amazing that it changes.  It's changed so fast because device space is not like you just switch over to a different OS on the iPads your school bought last year.

Start time: 1974.66
End time: 1984.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is selling a lot of a lot of fairly cheap Chromebooks, which a school looks at that and says we can outfit our class with a Chromebook or an iPad.  And I can't imagine they hang on to them for less than like five years.

Start time: 1985.76
End time: 1994.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what's interesting because in 2014, 26 percent were iOS, mostly iPads.  It's down to 14 percent in 2016.  So a big drop. Does that mean?

Start time: 1995.34
End time: 2020.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's actually one of the reasons that new iPad exists, I think.  Yeah, it's three hundred twenty nine.  I've had whatever it is.  Fifth generation is like the iPad Air brought back and the price drastically cut.  And that seems to be Apple saying here's a here's a product we can sell to schools that's going to be under three hundred for per unit for schools.  It's still still not as cheap as a Chromebook, but it gets them maybe in the game in a way that they haven't been the last few years because they've been driving toward the high end.

Start time: 2021.04
End time: 2025.98

Start time: 2026.22
End time: 2039.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and there but this also the future for these companies, right?  Because if a kid starts using one of these devices in high school, the presumption is a great school.  The presumption. I don't know.  Do you think that's true that they will then go out into the world and they'll expect to be using Macs or Windows or Chromebooks?

Start time: 2039.00

Transcript:  I'd like to apply some skepticism to it.  But in the in the what early 80s, Apple gave every single public school in California, everybody had an Apple to an Apple to.  And I got an Apple to.  So I may be the product of that program.

It runs in a browser like with no plugins now.  It's just JavaScript. And yeah, it's amazing.  Wow. So so yeah, I think there is something to that that you become comfortable.  And if I was Apple, I'd be saying I want them to be comfortable with tablets, not laptops.  Right. And if you want to be comfortable with a laptop, a Chromebook can do that.  And that gets you comfortable with Google services as well, which I think is my son's got a an iPad one to one in his school.  But they're also all using Google Classroom.  So in the end, I think Google would be perfectly happy for that because Google's classroom tools are very good.

He's releasing an 8-bit program called Thimbleweed Park.  But I asked him, you know, my kids grew up on Freddy Fish and all these humongous games.  They were great games.  And I know what they would like to play.  I said, you can play them.  They have a called ScumVM because the Scum was the scripting editor that he wrote for those games, starting with Maniac Manor.  And I said, how do you feel about emulators?  And he said, I think it's great.  He did not feel like it was a ripoff.  I think probably the big companies like Bandai and Namco, who really don't like these emulators.

And the real problem, he agreed with me, the real problem is you're not going to be able to get an Atari 2600.  You're not going to be able to get a Coleco.

Transcript:  There was just a story about the Apple II archive is trying to find original games and original software.  Because a lot of the versions that are in the archives now are the cracked versions.  They're the pirated versions where the copy protection was able to be subverted.  And the problem with that, it turns out, is that sometimes the act of removing the copy protection has changed the binary  to the point where things aren't quite what the original was.  And it can actually introduce bugs.  So you have to leave the copy protection.  And all those disks are dying, right?  They're all going to they're all rapidly aging.  They've been out in the sun too long.  So they put out like the word, like if you've got original disks, original Apple II disks, we want them.  Because we want to be able to preserve those in their original form before they're gone.  They need to preserve the physical disk.  Well, they need to get the data off the disks in a way that they can preserve it.  Because right now, the only version they've got of that game is the cracked version.  And they want the real version untouched and with no crack screen put on it by whoever broke the copy protection.  They want the originals.  This is true.  I mean, I was just at a conference where one of the speakers talked about how software developers are like ice sculptors.  They make this stuff, but you've got to keep in mind it's ephemeral.  And without emulators, without things like this to preserve this stuff, it will just go away.  And like the iPhone is a good example where as every version of the iPhone drops support,  like the talk is that this fall, 64 bit apps will be mandated on all iPhones and iPads,  that anything that hasn't been updated and is a 32 bit app will just go away.  And how do you run that old version of that old app from five years ago?  Eventually there will be an emulator, presumably.  But will people have those binaries now that it's all in the cloud?  Are those files going to exist anywhere?

Transcript:  That's why this is so appropriate for the Internet Archive to have a Mac OS emulator  and to be able to run these programs because there are people now who have never heard of HyperCard,  have never used HyperCard, and they really ought to have experience of HyperCard  so they understand the seminal software.  I guess. I mean, it's good that it exists.

Transcript:  I actually wrote a piece not too long ago, and it was about the sounds that Apple puts in the Mac,  which I know seems really boring, but it's kind of like...  Apple hasn't updated its beep sounds in like 10 years.  And one of the things I did was I found emulated versions.  I needed to figure out when did they get introduced.  You've got to get like System 7.6 and OS 8 and OS 8.1 in order to find it.  And I could not have done that story.  I don't have old computers with old OSs laying around.  It was all done with the emulators.  But to underscore...  Thank goodness they exist.

Transcript:  Your point, Liz. I think the companies and creators don't look backwards so much.  Maybe we don't even... It's just part of history.  But look at this.  Nintendo, which made this...  This was the most popular product Nintendo made in years.  And possibly...  You know, it's up there with the Switch.  I'm sure the Switch is bigger.  This is the Nintendo.  $60 Nintendo Classic.  And it's classic.  It's the size... It fit in the palm of your hand, but it played all these games.  I can't remember. 30 or 40. Yeah, 30 games.

Start time: 2578.79
End time: 2645.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They killed it.  Article from Business Insider speculating...  This is Ben Gilbert speculating on why they killed it.  Nintendo said in a statement to IGN throughout April...  Nintendo of America territories will receive the last shipments of the NES Classic for this year.  If you want this system, check with retail outlets regarding availability.  We understand it's been difficult to find.  For that, we apologize.  We greatly appreciate the support and interest.  But that's it.  So here's at least his theories of why.  First, it was never intended to be a product.  It's merely a commercial.  Is that the case?  I mean, if you've got a $60 product you can't keep in stock.  Whether you think it's not, it's more than a commercial.  It is, right?  Nintendo has a history of creating collector's items.  Really, they go back... Goes back to their history as a card company.  Playing card company, right?  And so they've made it...  They have made a collector's edition.  And maybe... They didn't notice.  They said this year, maybe next year, they'll bring it back.  They do have the Switch.  Yeah.  And they want you to buy the Switch.

Start time: 2646.42

Transcript:  Okay, well, how about this?  Nintendo wants to sell you classic games on the Switch.  That's the answer.  There will be a virtual... As you said, a virtual console service.  And at some point, if there's...  What they did is they created demand for these games.  And now they took it away and said, oh, look, we can do it on the Switch.  Interesting.  We're going to take a break, come back with more.  Liz Gaines is here from 60DB60DB.co.  If you don't know about it...

Start time: 2734.00
End time: 2744.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the idea is you're giving them a briefing, but you're not approving their stories.  They get to write whatever they want.  So if you're going to invite... From Apple's perspective, you pick people you trust to not misrepresent what you're going to tell them.

Start time: 2770.06
End time: 2777.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does that mean that they don't have relationships right now with the big publications in the same way?  No, I think it may be to a certain extent.  Because they rotate their reporters more.

Start time: 2777.36
End time: 2792.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's possible that these are the people that they're more comfortable with.  It's certainly they weren't picking brands, right?  Because you could look at the brands who were there and say...  TechCrunch, Axios...  BuzzFeed and Axios readers don't generally care about the Mac Pro.  It's pointless.  Right.  But those are...

Start time: 2793.48
End time: 2795.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They invited Ina, not Axios.  Exactly.

Start time: 2797.14
End time: 2821.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and Matt Panzerino and John Gruber.  And you could argue that they could have just invited John Gruber, and that would have been fine because his audience is probably the best match...  They're the pro users.  ...for the people who care.  But they didn't want to just invite one person.  So they invited people that they trust, which doesn't mean that they're viewed as mouthpieces.  But that is touchy, right?  Where it's like they're being given a few days to go away and write this story and convey it.  And Apple has no say on what they say.  So they're picking people they think they can trust.

Transcript:  Liz, do you want zesty nacho curls?  I have not.  They're not one of these.  Blueberry almond quinoa bites.  Garlic plantains.  It's okay.  I won't hold it against you.  I love garlic.  Or peanut butter, graham jam, or nutty power clusters.  These are really good.  They're nut squares, walnuts, almonds, and cashews.  Give me the peanut butter, man.  You want the peanut butter, graham jam?  I got it.  Peanut butter is my favorite food.  Sorry, sorry, Liz.  I'll go with the garlic.  Garlic plantains.  These are nature bucks.  I love plantains.  These are the greatest snacks ever.  Now, I'm going to point out a few features of the nature box.  First of all, it comes in a nice box.  To your door once a month, a selection of snacks you can pick ahead of time.  Tell them whether you like sweet, salty, spicy.  You get your choice.  They're all designed to be good stuff.  No artificial colors, flavors, no artificial sweeteners.  Delicious snacks.  They're kind of pride themselves being snack designers.  So they have new snacks all the time.  They have 100 snacks so far.  If at any time you don't like a snack, they'll send you a new one.  It's the snack of the month club.  What could go wrong, right?  You can order as much as you want as often as you want.  You don't have to wait for the monthly box.  This is new and no minimum purchase required.  You can cancel anytime.  So they've really made it much more flexible.  All of these bags are easy open, but they're also resealable.  So sometimes you open a bag of chips and you feel like you have to eat the whole thing  because what are you going to do with a half bag of chips?  These are nice sized bags.  They're delicious.  If you read the ingredients, they're all super healthy.  Super good.  Big Island pineapple.  What's in it?  Pineapple?  That's all.  Just pineapple.  I don't know what I'm opening here.  Oh, blueberry almond quinoa bites.  Wow.  Roasted cashews, crispy rice, pumpkin seeds, roasted almonds, dried blueberries, rice syrup,  quinoa, palm oil, sesame seeds, natural blueberry flavor and sea salt.  That's all.

Transcript:  Yeah, they don't bother with the resealable and the zesty nacho curls.  Nobody's ever just-  I think that's probably a good one.  Oh, that's good.  You wouldn't expect a quinoa bite to be.  Yeah.  But that's really good.  No, you're going to like it.  Yeah, all right.  All right.  Pardon me while I-  Right now you're going to save even more because Nature Box is offering our fans 50% off your  first order.  How about that?  Go to naturebox.com slash twit.  I'm going to open the nacho curls.  What the hell?  These are so good.  You want these.  And you know what?  If you're a parent, you'll be much happier at your kids eating these than the other guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I never ding anybody for not having iOS app or an Android.  Apps are hard.  Apps are much harder.  We spent $80,000 to do a Twit app.  And notice there's no Twit app.  Yeah.  I'm never getting that money back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  It wasn't.  I didn't feel like it was good enough to release.  We said, well, thanks so much.  See you later.  Yeah.  $80,000 later.  So I understand making an app is unfortunate.  We're very lucky because we have fans who make apps.  There's apps on every platform for Twit, but none of them are ours.  They were all written by fans, so thank you.  Because that's a lot of work.  And in the way, I kind of thought, it's good.  We don't want to undermine the people who are generously giving their time in making  apps.  Let them make the apps.  We don't want to be the app business.  Thank you for making an Android app.  That's fantastic.

Start time: 3154.36
End time: 3192.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been interesting, though.  We put the app out there and we thought we were going to be this commuter app.  That's how I use it.  I listen to 60 dB on the way in and back.  Because you set it and then you get in the car and you don't have to push a button or  anything.  But more than half of our usage is over Wi-Fi.  So I think kind of by definition, not in the car.  So that's part of why we're making the app more.  It's going to look a little bit more like Spotify when you log in.  And there's like, do you want to have your morning coffee playlist?  Do you want to have your?  Oh, I like that.  Oh, I can't wait to get that.  So now you'll come in and you'll just be able to kind of pick your mood and get your more  sports flavor.

Start time: 3220.92
End time: 3222.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3222.48
End time: 3229.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 3241.77
End time: 3255.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  In a lot of cases, we cut segments because we think people want to listen topic by topic,  not necessarily someone's hour long show.  Totally agree.  And then that then you have like a diversity of sources coming in.  So stuff you wouldn't hear normally on the radio.

Start time: 3255.18
End time: 3266.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you can do Spotify for podcasts.  But if every podcast is two hours long, you're literally like, OK, Spotify, I can't wait  to see what's next in two hours, which is not interesting.  It's not really the same.

Start time: 3266.36
End time: 3271.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 3271.86
End time: 3307.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, like that is the whole other side of this.  This is so fascinating for me as a creator of content is I can see when people drop off  my stories. Oh, wow.  And I like I'm not sure I want to know that.  No, it's I'll show you on the back end.  We can do it for any show.  So it's like, can you imagine?  Because I before I did this one to the CDP, I was always writing.  And so, you know, like how long someone spends on your Web page.  But this is like, you know, which words turned them off.  Yeah. Like and I'll I'll redo a story sometimes if I get a big drop off, I'll be like,  oh, that was a bad lead because I lost like 20 percent of my audience in the first five  percent of the right track.

Start time: 3307.90
End time: 3313.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  them more. Yeah, I do think that there's some Trump fatigue.  I bet you want to listen to other stuff, too.  Yeah, yeah. Very interesting.  You also don't want to listen to five stories about Syria.  Like you'd want the one good story about Syria.

Start time: 3327.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. But the world is kind of like turning towards what we're doing.  Like, did you see that? So the New York Times has The Daily, which is a really great daily  news podcast. And then NPR last week launched a first.  So like people are kind of coming around to this like podcast.  Don't have to be once a week, not really news relevant, interesting  conversations or like highly produced stuff.  You can also do great daily relevant, you know, minute, hourly relevant, whatever it's  going to be. It can be quick.

Transcript:  How long have you been doing TNT, our daily tech news update?  Five years, six years.  Get no credit. Daily is hard, though.  Daily is very hard. It's hard to sell.  Not that that determines what we do editorially, but it is determines whether we can make  money on something. And it turns out daily podcasts, advertisers  tend to want weekly. They don't they want daily so much.  So we just we do it anyway.

Start time: 3381.80
End time: 3386.58

Start time: 3386.90
End time: 3439.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, consistency, whether you're weekly or daily is important.  But but yeah, I think people will watch TNT, our daily news show.  Love it. It's definitely built a very consistent of all our shows.  That's interesting. It's the most consistent in terms of number of listeners every day.  Oh, really? It varies very little.  The same people. Well, we don't know that.  We don't know who you are, but we do know the number.  So I have to presume it's the same people.  It's like like five thousand people stopped listening and five thousand started listening.  It's a very consistent number, which is not the case of any of our other shows.  They're much more volatile.  You know, you get a lot of listeners on even in Twitter, which is our highest,  most listened to show.  You know, some weeks it'll be a quarter of a million.  Some weeks will be one hundred seventy seven thousand.  It could be that much of a difference in one week.  And then, you know, but it's so it's very volatile.  And I've never figured that out.  It may be partly due to measuring technologies.  Could be podcast measurement is not good unless you've got an app

Start time: 3439.86
End time: 3443.16

So many podcast players, more often in video, but it even happens in audio,  will start multiple connections for the same show. Right.  So if you're listening to if you're watching Twitter with Windows Media player,  it might open six different connections that I don't want to count that as six.  People want to count that as one people.  So I do bounce it. I say, well, if they're all from the same IP address,  that's one download. Right. But.  There's also  it's also the case that a company like Microsoft  has maybe one IP address for everybody in Microsoft. Yeah. So  if 6000 people listen to a show in Microsoft, they're still getting counted  as one person. So, you know, there's there's an middle ground.  So what we what we do for the bouncing is  if it's the same IP address for an hour within an hour, we'll say that's one person.  As soon as it's into a second hour, we'll start.  I think I think we've tried different lengths of time in an hour,  I think is right, maybe two hours.  Then we'll say that's another person.  But we're still missing some large number of people at Microsoft. Right.  Because 1000 people could download it in one hour.  They would still count as one person.  So it's a it's a challenge if you're not willing to invade people's  privacies by putting, you know, making them use special apps or putting bugs  in the podcast or whatever.

I think this is why mid roll.  We're getting really inside here.  But like mid roll, which is a major podcast ad network, bought Stitcher.  And I think one of the things they benefit from from that is they get the data  from Stitcher and they get a better sample, not the whole audience.  Apple probably has the biggest slice of the podcast listening audience right now.  And they're not giving that data out.  But that gives mid roll, at least a little view into how things are performing,  because once you're in the app, you could theoretically follow individual app  in-app behavior.  And then you know what they're playing and pausing and subscribing to  and all of those things.

Transcript:  Look at how we're making progress in ad blockers.  And now where was it? Princeton has come up with a way.  This is a university has done research.  It's a mother board called an ad blocking super weapon.  So you're scared now.  Well, it's unfortunately only affects banner ads on websites.  But what they're doing is they're actually looking at the team  of Princeton and Stanford, looking at the actual content.  This will block native content as well.  So that's one of the things when a, you know, websites know that you're  not reading the ads, whether you're blocking them or not, you're not seeing them.  So what they do is they make content that looks like it's real content.  They know an article you might read, except it's not.  It's an ad posing as real content.  We call it native content. It's all the rage now.  Again, we will never do that to you.  But lots of sites, including some pretty well known.  Have some more nature box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. The New York Times even says no, but it exists to trick people  into reading content, thinking it's real editorial content when it's not.  In any event, clearly these guys think it is because this will block native content.  It also looks for, you know, there's many ads that,  including Facebook ads that bypass ad blockers that can't be easily blocked.  This will do it.  And the reason it works and watch how long this loophole exists  is because the FTC says that ads have to be clearly labeled  so that a human can recognize them.  Well, that means so can a machine.  And so they're looking for those, you know, weasel words that indicate,  oh, what you're seeing is an advertisement.  And so as long as the FTC continues to require advertisements to clearly labeled  be labeled, these ad blockers will work.  As the author points out in his motherboard piece on this  motherboard is supported by ads.  So Jason Kobler writes,  so I'm probably biting the hand that feeds me talking about this.  And this is part of the ethical issue is  we got to find a way to pay for content  while not offending our viewers.  And so that's why I bring this up, because, you know, clearly we have to find it.  We need to we need to pay for our stuff.  You need to pay for your stuff.  But we don't also want to invade privacy.  So I think there needs to be some sort of relationship between  the content creators in the end and the community so that  we don't step on you and by giving you ads.  So you can if you're curious about the Princeton Stanford ad blocker,  there's a Chrome extension that is not a final version.  It's a proof of concept, not fully functional.

Transcript:  I'm skeptical of any declaration that this will end the war, though,  because I feel like what this will do is escalate something that may actually be  a little more insidious, which is it'll make the content.  If you're using computer vision, right, then you could also use computer vision  to design ad units and other content that is not as visible by the computer  vision, which probably means that your ad, your banner blindness will go away.  So they will create even more diabolical ad units  that even humans can't determine.

Transcript:  I think one of the big the shame of the web is that the advertising on it is so bad.  Because advertising, you know, advertising is not fundamentally bad.  In fact, if you remember the great days of of magazines, like people loved the ads.  That's right. Ads can impart information.  They can be beautiful. They can be interesting.  Good TV ads can be good.  Advertising can be good. It doesn't have to be bad.  But on the web, advertising is almost always bad.  And because it's been driven to this lowest common denominator,  auction based kind of stuff.  And so, I mean, it's a shame because I think it's kind of ruining it for everyone  that the the web ads are so terrible.

When I read it closely, isn't exactly what you think it is of the people who stream  of the people who use over the top streaming services.  Seventy five percent of them have Netflix.  Well, what a surprise.  Pretty much everything you buy, whether it's a Chromecast, a Roku, an Apple TV,  a microwave has Netflix on your TV, has Netflix on it.

Start time: 3956.36

So of that, more than half are using over the top services and seventy  five percent of those have Netflix.  Right. Right.  So it's you know, Netflix is the leader, but YouTube is catching up.

And they're not I have to say quality level.  So it's an interesting question.  Do you make more of a lower quality or do you make fewer of a higher quality?  HBO makes fewer of a higher quality.  Amazon is kind of notorious for just cranking the stuff out.  And obviously they watch they're very  they watch the data very closely to see who's big and who they're going to continue  to invest in.

Transcript:  Well, because when you get when you peer into what they're doing,  they will not give you numbers.  But they do.  They are they are very aware of what people watch, how long they watch,  what other things those lead to.  And that ends up going into their content deals about what they buy and what they  relicense if it's not an original.  There's a lot of analysis of viewers behavior happening behind the scenes.  What happens, though, is then their competitors want to know, like, how give  us a number, give us a Nielsen number, and they refuse.  And it frustrates everybody else.  But they seem very happy with it.

Start time: 4144.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So they have the best data in the business, but nobody knows it.  And and so it's this amazing dichotomy where Netflix knows exactly what they're  doing and nobody knows really how Netflix is doing.  So it's fascinating to do that.  And I imagine Amazon has a similar guess.  They all do. Right.  Well, HBO, I guess, doesn't because if it's on regular TV, then they have to go  back to samples and Nielsen Diaries or boxes company.

You'll have to give it permission to give you ads and not just shows you watch  through Roku.  There's a system you may not know about called automatic content.  This is where they listen to the they actually can audio.  What you're they can see.  Well, and video, too.  They're seeing what you watch.  Now, you'll have to enable a feature called more ways to watch on your Roku TV.  It will then collect information about shows you watch, not just on Roku TV,  but anything that's on your screen because the screen has this ACR built into it  and can actually tell Roku, oh, yeah, right now he's watching the cable box  and he's watching Game of Thrones.

And and and like now that Netflix embedded in that 4K TV is good for the TV  manufacturer because they're they're giving you a reason to plug in to Ethernet  or something or get on your or your home Wi-Fi.  And once that TV is now on the Internet, they can get data from you.  And so can the CIA.  And that's what Vizio got dinged for.  But it's the same kind of idea that we want.  Oh, it's a smart TV. Get it on the Internet.  But, you know, it's a two way street at that point.  They can get your data.  I mean, they aren't necessarily, but it's just a computer sitting in your house  and it may have a camera and it definitely can see what your screen is.  And it's going to report back.

They're going to make it impossible for you to opt out.

Oh, my God, what a world.  Let's take a break and talk about my doorbell.  Speaking of Internet of Things, do you know about the Ring Video doorbell?  This has become the king of the category,  partly because Richard Branson put twenty seven million dollars into it.  Ring is growing fast and I see more.  I'm really pleased.  I see more and more rings around the neighborhood.  The Ring Video doorbell.  I think I must have been the first in my neighborhood.  I got mine installed a couple of years ago.  And by the way, I'm no handyman, but it was easy to install.  The Ring doorbell comes with everything you need to do it.  And if you've got a wired doorbell, it's really fairly easy.  There's just two screws holding that in two wires in the door.  Jam. It comes with a screwdriver.  If you needed a drill, it has a drill drill bit.  It has a level even so you can make it look nice.  And it comes in a variety of finishes.  So it replaces your wired doorbell, pairs up to your Wi-Fi.  And suddenly you never miss a visitor again.  And, you know, I originally got it because I didn't hear the doorbell ring.  Like a lot of homeowners, I have the worst chime.  Why is it door chimes?  Do you have a good one?  No, I don't have one at all.  Yeah, it's hard to hear.  Right. You know, ours wasn't even that old.  It went donk.  It didn't go dun dun dun.  It went donk.  So you wouldn't hear it.  So I initially got the ring because I thought, well, my phone's paired to it.  I'll hear my phone. I have my phone on.  And actually now, because Lisa has it and Michael has it, everybody in the family,  the whole house lights up with somebody.  Not even by the way, it's when they ring the doorbell, you hear dun dun dun.  But when they walk up the stoop, walk up the path,  you the motion, there's motion detector in it.  It sees you.  It sees them and it rings us then.  So I can look at, in fact, the other day, the kids were alone.  We went to a movie and the kids were alone and you heard the people coming  and going and I was looking and I say, oh, yeah, that's fine.  And then one of the kids was like locked out and I pressed the button and I talked  to him because it's got a microphone and speaker in it, too.  And I said, Tanner, what's going on?  He said, they locked me out. Why'd they lock you up?

And so you're really in touch with what's going on in your house.  I love that.  Recently, Ring introduced a new product and they're constantly doing new products.  This is called the Floodlight Cam.  It's the world's only motion activated  HD security camera with two high beam LED floodlights.  So it lights up. This is what you want, right?  You want it to light up the area of your house  and it has 110 dB siren alarm.  By the way, that's pretty loud.  110 dB.  That's that everybody's going to hear that in the neighborhood and two way talk.  So you can say things like if you don't step away from the house,  I will press the alarm button and then deafen the guy.  Customizable motion zones and dual sensors.  So, you know, no more false alarms.  It's got object and face detection.  So it can help.  Man, this thing is so smart.  It's hardwired. It's weatherproof.  It's available in black and white.  And you can use the Ring app not only to talk to and listen to what's going on,  but to flash the lights, sound the alarm and zoom in, zoom in to focus.  That's why it has a face recognition.

Transcript:  Unbelievable. All right.  Vault 7, Vault 7 is the CIA hacks, mostly old.  Actually, we know they're old because Microsoft announced  this week that they'd all been patched.  Yeah.  So they're quite which raises the question.  How did Microsoft know about these attacks?  Yeah, I mean, they're not.

Start time: 4848.02
End time: 4861.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they and they apparently were alerted what in  October, but didn't release the patch.  So it was not quite a zero day.  But then it was released publicly.  I mean, the speculation I've seen is that they had a  they had a partner.

Start time: 4862.82
End time: 4913.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody told them which is a or something like that.  Not a reason to get angry.  To be honest with you, that is a reason to be thrilled that there is some sort  of channel that after the CIA uses a hack,  you know, they discover a vulnerability or they buy a vulnerability.  That's great.  They don't want to tell Microsoft yet because they want to use it against  somebody. But having used it against their person,  I think that's really the best thing the CIA could do is say  and it could be under surreptitious channels.  Hey,  Microsoft, there's this flaw.  We're done with it.  So would you you could patch it now and don't tell anybody.  I think that's fine. Clearly, that's what's going on.  And I actually feel like that's a good thing.  One of the fixes, I presume, was this was it this word vulnerability or  is that still that must be fixed.  Now, right?

Start time: 4915.00
End time: 4953.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so. Yeah, they fixed they fixed the the word patch that was used.  That was also and this is this is like state intelligence actors doing all of  this. This is government spies using security flaws.  And so part of the disclosure becomes, I think, part of a game, which is if if  the NSA doesn't need this and they know that some bad guys are using it, then they  just maybe disclose that to the vendor and say, you should close this hole.  But if the NSA wants to use it and thinks it's in their benefit to use it, then they  don't disclose it, right, even if it puts American data at risk because they don't  want to lose their their tool because these these bugs are tools to spying agencies.

Start time: 4953.92
End time: 5005.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this was the this was not the CIA.  This was, as you say, the shadow brokers leak.  It was a Microsoft Word booby trap that loaded PCs with malware.  And Microsoft says it's it's it's been fixed, but it was a zero day.  And it was first found by researchers at McCaffey.  So it infected your machine.  And this is the real thing.  I mean, we've known about word macro  viruses for a long time, but even if macro and of course, Microsoft as a result  now warns you before you runs in a document with macros, it says there's macros in here.  Those are potentially in safety.  You want me to run them?  Didn't matter on this one.  Even if you didn't have macros turned on, it would run and it even worked against  Windows 10.  So thank you, NSA.  Thank you.

Start time: 5006.08
End time: 5036.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's I mean, there's the larger question of just the.  At what point should a government disclose  bugs that they find that are security holes?  What is the responsibility of using those as your own spy technique versus closing  the holes so that the people in your country aren't being spied upon by others?  You know, right, because it's our government knows that there are bugs  that allow this to go on and don't say anything.  It's because they want to use the bugs.

OK.  This one was discovered by FireEye.  The hackers left a series of booby trapped documents on a server with an Italian IP  address and I guess they were hoping you would just download them or maybe they  linked they probably linked to them.

We do not allow this kind of content on Facebook.  Oh, well,  that's nice to know against the community standards.  It's against our standards.  We take our responsibility to keep people safe on Facebook very seriously  and are in touch with law enforcement and emergencies when there are direct  threats to physical safety.  It's unclear whether Facebook notified the police or somebody else notified the  police.  Doesn't matter.  Well,  I mean, I guess it would be good if Facebook had some sort of system for  monitoring and catching this kind of stuff as it happens.  Doesn't save anybody's life, but at least it  prevents Facebook from being used as a vehicle for this kind of stuff, or at  least discourages people.  What's wrong with people?  Sigh.  You see the prison.  Here's a happy story.  Prisoners who were working  in the prison on their computers.  This is an Ohio's Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections Center.  They were fixing computers and they would steal parts bit by bit.  Then they built  they built two PCs from the parts, hid them in the ceiling and connected to the  state's network.

That is it's the same idea is that there are certain malls that have recast  themselves and they've gone higher end. Yeah, they've been successful.  But there are a lot of them that are just  falling apart because, you know, their anchor stores are losing.  Yeah. And those are not drawing people in.  And it turns out that so many people are  preferring to shop at big box stores or on the Internet that the traditional  shopping mall is now a lot less appealing.  And so some of them can redefine themselves closing like 100 stores.  But a lot of them can't. And like Sears and Kmart, which Sears owns, Kmart,  that that is a company that may not make it at all.  They may just go out of business.  And so what do you do with that space and how do you turn it into something else?

But when I want to refill, when I want that shoe again, if I can get it on Amazon,  I'll just get it again because I know it fits and I know that I like it.  Yeah. So it tends to be like the first purchase is at a store.  But then if I want 10 more down the road,  they don't get my sale because I paid them for their marked up first version.  But then in the end, it's just so much more convenient to say, you know,  it's six months later and I want another one of these.  I'm just going to have it.

I mean, you talk about the coal, the coal miners earlier.  Like that was that was something that happened.  It's it already happened.  But the fallout happened after the fact.  So you lose the transportation sector to automated trucks.  Elon Musk this week. Right.  That was that was in our little show.  He says there's going to be semi trucks later this year.

Our show today brought to you by Betterment.  This is, speaking of robots, the best way to invest for your future.  You've seen technology transform commerce, entertainment, ride sharing, home security.  Did you know it can also help you invest better?  Betterment is the largest independent  automated investment service and has changed the industry by making investing  easier and in a fraction of what you pay for traditional financial services.  So it's better and it's less expensive.  Is that awesome?  Betterment offers smart technology and human advisors.  And they're one of the few that does it. I really like this.  So you get the best results at every level of investment.  The automation is great because it can help you build a portfolio,  but then it also monitors it and rebalances it and keeps track of it  minute by minute in a way that a human can't.  But at the same time, you want to be able to talk to professionals if you've got  questions, and Betterment offers a team of certified financial professionals  and licensed financial experts who will help you.  They'll monitor the accounts.  They can answer questions.  So you get everything you need,  including if you want planning calls and notifications throughout the year.  This is really the way to do it.  Betterment's goal based investing framework and advice algorithm will let  you know if you're on track in seconds, in fact, you can go there right now  and get a checkup.  You can also securely sync outside investments with Betterment so you can see  your total net worth in one place, get an idea of how you stand all round.  They've got something called smart deposits,  which lets you automatically invest excess cash.  That really helps build your nest egg fast.  Their retire guide will give you a  consolidated review of your retirement, calculates your gap if you've got one.  And they do, of course, all the most important things that only software can do.  Well, like tax loss harvesting, which lowers investment taxes and increases  after tax returns, no trade, no transaction, no rebalancing fees ever.  And no minimum to sign up.  Global diversification, smart rebalancing, lower fees.  With all of that and their really great system, you can expect returns  higher than the typical DIY investor.  And it's so much easier.  Their end to end investing means faster cash transfers, tax forms available  at the earliest possible dates, secure investing.  It's Betterment. It's a better way.  As with everything in life, I should say investment involves risk.  But, you know, there's a risk if you just put your money in the mattress, too.  Right now, get one month managed free  when you make an initial deposit of ten thousand dollars or more.  To learn more, visit Betterment.com slash Twitter.  That's Betterment.com slash Twitter.  Betterment is investing made better.  Oh, this scared me.  And I'm this isn't really a news story except just a beware.  Folks at Wordfence have discovered using Unicode, a new way to spoof URLs that  look they look exactly the same.  And the issue is here you could have what looks like Epic.com in your browser bar.  But it's not.  It's actually Xn dash dash E1 AWD 7 F dot com.  But Chrome and Firefox render it as Epic.com.  I'll show you right now. I'll click it.  This is their demo site.  And if I go to this site and it's safe to do so, it's not going to hurt me.  If you look in the browser, I don't know if you can see this,  but it looks like Epic.com, except it isn't.  And you could if you really knew what you were doing, you could view the certificate.  But it takes a little bit of effort to go to the settings and the tools.  I could actually go to developer tools and I can I can look at  the certificate and the certificate is reported correctly.  Sorry, I'm doing this kind of funny developer tools.  And then I go to the security tab and I can see even though it says Epic.com.  Oh, I'm on the wrong page.  Let's go back.  Even though it says I'm on Epic.com, if I view the certificate, it shows  as the actual certificate, which is that Xn dash dash E1 AWD.  So I know it's hard to see.  It's a little small on my screen,  but that's a little scary and it has to do with the flaw in the way the browser  renders text thanks to Unicode.  So there is a fix in Firefox.  If you go to about colon config and search for puny code,  you could change the value from false to true for this network dot IDN dot show  underscore show underscore puny puny code is there is no fix right now in Chrome.

So always when in doubt, if you get an email, see if you can type in where they  say you should go and make sure that it's the dot com probably domain that you  intended to be, because otherwise they can mask that stuff.  So it looks legit, but it isn't.

So we talked about like we did the sandwich thing because you've got to do a sandwich thing.  We talked about what makes a villain into a super villain.  Where is the line there?
