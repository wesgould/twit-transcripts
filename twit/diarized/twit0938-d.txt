Transcript:  Slowly. Senator Shoshanna.  Now I don't know what to do. I guess I have to say on X, which doesn't come off right.  You don't have to say. Shoshanna's on X.  Gosh, Paris Martino, you don't, you don't, you're not, you're not Paris Martino on X.

Start time: 180.58
End time: 204.10
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  I'm not. I can't get behind it. No. It feels wrong. But what do we call it?  The app formerly known as Twitter. The app formerly known as Twitter.  In the same way that we refer to Google as Google, even though it's technically part of Alphabet.  And you call Facebook. I think we can do this. Yeah.  I don't know why we've decided not to do that for Facebook and we're calling it meta.  But I think we can do it for X. X just sounds so dumb.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Paris writes about the company formerly known as Amazon on the information.  Wonderful. Wonderful publication.  Also with us from our very own This Week in Enterprise Tech.  He is a code, a self-described code monkey at Microsoft.  Hello, Lou Maresca. Hey, Leo. Great to see you.  It is wonderful to see you. And is at Lou M. M. on X as well?  I think it is. We're all on X today. I'm not on X. I got off X years ago.  Actually, I of all. You're an XX. I'm an XXer.  Of all people, I'm the happiest about the name change because I've been fighting with Twitter over the name.  Because we're twit and we predated Twitter.  I remember asking Alve Williams in the early days of Twitter.  Why did you name it Twitter? You knew there was Twitter.  His first company before Twitter was Odeo, which was a podcasting platform.  And we were one of the biggest podcasts on it.  So I knew he knew who Twitter is. He said, I didn't think either of us were going anywhere.  It didn't really matter. But Twitter obviously did.  And the title of Chief Twit in particular.  Oh, I was so mad when Elon. I've been Chief Twit for 15 years.  Anyway, Elon is no longer Chief Twit. He's Chief X.  Honestly, I feel like we won. Like, see, we outlasted Twitter. So there.

Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  That's true. Yeah.

Start time: 292.08
End time: 292.98
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I'm actually very happy.

Start time: 293.18
End time: 299.00
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  You could launch a platform called Twitter now.  I'm sure it'll be selling the brand name at some point.

Start time: 299.04
End time: 301.82
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's interesting. I don't need to buy it. I have the trademark for Twitter.

Start time: 303.24
End time: 307.00
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  You could though. Could be fun. Then you could turn it into a micro-vlogging platform.

Start time: 308.06
End time: 334.50
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We had an unofficial gentleman's agreement with Twitter back in the day that we wouldn't do micro-blogging.  Kind of like the Beatles and Apple.  We wouldn't do micro-blogging. And they wouldn't do podcasts.  But they launched spaces. They have a lot of podcasts on the network.  They've got, you know, what's his name from Fox on there doing what is effectively a podcast.

Start time: 335.72
End time: 338.00
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  I think it's technically a vodcast. There's a whole video element.

Start time: 338.16
End time: 340.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, what are we doing? We're vodcasting, right?

Start time: 341.63
End time: 343.00
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  Yeah, this is definitely a vodcast.

Start time: 343.14
End time: 378.50
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. So anyway, we kissed and made up.  It's involved a small check. But other than that, everything is fine.  And I'm just really pleased now that Elon has seen the light and rebranded.  Have you seen, speaking of seeing the light, and I'm not, I think I can't play this without warning people  if you're sensitive to strobes and flashing lights, you should turn away.  Elon has put a giant X sign above Twitter headquarters.

Start time: 378.60
End time: 384.50
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  See, Leo, that's the sort of disclosure that would be nice for any of the people living in the surrounding area.

Start time: 386.79
End time: 408.34
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the sad thing. So here it is being erected.  And I'm sure Elon likes that word because it really doesn't. It looks pretty janky.  I don't know what those poles are, but the city.  There's a lot of sandbags up there.  Yeah, don't you get that feeling? Yeah.  The city of San Francisco has already said that's against permit. You got to take it down.

Start time: 409.50
End time: 432.82
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  Yeah, but the city of San Francisco has been saying that everything Twitter X has been doing  is against permit since Elon Musk took over and started turning conference rooms into hotel suites.  The company formerly known as Twitter. Yeah, the company formerly known as Twitter.  Installing fire safety code violation locks.  They've been breaking the rules since the beginning and he just seems to keep getting away with it like he does with everything.

Start time: 434.66
End time: 444.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's clear that his attitude is do it and ask.  It's better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission.

Start time: 445.52
End time: 450.76
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  I don't think he's even asking for forgiveness. I think his mode is just do it.

Start time: 451.08
End time: 480.02
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. The video that he posted did not flash.  It's just blinking slowly, but I've seen many, many subsequent videos of it strobing.  And the neighbor and seeing buildings across the way just brightly lit, but this thing is very, very bright.  It was turned off last night apparently, so maybe he is listening or forced to listen.  Apple has said that you can't make an app with one letter.

Start time: 482.90
End time: 484.36
Speaker: Shoshanna
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, I didn't know that.

Start time: 484.92
End time: 487.68
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You didn't really plan it all that well. You get the feeling?

Start time: 491.80
End time: 531.00
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  I mean, this has been a kind of through line since the PayPal days where I might be remembering this incorrectly, but I think I'm right.  He had bought x.com way back when originally for a couple million dollars and really angled hard for them to rebrand PayPal as X.  Despite all of the focus groups and testing being like people don't like the name X. It reminds them of porn.  We can't do X. People are using PayPal as a verb. Why don't we just stick with what we've got?  But since the beginning, he has been dead set on doing X for everything, no matter the cost, which is just baffling to me.

Start time: 531.66
End time: 575.94
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He bought it in 1999, so he's owned x.com since then. Indonesia banned x.com because they thought it was a porn site.  I don't know if they fixed that, but Twitter was blocked in Indonesia for a while.  But you're right. Even when he was 28 in 1998, Musk wanted to do the everything thing app that would do all your banking, all your investments, all your money would go through this.  Yeah, like WeChat does in China. And he's even said when he bought Twitter, he said that's what the future of Twitter was.  So I guess it shouldn't be a surprise that it rebranded it X.  Throwing away though, do you think he's throwing away a valuable brand, Lou? I mean, Twitter's been around since 2006. It's pretty well known.

Start time: 576.12
End time: 587.30
Speaker: Louis Maresca
Transcript:  You think about it. There's not been a lot history wise. There's not been a lot of companies that have been able to rebrand themselves successfully without losing a bunch of things.  I mean, there's some out there that have changed their view points on things.

Start time: 588.68
End time: 594.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Even Alphabet still calls the search Google.  Right.  They didn't call it the Alphabet search.

Start time: 596.64
End time: 623.50
Speaker: Louis Maresca
Transcript:  Right. I mean, there have been some that I would say that in history, like I remember Google when it first started out, they were called something real strange, like back rub or something like that.  I can't remember what it was, but it was they changed themselves really fast.  It was back rub, wasn't it? Yeah.  Something like that. Yeah.  Yeah. And so I think they, you know, they did it really quickly before they became popular.  But I'd say after that, a lot of companies, they might change their images like GoDaddy or something like that, but they never really changed their names.  So I'm curious to see if this is going to be successful or not.

Start time: 624.34
End time: 634.72
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Economic Times says Google was called back rub and Pepsi-Cola was originally, oh, I just it just blocked me.  Pepsi-Cola was originally named Brad's drink.

Start time: 636.19
End time: 645.86
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  Okay, I think we should bring back Brad's drink.  That's great.  That is the, that is, if I saw something called Brad's drink at the store, I would buy it.  No further questions.

Start time: 646.00
End time: 648.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if it's good enough for Brad, it's good enough for me.  Why not?

Start time: 649.56

Start time: 653.08
End time: 664.40
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  Amazon was early going to be Kadabra, something that Bezos had picked up from the dictionary and then Relentless.  I believe if you still type in Relentless.com, it redirects to Amazon to this day.

Start time: 665.06
End time: 671.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that was his kind of philosophy is to be relentless.  Let's try it. Relentless.com. Yep.  Pulls right up.

Start time: 671.68
End time: 679.34
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  There we go. Wow. Pick up where you left off and get some dumbbells, Leo.  You could do some weightlifting while you're recording.

Start time: 680.46
End time: 688.94
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I am so ashamed.  I was, I apologize.  I was looking for some dumbbells because I want to pump me up.

Start time: 689.00
End time: 692.82
Speaker: Paris Martino

Start time: 693.88
End time: 710.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  These dumbbells weigh 0.01 kilograms.  It's like a faint breeze.  They're not very, they're not very, but they're just right for me.  And hey, pink is my color.  These are, yeah. Yeah.  I just thought, well.

Start time: 710.64
End time: 713.50
Speaker: Shoshanna
Transcript:  I believe in you to do a little more. Just a little, little more.

Start time: 713.50
End time: 717.18
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A little more? You're going to push me?  Are you going to be my trainer Shoshana?

Start time: 717.50
End time: 719.28
Speaker: Shoshanna
Transcript:  Yes, I'll be your trainer.  One more rep. Oh, I can't.

Start time: 724.80
End time: 737.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what is the, what are the odds that Elon will make Twitter into the everything company?  Can he, WeChat is a good example.  I mean, it is dominant in China.

Start time: 738.20
End time: 747.62
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  I'm sorry. What is the, are you asking that he's actually successful in making it into an everything company or that he tries?  Because those are two very different questions.

Start time: 748.20
End time: 756.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  With a straight face.  I mean, clearly there's some roadblocks.  First of all, I mean, the most obvious one is would you trust him with your money?

Start time: 759.08
End time: 759.80
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  Not in a million years.

Start time: 760.50
End time: 775.36
Speaker: Shoshanna
Transcript:  He keeps like stealing, like not letting people cancel their memberships, right?  Like imagine just like throwing all your data and bank information and investments at the guy who can't like be trusted to have you cancel an eight dollar a month subscription.

Start time: 775.96
End time: 812.98
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was very nervous when I bought a Model X and this is before all this because Elon had famously canceled somebody's Model X.  I had a Model X Tesla.  I did very famously.  There was a blogger, I think, who said something bad about Tesla and Elon canceled his Model X reservation.  So I have this reservation.  I really wanted this car back in 2014 or 15 and I realized that I was in the mercy of Elon Musk.  If I said something bad about Tesla, he could cancel it.  So it's good because you've never done that.

Start time: 813.04
End time: 814.21
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  You know, you only.

Start time: 815.56
End time: 816.28
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love Elon.

Start time: 816.50
End time: 819.39
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  I just you only talk about how much you love and revere him.  Elon is so great.

Start time: 821.05
End time: 829.99
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There are you go to Twitter there.  You say anything negative about Elon and there are lots of blue checks will brigade you.  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 831.19
End time: 831.67
Speaker: Shoshanna
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 832.50
End time: 836.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why are you still on Twitter then Shoshana or X?  Why?

Start time: 837.62
End time: 859.98
Speaker: Shoshanna
Transcript:  It's just for work, honestly.  Just the people I want to reach are still sort of there for now.  So figure reporters and people who work in House and Senate.  Those are a lot of my big audience.  So while they're there, I'll be there.  But I don't really like the platform is increasingly sucking and being a pain.  And we're cutting back already a lot of our engagement there just because it's not worth the ROI anymore.

Start time: 860.10
End time: 876.89
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I do notice a lot of members of Congress, mostly the left, have moved to Metta's platform.  I always want to say glances.  I have what's it called?  I forgot.  Threads.  Threads.

Start time: 877.52
End time: 880.36
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  That's the name of it.  Are you guys on threads?  Are you using threads?

Start time: 881.04
End time: 886.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, the story is 100 million people joined in the first week and 50 million left the second week.

Start time: 887.29
End time: 927.90
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, engagement is down 70 percent.  I feel like that threads from my perspective.  I think threads only exists for people who already have large Instagram followings to repost threads to their Instagram stories.  But I also don't really use threads because for me, at least the people, my social media profiles on Twitter and Instagram could not be more different.  My Instagram is private for a reason, and I like to use it to interact with people I actually know.  And my Twitter is for shitposts and work related stuff.  And those two audiences should not mix.  But I think that's I'm curious.  Have you guys been enjoying threads?

Start time: 930.00
End time: 1015.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have initially because it was it was the all the people I followed on Twitter had moved over.  And so it was very much like my old Twitter was with, you know, without the Elon, the dash of Elon that has been thrown in.  But at the same time, I had misgivings.  We talked about this a couple of weeks ago.  I had Dan Patterson on who's done a lot of work in countries where Facebook has been appalling in its willingness to support dictatorships and its unwillingness to take down genocidal posts, things like that with the Rohingya, with Myanmar.  And so he practically busted a gasket when he said, but you can't support Metta.  And I've heard other people say that, too.  And I say, well, do you have Instagram?  Well, yeah, but I don't have a Facebook account.  Do you have WhatsApp?  Well, yeah, but I don't have a Facebook account.  It's all Metta and it's all the same.  They're all connected and they're all connected.  And I do have an Instagram account only mostly because on the show, if I want to show somebody's Instagram, I have to be logged in to see all the posts.  So I keep it for that reason.  I don't really post there.  And I use WhatsApp when I'm out of the country and I need to communicate with people who aren't in the US.  Most of them use WhatsApp.  So I guess it's kind of like you.  I stay on. I don't use Twitter, but we do as a company because that's you know, you still have to have some sort of presence there, I guess.

Start time: 1017.13
End time: 1049.97
Speaker: Shoshanna
Transcript:  I think that's starting to go away, though.  I've been like our engagement has just totally dropped.  So we do a lot of just re-upping old posts that are relevant, just policy stuff that's still going on.  But I stopped doing that.  Like what's scheduled is scheduled.  But beyond that, I'm not doing any more because our posts aren't getting much engagement.  It's not the same level of like, oh, I saw your tweet.  Therefore, I wanted to meet with you stuff.  So now we're kind of moving strangely enough to LinkedIn, which I want LinkedIn to do a little bit more because I think there's a lot of potential that they're not tapping sometimes.  And I email a lot of email.

Start time: 1050.78
End time: 1070.69
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, LinkedIn for our street seems like a perfect place to be.  Now, let me not pigeonhole you, but I always get the sense when I look at our street.org, it's a think tank.  But I also notice it says free market.  So I get the sense it is maybe somewhat right of center.  It's not.  It's not.

Start time: 1071.02
End time: 1098.35
Speaker: Shoshanna
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  So we're right of center, but our staff are all over the spectrum, which I really like.  Like, it's funny, a lot of our editorial team leans very left, which is super helpful because then if they're editing our stuff, they can be like, hold on.  You don't know how this comes across and then give us feedback and think like, OK, think through this again.  This way you upset nobody rather than upsetting some people on the left because I know you don't mean it to sound like that.  So it's nice that we have people across the spectrum, but we definitely lean right.  We're like center right.

Start time: 1099.50
End time: 1132.59
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I always think of you as somewhat like the magazine Reason, which is a libertarian publication where it's not dogmatic.  It's not it's not ideological.  There are like the Heritage Society or whatever dogmatic ideological think tanks.  You're not one of those.  So I always I read your stuff because I do feel like it's it's kind of it's good to see another point of view on it.  And it's fair.  It's there. It's thought out.  It's not like, you know, right makes might fascism.  Thank you.

Start time: 1133.24
End time: 1134.84
Speaker: Shoshanna
Transcript:  But I know I really appreciate that.

Start time: 1135.54
End time: 1153.33
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's true.  But at the same time, you might say if you're right of center, the Twitter or on me X can't do it.  Twitter might be it might be a good home.  You'd be more likely to find people who agree with you on on on Twitter, which is definitely moved to the right.

It's not like, oh, I think we should have mildly smaller government and think through this.  It's like just MAGA like all these weird that stuff.  It's and we're not that which is like we'll work with people who are if we can get good stuff done.  But we're pretty we're pretty like middle of the road, but we lean right.  So we liked it when there was kind of everyone involved because then we could reach all different kinds of people.  And that was good for us.  But now it's like if you are willing to pay for a blue check, you're probably very, very, very right of center in a way that probably doesn't align with us.  Which is OK. But it just it's not as useful.  And our engagement is just down.

Although if members of Congress are there, as you say, although, like I said, threads also has a lot of members of Congress, a lot of brands.  The brands jumped on it very hard.  And I think the brands are the most desperate to find a replacement for Twitter and have yet to find one.  There's blue sky.  There's there's threads.  There's a lot of wannabes.  I guess you include mastodon in that.  But nobody has has taken the crown.  Is the crown going to be taken is the question.  Do is there going to be a next Twitter?  I mean, or is Twitter going to come back?  Or do we not need this kind of microblog platform to begin with?

Transcript:  I don't think that there's going to be a next Twitter.  I mean, maybe there might in.  I think the thing that made Twitter the platform that it is that made it this huge platform for it made the thing about Twitter that worked as a platform and made it different from, say, like Instagram or Facebook or Reddit is that it was really good for live events, live cultural moments.  I think it's a platform that you could be watching a football game or an episode of The Bachelor or, you know, the Oscars or something you could comment live with other people.  And sometimes total nobodies would blow up.  Sometimes celebrities would blow up.  Virality was kind of baked into it.  But also this like real time cultural following aspect.  I think the thing that threads is missing is sure you have a baked in audience already because you're easily able to follow the folks you're following on Instagram and vice versa.  But it doesn't have that real time feed.  I haven't been on threads kind of since it launched, but I don't believe it has hashtags or things like that.  It seems more like Instagram than anything resembling Twitter.  And I think that that is why threads will never replace Twitter as kind of that cultural touchstone in the same way.  I think the threads might continue to exist and thrive as kind of an offshoot of Instagram, but I doubt that it will replace it in that way.  And I'm not sure that another platform will emerge anytime soon that kind of has that same factor.

Transcript:  Threads is very limiting, too.  They require you to have a device to use. You can't access it on the web.  They have a lot of restrictions. I think they're limiting their base, I think, at that point.  I can guarantee that grandmothers are not going to install another app.

Transcript:  They have added that tab, though, right?  The latest edition of threads has a for you and a following tab, although it reverts, as Twitter has for a long time, to the for you tab.  It doesn't maintain your setting. I mean, they at least listen to people on that.  I have to say, Tony Bennett passed away very sad this week.  He was 96, so it wasn't unexpected.  But, you know, a lot of people posted memories and so forth.  And normally I would have gone to Twitter.  When to find out, you know, in fact, when you see on trending, it used to be if you saw somebody's name on trending, you'd go, oh, I found out threads and threads had a lot of great posts about it.  Same with Sinead O'Connor, who passed also this week.  I thought threads really had a lot of beautiful stuff.  Maybe that's the people I'm following on threads.  I have noticed that it's a lot less busy than it was when it started.  There definitely is a drop in usage.

Like it is a jolly Twitter.  I think also, technically speaking, it fascinates me as a feature that I think I don't know why Twitter or other micro blogging services haven't adopted, which is much like Twitter.  You can see your following tab of real time updates from whoever you follow, but you can essentially create your own algorithms, whether it is something that is popular with friends, posting your mutuals, and anybody can create their own algorithm.  So they have a feature where you could say, essentially, I want to see you can type even in plain text.  I want to see mostly positive posts from people I follow and nothing about dating or relationships with an emphasis on cat photos, and it will create a feed like that.  You could also get technical about it and go in and kind of create your own custom algorithm.  I guess like how hard is that to do?

Skyline.gay is the thing.  So if you're looking at it, it will allow you to kind of create a timeline.  The base feed could be something like the people you follow or your mutuals or kind of what's hot, and you describe what you want to see more of in plain text.  So you could say like, I want to see wholesome tweets, fun banter.  I want to see less of like angry posts or posts with politics.  And kind of the AI will assign a match percentage to each post.  And you can kind of customize how aggressive you want the AI to be.  I just think that is so cool.  I've been able to create...  So the thing is you can both create your own timelines or you can follow other people's timelines.  So I mean, I...  Let's see, I'll pull it up here.  Yeah, I have a variety of feeds.

Transcript:  And then there's one somebody created called Black Sky, an attempt to recreate black Twitter, for instance.  And so, well, I have to be a little careful showing...  I'm not porn.  It's not exactly porn.  One of the ethoses of Blue Sky is that you can show your body even if it's not pornographic or traditionally, you know, it's not a thirst trap.  And so there's a lot of people's butts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's right.  I think that Blue Sky is very interesting.  There are a couple of things that make me nervous.  In 2001, Jack Dorsey funded it with $15 million when he was running Twitter and it's still on the board.  So I'm a little nervous.  They created their own...  The idea was to create a federated social network so that other people could host instances.  And they created instead of using Activity Pub, which is what the Fediverse uses, they created their own protocol, AT Proto, which is a fine protocol.  It's a good protocol.  It's just different.  But they've yet to allow federation.  So there are no other servers yet.  And the same...  By the way, Threads promises the same thing.  Threads says we're going to be on the Fediverse.  We're going to support Activity Pub.  But I don't think there's a lot of incentive really.  I think the real...  The strong incentives are to create a centralized network like Twitter.  Yeah.

Speaker: Shoshanna
Transcript:  On that note too, like I really like Blue Sky.  I think that if it developed well, it could be the next thing.  And it could be better.  I love all the customization, but not allowing people in until they have invite codes.  It's still invite.  And that's really holding it back.  Yeah.  And also, I think with having the instances, I get the appeal of it.  But I also think that some people overstate the appeal of it.  I know a lot of my fellow tech nerd friends are really into it, but my normies are not.  They kind of want to see a little bit of everything.  And if you're going to limit them to, oh, you can only see tech nerd posts, or you can only see Barbie posts.  Or like, this is where you go to talk about each thing.  I think it ends up being self-limiting in a way that constrains the platform.  And it's a little bit more old school.

Transcript:  There's another thing keeping any one of these from being the next Twitter is that they all are there.  There are many, many more we haven't mentioned.  And so there's no consensus that, oh yeah, we're all...  When MySpace gave way to Facebook, there was just a broad consensus.  Yeah, we're all moving to Facebook.  I don't know how that happened.  But there are so many choices.

Transcript:  I think the thing is that happens slowly over time.  And I think that that's kind of part of the...  I remember someone asking me right when Elon Musk had bought Twitter,  during that week when everyone was posting their tearful goodbyes,  like the site was going to implode immediately,  they were like, oh, what do you think is going to happen with the downfall of Twitter?  I'm like, downfalls of social media sites don't happen in a flash.  It happens over a period of time.  People stop using the site slowly.  And then eventually new sites are going to take off.  And we don't really know what that new site is going to be  and whether it's even going to be a microblogging platform to begin with.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I guess that was the root of my question was, do we even need...  Linda Iaccarino, sort of vaingloriously the new CEO of Twitter,  proclaimed it the new town square.  No.  Do we... I hope not anyway.  Do we need a town square?  Do we need one place everybody goes when somebody dies  or when there's an event that we all can go and talk about?  How important is that?  I think, I feel like all of you, maybe not you, Lou,  because you've recused yourself as a nerd,  but I think people do want...  We want...  You know, you don't want a town square exactly,  but we want a community that we can go to and talk, right?  Does it have to be the same one for all of us?

Transcript:  I like the idea of having lots of different ones,  like just, you know, maybe there's one where there's a bunch of people  and then there's maybe another one where there's also a bunch of people  and you also have those silos.  But I think it's kind of an all of the above thing,  that different people are communicating in different ways,  in the same way that some people have more stuff they want to put on Discord  and some people have more stuff they want to put on Instagram.  I just kind of see it as very all of the above kind of thing  and like let a million flowers bloom,  and I think they will if the platforms for them are created.

Transcript:  Tweeting, skeeting and threadzing. Oh my.  Lou, do you, I mean, you probably...  I do think, I think Shoshana's suggesting that LinkedIn,  for a lot of kind of more businessy people,  is the place, is the incumbent in that regard.  Do you use social media, Lou?  I mean, you post for work.

Start time: 1896.18
End time: 1930.24
Speaker: Louis Maresca
Transcript:  It's all, I think LinkedIn by design does that way.  I think that, I do agree with having lots of different places  to go to be part of some kind of a community.  I think these places have to have some kind of a critical mass.  Like for instance, is Reddit all the time.  I use...  Reddit's for me the social media.  Yeah, so these are places where people can kind of be themselves  or be behind a screen name and still help and talk and chat.  And I think that threads might be a particular audience,  and so will some of these other ones, and they will have their purpose.  But there's not going to be one town hall to rule them all.  I don't think that ever will exist.

Transcript:  Is that a loss?  I mean, see I grew up in an era where there were three networks,  and if you were lucky maybe you got four different TV channels.  So the chances are very good that when you came to work in the morning,  everybody had watched Johnny Carson, and you could talk about what you saw.  And there was a certain community,  and maybe more importantly, a national identity  that we had that we've lost, right?  Right now everybody complains about how polarized the country is.  I'm not proposing the fact that there are so many TV channels  as being the cause of that.  But there is a schism, a fragmentation of community  that hurts us a little bit.  We don't have a national identity anymore.

Start time: 1979.30
End time: 2045.76
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  I mean, I think that this is something where...  I think that it was a fallacy that there was ever an actual national identity,  just because there were these touch points where  maybe a significant part of ones in group,  like we're all watching the same TV show or the same newspaper.  I'm not certain.  I mean, obviously I wasn't alive during...  I wasn't watching those three TV channels like you,  so I might be wrong here.  But I think that the world was always deeply splintered,  and that people had more of just...  We're filling in the blanks with the thought of,  oh, other people must be experiencing the world like me.  And part of what we are now having to reckon with,  with the torrent of content we see on social media platforms,  is that other people do not experience the world like you.  Other people are having wildly different reactions  to a wildly different array of things,  and that is very alienating and difficult to face.  But it's true.  I'm not sure that we can ever put that genie back in the box.  But it's the reality.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's the truth, yeah.  I think that's very astute.  I think you're probably right.  And because I'm an old guy,  I have this nostalgia for...  You know, there's a lot of nostalgia for the 50s, right?  For this period of time where we were all unified,  and Eisenhower was president, and the middle class was strong.  It was like that for some people.  If you were black, maybe you don't have such a good feeling about that time.  So you're exactly...  I think you're right.  I think that maybe that's a form of amnesia, nostalgia,  and maybe wearing blinkers a little bit, blinders,  because it maybe wasn't the same for everybody.  We just pretended it was.  Louis, you said we don't need a national identity.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, China's an example of a centralized national identity.  It's top down, but that's a good point, right?  And actually, that's what I was getting to,  is that WeChat could occur because the Chinese government  strongly supported it.  Here in the United States, it would be very difficult  to do something like that,  because that's not how we're very much more bloody minded,  independent minded in the US.  And I think Elon's fantasy of an everything app  is just not something that America has ever wanted,  or could even do.

And like, they just way overdid it.  And everything was possible on Facebook,  and it was kind of incredible that they built that.  But it was also like, who wants to do this?

I was trying to list all the payment methods for a provider.  I was saying, well, how do you want me to pay her?  She was not a prostitute.  I was paying. I just realized how horrible that sounds.  It was actually for my wife, who wanted to tip,  she'd forgotten to tip her esthetician.  I said, well, ask her which payment system she uses,  and we can pay her.  And I started listing them, and they go on and on and on.  There's an infinite supply, which is good.  You know, you can, I mean, you ask a kid, my son says Venmo.  My daughter says cash.me.

So great to have all three of you here.  Our studio sponsor and our show sponsor today, ACI Learning.  I know you've seen the signage all over,  but you might say, well, who is ACI Learning?  Well, I know you know the name IT Pro.  They've been one of our best sponsors and good friends  for more than a decade,  since they opened their studios in 2013.  In fact, Lisa and I flew out  when the brand new studios opened in Gainesville.  We love IT Pro.  Now you get all these additional resources.  As part of ACI Learning,  IT Pro has elevated their highly entertaining,  bingeable, short format IT training,  with over 7,200 hours now to choose from.  And that's not a lot of backlog from old stuff.  No, it's all current.  They have seven studios running Monday through Friday all day  to keep that content current.  They're adding new episodes every single day  because the IT world is a very changing place.  Constantly changing the certs,  the questions on the cert tests,  software gets updated, new software comes, old software goes.  If you're not updating regularly, you're out of touch.  And you will love ACI Learning.  As an example, it's great for individuals,  it's great for groups if you've got an IT team,  But let's say you're an individual looking to get into IT.  You will get a world class personal account manager at ACI Learning  who will be with you every step of the way  to make sure you're getting what you need  to be successful in your field,  to make sure you get the training you need to get that first job.  And if you're already in IT,  fortify your expertise with access to self-based IT training videos,  interactive practice labs,  you can get practice tests,  one user shared, excellent resource,  not just for theory but labs incorporated within the subscription,  it's fantastic, highly recommend the resource,  top class instructors.  Let me talk about the practice labs, that's very cool.  You don't have to have Windows to become a Windows expert.  All you need is an HTML5 browser, you could use a Chromebook,  you could set up Windows servers, Windows clients,  all inside the browser in their practice labs.  You can break things, it doesn't matter,  I just close the tab and move on.  It is a great way, MSPs love it too,  a lot of MSPs use IT Pro not only for training,  but these ACI Learning practice labs let them test and experiment  with software before they deploy them.  So it's really a great way to test stuff as well.  Now, let me talk about the practice exams,  because the best way, I know this from back when I was in high school  taking the SATs, the best way to prepare for a test  is to take it a few times upfront, practice with it.  You can take practice IT cert tests  so that when you do sit for the final exam, it's familiar,  you're comfortable and confident.  ACI Learning brings you IT practice exam questions from everybody,  Microsoft, CompTIA, EC Council, PMI, all the certs.  You can access every vendor and skill you need to advance your IT career  all in one place.  By the way, ACI Learning is the only official video training for CompTIA,  so if you want to get those A+, Network+, Security+, certs,  those are the certs people often start with,  the best way to get that first job.  But check out their Microsoft IT training.  They've got Cisco training, Linux training, Apple training, security, cloud.  They've got it all.

Big story in the New York Times this Sunday  about concern over Elon Musk's power in the stars.  That's what the headline said.  The tech billionaire has become the dominant power  in satellite internet technology.  Starlink has 4,500 satellites up on its way to 42,000.  It is already with 4,500 satellites,  and this is an actual picture of the 4,500 satellites orbiting the Earth.  50% of everything orbiting the Earth is Starlink.  50% of all Earth satellites, Starlink.  And one of the concerns is Elon seems a little unstable, shall we say.  What? Really?  Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  was talking in March, according to the Times, with General Zaluzhny,  who's the leader of the Ukraine armed forces.  And Zaluzhny said, because Ukraine uses Starlink  for communication in their military, right?  So General Zaluzhny said, I'm paraphrasing,  what's the deal with Musk?  He says, does the US have an assessment of Mr. Musk,  who has sprawling business interests and murky politics,  and the American officials basically said,  no, we've got no idea what's going on.  The fear, for instance, Musk has on Twitter several times said,  Ukraine should just surrender, end this war,  give a piece of Crimea to Russia and go on.  What if he decides all of a sudden to turn off Starlink for Ukraine?  That would be the end of the war.  He could literally, unilaterally, give Ukraine to Russia.  A legitimate concern.

I often, in my mind, I think people who lived under Stalin as an example,  in the Soviet Union under Stalin, who was arguably worse than Hitler,  I mean he killed more people than Hitler, it was horrible.  But if you're just living in a suburb of Leningrad and just trying to get your life,  you can't think about that.  You just live your local life and hope that it doesn't affect you,  and I think that's what a lot of people do.  They just survive by narrowing in, and yet here we are.  We're in a news organization.  We've got to cover this. This is a big tech story.  You can't just say, well, we're just going to muddle along, Shoshana.  We're just going to muddle along.  It could go bad, right?  At least nine countries, including, this is New York Times again,  including in Europe and the Middle East, have brought up Starlink  with American officials over the last 18 months  with some questioning Mr. Musk's power over the technology,  according to two US intelligence officials briefed on the discussion.  Few nations will speak publicly about their concerns for fear of alienating Mr. Musk.  Oh boy, maybe we've dug a hole for ourselves  that's going to be pretty hard to get out of.  Oh, that's the Boring Company, of course.  That's the other company.

Transcript:  We've talked, there's more people in the space field actually,  Oh, can you do more on space policy?  We want to see what you're thinking,  which is flattering and strange.  I didn't think that's where I'd end up in life,  but kind of cool that I have with other tech stuff though.  I kind of feel like things really have worked themselves out  in addition to existing regulations.  Like fraud's illegal.  So when Meta had its fraud problem and was inflating video views,  that was already unlawful and the FTC was like,  no, you can't do that. That's fraud.  So we know fraud's bad and like fraud's something you can't do  and it's covered by existing law.  But with other stuff, I mean, some of it's just anger at free speech  from elected officials.  And you see that a lot in hearings when they're like,  Oh, well, this person criticized me.  Why do you still have them employed?  Or, you know, there's not enough of this on your platform,  but it's all matters of free speech.  So I think, I mean, it's not to say that they're capable of doing  that, but I think most of the proposals just have not been  tailored to fix problems, but have been tailored to limit speech,  which really concerns me and makes me want government less in it.  Because while, you know, tech companies are by no means perfect,  I think they're a lot better than what a lot of the elected officials  are proposing in a lot of cases.  Yeah. I mean, so when I see Lindsey Graham and Elizabeth Warren

Transcript:  So they have written an opinion piece together, I guess, for the New York Times.  When it comes to big tech, enough is enough.  They are promoting legislation to regulate big tech, I guess.  And on the one hand, it's clear big tech is not going to self-regulate.  And there are absolutely instances where big tech has gotten too big,  and it's appropriate for somebody to do something.  But I agree with you, Shoshana.  I know Lindsey Graham doesn't want to regulate big tech because, you know,  he feels like it's bad for the people.  He wants to regulate it because he feels like conservative speech is being censored.  And I know Elizabeth Warren doesn't care about conservative speech being censored.  She was the creator of the CPFB.  She wants consumers to be protected.  So they have opposing points of view, and yet they have united to create legislation.  They say this is their proposal.  There needs to be a regulatory agency.  And I'm sure that sends chills down your spine, Shoshana.  There needs to be a regulatory agency to regulate big tech.  They say in 1897, the Interstate Commerce Commission was formed to take on railroads.  In 1914, the Federal Trade Commission was created to protect against deceptive acts and practices.  In 1934, the Federal Communications Commission took on radio, then TV, the NRC in 75.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 77.  We need a nimble, adaptable new agency, they write,  with expertise, resources, and authority to do the same thing for big tech.  And they've introduced the Digital Consumer Protection Commission Act.  They want to create the Digital Consumer Protection Commission.  I don't have high hopes.

Transcript:  It makes me feel good when people who don't agree with me and all the fundamentals can also be like,  oh, something's kind of off here.  Senator Graham for years in Senate judiciary has basically been proposing this and saying we need an agency.  But if you listen to his rationales, it's all First Amendment stuff.  He's angry at the First Amendment and the way free speech works.  And I wrote about this a couple of months ago, actually, in National Review, basically, to remind conservatives,  like, hey guys, this isn't going to work out great for us.  And if you don't like who's in charge, then maybe you won't like how they regulate free speech in that way.  And you shouldn't even if you did like who is in charge.  But Graham's been on this forever.  Warren just really likes agencies.  It's fine if that's her thing, but she just really likes creating new agencies.  That's like her vibe.  And I think the two of them together are like, oh, we're a new agency.  We'll do stuff for tech.  It's frustrating too, because they haven't really identified something that government cannot do now.  Congress can still do stuff and the FTC can handle stuff.  They haven't really identified any new capacity need or any new specific need that doesn't already exist,  which for me is always kind of a big thing.  Like if the authority exists elsewhere and it's capable of handling it,  and also your job is kind of to do this as Congress, maybe go that route.  Graham wants online platforms to have a license in order to operate.

Speaker: Shoshanna
Transcript:  Like that's literally what it is.  And my other policy heart is occupational licensing reform.  So I see, you know, left and right, how government tries to use licenses to stop people from doing stuff for no reason,  from arranging flowers to giving tours to people.  Actually giving tours, pure free speech.  And those get struck down a lot when they go to court because it's really unconstitutional.  And they're like, hey, why don't we nationalize this terrible idea and like make it applied to way more things.  And then I just kind of like die a little on the inside, you know.  Yeah, that's actually a perfect example of over regulation because I mean, this is regulatory capture in a nutshell,

You have to have a license to drive a car.  You have to have a license to sell real estate or practice law to sell insurance, to sell stock.  But the largest companies in the world are not licensed.  Right.  There's a huge difference.  There's no regulatory agency with any meaningful power to hold them to account.  You can't sue them in court.  Of course you could sue them in court, by the way.

His vision of parks was we're going to build tennis courts and swimming pools and beach facilities.  And we're going to take over.  Six thousand parking spots.  Ten thousand.  The first that it had ten to parking with ten thousand parking spaces on these two bath houses on Jones Beach in Long Island.  And he did it.  But but but he didn't he was really for white people because he didn't he thought poor people, especially black people were dirty and he didn't want them to use the facilities.  So your dad was absolutely right.  They made sure that all the overpasses were too low for buses because they didn't want people who couldn't afford personal autos to come to Jones Beach.  And they made black people go to the farther ends of Long Island.  Now, admittedly, this was in the 20s and 30s, 40s and 50s.

If you were going from New Jersey to Rhode Island, you had to go through the streets of New York, every intersection one by one with these massive backups.  It would take hours to get across Manhattan.  So he wasn't completely wrong.  There was a problem to be solved.  It's just and I guess that's really the nut there that often there is something that needs to be solved.  And sometimes you give somebody so much power that they build a paperclip factory and consume the universe.  Anyway, let's hope that Lindsey Graham and Elizabeth Warren are shot down.

Speaker: Louis Maresca

However, there's two there's things that are very broad, like, you know, there's like gravitating company companies that are very broad.  I mean, how they're going to do that, like how they're going to there's no information about how they're going to prohibit companies from doing stuff and growing too big.  And what's the what's the penalty? Yeah.  Right. Yeah.  And I think that that means that it's open to interpretation, which means leads to a lot of other problems in the future.  So I think the GDPR part of it, the consumer protection part of it does make sense.  I think they should break that out and do that separately.  I think that would definitely help people.  Warren's website has a one pager.  Which is probably all I'll ever be able to get through.

The Warren Graham Digital Consumer Protection Commission Act would create a new commission to regulate online platforms and data processors.  So that's interesting.  So Tesla, for instance, might not be regulated.  Create.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Create.  Yeah.  But it will all the social platforms were.  That's got to be Lindsey Graham in there.  Create an independent bipartisan regulator.  Oh, that'll stay bipartisan for a while.  Charge with policing the biggest tech platforms like Facebook, Google and Amazon to promote competition.  Okay.  Good.  And to prevent harm online.  I'm all for it.  It would empower the commission to enforce violations of the law.  Monopoly platforms.  So get this would risk losing their license to operate.  If they if they're really violating the law.  So it's pre regulation in a sense.  You have to get a license to be a company.

Like that's real dangerous stuff because they're these are speech platforms and they want prior restraints on speech, which are usually unconstitutional except in very rare circumstances.  I mean, like this would not get through the Supreme Court.  Everyone there would like laugh them out of court and be like, why did you pass this?  And why are you here?  Like every member of the court, like it's just wildly unconstitutional.  In addition to being just really, really stupid, like this is just going to enshrine the incumbents because no one else is going to be able to compete.  Like that's exactly right.

We understand the needs for like better privacy.  But instead of doing that, they're like, how about we do privacy but with other stuff and in a really terrible and unconstitutional way.

But, you know, and I don't know, like I call myself an originalist, but like I know that there's different flavors of it, too, where people just have genuinely different interpretations of the Constitution.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.  Oh my goodness, if you are hiring, bless you.  You are dealing with crazy economic uncertainty.  And I know this as a small business owner, the ups and downs, it's like you feel it in your stomach.  Don't you?  But now you got to hire somebody and the whole thing gets even worse.  If you're hiring more than ever, I think it's important that you hire the right person, that you do it fast.  Is that possible to hire somebody fast and get the perfect person?  Yes.  Thankfully, there's a hiring partner that's focused on you and your needs and that's Zip Recruiter.  From pricing to technology, everything Zip Recruiter does is for you and what works best for you, right now you can try them free at ZipRecruiter.com.  I can say this, I know this from personal experience, it's absolutely true.  We use Zip Recruiter, we've hired some of our best employees.  The thing about a company, especially a small business, it's made of people and great employees.  Oh man, that's fantastic. It's like the information.  All great people, it makes it a great place to work, the business soars.  But then you bring in one bad apple and the whole thing can go to hell.  It's really important you do the right thing. You hire the right people and this is how Zip Recruiter helps you do that.  Well first of all, straightforward pricing. So you know exactly what it's going to cost before you post your job.  That helps you stick to your budget. These days that's important, there's no surprises.  But then, assuming the right person's out there, and I think if you cast a broad enough net, there is that perfect person.  Zip Recruiter does that. It sends your job post to more than a hundred different job sites.  And then they do something that's very clever. See they have a million current resumes on file,  because people come to Zip Recruiter looking for work. They use AI to look at those, to look at your job requirements and to make a match.  Now they don't tell that person about the job, they tell you about that person.  So then you can look, you know, with your human eyes at these applicants and say, yeah, this person, oh that one's good, that one's good.  And you can invite the best matches to apply for your job.  Now why is that important? Well first of all, it brings people to you.  So it's much more likely you're going to find the right person.  Second of all, when you invite somebody to apply for a job, that is you are starting way ahead. Huge head start.  That is flattering to them, they're much more likely to go through the process, they're much more likely to take the job.  And you will be beating out the competition because you'll get to those talented people right away.  I think Zip Recruiter is fantastic.  Hire the best with the help of a partner who's all about you, Zip Recruiter.  Four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate within the first day.  Our experience has been within the first hour or two.  I mean really, it's kind of amazing.  Just go to this exclusive web address to try Zip Recruiter for free, ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  That's what we do, ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  Zip Recruiter is the smartest way to hire.  I think if we're talking privacy, we've got to talk about the NSA.  And they're lobbying, this is from a Wired story.  US spies are lobbying Congress to save a phone surveillance loophole.  So I agree with you, I think all of you, that our personal privacy is important.  We live in an ad-supported economy where advertisers really want to know about customers.  And so a lot of platforms that have, all the platforms that have advertising,  except maybe with the exception of podcasting, because we can't,  will gather information about all the people who visit and use that.  Facebook is a perfect example, Google too, with their AdSense,  use that information to sell those ads to advertisers.  I think that's fine, that's kind of how it's working.  You take that away, suddenly you don't have a backbone.  The information has to be, well it is subscriber only, right?  But the information has to be, well it is subscriber only, right?  There are very few publications that can do that, right?  Most blogs like The Verge and Gadget all have to have advertising.  We have advertising, I would love to be all subscription,  but on the other hand I also like it that you don't have to have money to listen to our shows,  you just have to listen to ads too.  Anyway, I think that that economy makes sense.  The problem is, all this information that's being gathered is,  and not just by ad services, but by your ISP and by your television set and on and on,  is being then sold on to data brokers.  And the data brokers who have no connection with you, you're not their customer,  they take that and sell it on to the highest bidder.  Which is why I think all of the upset about TikTok was misguided,  because China doesn't need TikTok to get information about me,  they can buy it on the open market.  It's all available.  So, Warren Davidson and Sarah Jacobs in the House have introduced an amendment which would,  by the way I forgot to mention one other point,  it's not just TikTok and advertisers that are buying this data, law enforcement is buying this data.  Law enforcement buys location data, and in fact according to this amendment,  military agencies like the NSA purchased data that would,  quote, otherwise, receipt require a warrant, a court order or a subpoena to obtain.  Why get a subpoena? Why get a warrant if you just go to the open market and buy it? Right?  So this amendment, which would ban more than half of the US intelligence community,  the NSA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Space Intelligence Center, among others,  it was added to the National Defense Authorization Act,  I think is a good thing. Yeah? We all agree? Shoshana is nodding vigorously.

Transcript:  It makes me so happy. I just love this concept.  The government is getting around the Fourth Amendment by buying data.  Senator Wyden has been on this forever, and he's a really big proponent here,  but this is a really big loophole that government just uses to evade the Fourth Amendment.  So it's one of my more on my side favorite things that the government's trying to reform here.

Start time: 5035.88
End time: 5164.50
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  God bless Ron Wyden. He's reintroducing it in the Senate as the Fourth Amendment is not for sale act.  He writes, Americans of all political stripes know their constitutional rights should not disappear in the digital age.  There is a deep well of support for enshrining protections against commercial data grabs by government into black letter law.  So yeah, they're going around. Your right to, it's not a right to privacy.  The Fourth Amendment says the right to against search and seizure, right? Yeah.  And it says you'll have to be warranted. It has to be probable cause.  Then the probable cause, you go to the judge. The judge says, okay, there's probable cause here.  Here's a warrant. You can go search that house or that car.  This gets around it.  The Wired writes, the extent to which the NSA in particular uses data brokers to obtain location and web browsing data is unclear.  Although the agency has previously acknowledged using data from quote commercial sources in connection with cyber defense.  Regardless, the NSA's lawyers have authored extensive guidelines for acquiring commercially available data.  Although we know the guidelines exist, but some of the rules are classified.  What we do know is the NSA is, according to Wired, lobbying hard against these two bills.  They say we need to be able to buy this data. We don't want to get now.  All right. Look, the NSA is protecting us against the worst kind of terrorism and things like that, right? Yes? No?  That's fair.  We will never know, right? I mean, that's the point.  It's so secret. We don't know what they're doing.  That's right.  But if it were the CIA, I might feel bad, but the CIA does international stuff. What is the NSA's charter?  The NSA can do anything they want.

Start time: 5216.54
End time: 5283.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Immediately, but at least he got the one picture.  Critics believe the data center, this is from Wikipedia, the capability process, quote, all forms of communication,  all forms of communication, including the complete contents of private email, cell phone calls and internet searches,  as well as all types of personal data trails, parking receipts, travel itineraries, bookstore purchases, another digital pocket litter.  Oh, and let's add all the stuff they buy from data brokers.  Some of this they're storing because it's encrypted and they're expecting some day to be able to crack that encryption and find out what you were talking about back in 2019.  So...  I mean, if they are really lobbying, and I have no reason not to trust this article, that kind of tells you that they are buying this data and they don't want to have to get a warrant.  I can understand that they may say, I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of the spooks, that's revealing our methods if we go to a court.  But there are FISA courts, there are secret courts you can go to.

Start time: 5283.08

Speaker: Shoshanna
Transcript:  Yeah, we have like a lot of secret courts. That's kind of like, if they're like, oh man, we don't have to go to the secret courts, that's so much extra work, we just want to be able...  That's really messed up.  That's truly messed up.

Start time: 5299.02
End time: 5324.88
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  That is a primary argument I believe that they've had before the Supreme Court often. They're like, oh, the secret courts are too much work.  The courts where I think they... the denial rate is something like, it's definitely below 5% if I'm recalling correctly.  It is like once in a blue moon, will their secret court requests ever get denied, and that is too much for them.  It's so hard to be the NSA, guys.  Again with the secret court. Again!

Transcript:  The NSA is in charge of signals intelligence. I think that's the short form of their mission, which means exactly what we just described.  Snarping up all the possible radio, telecommunications, internet traffic that can in order to try to figure out...  I mean, if you interpret it positively, in order to try to figure out what... you know, that's the terrorist chatter you hear about.  Where the next attack on the US is going to come from and prevent it.  And as far as we know, they're doing a great job.  There haven't been a lot of terrorist attacks on our soil since 9-1-1.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But that signals intelligence would have found... maybe it found that as well.  I mean, I don't want us to be unsafe.  It seems like they could go to the FISA courts, though.  It seems like they could go to the secret courts and say, look, you know, we need to buy this.  We need to know where Leo Laporte was for the last 40 days, just in case.  You know what the real issue is? I think it isn't Leo Laporte.  We need to know where every citizen of Manhattan was, who they spoke to, because you're using AI and other technologies to cross-reference and try to find patterns.  That sounds right, Lou.

Speaker: Louis Maresca
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, most people's data is just collateral damage to what they're looking for.  And so I think that's the main point, is just trying to connect the dots.  And sometimes it's going to have to go through everyone's data to find that out, essentially.

Start time: 5434.98

Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  I mean, I think we have, you know, part of our Constitution that does ostensibly protect us against unwarranted search and seizure.  And allowing an entire operation and part of the government to be constantly essentially searching and seizing our data all the time and having real-time access to where we are, what we're saying, and the things we are doing would technically be a breach of that.  I mean, obviously, I guess if the courts decide to rule against it and weaken that aspect of the Constitution, that would be one thing.  But I think that's probably where this is going.

There was a recent case, I think it might be going to the Supreme Court, where a, the FBI, I think, asked Google, they do this from time to time, give us the location of everybody near this 7-Eleven so we can figure out who the crooks were who robbed it.  That's a fishing expedition, right?  And it infringes everybody's rights.  You can't give a warrant.  Maybe, I guess you could.  Maybe a judge would say, yeah, you need that information.

Transcript:  Congress and, like, the federal government also just love extensive national security authority, even if it doesn't have stuff to do with national security, if it's ever done under the guise of it, like, that's staying forever.  And you can start to narrow a way out, but it's just really hard to do.  And I think a lot of this also just gets a third-party doctrine, because, like, data brokers are the third parties.  You know, the first party is the guy whose data it was, and then the government trying to get that.  It's like, oh, well, that's a third party, so they don't have any interest.  But years ago, the Supreme Court had a case, and Gorsuch also there had a really interesting opinion trying to figure out, like, the right way to see data property rights, and the court was all split on it.  But they basically said, yeah, people have an interest in their data, even if other people have it, which was good, because third-party doctrine really sucks.

Transcript:  I think we talked about this last week, but this is related. It's about cameras. They're everywhere.  They're everywhere. I remember the Petaluma, I guess, police, I don't know, city government, put up cameras on all the stoplights in the town, right?  And the theory is, what, they're going to catch speeders? I don't know.  But what's happening is, in fact, they're using software to collect every driver's license, every car make and model that goes by these cameras, and then cross-referencing them.  And so there is a case, and I don't know where it stands right now. I mentioned this before.  The Westchester Police Department had a surveillance system. It was built by a company called Recor. There are other companies that do this.  But it takes all the cameras, the police cameras, but also cameras in police cars, the traffic cams, and uses automatic license plate recognition to search for plates.  And usually, in the past, what it would do is, oh, we know the plates of this bad guy. He drove away from the bank robbery. Where is he?  But now what they're doing is they're actually getting all the plates. Westchester County has 480 cameras, collected data over two years, and noticed that there was a car that was stopping short stops all over the county.  The kind of activity that a drug dealer would engage in, going to the places that they knew that drug dealers would go to sell drugs and so forth.  Let me see if I can read you the...

Speaker: Louis Maresca
Transcript:  Honestly, unless there's explicit laws, like for instance, Washington State has one that says you can't use red light cameras or speed light cameras for anything other than traffic enforcement.  So you're looking for somebody who's stolen something. You can't do it. But I would say there's a majority of the states that don't have laws like that, which means they're probably doing it too.

Transcript:  This guy was driving down the Hutchinson River Parkway in Scarsdale in a gray Chevrolet.  But according to this new AI tool that the Westchester County Police Department was using, it was suspicious because it was on a journey typical of a drug trafficker.  It made nine trips from Massachusetts to different parts of New York, following routes known to be used by narcotics pushers, and for conspicuously short stays.  The Westchester Police pulled him over on those grounds. So they had this database of licenses. The AI said, this guy is suspicious.  They pulled him over. Yes, they found 112 grams of crack in his possession, a semi-automatic pistol, and $34,000. So the AI was right.  But at the same time, so this is similar, right? I'm sure that this is the kind of stuff the NSA does, except it's not looking for crack dealers. It's looking for terrorists. Or maybe it is. I don't know what they're looking for. No one does.  His attorney is now appealing it, saying because this is the specter of modern surveillance, the Fourth Amendment must guard against the systematic development and deployment of a vast surveillance network, invade society's reasonable expectation of privacy.

One project that I think is kind of interesting is there's this company called Adversarial Fashion, but I think just a program of one woman, but specifically they create merchandise like sweatshirts, t-shirts that look kind of like a jumble of patterns and text.  And essentially what they're supposed to do is they target these automatic license plate readers and you can see on them, they kind of look like license plates.  So if you're walking by one of these readers, it will read this and then insert junk data into the automatic license plate.

All grandparents.  How many grandparents are there in the world?  I guess 3 billion.  User growth is mostly plateaued for Facebook in recent years.  It's monthly user base and this is from Facebook's quarterly results, growing by 3% since this time last year.  That's half the growth rate of WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, which is why, by the way, Facebook bought WhatsApp and Instagram.  Instagram had a billion dollars was the deal of the century, it turns out.  Your company, Microsoft, is trying to buy Activision for $70 billion, 70 Instagrams.  And it's going to do it, by the way. Congratulations on victory.  I hope it's worth it.  It's a lot of money. It's more than they spent for LinkedIn.

And of course I'm trying to find it.  He always writes very good pieces.  About...  Gosh, he is really completely on everything going on in the world.  Private equity goals have a new way to steal from their investors.  Denazification, the truth of Germany's story.  Podcasting, let the platforms burn.  None of this is...  Oh, why they're smearing Lena Kahn.  My God, Cory writes, they sure hate Lena Kahn.  And of course what he's talking about is the Wall Street Journal and others saying,  Kahn, why does she keep losing? She's a loser.  She's 0 and 4 in the courts.  Why does she keep pursuing this stuff?  On the other hand, and this comes back to this government regulation,  this is the FTC's role.  And I think many of you listening may not agree with her trying to stop Microsoft from buying Activision.  Frankly, I think that was probably a fool's errand.  Although, she had a... I mean, there's a point to be...  I won't argue, but there's a point to be made there.  But she is going after things like...  It is easy to cancel a subscription as it is to make one.  Who could be against that?  The FTC is doing a lot of, I think, good work.  Okay, maybe they couldn't keep Facebook from buying within.  Maybe they couldn't keep Microsoft from buying Activision.  Perhaps because, you know, the courts are a little bit more bullish on trusts than the FTC.  And she's not doing her job.

End time: 6407.60
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  I mean, I think the thing a lot of people don't understand is that Lena Conn's goal, ultimately,  is to kind of shift the window on how the courts and the FTC view kind of the consumer welfare standard  and just generally how the approach to American antitrust law in general,  shifting it away from kind of the legal standards professed by Robert Bork.

Start time: 6408.58
End time: 6411.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bork was the creator of it, right? He was the guy...

Start time: 6411.64
End time: 6448.42
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  Yeah, he's the total father of modern antitrust law  and kind of centering it around this idea that should be all tied back to economic efficiency and consumer welfare.  And Lena Conn specifically, you know, believes that there should be kind of a new approach to all of this.  She famously wrote that paper called the Amazon, like, Antitrust Paradox.  And I think that when your goal is shifting an entire body's approach so dramatically,  it's obviously going to take a while. It's going to be kind of a long game that you're playing.

Maybe this isn't the right thing to do.  And I also want to thank you for not using the word overton when you said window.  So thank you for that as well. But I think you're right.

I mean, I think we all agree that there is some regulation necessary.  We also agree that sometimes you can overregulate and maybe government isn't the best way to do this.  But if not the FTC, if not Congress, then who? Nobody's going to regulate these guys.  We can't let the EU do it all.

Speaker: Shoshanna
Transcript:  I just like the consumer welfare standard.  I'm not a big fan of con, but I get why people are.  It's just a difference of like fundamental views and stuff.  But for me, it's just if there's no harm being caused and if the only issue is that something's really big,  I just don't think that should be the role of the FTC.  I'd rather them step in actually for rental car companies which steal money from people and put them in jail.  That seems like when Hertz was doing that, that seems like a very clear role for the FTC where local law enforcement  isn't really doing anything about it and there needs to be something to be done  because Hertz is throwing people in jail, which isn't cool.  I had my money stolen by Avis and it took a lot of time for me to get it back.  And to me, that's a lot bigger deal than just having seven clicks to do Amazon,  which is if she wants to go after companies harder, just strategically at this point,  I feel like it would be more worth it for her to do things that everyone is like,  oh yeah, no, this is ridiculous.  There's no way you can see the other side of Avis stealing money or Hertz throwing people in jail.  And then moving from there, if she wanted to strategically change the conversation,  just get some wins and then go a little bit more that way.

Transcript:  I mean, of course you could say do the low-hanging fruit.  But I think Khan has a larger, and I think Biden as well,  bringing in Tim Wu and Jonathan Cantor, has a larger vision for antitrust.  You know, Corey's position, and I think you probably agree, Paris,  because this goes back to Robert Bork, was the Reagan era shift in how we enforced antitrust.  And in fact, basically didn't.  Bork, you said, believed in the efficiency of markets.  And you want to preserve the efficiency as opposed to consider consumer harm or the harm to,  which I think is really important, the harm to innovation of these large companies.  It makes it very difficult to be, you know, if you're an incumbent pulling up the ladder,  because it's very difficult for the little guy to create the next big thing.

Start time: 6635.68
End time: 6696.44
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  And I think ultimately, like the important thing here is not even looking at it consumer welfare standard versus not.  I think that my understanding of Khan's kind of approach to this and this movement in general  is that they're seeing that what the current state of antitrust regulation looks at consumer welfare  in a very narrow manner in the sense of is this company's actions resulting in the cost of my,  whatever I'm buying on Amazon, being higher than it otherwise would be?  Is this having a demonstrable monetary impact on the consumer in a negative way?  And I think that the concept of consumer harm or consumer welfare is a lot more complicated than that.  And I think that part of this regulatory movement that they're enacting  is trying to unpack the second tier and third tier effects of a corporate action  in a way that then you could perhaps, you know, take regulatory action on it or not.

Start time: 6697.02
End time: 6744.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's easy. I mean, Corey talks about this when he's talking about en-shitification  and he uses Amazon as an example, as did Lena Kahn,  that it's easy to see in the early days of Amazon, it was great for customers, right?  But that wasn't the end game at all.  That stage two and stage three ultimately ended up in, you know, capturing more,  stage three was capturing more profit from both customers and businesses  and ultimately raising prices once there's no more competition.  And, you know, I think that that's, that is a more long-term, more nuanced look at consumer harm  than just, well, what's the price today of a book?  Books were cheap on Amazon for a long time until they cornered the market on books  and all your bookstores closed.

And it is free because, as John has pointed out, we already paid for it with our tax dollars.  Unless you're burning Matt off, in which case you don't get to watch it.  I don't know.  I watched the Beanie Baby movie last night.  Have you seen that yet? It's on Apple TV+.  It's about Ty Warner and his creation of Beanie Babies.  Is this a new movie?  Yeah, it just came out, a Friday on Apple TV+.  You're probably of the age where you might have had some Beanie Babies, you two.  Yeah? You three?  No Beanie Babies.  I've had Beanie Babies.  Yeah.

Transcript:  My daughter was really into them and we bought every one of them.  We didn't collect them.  Anyway, the story is actually interesting because he hired a young college freshman, kind of as an intern, a receptionist, $7 an hour receptionist.  Actually, it was less than that, it was minimum wage.  But she, and this is in the early 90s, she knew about the internet.  She was a computer science major and said, you know, we should have a web page.  No one had web pages.  They created the, she created the first Beanie Baby web page, but then did something really smart.  She noticed that Beanie Babies were being resold for profit on eBay.  Ty Warner said, we should shut that down.  She said, no, you don't understand.  This is creating a secondary market.  People will buy our Beanie Babies with the hopes of reselling them for vast sums on eBay.  I guess he got it because he let her do that and they got a lot of information, market information, by monitoring the, very early on monitoring the internet.  Something everybody does now for sentiment analysis, for dollar values, for which Beanie Babies to stop selling, which Beanie Babies to introduce.  And she helped make it the most successful toy company of all time with a billion dollars in sales one year.  But of course, as the story goes, it's actually a parable for our times.  Three women helped him make that business, including that college freshman.  He got rid of all of them.  When he got rid of the college freshmen, she said, but you're not going to get the market information.  He said, I don't care.  At which point they overproduced Beanie Babies, collapsed the market and went out of business.  But it's a true American story because he's worth three billion dollars.  And you might be interested in this.  He owns the Four Seasons Manhattan, the New York City Four Seasons.  And just, just the Manhattan one.  He owns that one and one in Santa Barbara.  Yeah. The Four Seasons chain runs it, manages it, but he won't let them reopen.  He closed it in COVID. He won't let them reopen. It's too expensive.  So it's, it's okay.

He also, this is what made me think of it, was all this time stashing money in a Swiss account so the IRS wouldn't see it.  Ultimately, I think over $400 million in a Swiss account, they caught him and they gave him two years probation.  Felony tax evasion.  He pled guilty to rob a 7-Eleven, they'll kill you, but steal $400 million from the IRS, no problem.  He did pay $50 million in fines and the judge said, your charitable works lets you off the hook.  So that's what made me think of it.

I wanted to say, honestly, I wanted to say Ty Warner, but I realized no one would notice.  I must've said Bernie Madoff, which isn't really a good one either.  He's dead. So he's obviously not watching NASA TV Plus, but Ty Warner, that was the real joke.  Now that you've now, and now you know.  We're all here.  The rest of the story.  The end of the line on the Uber fatal car story.  You may remember back in 2015, it was the, I think the first fatality from a self-driving vehicle.  An Uber killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona, who was crossing the street in the middle of the night,  in the middle of the street, by the way, not at an intersection, on her bicycle.  The car hit her, killed her, and there was a lot of conversation at that time.  Is it, are these self-driving vehicles unsafe?  Who gets blamed for a fatality in this case?  The, and there was a, now here's the thing.  There was a safety driver, and we found out from telephone records that she'd been playing a game  while this car was going down the street.  In her defense, it was the middle of the night. There was no, she, it wasn't easy to see.  Had she even been driving, she might still have hit this person,  but she came out of nowhere.  In any event, this week she pled guilty to account of endangerment  and was sentenced to three years of supervised probation, no time in prison.  It's a plea deal, so there was no jury. She was, she could have faced...

End time: 7519.98
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We weren't nowhere near the vehicle at the time, as you may remember.  The National Transportation Safety Board did have a lengthy investigation.  I'm not going to say her name, but the safety driver's legal team had shown every intention to make its defense  about shifting blame to Uber, arguing that she had been set up to fail.  And the NTSB found that the car failed to identify Hertzberg, the woman killed, as a pedestrian.  No brakes were applied, so the car just whizzed right through.  Uber, according to the NTSB, also kept a quote, inadequate safety culture,  doing little to protect test operators from the well-known phenomenon, we all have it, of automation complacency.  That's why she was playing a game. The car's doing great. I don't need to worry about it.  In the months before the crash, Uber had removed a requirement for there to be two test drivers, test pilots in each car.  Solo operators were often looping the same monotonous route on hours-long shifts,  left to self-police their usage of cell phones. Sounds like Uber's a little bit at fault.

Transcript:  Vasquez's, I'm sorry, I said her name. Well, I'll say it now.  Vasquez's attorney contend she was only listening to the voice.  Not playing a game, as operators are allowed to do.  The investigators mixed up which phone Vasquez was looking at in the seconds leading up to the fatality.  The defense attorney said in court, she was not watching the voice, Your Honor.  She was doing what she was asked to do by Uber, and that is to monitor the systems in the car.  Nevertheless, Judge, she's indicated the conduct itself was reckless.  She acknowledges that and accepts responsibility.  So, I mean, it's a tragedy.  There's a person dead.  We, at the time, kind of blamed Uber, but there was some question about the safety driver.  She's now basically bearing all the criminal blame.

Transcript:  It would be interesting though, like, I know, you know, and I understand why we're thinking that Uber might be like mainly at fault,  but I do kind of wonder, like, what if she was actually just watching the road and just, you know,  just like messed up?  Yeah, which happens all the time, right?  Yeah, and it's just hard to know in this case because I don't think that there was enough to figure out, you know,  if she was playing a game or even if she was just watching the road and missed it or something.

Transcript:  Well, and let's face it, there are many, many vehicles now from Waymo, Cruise, and others driving without safety drivers.  All over San Francisco, all over Phoenix, all over Los Angeles.  Any of you ever driven in a self-driven car without, have you, Lou?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, what are you going to do, leap to the front seat and grab the wheel?  Exactly, or jump out.  Yeah.  So, in a way, this is, this conviction is kind of the ancient history of self-driving vehicles.  We don't have test, you know, safety drivers anymore, not often anyway.  All the cars in San Francisco, both from Chevy's Cruise, GM's Cruise, and Google's Waymo are unpiloted.  They're empty.  And so far, you know, there haven't been any fatalities that I know of.  Maybe they're better at it.  Tesla did, and this story came out this week, create a secret team to suppress thousands of complaints about the driving range.  Tesla, now this is in the early days of Tesla, where they would, when you got in the car after charging up, predict a lengthy range of 300-some miles.  Then you'd get in the car, and as you're driving, that number would start to plummet precipitously.  And in fact, that was intentional.  Tesla would give an intentionally optimistic range.  Remember, in the early days of electric vehicles, there was real range anxiety, real concern.  There maybe still is, it's still one of the things that makes it hard to sell an electric vehicle.  But when you called Tesla to say, hey, what's going on?  My range was 353 miles, and halfway through the ride, it went to 12.  Tesla had a team to take that call and say, no, no, there was nothing wrong.  We're going to cancel your visit.  The reason being a service visit costs about $1,000 for Tesla, and there was a lot of pressure on service centers, long waits for appointments, and I do remember that.  And because really there was nothing to fix, all they'd be able to do is say, yeah, that's normal.  The car realized you weren't going to get the mileage we thought you were, so we adjusted it.  It is accurate by the time you get to run out of juice.

Elon quote, Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged.  When you buy a car off the lot, seeing 350 mile, 400 mile range, it makes you feel good.  Yeah, sure.  It sure does.

I don't know if you could say that today, but he was a great marketer.  And you could buy a normal car or you could buy it with insane acceleration or you could buy it with ludicrous acceleration.  And this is a thousand, multi-thousand dollar, probably four thousand dollar upgrade.  And all it meant was that instead of zero to sixty in six seconds, it would do zero to sixty in three seconds, right?  And all they, it's the same car, by the way, there's a knob.

You don't want to surprise somebody with this because the coffee cups go flying.  Stuff goes flying backwards.  There are a lot of videos of that.  But what I realized is this is probably dangerous because it would not only pin my head against the back like this, but I would start to red out.  And I thought, I'm going 80 miles an hour down a thousand foot straightaway into an underpass.  I probably should not do this anymore.  So this is what happens.

I'm supporting Elon's goal to get gas vehicles off the roads and to save our planet.  And so I'm going to, I paid a ridiculous amount of money for this vehicle.  But I'm kind of subsidizing the next generation of Teslas, which will be affordable.  But that was the theory, right?  He was going to release a Model 3 that would be 30,000 and everybody would buy it and then everybody would be electrified.

I look at the Lightning from Ford or all of them claim the control of their experiments say, hey, this car can go this far being a control.  But they never ever go that far.  The same thing in the analog of this is internet speeds.  You kind of pay for something, but you never ever get that speed.  It's like there needs to be something that enforces this so that when you do get it, you have a little bit of trust.  All of them are going to continue to do it if they're not forced to do it differently.

Anyway, moving, moving right. Did I say 3 billion meta users?  That's how we got started with this.  There are 3 billion meta users.  Good news. This is good news.  Android is now going to warn you if there is a Bluetooth tracker coming with you.  Not only an AirTag, but anybody's Bluetooth tracker.  They mentioned this at Google I.O. but they're now starting to finally roll this out for Android.  This was always a problem with AirTags.  The iPhone would say, you know, there's an unknown AirTag near you.  But Android phones wouldn't, it'd be easy to track somebody with an Android phone.  So the good news is Android has now added that capability.  It turned out Apple and Google are working on this together.  They said last May that they were going to draft an industry-wide specification specifically for safety,  focusing on how users could be alerted to unwanted tracking from Bluetooth devices.  That's really good news, especially because they don't often work together on this.  There's only a few things, but this one, you know, in Steve Jobs' era, he hated Google.  He sued them. He thought Android was a ripoff.  But I think now the companies are a little more mature.  Here's an example of what you'll see on an Android phone.  It'll be an unknown tracker alert, tracker traveling with you.  The owner of the tracker can see the location.  And I think for people who are worried about a spouse trying to track them,  or somebody that met in a bar, this was a very important thing to have.  So it's good.  Oh, wait a minute, except Google says the update is on hold.  The decision was made to wait to roll out these updates because Google is now working in partnership with Apple  to finalize the joint unwanted tracker alert specification by year end.  So, sorry about that.  This is mainly targeted at the consumer ones though, right Leo?

Start time: 8287.54

This will apply to tile, Chipolo, and Apple's AirTags, and other ones like that.  A little disappointing.  Google had planned to do this by now.  In fact, it's a little confusing because the story said they are doing it,  and then it says Android will now warn you about unknown Bluetooth trackers.  At the top, at the bottom it says, never mind, they're waiting till the end of the year.  Is that right?  I must be misunderstanding this.  Yeah, I guess there must have been some update that happened right after I.O.

Alphabet, Hanley, Topping, Earnings, Estimates, and the Hatchet person,  Google's CFO, was the first to announce that they were going to be doing this.  Google's CFO, Ruth Porat, is being bumped upstairs.  She's going to oversee investments for Google.  She will no longer be the chief financial officer.  So if you're blaming her for all the things Google killed, she's getting her just reward.  Actually, Microsoft had a good quarter, didn't it, Lou?  Very good quarter.  Yes, they did.  Go ahead, I'm sorry.  I was just wondering, normally financials are more for the stock market,  but it is important for companies like Microsoft and Google because of stock awards to employees.

Much of that, I imagine, was in Azure credits.  Nevertheless, Azure is very, very profitable.  At this point, it's really a race between Amazon and Microsoft  for the cloud.  AWS is still bigger though, right?

So the UPS strike has been averted.  What is Amazon?  So this is always an issue for Amazon.  I remember reading this in a couple of books about Amazon  that the costs of shipping were a big part of what's holding Amazon profits down.  Is that right, Paris?  Well, I mean, this has been kind of the...

Start time: 8555.00
End time: 8607.99
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  primary focus of Amazon, I feel like, over the last decade  has been building out different parts of its logistics network  in order to bring those costs in-house and bring them down.  So I mean, now, when you order something from Amazon,  it's coming from an Amazon fulfillment center where it's being stored,  even if Amazon doesn't own the goods.  That good is being, you know, packed, put on a truck  that is probably operated by an Amazon third-party contractor  who's probably dragging an Amazon branded trailer.  And that'll go to, you know, a different sort center  or kind of a delivery center that are all within this Amazon network  using a bunch of different third-party contractors  that are within the Amazon bubble.  So it's trying to lower its costs.  I remember anecdotes in Brad Stone's second book,

Transcript:  Amazon Unbound, about, you know, when they came up with the price for Amazon Prime,  there was no idea of how much that's going to cost them.  So they just made up a number and they've slowly raised that number.  It's almost double what it cost initially.  But nevertheless, despite that, it's still probably a money loser  because it's so expensive to do second-day shipping.  And so Amazon plays hardball.  They played hardball with Amazon Prime.  I'm sorry, FedEx.  I confused Amex and FedEx. I don't know why.  But the Federal Express, they played hardball with UPS.  But I see when Amazon delivers, I see a lot more Amazon Prime trucks than I used to.  Still occasionally the Postal Service deliver on Sunday.  Occasionally I'll see a FedEx or UPS truck.  But I think Amazon really is taking it all over.  Didn't they buy a fleet of jets?  Yeah, I mean, I think Amazon is taking it all over.  Didn't they buy a fleet of jets?

Start time: 8665.17

Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean Amazon owns most aspects of its transportation network.  And that's kind of been its really big project, especially over the last five years.  It's bringing as much of that as it can in-house.  Because, I mean, frankly, with what we're talking about with labor unions,  they don't want to have to play ball with, you know, USPS.  It was a big deal when they got USPS to even deliver for them on Sundays.  They don't want to have to work with these larger labor unions and organizations  that are going to charge higher prices when Amazon...  Because Amazon is a very kind of spiky demand organization.  There will be some times where all of a sudden they need thousands of packages  to be going out every hour from a certain delivery station.  Versus, you know, there will be other times when they don't really need that many employees.  So they need to be able to, I guess from a purely Amazon's perspective,  they need to be able to have a highly flexible workforce,  which is going to involve a lot of third-party contractors  that they can pay as little as possible in order to make everything  as efficient as possible for the business.

Transcript:  It's a fascinating business.  It looks like initially Andy Jesse was not...  I felt like wasn't really...  He hadn't really found his saddle yet.  He wasn't really...  But now he feels like he's doing a very good job maintaining  maybe better than Bezos did Amazon's supremacy.  Would you agree? Is Jesse a good replacement for Jeff Bezos?

Start time: 8756.15
End time: 8835.00
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's hard to say.  Obviously Bezos, I think, was presiding over a very different Amazon.  And he had built up this network, the kind of leadership part of Amazon,  it was called the S Team, the senior leadership team.  And Bezos had presided over a very different company  than the one you are seeing now over the last year or two  since Jesse has taken over the head of Amazon's fulfillment and logistics.  Zarr was this guy, Dave Clark, who essentially had built Amazon's  whole kind of logistics apparatus from the ground up.  He's gone. Many of his lieutenants are gone.  Many of the other leaders in different parts of the business,  from retail to parts of entertainment, have left.  But obviously the business has a really strong foundation  and has an insane amount of employees even in its corporate ranks.  And Jesse is now ruling that version of Amazon,  which is going to be a very different company  than the one we'd seen five years ago.  It's no longer exclusively about growth, growth, growth.  It is about maintaining this giant beast.  And maintaining it especially in one of the most difficult  regulatory environments the company has ever seen.

Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean that is, I think, someone like Lena Kahn's ultimate goal is  they, my understanding of it is that the issues that regulators have with Amazon,  I mean they're multifaceted, they kind of all tie back to this concept  like a legal tying, essentially saying that, you know,  you have this company that I guess we'll take one example.  If you are an Amazon seller in order to have, like let's say, you sell towels,  in order to have your towels show up on the first page of Amazon results,  when someone searches towels, you need to be able, you need to be using Amazon Prime.  You need to be paying for your stuff to be in the Amazon delivery warehouse  and also paying for Amazon to deliver that  because that will make you show up higher in rankings.

Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean with ads, like what you're talking about, in order you have to pay for ads.  You have to pay for sponsored recommendations and things like that in order to get in there.  Do you think the pink dumbbells paid to be in the top of my search or that's just...  Almost certainly. Yeah. Those pink dumbbells, they have to play the game.  And they also, I mean part of this, they have to agree not to list their products for a lower price elsewhere.  Meanwhile, they're paying extra for the logistics, they're paying extra for ads  and people like Khan say, you know, that is ultimately harming consumers.  And part of how Amazon's been able to do all of this, like you said before, you know,  have lower prices really build up this huge service is because they have things like AWS  and different very profitable parts of the business that have allowed them to operate at a loss  in various other parts of their business.  So part of the impetus for perhaps moving towards a breakup would be  that it would allow those parts of Amazon to compete more fairly with others.

Start time: 8985.02
End time: 9032.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Even pink dumbbells have to play the game and I think that that's the key.  That's true.  Actually, it's really interesting because Amazon wants you to use Amazon fulfillment  not merely because they make money on it, they may not make money on it,  but they get lots of information and that's when you start to see your product  duplicated by an Amazon basics product or, you know, by...  And Amazon has dozens of fake company names that are really Amazon  and they'll say, oh yeah, those sheets are selling really well.  Well, we ought to undercut the price and sell them ourselves, that kind of thing.  It's so hard to untangle it.  I mean, when you say something like breakup Amazon,  you're hitting at the foundation of American capitalism.  I mean, clearly it's a problem.

Start time: 9032.50

Transcript:  I mean, yeah, and Amazon's argument for like the argument from folks at Amazon  would be that every company is doing this.  You know, you look at a supermarket, you go to Trader Joe's,  and it's Trader Joe's brand everything and they copy all the competitors.  But I think that that is maybe what folks like Con are getting at  is that Amazon seems like a good and meaty target to attack a part of capitalism  that at least this sect of the political elite have deemed, you know, has gone too far.

Start time: 9246.64
End time: 9271.96
Speaker: Louis Maresca
Transcript:  So what is blind?  I'll let Paris talk about it more in depth but I can tell you anything that happens at a Microsoft or Google or whatever, people get on there and they voice their issues with you.  And you're doing it anonymously, right? They can't tell you're doing it?  Well, they have your email address. They could technically relate you back to a username but they supposedly don't tell the company.

Start time: 9272.02
End time: 9280.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Tech people are smart enough. They could anonymize it.  Paris writes, how blind?

Start time: 9281.00
End time: 9343.50
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  So that is more out of the loop. The blind app, I think we should just explain what it is for if anybody is listening.  It's essentially an anonymous workplace social media app where there are no names but everybody on there has to sign up with a company email address and people post a comment.  So you'll see something from a username, it's just like XYZ123 but they say Amazon next to it and that means they're a verified current Amazon employee who signed up using their Amazon email.  And then people will use this to talk about kind of tech news, anything related to work but you also then have kind of these internal company channels where Amazon employees can talk to Amazon employees.  And so it's been a great source of leaks and interesting tech news because if you see a post from somebody who's a verified Amazon employee saying, hey, don't ask me how I know but layoffs are coming next week, you might pay attention more than just some Yahoo on Reddit.

Transcript:  It's pretty difficult to tease out sometimes the parody and the trolling accounts too.  So people start these terrible conversations about people internally sometimes that you're like, wow, that's not real.  So yeah, it's just tough sometimes.

Start time: 9358.66
End time: 9371.54
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Paris writes, blind has become something like a Reddit for workplaces mixing anonymous nastiness with layoff leaks, confessions about compensation and a bonanza of corporate gossip.  Oh, this sounds juicy. Can I just go and read it or do you have to have?

Start time: 9373.18
End time: 9389.32
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  You can, yeah. Anybody can go and read it. You can sign up with a personal email and you can just read whatever you want.  You can also just look at it on the web browser without signing in.  You could use your tweet email though, Leo, and make an account.

Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  And I mean, the thing is there is precedent. A lot of CEOs and founders, the reason why I ended up doing this article is because this is a really popular app among tech workers and people in Silicon Valley.  But a lot of what they're talking about are the sort of things that would piss bosses off.  I started to hear that CEOs and founders absolutely hate blind.  I mean, it's like something a lot of them talk about all the time.

Start time: 9418.52
End time: 9447.50
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, the worst thing you can do from the point of view of the boss is reveal how much you make.  Bosses hate that. You're legally protected. You can do that. It's not illegal.  It's not illegal.  Bosses will lie to you. They'll say, oh no, we keep this secret.  This could be a, there's not, where no retaliation is allowed.  But they do not want you to do that because then everybody has a better negotiating position.  Because you know how much, I know how much Jammer B's making.  I want to make more if I'm running the board, right?

Start time: 9448.48
End time: 9476.50
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  And that's one of the real reasons why blind is taken off is because, I mean, one of the primary uses outside of kind of gossip is people coming to blind, being like, hey, I got this offer from Google.  Here is, you know, my experience. Here is the salary. Here's the comp, like equity package and things like that.  I have an offer from, let's say like Microsoft, also one from Uber.  Here's what I've got. What do you guys think I should do? How should I negotiate?  And people will get in there with very specific advice and examples.

And people just put that in there as like their, their, like the bottom part of their post.  They're like, they're going to be talking about the lunch room and then just put TC, their level and what they're making.  And that's like just what they do by default.

And I, somebody, some of you may remember this when a career at Korean Air lines, vice president lost it on a flight to Seoul.  This is back in 2014. She was served macadamia nuts in a paper bag rather than on a plate.  She actually forced the plane to return back to the gate.  But then a post by an employee resulted in global media coverage.  And she ultimately got a year in jail for saying, where's my plate?

Start time: 9538.16
End time: 9547.52

It's too bad that you have to sift through some of the stuff to know whether it's real or not.  Is it pretty obvious, Lou, when you read something that some of them are, some of them are.

Start time: 9567.50
End time: 9594.50
Speaker: Louis Maresca
Transcript:  People usually come to aid.  So they'll say, this is not true. This is a troll or, you know, that kind of thing.  And then, you know, most people will kind of jump on that.  But it's sometimes pretty difficult.  When the layoffs happened recently, you know, people always ask, what's the reason for the layoffs?  And sure, there's really, you know, most people don't know.  They're, you know, they could be performance related or budget related or whatever.  And they'll go in there and speculate, but say it's like fact and then people don't know.  So it's tough.

Transcript:  This is the from Paris's article at the information.  This is the poster blind posted in 2015 around.  You remember this around the campus?  Mini Microsoft 2.0.  Talk to your coworkers anonymously.  And then on a phone screen, it says, OK, I think I just got promoted.  My comp only went up 8%. Is this right?  And then a poll. No, you got screwed.  Yes, this is normal. It depends.  And then search for blind in the App Store or Google Play.  This had not affiliated nor endorsed by Microsoft.  Like Yammer, which of course is the big acquisition of 2015.

Start time: 9631.06
End time: 9663.00
Speaker: Paris Martino
Transcript:  Yeah, it's so funny because Microsoft was one of the first companies where blind ever really took off.  And they got it to take off by making these posters, which reference this thing called mini Microsoft, a really popular anonymous blog in the mid aughts.  And the two founders snuck into Microsoft's campus in the dark of night.  One of them drove the other one who was skinnier and faster sprinted out and slapped them on different things before security guards could catch them.  And it helped their app. Yeah, take off.

Transcript:  I asked the founders about this and they were like, actually, we don't really worry about it too much.  It's been a thing ever since we were in Korea.  It's very easy to get around email blocks.  We can just make other emails and do other things.  But he's like, it actually benefits us because when this happens, it's the Streisand effect.  People start asking what's blind? I hadn't heard of this.  Why are they blocking it and look them up and download it and people end up talking.  You can't really. They had originally decided to make the app because there had been a South Korean company.  And one of the co-founders had worked for the Korean search giant Naver, which had had its own short-lived anonymous employee forum.  That really took off among employees and then the company shut it down once they started getting too frank and talking about, you know,  the sort of things bosses don't like you to talk about like compensation, whatnot.  So from the beginning, they've been like, we know companies aren't going to like this, but we've got to find a way to give workers a voice.

So they're pushing it more at college level. And there are at the links at the bottom, there's jobs, privacy terms and law enforcement.  So clearly, I mean, this was one of the issues is that some of the traffic on these sites was really actionable, was completely inappropriate.  Good. Well, I hope Blind does well and continues to do well. I think that's a great thing.  And I'm so glad you are doing so well at the information. It is worth subscribing for Paris Martino alone.

Transcript:  A lot of automation, a lot of little automation things, but it's been a lot of fun just figuring out how I can cut down on the amount of burnout on my team so we can do more fun stuff.  And we're doing a big email overhaul and then I'm writing a kids online policy series that is stressful because there's a lot of constitutional and functional problems with kids online bills.  So that's the fun in my life now.

Transcript:  I mean, if you have to say what age you are before you use a website, it doesn't just apply to 13 year olds. It applies to everybody. And there are real privacy concerns with that. Yeah, keep fighting the good fight on that one.  Thank you so much.  That's a problematic bill. You know what? We should get you back to talk more about that.  Sure, I'm glad to.  What is the prospect for that bill?

Transcript:  So there's a bunch of them. I ended up writing 12,000 words on it. I had started thinking I was going to write 2,000 because and then I'm like, oh crap, it gets worse and it gets worse and it gets worse. And I kept finding new issues with it.  But COSA just passed judiciary and it'll probably get through Senate and in-house more than likely. It's just very frustrating because I don't think lawmakers understand the real implications of what accurate age verification or burden on platforms to verify age means.  That if you're putting the burden on them, they have to do it. And that if they have to do it, it means face scans and government IDs. And that puts a lot of vulnerable people and just normal people who don't want their business everywhere at risk.

Transcript:  So that's all at rstreet.org. Most of my kids online stuff is there. There's one piece in Tech Dirt talking about how if it wasn't for me being on social media as a teenager, I wouldn't have the career I have and I also wouldn't know I have fibromyalgia.

Transcript:  I really loved that piece. I did read that piece. That was really, really good.  Really good. And hit home, I think.  Thank you so much.  Mike's going to be on Twitter soon. We love Tech Dirt and I read it religiously along with all of the other places.  Yeah, you write. And rstreet.org, of course.  Thank you, Shoshana. Thank you so much, Lou. Thank you, Paris. Thanks to all of you who joined us today, especially you Club Twitter members.  We do Twitch Sundays about 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern Time, 2100 UTC. I say the time so you can watch it if you want live. That's the, you know, as we make the show, the live stream 24 hours a day is live.twit.tv. You can get audio or video there. In fact, we just added Kick, another video provider. So we have a number of different ways you can watch. All the links are at live.twit.tv.  If you are watching live, chat live, that's why we have a chat room, an IRC, because for years, more than 20 years, I've had a chat room going while I'm doing shows. IRC.twit.tv. It's kind of the back channel to the show.  Of course, there's also a Discord for Club Twitter members. We invite you to join us either of those places.  After the fact, there are discussions going on at our Mastodon instance, which is twit.social. That's open to all twit listeners. All you have to do is say, I listen to the show or Leo sent me or something like that and I'll add you.  It's a good conversation, always going on there. If you prefer forums, we have a wonderful discourse forum at twit.community. Also open to all. But as I do with twit.social, I have to approve every account, only to keep spammers out. That's the main point of all that.  But a good place to leave your comments about this show or any of the shows we do or any subject on your mind.  You can also get the show on demand. There are a few places to go. Of course, our website is the first place to start. twit.tv. Just look for This Week in Tech. There's a YouTube channel called This Week in Tech that's got all the shows. You can also subscribe in your favorite podcast player. In fact, that's the best thing to do. If you subscribe, you'll get it automatically the minute we've done editing it. That guarantees you'll have it in time for your Monday morning commute. Thank you everybody for joining us.  I think it's safe to say the longest running tech podcast in the world. Certainly one of them. Yeah, right. In our 18th year. And for 18 years I've been saying it and I'll say it again. Another twit is in the can. Thanks for listening.
