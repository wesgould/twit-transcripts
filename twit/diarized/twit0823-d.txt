Transcript:  It's time for Twit this week in tech. Great panel for you. We got Owen JJ Stone, Wesley Faulkner, Dan Patterson from CBS News.  Colonial pipeline paid the ransom, but where'd the money go? Are you ready for the Pixel 6? We'll find out Tuesday.  The question is, is Google ready for the Pixel 6? And they found the president's secret Venmo. I wonder if they used air tags.  It's all coming up next on Twit.

If you're in the audience, you can raise your hand and if you have  got a comment or something you'd like to say about anything, we're  talking about we'll see if we can integrate that in.  I want to do more of that because it's so fun to have those audio  comments.  I don't you know a lot of times as we're talking I feel like, you  know, we're not the only people have opinions on these topics speaking  of which topic number one the colonial pipeline.  Oh, and you had some great pictures.  In fact, some people thought it was you of people in the southeast  storing gasoline and plastic bags in their trunk.  There was some severe hoarding going on in the southeast because  of this ransomware attack in the colonial pipeline.

Start time: 533.98
End time: 541.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And it is that picture obviously is a I was from 2009 in Mexico.  So it is it came from somewhere but I wasn't from oh, you're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 543.70
End time: 552.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yes, I literally Google gas and trunks to find something because I  knew somebody had done it and I stumbled across that picture and

Start time: 552.46
End time: 604.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  then well, okay truth in advertising.  So we don't know what apparently that is not that actually happening.  Although we were talking about this on Wednesday and I think was  Jeff Jarvis who pointed out that really the panic was a media  inspired panic much like the toilet paper panic of ought 20 because  the pipeline itself wasn't down for very long was down for a few  days and the ransomware attack actually hadn't hit the operations.  The pipeline was closed in an excess of caution.  The attack was on the IT department.  However, who knows what the truth is because colonial pipeline  also said they did not pay the ransom but now according to Bloomberg.  Oh, yes, they did five million dollars in ransom shortly after like  on Thursday like the day after the attack they rushed to pay the

Start time: 605.02
End time: 634.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  hackers and we have the same sourcing on that as well even so even  though they were very quiet as this was happening and look I can  understand any business that's hit with a ransomware attack whether  you're in small SMB or a huge critical infrastructure company like  Colonial you don't want to talk about this because it's embarrassing  business.  Yeah, and it's embarrassing but they I mean we had three sources  Bloomberg went up before CBS did but we they were telling the public  one thing and in private doing the exact opposite.

Start time: 635.04
End time: 689.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and then here's an article from elliptic which is a company  that offers solutions for people who are hit by ransomware.  They try trace the Bitcoin wallet said sometimes people think that  Bitcoin is anonymous and the owner of the account might not be  associated with the account number but the account number is on  the blockchain so you can see if for instance if I say here's my  Bitcoin wallet give me money people can see how much money went  in that Bitcoin wallet.  So we know that the dark side Bitcoin wallet has received 50  according to elliptic 57 payments from 21 different wallets since  the early beginning of March in the last couple of months some of  them it looks like on Friday 75 Bitcoin coming from the Colonial  pipeline.  What is 75 times 50,000?

Start time: 692.08
End time: 711.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's more to clarify and just jump in here.  They the ransom did get paid but it's a possibility that they did  not pay the ransom.  So both can be true.  Who else would have paid us?  Well, if they had some sort of hacking insurance, oh, they're  insurers.  Paid for it then they could say both they can claim strictly  speaking.  It was true.

Start time: 712.88
End time: 726.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although one of the things we're seeing is as a out shoot of this  and other ransom recent ransomware taxes increasingly insurers  are saying we're not going to pay Bitcoin.  We're not going to give anybody cryptocurrency for paying back  ransom, ransoms.

Start time: 729.36
End time: 734.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So and regardless to who actually made the payment somebody made

Start time: 734.56
End time: 736.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  some money.  These guys made a lot of money.

Start time: 737.42
End time: 768.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it under it.  It highlights that the the challenge of ransomware that every  company every government and even individuals face with ransomware  which is and you saw the White House change their guidance at  the press conference earlier this week with Jen Psaki and others.  They initially like everyone our guidance is always don't pay  the ransom, but they kind of subtly shifted that to well, we  always advise companies not to pay the ransom, but we do think  that companies should do what's in their best interest.

Start time: 768.40
End time: 778.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard to say don't pay the ransom.  I mean, it's easy to say it but it's hard to do it because if  you're sitting here and you're going to be out of business and  it's going to cost you a hundred million dollars, right 15 million

Start time: 778.80
End time: 810.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  big deal and often that ransom price now, I mean, there's all  kinds of meta that went into this particular hack but often  the ransom price is set by these criminal organizations to be  non-factor in your decisions.  So it might seem like a lot of money for you and I five million  bucks is a lot of money.  But for a company at this scale, it really isn't a decision  about like well, is it cost-effective to pay it or not just  pay it and get it over with let's get back operational and I

Start time: 810.60
End time: 824.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  understand why the FBI would say don't pay it because they  don't want to encourage these attacks, but that's not the  calculus that any business is making that's not their issue.  Their issue is how do we get our stuff back online because  we're going to lose millions every single day that we're  offline.

Start time: 825.70
End time: 841.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I just getting back online.  It is also some of this data gets exfiltrated from their  servers and if it got released on the open web, it could cause  a lot of havoc.  So it's not getting up and running.  It's making sure that it doesn't get out.

Start time: 842.44
End time: 877.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's what dark side specializes in.  They don't just exfiltrate their data and there are a couple  other groups that operate in a very similar way.  They're kind of competing in a similar market, you know,  Mays, I think Ragnarok or Ragnar.  There are a couple companies that will not just lock up your  data and not just steal your data, but they'll kind of bludgeon  you with these threats of like well, we're going to leak some  of your data.  We're going to corrupt other components of your data.  We're going to DDoS you and we're going to go after your  clients.  So what do you want to do pay the ransom or like have a really  bad day?

Start time: 878.18
End time: 972.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's what happened to Apple and their supplier  Quanta when they got hit by the R evil or evil ransomware.  The hackers and this is what you do now if you're a ransomware  gang apparently is you get on that you get in.  That's the first step you before you trigger the ransomware  you survey the network you exfiltrate anything of interest.  You might also be looking for where the backups are stored  and how to make sure those backups also get encrypted.  Then once you feel like you've done the reconnaissance and  you've gotten the data then you trigger the ransomware and  that's exactly what our evil did to Quanta.  They said, oh not only we encrypted your data, but we've  also got all the schematics for Apple's next products and  we're going to here's a couple of them 14 inch and 16 inch  laptop laptop.  If you don't want us to release anymore give us 50 million  dollars.  Now.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know if Quanta paid or Apple paid or if they caught  the guys or what but suddenly that stopped so it sounds like  they got paid and you're exactly right Dan.  It's worth a lot more than 50 million dollars to Apple and  probably to Quanta for that matter that that stuff not  leak out.  It's not just the encryption.  There's also another problem according to Bloomberg even  though Colonial Pipeline paid 15 million dollars to for the  decrypter.  It was so slow.  They ended up restoring from backup anyway.  Come on guys.  If you're going to write ransomware make sure it's efficient  at least the decrypter ought to be isn't that why you have a

Start time: 975.96
End time: 1093.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have employees like DarkSide is an unusual operation.  They had a website.  They had an ethics policy.  Well, that's that's the interesting second half of this  story.  They have now they claim that shortly after the president  said we're going to get these guys.  They said they've lost they said we should say this is you  know, the trustworthy folks over at the DarkSide said they  lost control of their servers and all the money in their  Bitcoin or much of the money in their Bitcoin wallet DarkSide  DarkSide's blog post.  Yeah, they got a blog.  Sure.  They do.  Why wouldn't they?  DarkSide's blog post said a few hours ago we lost access to  the public part of our infrastructure namely blog payment  server CDN.  Yes, they had a CDN CDN servers.  This is a dark sup speaking the operator of the ransomware.  Now these servers are unavailable via SSH and the  hosting panels are blocked.  Apparently some cryptocurrency funds were withdrawn now  experts have said well, it's possible, you know, seal team  six found the servers and took them down.  It's also possible that this is apparently happens enough  that there's a name for it an exit strategy that the DarkSide  guys thought now would be a now would be a good time.  I don't know.  What do they do now would be a good time to get out of the  business and oh by the way instead of paying the affiliates  because DarkSide is ransomware as a service.  So they have other people who use their software.  They those people pay a percentage back to DarkSide actually  goes the other way around DarkSide gets the money and then  gives the people the money and keeps a little bit of it.  So instead of paying off the affiliates for this successful  attack, they're just making off with the with the Bitcoin and  pretending that they lost it all.  What do you think?

Start time: 1094.06
End time: 1130.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So they blame the government flip the table and everybody  runs out and just in general every American.  I know at least has heard the term we don't negotiate with  terrorists, but we do.  Oh, okay.  We better.  Yeah, you know when you look overseas and somehow they got  Toyota Tundras in the middle of the desert.  I'm like, well, where did they come from?  You know what I'm saying?  Like you so we we do negotiate with terrorists.  So if somebody has something that you need and it's money  and you've got the money to pay it they pay that money and  then they try to figure it out later and I I believe whole heartedly in our war machine that is America, but I don't  even think still team six has a teleport machine.  They can't jump through space and time.  It's hard.

Start time: 1131.50
End time: 1148.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can't is from what we seem to know is that these guys  are Russian nationals not Russian government, but they  but they're Russians.  You can't just kind of invade Russia and take these guys out.  I don't know Dan.  You're probably more an expert on dark ops than anybody else  on this panel.  Could we do that?

Start time: 1149.64
End time: 1221.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I I mean I there to the metagame here is way more interesting  than the the overt game.  There's that adage that no one makes money in Russia without  Vladimir Putin's say so right and I'm instantly suspicious  when I see an attack like this.  I think everybody is like you don't have to be as an expert  in cyber to say it did this come from Russia and even when  we had intelligence that said this was probably Russian the  organized criminal actors in Russia are they kind of play  by that adage, you know, nobody's making money.  There are no criminal organizations there that are acting  in this way attacking American critical infrastructure, even  though it's run by a private company.  This is critical infrastructure like the electricity or your  water and nobody is attacking those things without Putin's  say so so on the flip side of that Leo, I like I don't know  what the NSA or other cyber operations are doing, but I  know that we've developed offensive capabilities and we  haven't been shy about using some of those capabilities and  I do believe that Biden is more keyed into cyber than his  predecessor.  So I would be shocked if there wasn't a proportional response

Start time: 1222.04
End time: 1283.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but who knows what it is there was a tweet from a former  director of a national intelligence who said, oh, yeah,  they're they're going in right now.  Yeah, he said, I, you know, I don't know for sure but based  on my experience.  It's funny though.  There's some interesting points to this one is that in their  ethics statement, the dark side blog says we don't go after  hospitals and national infrastructure.  There's some thinking that they didn't know that when they  were attacking the IT of Colonial Pipeline that they were  actually attacking infrastructure.  You'd be you'd probably be prudent not to go after  infrastructure.  There are plenty of other excellent targets that you can  make money on and you don't want to rile up a nation-state  but if assuming that this nation-state is riled up and  that dark sides security operations, their secops were  good.  Would we is it reasonable to think that we would be able to  we could I think we could probably shut down their servers  right?  Maybe we could invade their Bitcoin wallet.  Maybe I don't know.

I mean we were talking on the security now on Tuesday about  Tor at any given point as many as a third of all Tor exit  points are owned by national intelligence agencies.  So, you know, it's it'd be pretty hard against a determined  nation-state to keep everything a secret.  So I could see how especially since it came the day after  Biden whether it was convenient for dark side to do it at that  point or we really did get to him.  I would love to know frankly.  So the pipeline came back online again.  It was never threatened apparently by the ransomware but  it was closed just to be cautious.  It came back online within a few days.  I don't know if there were big shortages, but there weren't  any no reason to put gasoline in a trunk and plastic bags.  Again, no judgments.

Yeah, thank you.  Good good one Owen, but some people didn't retweet it  reposted it.  It gets more and more serious and Facebook and Twitter  and Instagram are designed algorithmically to promote this  stuff to build it up.

There's always some kind of stereotype or a meme that will  get you where you like that is blatantly false.  What are you doing?  And then the other person's like I just thought it was funny.

I know people are gonna laugh at this.  It's funny.  But then I know I personally never taken an account unless  I think it's something that's violent or something like  that.  I never take it account.  So my my misunderstanding is and take this the wrong way.  I just say it's funny and I go post it.  But if I was a rational person like all of us could be I  would think misinformation.  I shouldn't do it.  But then where's the fun?  It's by the way why I don't have a Facebook Twitter.

They need to be taught how to distinguish good content  from bad content.  They need it.  But it isn't people's fault because this stuff has  always gone on.  Somebody's mentioning the original troll is war of the  world by Orson Welles, which terrified people across  America.  But and and and by the way that was used as an example  of why radio is way too dangerous a medium because it  was very convincing.  But we've just weaponized these these tools in such a  way that you can't make a joke anymore.  And I don't blame people.  I thought I don't think it's our fault.  Yeah, I think that it's I think we got to do something  about the medium.

Start time: 1907.82
End time: 2003.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, this in software development, there's this thing  called the the tour or the out-of-box experience or  the walkthrough where you can walk the user onto the  medium the way that you want them to flow if there was  a gating option to show hey, this is how you can spot  misinformation when you're on Twitter when you launch  Twitter and you can walk you through hey, you see this  picture of this person filling up their tank or in  all these containers of gas.  Keep in mind.  This is extremely cropped.  If you pulled out that you might not see so everyone  doing it.  And so this could be an isolating incident.  You don't know.  So don't think that this is way bigger because you're  seeing just this one image that they're they could do  that.  I remember Google early on they used to do a health  check like hey, would you like I don't know like 200  megs of free Google Drive storage by going through  and checking make sure your password and your password  hygiene was good.  They could do the same thing with these services.  I think lower in the rundown.  We're going to be talking about a Twitter.  Yeah, Twitter's looking at subscription.  Yeah, what if they made that part of it saying hey with  great power comes great response.  I don't think Twitter wants to great user.  I think the reason is not happening.  No motivation for that.  Yeah, but but they should really do this to get ahead  of this legislation because you know Congress doesn't  like them right.  That's the incentive isn't it and stuff like this stuff  like that could help head off those problems with  legislating that that these companies make sure their  users use their products.  Well, that's a good point.

Start time: 2004.50
End time: 2026.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the argument for investigation and legislation  is that's the stick with which you get these companies  to do the right thing because there's no incentive.  Otherwise they make money when people are upset.  They make money when the fire gets lit.  That's how that's good for Twitter and Facebook and  Instagram and tick tock and everybody else.  I don't want to single anybody out Dan.  Does that seem reasonable?  Is that a good solution?

Transcript:  I like I like that quite a bit.  I think that what Wesley describes is exactly I mean that  would counter or it would encourage behavior that is counter  to the business models of a lot of these companies, but it  sounds like a fantastic suggestion to do something people  spoke with.  Go ahead.  I spoke with Christopher Wiley who was the Cambridge  Analytica whistleblower and he's he made this great metaphor  for what's happening right now and he used a building.  You know, we're in New York City and he says look, you  know, you can't build apartments past a certain height.  You can't build buildings past a certain height without  having a building inspector.  And if you want to go up and down in those buildings, you  definitely need an elevator.  Well, are you going to get into an elevator that has not  been tested?  No, of course you're not that's no, you're definitely not  going to do that.  So that's the same thing in his words that we should do  with social media firms instead of regulating what speeches  or having this dumb debate about what speeches which is  really just designed to distract us instead just build  for safety and design protocols inside social networks that  do exactly like Wesley is describing which is safety.  We're not talking about speech.  We're talking about safety and we can see the inherent  unsafety or the problem the flaws and the danger when we  look at groups like QAnon or we look at people like Maria  Ressa in the Philippines who has a Constitution much like  the United States Constitution, but it was overtaken by a  strongman to Tarte who used Facebook to weaponize  disinformation and attack her a journalist telling the  truth about a politician and if we're not careful, we're  going to see very a very similar weaponization of social  media here in the United States and we saw glimmers of  that with QAnon, which was a remarkably violent movement.

Transcript:  Yeah, but it's all made up.  I mean, it's all made up and the accusations have come from  Facebook and from Twitter and Brigades very similar to what  we saw with like Stop the Steal and QAnon on Facebook where  they just proliferated so rapidly that you could send a  small message and that signal would amp up this entire crowd  who would go on the attack.  Yeah, anyone who's covered QAnon knows the death threats  are real from QAnon and the same phenomenon happened to  Maria Ressa and I mean a country with a Constitution like  the United States when a journalist is targeted with  violence by the president and by mobs who are whipped up on  Facebook bad things are going to happen.  All right, that sounded way more moralistic than I know.  I think it's good.

Transcript:  All right, we go back and forth all the time on all of our  shows about government regulation, you know, and there's  different points of view on this.  There's some people who say, you know, technology has brought  us so many gifts.  We should be very slow to try to regulate these companies all  the way to people saying, you know, you're going to break  them all up or put them all out of business because they're  a blight on the humanity and I go back and forth, you know,  the history of government regulation of technology is not  good.  But at the same time, you're never going to get Mark Zuckerberg  to give up the algorithm and give up the traffic and the  attention he gets.  So you're going to have to give him a stick.  There has to be something that threatens them so that forces  them to do the right thing.  I think it has to be a more of a business cost.  It's the same thing as choosing the right amount for your  ransomware demands.  There has to be a greater business cost than the money  he's making.  Otherwise, he's just going to thumb his nose at it.  And that's so far.  That's exactly even when he gets, you know, you see fines  in the EU for companies like Apple for 15 million dollars  and it's like, okay here fine.  That's not a threat.  You need to make it.  You need to make it serious.  Do you disagree Owen?  I don't think you're a fan of government regulation.

Okay, we've ruined water in this country.  We're trying to privatize it electricity.  I like all kinds of things that are just bigger than the  internet that the government hasn't seemed to fix yet.

I like them to be intelligent.  I like them to come up and say well, why am I using this  instead of that and then have an intelligent discussion  with them.  But when they come in and they don't want to listen and it's  going to be it's an issue.  Yeah, and it does upset most of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not included.  That's my cat does not come with a mattress.  I think we covered the pipeline.  Let's move on.  Apple this past week turned on their ATT their application  tracking.  Stuff 96% according to Flutter, which does these kinds of  metrics 90% of iPhone users who have the new iOS 14 596%  percent said when asked no don't track me.  This is exactly what Facebook was terrified of.  But there's an interesting side note to this and it goes  along with so Apple says no, no, no, we won't let anybody  track you.  We're privacy first.  Google says no, no, we don't nobody wants third-party  cookies.  Chrome will not lose them.  In fact, not only that Chrome is going to invent this new  thing called flock that will keep you private.  It will keep you anonymous great piece.  I wanted to give him credit from Eric Benjamin Sufert  mobile dev memo content at mobile dev memo.com titled  Apple Robbed the mobs Bank.  What he's pointing out is that Facebook Google Apple all  our first parties.  They're not third parties when you see ads on those platforms  are served by those companies and none of this slows down  first-party data collection and in fact Apple knows everything  about you Facebook knows everything about you.  Google knows everything about you and they are not doing  any of them anything to stop that.  So my proposal to the panel here my question to the panel  here is is this hypocritical I'll ask you what first Wesley  is this hypocritical for Apple or Google to say, oh yeah,  we're not going to any more to have any more tracking or is  it pulling up the is it pulling up the ladder and saying yeah,  we got everything we need.  Good luck to the rest of you.

Transcript:  There's always going to be this thirst for data and it and  these companies who want to control that data.  They'll have a lot of the power but for fountains that are  cut off like from Facebook.  They'll still be able to get it from even your carrier from  all these other sources.  They already have this data and they'll continue to collect  it.  They just have to have other means.  I think Apple is just giving a false sense of security saying  that we are more secure and also I think part of that same  story or a story later is that they're now going to be selling  ads on the app store.  Oh, Apple is going to sell ads to people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they just want more control and they think lack of control  from these other sources if they can they could prop up their  value and it's just another way of delaying the inevitable the  companies are going to get this data.  They may not get it from Apple, but they'll still have access  in some other ways and I should point out it's nice though.  It does feel nice to be able to say no, you can't have my data  but that's going to of course just like everything in tech.  It's going to hurt us the smaller players more than it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the bigger outfit.  That's the point.  I mean you may click this button in iOS 14.  Five that says, you know, should I this is the button you see  allow Facebook to track your activity across other companies  apps and websites and you can say ask app not to track or  allow of course everybody 96% are clicking ask app not to  track you can click that but that doesn't stop Facebook from  knowing everything you get you giving them all this information  anyway.  There's an app and Facebook may not give this to advertisers.  They gave it to Cambridge Analytica.  Although actually I'm going to ask you since you talked to  Christopher Dan there.  There's some evidence that Facebook Analytica was BSing everybody  anyway that they didn't really know if Facebook didn't give

Start time: 3181.90
End time: 3233.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  data to Cambridge Analytica Cambridge Analytica used everything.  Well, they stole it for sure, but they stole it using tools  that were openly available.  Yeah, quizzes.  Yeah.  Well, it's the quiz was the front end.  But what that quiz allowed them to do is use the Facebook API  to get not just your profile information and a lot of times  information mark those private but it's your friends and your  friends of friends and they use not just the data but they were  able to develop maps maps of social relationships and maps  of habits and behavior and I think that that might be what  you're getting at with Apple and with Google anytime.  They say will turn off or this isn't an important data source  believe them right?  You Google saying will turn off third-party cookies.  They don't care.  They definitely don't care and I would say that Facebook never

Start time: 3233.54
End time: 3259.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wanted to give Cambridge Analytica that data because that's  their secret sauce.  What they want to do is sell Cambridge Analytica or in this  case the Trump campaign access to this information without  giving them the information.  So they say the campaign used it very well in 2016.  Okay, you want to target voters in this demographic in this  area who perhaps are gun supporters.  Okay, we're not going to tell you that is but you can buy ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  against them which is to Wesley's point and the point  that Facebook makes pretty openly.  Look, I disagree with Facebook quite often and I get into  heated discussions with them, but they made very accurately  the point that this change by Apple will also hurt small  business.  I asked them why and they say well it hurts their ability to  target like us big companies.  We can target because because we have all of these different  options.

Transcript:  Dan I just I'm trying to figure out why Facebook took those  full-page ads and everything.  I mean, I think Facebook just didn't want it to happen.  They're terrified and so they they they use this I think red  herring to get people to but didn't work by the way,  everybody's still clicking that button.  But Facebook can still collect so much information that when  a small business wants to buy an ad on Facebook, they're still  going to be able to buy an efficient ad.  This is not cutting that off.  All this is cutting off is their ability to see what other  apps you're using and to follow you geographically and as you  said Wesley, they could still buy that information from  plenty of other places.  It I why is Facebook so worried about this?  I think they can make this up.  There's just one more data source.

Bye-bye until you want marketing come talk to me about  it because I'm running the cap on the captain of the ship.  Did he got to get through me to get to you Apple is about  to mess up a lot of people in this industry and though it  might seem like it's not a big deal and their reasoning for  doing it.

Like again, I just I'm seeing the long con in this and I'm  looking like I said, I'm looking way around the bend on  things that Apple's trying to do and manipulate the markets  to benefit themselves and only themselves.  It seems like it's just I don't know.  I feel like everybody else needs to start teaming up against  Apple because Apple's got a plan is the you know, this isn't  the first step.  I mean the last is the first step.

Transcript:  What's Facebook doesn't really they do care about this Apple  change but it's less so because it's kind of universal.  They're not losing anything that everyone else is not losing  what they're really scared of is a trend of these features  rolling out on these different providers.  If everybody does it and everyone locks up then that just  they just don't want that trend to happen.  So they're trying to stop it right now or at least give it  some friction to slow it down.  But the truth is it's just work on their side to integrate  more services and more data pipes to kind of like fluff up  profiles so they can work around this new Apple change, but  they just want it not to be the first domino in a set that  kind of removes slowly their power.

Transcript:  I wonder if Facebook which is notorious for being very  paranoid and buying up anybody or shutting down anybody that  could compete with them.

Start time: 3601.00
End time: 3661.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean the argument every each of these other companies  have different ancillary grievances with Apple, but it's  kind of their fear.  I mean the long game is what Owen points out rightfully like  everybody is kind of afraid of a monolithic Apple.  What epic is contending and what others contend is that Apple  says the iPhone competes along with the PlayStation and the  Nintendo Switch and if you don't want to play place if you  want to play Fortnite on the iPhone you can play it on any  number of competing devices.  Epic is arguing that the iPhone is itself a market and the  App Store is on top of iOS.  These are all unique markets and Apple has all of these  locked up and because of that they have created a monolith  that is the iPhone and then you switch to the services that  Apple is now selling and you have this entire ecosystem.  It's really what just Owen is describing this ecosystem monolithic  Apple where you want anything you got to come through me.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny I for years when Microsoft was such a  dominant monopoly and Apple was the you know second weakling.  I said if you think Microsoft's bad with their monopoly is just  be glad Apple doesn't have it and now that Apple does I think  I'm fortunately I think I was right.

Start time: 3681.46
End time: 3735.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was just going to make that point that Apple's the new  Microsoft.  Yeah, and some ways the the downfall of Microsoft wasn't them  being too aggressive is that they were so dominant and people  felt like they had to use it that necessarily they wanted to  use it.  Nobody has to Apple Apple stuff.  Do they as they lock in their ecosystem people are going to  start feeling that way you want to and as soon and we are  hearing like some people are saying that some Microsoft  laptops are better than Apple laptops and on some regards  especially when the keyboard butterfly keyboard right fiasco  happened when if people feel more locked in when a competitor  comes up with something that's better people will start  jumping ship because they will stop having to use that  hardware stack that might be closed and might jump into an  open ecosystem that works with a variety of different kind of  products.  Oh, I wish it was just like Apple is just so good right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's it still can happen but just Apple is really  good right now.  We are not at the tipping point where people are trying to jump  off but like we're going to talk about like Google in their  next pixel pixel having their own SOC's people are learning  this playbook.  You see Microsoft making their own SOC's this is the return  of the silo.  It's going to happen.  It's going to happen.  They're not going to lose their advantage.  It may not be today.  It may not be next year, but it's going to happen if people  feel locked in they were going to just jump ship when there  is a viable number one solution outside of that ecosystem.

They they're the best because of a billion iPhones if you  live in the Apple and if you don't have an iPhone, it's much  easier to stalk people who have Android phones and so you  better get an iPhone to defend yourself against them.  And if you don't have a modern iPhone, then you can't point  your iPhone to find out where your keys fell under the sofa.

Start time: 3814.48
End time: 3859.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey guys.  Hey, I just had a thought and I was kind of doing the math  on this in my head as you guys were talking so compared to  most platforms like Google and others Apple takes tight  control on everything there their app store what goes on  their phones, you know all this different type of stuff and  because of that, I think they can easily implement kind of  the privacy aspect because they retain most control, but  I'm wondering here lately with you know, the epic and Apple  lawsuit and this new privacy implementation they did about  tracking.  I wonder if it's more about control over privacy.  So I just kind of want to exactly what we're saying Taylor.

Start time: 3859.70
End time: 3879.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you nailed it which is you know, Apple will paint it  as we're protect.  We're doing this for you.  We're protecting you but it but it interesting side effect is  it gives them absolute information and absolute control  over that information.  So there's a benefit to Apple that is different from just  being the nice friendly privacy company.  Is that what you're saying?

You remember I had yeah, I had failed but yeah, so in one  way you people have said well Apple only is doing this  because they don't have an ad platform.  Well interesting they now they are selling ads again Taylor.  Thank you for being a member of the club and thanks for  participating with us.  I appreciate it.  Thanks Leo.  All right.  Take care.  I want to take a little break.  I just by the way, we'll just mention give it a little plug  if you're in Club twit seven bucks a month ad free versions  of all of our shows via RSS.  You also get access to this discord, which is really a lot  of fun.  We've been doing some great stuff.  We're also starting to test out some shows.  We did a Linux show in there last night.  I wasn't there.  I'm sorry.  I missed it.  But there's some really fun things going on and and then  of course, there's the twit plus feed which is stuff that  fell on the cutting room floor specials.  We are going to be doing and I think we'll do it in public  for sure.  Andy Weir who I've interviewed both times on his last two  books the Martian which is an incredible book and motion  picture and then his most recent was Artemis.  He's released a new book called Project Hail Mary John.  You finished it.  I'm halfway through.  I can't put it down and I as soon as we started I started  reading I said get it get me Andy Weir and I think we're  going to interview Andy Weir on Friday.  So the show that we used to do that we interviewed Andy on  in previous times is triangulation but we canceled that show  because of lack of listenership and mostly lack of ad support  now thanks to the club.  We can do show we could do stuff like that shows like that.  So we will do that.  We'll do it.  I think I haven't heard back from Andy yet, but I believe  we're going to do a 3 p.m.  on Friday Pacific 6 p.m.  Eastern 2200 UTC John make sure we get the fireplace fired  up for that.  And then and we'll put it out on a I guess we'll put it  on the triangulation feed and events feed but there is a  benefit for Club Twit members.  If you want to ask a question, we're going to spin up a live  stage as we've done this time and we will give people a  chance to ask Andy Weir questions during the interview  as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they did fill it with argon gas, but it just wasn't  enough to kill you.  Could it be?  Oh wait a minute.  It's it's inert so couldn't kill you just would suffocate  you.  That's all.  We should actually talk about what Stacey called the biggest  story of the year.  We're talking about tile and how hard it was going to be to  compete against Apple with air tags and tile knew this.  In fact, it made me wonder why tile didn't jump on Apple's  offer to join the fine my network.  They offered it to any third party Chipolo a competitor did  it but not tracker.  We found out a week later trackers announced they're  partnering with Amazon and they will be part of Amazon sidewalk  network.  That is very interesting.  It's probably the only reasonable way any tracker compete  against Apple's billion iPhones sidewalk is a network that  is turned on probably without your knowledge by default.  If you have a late model Amazon Echo device, it is a low  bandwidth but long-range network and if enough people within  say a half-mile radius, that's about how far it'll go for  enough people have it your whole neighborhood will be  blanketed with sidewalk, which means your tracker suddenly  your tile could be seen in a lot more places.  Why what is going on and should we damn ask you first should  we worry about Amazon sidewalk?

Start time: 4611.38
End time: 4628.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean definitely we should worry.  I know that I mean this Stacey in the house and they're going  to hit the nail on the head right?  This is consumer IOT or at least it really looks like consumer  IOT that is no fuss no muss right?

Start time: 4630.04
End time: 4634.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  Right, right.  Maybe you should fuss and definitely muss but it's still  consumer IOT.

Start time: 4642.88
End time: 4696.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Amazon and says and Stacey agrees they've done a lot to  aware of the fact that people are going to be concerned about  this make it very private fully in multiple layers of encryption.  It doesn't, you know, reveal anything about you.  You can disable it, but it's on by default on any modern Echo  device within the last few years.  I talked when it first came out when they first announced it.  I showed people on one of our shows how to turn it off, but  then I just kind of forgot about it and I guess that's Amazon's  plan.  Pay no attention.  On the other hand, there's a huge benefit from sidewalk if  they did in fact implement security and privacy well because  now you have this low low bandwidth but hot long-range network.  It's actually a low raw which means you can use it for all  kinds of interesting IOT outside the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't own any of that stuff.  That's why because this is the same company the behind the ring  doorbells that were selling.  Oh by the way to law enforcement there on sidewalk also exactly.  Yeah, it's like if tiles now going to be part of this network.  They're going to be able to track a large percentage of the  population and and probably sell this over to law enforcement  or any entity that's willing to pay or that they feel should have  this data and this is scary.  I don't trust Amazon.  I don't trust Google, but I trust Amazon so much less with personal  data because they have shown poor choice on who they allow access  to that data.  And so from from that standpoint, that's why I'm scared of them  being able to track more and more people of where they've been  where they're going.  Think about this this sidewalk network in a future protest that's  going to happen and they're able to tag figure out who have these  tags not just the tags but the phone app that runs tile that now  they can understand who is part of this this group.  It's scary in terms of tracking and surveillance and it's kind of  being ushered in as a fight against Apple, but it's it I think they're  going to embed with an enemy that it's going to probably guarantee  their survival, but also it's going to be just worse off for everyone.

Oh, but I think that they are being very proactive about that.  If we trust Apple, I think we could trust Amazon.

If you take this anywhere with you, it doesn't matter who you  like or who you don't like one of these things got you tracking  the thing that this doesn't have going for it.  I have spent a good chunk of money on these devices and let me  tell you the one difference.  I've learned in the last three weeks of having an Apple device  versus this this works 64% of the time.  It's not good.  You want somebody to track you with this good luck with that because  these don't work all the time that that Apple tag.  I got a little survey going on right now.  I put one in a mailbox and send it on down to my sister, Nerve  Carolina.  And guess what?  I'm watching that thing pinko to Kosti West Lago.  It ain't losing nothing these things I go from the street and  lose this bad boy.  Okay, so I go ahead and just quote Charday.

I also agree with Leslie that like no matter what enhancing  or adding to these networks, not only does it add capability to  people who might not have your or my or protesters best interest  in mind, it adds a good but it also erodes are look we we've  given up so much.  Do you remember when it was a big deal that apps were apps and  they weren't like part of the World Wide Web and they weren't  connected.  They were kind of siloed.  Everybody was up in arms about that.  We've given up so much in this March towards inevitable  technological progress and I'm a tech person, but I think that  Wesley is on to something like if we continue to add these  networks that just track us and surveil us air tags included in  our phones.  Are we giving up some mental peace of mind or something that  was human piece by piece?

I mean you were easiest in 20 in the fall of 2018.  I covered mass shooting in Pittsburgh and as a result of  that I had the synagogue shooting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that was that was CBSN and we were live on air for that  for quite a while and we were talking about this phenomenon,  but it it blew up and the doxing and death threats were  so severe.  I mean look this for reporting on a mass shooting everyone  who covers QAnon has the same experience.  They will dox you Brigade you they will share your information  in private channels.  Some of them claim that they also use bots to amplify some  of the harassment but it was every single time I would go  on air within seconds.  My Twitter would light up.  I mean I shut down Facebook and Instagram.  I deleted those accounts years ago and and my wife and I have  both gone through and we've gone through with the FBI as well  everything that could be public to find and eliminate our  physical location cow.

Transcript:  Well, we talked to the FBI and what they would often say is  that we can't tell you the particulars about a case or about  a particular instance, but what we can tell you is when there  are things that might impact you.  So yes this incident like Thanksgiving morning.  I woke up to a threat that just said you're f'ing dead in 2020  not a big deal.  We had the IP address and we sent it to the FBI but they  come back and they say we don't tell you particulars, especially  when it comes to ongoing investigations like what we're  doing with even if you're the victim.  Well, what they will tell you is that like this is an actionable  this this came from an actionable suspect and they told  us that this was in Houston and that we should look again.  This is a long conversation.  Take it serious not about me.  Yes, take it seriously CBS took it seriously like I mean I had  detail going to and from work for quite a while.  Good Lord.  I had no idea that I'm so but it's not ever it's not me though.  I mean like it's interesting to share this but what's important  to know is that it's not about me every reporter who covered  and similar conspiracies experienced the exact same thing  and what that means is that it's systemic harassment designed  to attack those who are talking about these not we can laugh  at these emerging conspiracies, but these emerging conspiracies  who had political motivations and the way this ties into  tech is that these were weaponized.  They metastasized on Facebook in particular.  Yes, and although we can talk about a Chan and fortune those  were teeny in comparison to what happened on Facebook and  it's not just happening to me.  It's happening to so many people that once Facebook cut off  the spigot and Twitter cut off QAnon you could instantly see  this change like suddenly there was not this huge flood of  harassment and threats coming from them.  And again how this applies to tech is algorithms that are  designed for engagement do far more harm.  And not in touch.  Sorry, I didn't mean to talk about no, no, no.

It's pretty clear that while the original queue, we don't know  who that was the one on the originally started the whole  thing on 4chan kind of took off early on and it was taken over  by a chance new owners and the queue almost certainly all the  queue drops from that point on were by I can't remember his  name the son of the.

Transcript:  yeah, yeah, but you never know with a documentary.  It's easy to it's easy to pick and choose, but I'm actually  glad to hear you say that and Frederick at first seemed to  me a little bit sketchy.  He certainly he started 8chan which was sketching and of  itself, but actually comes off pretty sympathetic and it was  virulently anti-queue and anti-8chan and Andy Watkins.  He knew that the threats especially as violence started  to happen.

I'm in a black box and I don't really talk about where I'm  at.  Maybe five or six years ago.  I had somebody threaten me and it wasn't like I'm that big of  a person but they knew enough about me but not enough to get  to me and that's why I live the way that I live like it's very  hard to get to me like I can show you my driver's license  right now and you're still not going to get directly to me.  But even with that like teaching kids and things like that  with the things that they post and they're sharing their  locations everywhere like as much as I say, we gave up  privacy.  There are certain things that people don't think about trying  to protect some layers of themselves.

That's not a harm and then people say well, what if insurance  companies knew I said, yeah, but is that happening?  They know everything anyway, but you make an X and then people  say well, what if the government turned out to be malicious  and they have all this information?  Okay, maybe when that happens, we'll start to worry, but you  make an excellent point.  These guys we don't know who the hell they are and they're  terrifyingly scary and they're very willing to use whatever  information they can get and apparently they're very good at  getting information.  That's that's that's pretty scary.  Do you think that that has something to do with why the  Republican Party is acting the way it's acting?  Are they just afraid?

Transcript:  I will put it to you like this.  I talked to Fred.  I mean pretty pretty regularly through the process like for  years.  But I talked to him on camera the last time in January and I  just asked him this really simple set of questions about  the future of this was just after the insurrection of the  refute the future of the Republican Party when it comes  to I'm not a partisan.  I'm not a Democrat or Republican, but when it comes  to these extremist factions, which are undeniable and what  Fred told me is that this is I mean you can watch his  interview, but this is not.  QAnon is is irrelevant.  They will evolve and become something else.  But the elements that created QAnon is not going away and  that they have not just infiltrated the Republican Party,  but they are components of it in large part because of  disinformation and misinformation.

Would I go to jail?  Is this going to be a problem?  Apparently not.  So people who have this bent can now say ah, there's a  playbook.  Here's how here's how you can play the public troll them make  money and pursue a big lie.  Post-truth post-truth is very scary to me.  And yes, look this is the show gets political from time to  time, but this is more than politics is about technology  and about how it is being used.  It's what we began the show with is this whole issue of  social and now I have to say given what you said and what  Owen has said, you know, I'm very open, you know people I  the other day I posted a picture that my home address on  it for crying out loud and some very nice people in the  in the discord took it down before anybody saw it.

Transcript:  Oh, you're right.  You're so smart.  You know, I want to tell you about WWT and Dell Technologies.  Thank you.  Owen JJ Stone.  Our show today brought to you by Worldwide Technology and  Dell Technologies WWT.  We've talked about them before.  I love these guys went out and visited them last March.  Our last trip before the pandemic in St.  Louis.  We saw the amazing Advanced Technology Center.  WWT is for decades been at the forefront of technology working  with clients all over the world to transform their businesses.  They are the kings the experts in enterprise technology and at  the heart of all that lies the ATC the Advanced Technology Center.  It's it's WWT's research and testing lab that brings together  technologies from leading OEMs more than half a billion dollars  in equipment in the lab, you know used to be that magazines  would do this.  PC magazine used to have this amazing testing lab.  Nothing like the ATC, but no nobody does this anymore except  I'm thrilled to see WWT doing it when we visited the lab.  It blew me away.  It's a spread out over several buildings.  It's miles of racks with some of the most amazing stuff in  there including some beautiful Dell power stores.  It's really interesting the stuff that's designed for racks  actually looks spectacular in the ATC.  You'll find hundreds of on-demand and schedule labs that  you can do like Dell's VxRail Cyber Recover Solutions Dell's  PowerStore, the Unity PowerMax Data Protection Central, IDPA  the newest advances of primary storage.  These labs are for you.  Of course it started with WWT's engineers.  They would use them for proof of concept to spin up pilots  give customers a chance to select the best solutions make  sure it could integrate with existing solutions which really  helped cut, you know, the evaluation time from months to  weeks, but now these labs are available to everybody in the  WWT community.  Other labs in the ATC represent the newest advances and things  like things you want to know about for your business like  multi-cloud architecture and security and networking and  primary and secondary storage data analytics, AI, DevOps, all  this stuff that is transforming business.  The ATC is there for you.  It's they call it lab as a service.  You could test out products and solutions before you go to  market. It's not just labs.  You can access technical articles get expert insights.  There's demonstration videos white papers so many tools to  help you stay up to date with the latest technologies and it  is a physical lab space in St.  Louis, but you don't have to go to St.  Louis. I would recommend it if you get the chance.  I can't wait to go back but you can also do it online because  it's a lab as a service.  They virtualized it.  Members of the ATC platform can access these resources anywhere  in the world anytime the day or night.

Thank you WWT for your support.  All right, so Tuesday, this is you know, it gets heavy, but  then we get back to shiny things.  Joy's cheers me up.  Tuesday, I think is going to be a big day for Google.  Google took a nap in 2020.  They didn't even bother doing Google I O this is too much  trouble, but they're going to do a Google I O the keynote is  Tuesday.  We will be covering it will be streaming a live Jason Howell  will join me.  What is that 10 a.m.  John Pacific pardon me and Jeff Jarvis.  Oh good.  That's great.  Jason how Jeff Jarvis and I will be sitting at these this table  watching the keynote with you.  10 a.m.  Pacific.  That's 1 p.m.  Eastern Time 1700 UTC.  You can watch live at twit.tv slash live.  Senator project kind of telegraph this in the analyst  call a couple of weeks ago.  He said we've got a lot of interesting that we got we got  some big stuff to talk about.  I think the nap time is over for Google.  And I'm very curious one of the things that's starting to  leak now.  Normally they announced the new pixel phones in the fall pixel  I didn't even bother because it was no it was hardly any  change.  This one's going to be a bit different.  We're already seeing design leaks John Prosser who is pretty  good on these leaked a design on his YouTube channel front  page tech.  He says these are the pixel 6 and the pixel 6 Pro.  These are renderings.  The front screen will go all I mean it is full screen a very  small hole punch for the camera the front camera very tiny  bezels.  There is an in-display fingerprint reader note.  It's not the first we've seen.  I mean others have done this but be interested to see how  Google implements it.  The back is two tone camera module is the full width.  It actually is the bar and by the way, it's not a camera bump  anymore.  It's a camera bumper that is a is a big raised bar on the back.  Perhaps that's a fall flaw in the rendering.  We'll have to see and the pixel Pro 6 includes a third rear  camera not found on the pixel 6.  So it'll be interesting to see new capabilities.  Google took some time off 2020.  The other thing we know is Google is going to do a custom  system on a chip including custom processor.  You mentioned that Wesley or what is this Google looking at  what Apple's done and saying hey we should do that too.

But a pixel to win the yes, but that's when they have the  video process.  Sorry the image processor their custom silicon in that phone  to help push image capture to the next level and now it's  kind of like so that was the big jump.

Start time: 6571.90
End time: 6613.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, the habit solely to the pixel 4 and 5.  Yeah, and so this is something that could actually help them  leap into the next level of whatever they want to optimize  it.  You mentioned the additional camera.  So hopefully me they're doing something with that that  optimizes it but the just from the design it looks better  than it's pretty any other phone out there not not saying  it looks like a lot better, but it looks different enough  that you can say, oh, I know what that phone is all the  previous pixels were kind of like they kind of blended in  specially through a case on it.  This is something even with the case it'll stand out which  in itself regardless of what they're doing inside is  exciting for the pixel line.

Transcript:  It feels like not only Google take a nap 2020 and you can  explain that with covid.  Okay, fine.  Although Apple certainly did not Microsoft certainly did not  but Google seems to have taken that time to rest but also  seems like they lost the guy who was behind their really  innovative cameras.  They were the best cameras out there.  The pixel though seems to have also lost its way at first  it was a low-cost reference design for people who wanted  to get the best Android experience then they then they  started charging flagship prices for it.  Then it started become.  Oh, that's the one with the best camera, but then they  rested on those laurels.  It seems to have really lost its way.  So this would be a good time for Google to sit up and  say, okay, we found our mojo.  It was in Sundar Pichai's back room and we're going to  bring it out again.  I want them to do that.  We need the competition.

Transcript:  Yeah, and they need that Microsoft mentality.  Yeah, they need that Microsoft mentality to have like taking  the loss to get in people's hands.  It's one of those weird things where you have a lower-end  phone not lower-end you have a lower-cost phone and I knew  so many people are like that must be like a cheap phone  because I'm paying $1,200 for a Samsung.  I'm paying $1,200 for an iPhone.  Why is this phone only $700 whatever it's lacking?  I don't want that like that's a general concept of average  people that when you talk to them about oh, have you looked  at this Google phone?  They're like no because they think it's cheap, but then  they try to raise the price and it's like, okay, well now  you got these two tears now you got too many options for  somebody who's not market share dominant Samsung can afford  to have an s plus and s light and s gigabit s tablet s note  like they can afford that leisure.  Google cannot Google needs to really hunker down and focus  and produce a great phone again.

You better make your own chips.  You better have your own sauce.  That sauce better be good.  You better consistently serve that sauce to try and climb  out of this hole that Apple's put everybody else in because  it's just it's dangerous right now Apple Apple is smooth  sailing with its mobility and that you know, the computers  not so much your Microsoft.  I built a PC my PC is a baller and I got this little m1.  You know what I mean?  This little this little Mac mini and they try to pull me  back in the game.

I feel like Intel's kind of talking about taking the big  sleep Intel hasn't done anything in years, but has Apple  really in its early days?  So, you know, maybe they will but has Apple really done  anything besides say we got our own silicon.  I mean they haven't really done anything that takes advantage  of this.  I feel like part of the problem is everything we've got right  now is really faster than we need.  It's fine.  Your pixel 2 is fine.  It's five years old, but it's fine.

I've gotten a video card in here.  I've got 16 gigabit like I'm pretty max.  I got 120 gigs of RAM in this thing.  And guess what for 8K video.  I still have to make proxies of this thing chugs along and  it sounds like a jet engine with this Mac Mini by itself using  Apple software.  I can actually import 8K raw video and it's not smooth, but  it works and I don't have to do anything to chop it up and  use it to work.  Like that's power for my case use for somebody even my r6  that the files are so large my PC.  I have to do certain things to make it run right, but whatever  they've got going on all this hand shaking that they're doing  inside this little thing.  It even works on my iPad better than it does on my computer  now.  I can still edit on my computer.  I know the workarounds.  I know how to do it.  I know how to get the job done, but this little thing has  impressed me with just my case use of that.  Like I just take this raw footage out.  That's huge and it just works on this machine.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  The incumbents talk about sleepy.  They were resting on their laurels.  They you know, it's always it's the innovator's dilemma.  Intel is doing really well making, you know, integrated  chips and systems integrating their business making their  own stuff.  All of this stuff.  They got very invested in it spent billions of dollars on  fabs and then it turned out that wasn't the way to do it.  The fabless guys came along like Qualcomm and arm and it's  like oops, but we put so much money into it.  We can't pivot and that's the problem, right?  In fact, in a way that's that's why Microsoft's kind of  impressive because the  they're one of the very few companies that that made the  pivot and made it work.

You're if you're living, you know on selling a certain  products hard to say well, we're going to do something  that's where Apple's been pretty good.

How are they going to find people who wants to work for  them? They will not get the best of the best when they  have this reputation and which means that it's going to  cause some some, you know backup and some slowdown.  They need to convince people that they that they that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

And be able to resurrect some of this nascent talent that  that they had before and just bring those bring people  back and make it welcoming and really make amends in  the community.  But my guess is they say the same thing the boilerplate  like we we are reinvesting.  We're doubling down.  We're so sick of that.  A lot, you know, like very that mealy-mouth stuff.  Yes.

He's been fired employees and circulated a petition on  Wednesday saying  you got some splaining to do Apple explain why you hired  this guy.  He because he has made things statements that are his  published views on women and people are color are  reprehensible.  Apparently you didn't know that he described women in  the Bay Area is soft and weak.  This is in the book Chaos Monkeys, which I tried to  read and threw across the room after a couple of  chapters.  He said women in the Bay Area are soft and weak  cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness  and generally full of poop.  That's not a nice thing to say in a book.  It was a terrible book.  And apparently Apple didn't read the book.  They have now fired him  terminated with extreme prejudice.  He tweeted about I have thus far far maintained my  silence on the Apple situation as I've sought to  settle things amicably with a company that I admired  which I had hoped to build the future of ads privacy.  As they however are not maintaining their silence in  the matter neither shall I.  I upended my life for Apple.  I sold my home shut down any public media presence  Apple knew about my book.

I've been told that no, no, I've been told that and an NBC  executive said no, no, no, we're not putting you on the  air.  So I know it's the red bowtie.  I think they didn't like that our show today.  Brought to you by Express VPN.  Have you ever wondered?  Why internet access is cheaper these days?  It's because isps like Comcast and AT&T have another ways  to make money, not just off subscription fees.  They're making money from spying on your internet activity  selling your history and data to big tech companies or  advertisers or marketers or whoever will buy.  We talked about privacy.  You know what a great way to protect your privacy is a  virtual private network, but but remember the VPN now assumes  the role of your isp your VPN now knows everything you're  doing.  So it's very important when you choose a VPN to hide your  stuff from your internet service provider or your or  your cell phone carrier or bad guys at the coffee shop when  you're doing that.  You got to pick a VPN provider that that respects you that  protects your privacy.  That's Express VPN and I don't I'm not just saying that even  though I've been using them for years.  I know it because they've had third-party audits.  They never log never log so your information is safe.  They even went so far as to create their own trusted server  technology when you press the button and every Express VPN  app has this great big button you press it then suddenly now  you're secure if they spin up a server they call it the trusted  server technology.  It's in Ram only it's sandbox.  It can't write to this even if it wanted to it cannot log and  the minute you log off it's gone and so is every trace of  your visit Express VPN is secure.  It works everywhere not just your phone your computer, but  even on smart TVs.  You can put Express VPN on a router so that your whole  family is protected.  The other thing I really like about them.  They invest in their infrastructure.  There are 160 Express VPN servers in 94 countries all over  the world and they always give them enough bandwidth so that  it's fast.  That's important too.  You won't know you're using Express VPN not because it's  slow.  Anyway, you only know it because your privacy is protected.  It's simple to use open the app tap the button.  That's it.  It's safe.  It's secure.  It's private your data is your business protected with the  only VPN I use Express VPN com slash twit Express EXP RSS  spell it out Express VPN com slash twit right now if you  sign up for a year, you'll get three extra months free.  It is the number one VPN.  It is absolutely trustworthy and that's the most important  thing Express VPN com slash twit.

I guess so you mentioned you mentioned this Dan Twitter is  looking at according to rumor a subscription plan called  Twitter blue to include undue tweets.  How much would you pay to undo some of those tweets and  some other features?  This this comes from a researcher Jane Mansion Wong who  has apparently looked at the source or something.  She says Twitter blue will be $2.99 a month for now including  paid featured like undue tweets and collections.  She's even got the screenshots save and organize your favorite  tweets into collections.  So they're easy to find later.  You know, this is Twitter has been trying desperately to  figure out a way to make money to somehow, you know, make  make a living in general.

Transcript:  So you just did this thing with Twitter tips, right?  Okay.  All you have to do to make a bajillion dollars is go set  yourself up with only Twitter.  Okay, don't compete with only fans.  You don't have to take $2.99 from me.  You can give me all these features free if you just make  a only Twitter where your Twitter is blocked off the  Twitter's like the only the last one of the last remaining  social media networks where adult content can still be  posted on that bad boy.  Go ahead and put up only Twitter and let people go get  subscription based stuff and go see what they want to see  over in the dark side of Twitter and then go get that  money and give me all this blue stuff free because I need  to delete a whole bunch of tweets because I can't spell  a half read right and I'm typing fast saying why I'm talking  on this show.  So go ahead and just start up only tweets and everybody  gets all the good stuff for free because you're gonna make  a bajillion dollars next quarter.  Send me my 2% advisory free cut.  I appreciate you Jack.  That's how you get money.  That's all I got to do.  Have you seen the tip jar?  You're spending some cash out some Venmo.

I don't necessarily trust it because Twitter has had  collections for years and it's been free.  So calling it like a feature makes me wonder the validity  of this interesting.

I see that as like if they do like kind of like Amazon Prime  will like bundle all that into the description fee.  Yes, please.  Thank you.  I hope that they do that with verification and allow me  to take money.  I would definitely pay the three dollars to get Twitter  blue or whatever they want to call it breaking news.

Of course, Bill and Melinda Gates according to The Wall  Street Journal have been negotiating a divorce settlement  since 2019.  That divorce became public just last week.  The Wall Street Journal implied that the problem was they  didn't say it outright, but they implied the problem was  Bill Gates relationship with Jeffrey Epstein that Melinda  Gates who's an advocate for women's rights and protection  of young women was unhappy about Gates going Epstein for  money for the bill of Melinda Gates Foundation.  Wall Street Journal thought that might have been the problem  now.  Thanks to this story from CNET.  There may be more Bill Gates left Microsoft's board last  year after fellow board members decided he should step down  as they pursued an investigation into a prior relationship.

It's a little bit more than capitalism because if you look  just straight up capitalism like VC money kind of capitalism  minority owned businesses bringing more revenue are more  successful, but yes get to get just a fraction of the money.  There you go.  If it was just purely capture capitalism, then we would not  be doing this.  In grain and trench power that is and not going to let it go.

Transcript:  It's all it's all so here's another example of horrible  behavior on Friday.  The New York Times briefly mentioned the president Biden  sent his grandchildren money on Venmo, which if you work for  BuzzFeed News is a red flag.  They immediately search for the president's account and found  it.  They mapped out a social web that encompasses not only the  first family but a wide network of people around them including  the president's children grandchildren senior White House  officials and all of their contacts on Venmo.  Now good news President Biden or somebody around him was smart  enough to say if you're going to use Venmo the default is  public.  It always shocks me when I launch Venmo to see what my son's  giving people money for what my daughter's giving people money  for what people I know are giving other people money for  those are public by default.  So click the little lock and make your transactions private  and at least the president's family is doing that and BuzzFeed  News has decided not to identify user names.  After they reached out to the White House for comment all the  friends on the president's Venmo account were removed.  Talk about that because you can hide transaction, but you cannot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

In fact, if you want privacy don't use Venmo.  Jam Patterson you've you've taught dissidents and others.  I remember you were doing this how to protect themselves online.

I follow account an account on Twitter that we chat a little  bit on DM, but they do really interesting stuff by pulling  all public photos and then putting all photos into the cloud  like tens of thousands of these pictures and then running their  own machine learning algorithms.  I think some of them are fairly young like just out of computer  science school and running machine learning algorithms kind  of track those people down and the connective tissue the connective  social network was all Venmo.  They were able to look at the friends of friends using Venmo  and say, okay, this will validate this ML algorithm that we  just ran on these photos.

Yeah, what you can figure out and if you're going to pay for  sex don't do it on Venmo Matt Gates if just you know what public  figures probably shouldn't be using Venmo.

Transcript:  I'm doing it.  That's right.  I'm giving it away.  Okay.  You can replicate me in my LLC.  Okay.  I ran a lot of finding exactly.  I ran a lot about how horrible the world is, but this show  personally, you guys understand Wesley is like a top-tier  individual and human being.  He has contacted me sometimes just for general conversation  sweetie and the just talk man to man and just have a quick  text or a quick DM.  He is just a great individual.  So another beloved him and his family and also on the other  side dapper Dan, I this guy we've been friends for almost  over a decade now and we've only been in each other's physical  space like five or six times, but I literally feel like this  dude's a brother to me if I want to read news or listen to  news.  If I'm listening to things that he's saying, I know that man  he is in a person he is it's vetted information.  It's information.  I could actually believe in a truthful and in the world that  he's in that's great to have somebody at least know on a  personal level that takes that job so seriously and so to  have both of these guys on the show is just great.  So I know I yell and say how bad things are but when you  get to look across the screen and have two people that are  just great and then Uncle Leo Center is down the middle just  know the world's great place and if you text me I won't  spam you but I got a whole bunch of shows in the can.  I'm coming back to life on the internet this year.  So I texted me you get direct contact with me.  I'm going to teach Uncle Leo about this direct marketing.  I'm going to teach Uncle Leo about buy houses on the LLC  and I would teach Uncle Leo about how we could possibly  recover his Bitcoin because if we kind of right hackers  from dark side we get this money.  I got to get dark side on this one.  Yeah, we might have to do something but just remember  again, I know I got a tinfoil hat on but the world is a  great place and it's the place that you make it.  So make your place great every day and with that another  twit is in the can.  Love you guys.
