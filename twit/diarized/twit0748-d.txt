Transcript:  The show where we cover the week's tech news in obsessive detail.  I have a great panel today.  It's just two people.  Two of my favorite people.  Christina Warren is here.  She's a senior cloud advocate at Microsoft.  Hi Christina.  Hey Leo.  How are you?  I'm great.  You're in your office and I see it says hello twit on your whiteboard.  I am.  Yes.

Start time: 156.23
End time: 162.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All the secret, secret plans.  Yes.  There's so many secret things that I normally have on my board.  Completely.

Start time: 163.20
End time: 175.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly what it was.  Actually I noticed our other guest.  Christina is joined by Amy Webb.  She's a futurist from abweb.io.  Usually Amy is sitting in front of a whiteboard with secret plans on it.  I know you've moved.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We just moved offices in New York.  I'm at my home office which is also being renovated.  I'm off to the side in a hallway.  I like to look at your whiteboard.  Amy is a futurist.

Start time: 187.22
End time: 194.27

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great to have you both.  We decided with you two I don't need anybody else.  We did our holiday special  which will be airing on the Sunday before Christmas  out against December 22nd.  It was Mary Jo Foley  and Stacey Higginbotham  and Micah Sargent.  Foolishly I thought let's look back at the decade.  Two and a half hours in we're on 2014.  Two and a half hours in we're on 2014.  Two and a half hours in we're on 2014.  My wife's going like this.  She's pointing at her watch.  Come on, come on, hurry it up.  2010 took an hour.  But as it turns out  the decade was kind of top heavy.  A lot of stuff happened  in the first five or six years.

Start time: 237.22
End time: 244.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well there was a lot of stuff happening around 2007  that continued.  We had big social media launches  and big computing changes.

Start time: 245.73
End time: 253.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well Instagram launched  in this decade.  Was purchased in this decade.  LinkedIn was purchased.

Start time: 253.20
End time: 254.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was started by Facebook in this decade.

Start time: 255.40
End time: 299.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean there's just a ton of stories.  The big story today  it came out in an email yesterday.  Apple has announced that you will be able to spend  exorbitant funds.  Huge amounts of money on your  Mac Pro starting Tuesday.  December 10th. Orders will begin.  The Mac Pro starts  at $6,000.  Oh you wanted a monitor?  That'll be another $5,000.  Oh you wanted a monitor stand?  That'll be another $1,000.  We're at 12 now  and you only have 256  gigs of storage and 32 gigs of RAM.  Oh you wanted more than 8 cores?  You can really spend a lot of money.  But honestly this is not a computer  for the rest of us. This is a computer for us.

Start time: 299.44
End time: 313.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm confused about Apple's product  roadmap strategy.  Because I mean I had the  G5, the earlier  bigger clunkier version of that  machine. I guess we should call this one the cheese grater.  If the last one was the  trash can.

Start time: 315.20
End time: 322.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's the cheese grater's, the vintage  ones, then the trash can.  Which looks more like a cheese grater  than the cheese grater's.

Start time: 323.24
End time: 368.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's what I don't get.  I appreciate the fact that it's  theoretically modular  and that you can theoretically add  components and add  on your own. I mean I'm sitting  in front of the trash can on my desk.  And technically you can take it apart.  But the ports are in a dumb place.  There's not enough ports. The ports are in  a really dumb place. The thing gets  very very hot. And ultimately  I'm not  editing 4K video. It doesn't  have enough power somehow.  And I bought a very high end version.  So my question is  between the multi  thousand dollar, or I guess the thousand dollar  stand that holds the multi  thousand dollar monitor. I don't  understand what the product strategy is. Maybe  you guys can help me figure it out.

Start time: 369.62
End time: 384.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean I think a lot of people  are kind of confused with that. I think the product strategy is  that they did actually listen to the feedback  from the trash can. Which  I remember reviewing it back in  I guess what was that? 2013?  2014 whenever it  came out. It was announced 2013.

Start time: 385.44
End time: 391.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mine arrived early 2014.  Six  years later there were no upgrades.

Start time: 391.87
End time: 409.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was it.  Which was just a massive problem.  I think that yeah, because what you bought in 2014  wound up being the exact same  thing that they are still selling now.  And to your point Amy, yeah the ports weren't in a great  place. It could overheat. It didn't  seem to have enough power even if you got it.  The way that it was. Apple confessed.  Yeah.

Start time: 411.46
End time: 416.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two years ago Apple had brought in  some journalists and said we  blew it. Right.

Start time: 417.56
End time: 473.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so I think this is them listening  in part to what the feedback  was. Which is we really liked having something modular.  We really liked being able to bring  in other things. Which is great.  I think the problem is, is that  when you look at the price point and putting the monitor  aside. Because even though I think that the  thousand dollars for the stand is idiotic  and ridiculous. Just include  it. If this is what it's going to cost with the stand  just map it in.  Having it as a separate thing to  me just makes no sense. But I  feel like the rest of the industry  has moved on from the point where  what Apple is charging for what you're  getting. You know you can look  at what AMD is doing with Ryzen.  You can look at some other things and people are just going  OK do I need this?  And even Apple it's sort of confusing  because for a lot of people an  iMac Pro or even a  5K iMac or even  the new 16 inch MacBook Pro  is going to be more than sufficient for  your needs rather than spending  you know $12,000.

Start time: 475.95
End time: 523.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're also pretty expensive. And so this  comes back to my question which is  who are these devices  intended for? Because I keep  hearing these are high end models  intended not for the masses  but for a rarefied group of professionals  working in a particular field.  I kind of feel like between the most recent  iPhone launch and you know this  new  the new iPhone launch  the  new Mac Pro  the previous stand, the previous devices and even  the on the MacBook Air  which also has apparently  no ports which makes me crazy.  It has two but they're all the same.  Right.  I think this is like  I'm not sure  who's doing the math over there?  Well wait a minute.

Start time: 523.24
End time: 537.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unfortunately you two  have just placed me in the position of  Apple apologist which is the last place in the world  I want to be. But to their credit  they're making a lot of money.  I mean  it's not like they're suffering because of their choices.  Are they making

Start time: 539.38
End time: 540.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean that's the question.

Start time: 541.20
End time: 542.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course they're making a lot of money.

Start time: 543.20
End time: 553.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're making money hand over fist. I think that there's an open question  could they be making more money if they were priced  slightly differently right? I think that's  a valid thing to say. When it comes  to the Mac Pro itself. I wouldn't even say that.

Start time: 553.20
End time: 564.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The PC industry is dying.  The Windows machine industry  these companies are suffering  with razor thin margins.  Apple has huge margins  and is far from dying.

Start time: 565.40
End time: 603.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not talking about  PCs Leo. I'm talking about phones.  Phones you could make an argument.  I think you could make an argument. And actually they did.  The phones cost less  than they did a year ago. They did actually  like they lowered the price of the  iPhone 11  compared to the XR.  They came down some there.  Even $50 is still a difference.  When you look at the Mac Pro  and I think that frankly that only audience  in an ideal world you would think that people doing  kuda tasks and doing a lot  of ML stuff. The problem is they don't use  Nvidia chips. They use AMD. So that's not  even actually a good use case.  Nvidia has announced that they're going to

Start time: 603.34
End time: 606.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  stop doing drivers for Macintosh  so you won't be able to use

Start time: 607.26
End time: 612.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a kuda chip. Right. But my point is that even if you were  like right now people who are trying to make  that work. Whether it's a hackintosh

Start time: 613.20
End time: 619.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do it. You could do an eGPU with a Mac  and use a Nvidia card.  But you won't be able to going forward. But my point Leo

Start time: 619.26
End time: 637.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  though would be that if you're buying a $12,000  machine for kuda stuff then  getting eGPUs  is not your best use case. You are  actually much better off using a different operating system  that's going to be the platform and those are going to be  the use cases you're doing. Because as  good as Vegas can be for certain use cases  that's just not what they're optimized for. I think

Start time: 637.32
End time: 686.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple is suffering a little bit here  because it took it took taking them  two years to create this. I think  to their credit they did listen to high  end pros. Apple which used to  tout the fact it was a computer for the  rest of us many decades  ago. Clearly this is not  the computer for the rest of us. But  maybe you could argue that some of their other stuff  is. This is a computer as high  end as you can get. It's intended for  high end creative professionals in  video photography  3D design 3D rendering  and for those people if you're doing  8K video or you're doing  music with a thousand tracks you know  Logic Project this is you know  a reasonable expense.  They're spending a lot of money  for those tools. Those tools are their  professional tools. They pay for themselves.  Even that expensive monitor is actually cheaper  than a high end monitor.

Start time: 687.34
End time: 688.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah the monitor I don't actually have an issue with.

Start time: 689.30
End time: 711.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is a market. It's a very  small market. And I  have to think Apple's whole intent with this  was to say  I mean they got a there was a little  bit of a black mark on the trash can  back that Amy and I bought. There was a  little bit of a you know and so I think  what they were they're saying is well if price were  no object we could design  the hell out of this thing. So let's do it.

Start time: 711.42
End time: 719.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still think I think that  they from my vantage point I  don't see what the longer term I don't see  a narrative arc. It's just

Start time: 719.62
End time: 741.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you here's the narrative arc for this.  This is just like Ford  building a what do they call  their race car the GTO. There's  like Ford building a five hundred thousand  dollar race car. Nobody's going to buy  that but it looks good on the track  and people  will know Ford can make this  and then that will trickle down.  And I think that's what this is. This is their GTO.  I mean yeah I

Start time: 743.60
End time: 799.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  agree with you but I disagree slightly. Like I agree  with you and I think that there is a market for this.  They're certainly not looking at selling you know massive  numbers of these the same way they didn't  sell massive numbers of the trash cans.  I think what's hurt them though with video editors because I  talk to a lot of them and I've worked with them for many  many years is that because of  the botch of the final cut  final cut 10 rollout even though a lot of those things  have been you know fixed and then  because of the failures around  the trash can  Mac Pro many many video  editors who are largely like  at this point very committed to premiere  it doesn't really matter to them whether they're  using a Mac or they're using a PC.  And if you're building a PC  you could build something with Ryzen  the newest AMD Ryzen ship which is now like a  16 core ship and that's not even getting into  their really high end stuff.  You could build something that would be very  very you know comparable  for much  less money. So you  know I think you're right. There is proprietary

Start time: 799.48
End time: 850.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  stuff in here and that's in a way  the negative on this is that  it's Apple proprietary. The  video cards the way they're mounted all of that  stuff is kind of Apple proprietary. So  you can't build  a PC that's exactly the same.  But I do think Apple suffered because they've  been designing this for years. They missed  out on Ryzen. If  a PC company is much more  nimble in the sense that they're cranking out new models  all the time. And so  they can say hey look this Ryzen chip is better  than the current Intel chip  price performance. Let's go  put a Ryzen chip in there and  next year Ryzen is going to go 64 core.  Apple is going to look silly with their  what is it 28 core  Mac Pro. So  I think that's just a  flaw.  I don't think this is Apple's  bread and butter though to be fair.  Again this is their GT.

Start time: 851.34
End time: 858.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It may not be but I haven't seen  a lot of innovation coming out of Apple  in a long time.  You know what's interesting

Start time: 859.40
End time: 889.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is Apple also doesn't see  a lot of growth in their market.  Which is why they've repositioned  themselves as a services company.  And then the last quarter the last reporting quarter  which ended in October they had 12 billion dollars  in service revenue. Which is  App Store, Apple TV,  Apple Music, iCloud.  iCloud. Yep.  And that's their new profit center.  So remember Apple changes is accounting  a couple of quarters ago. They said we're not going  to report unit sales anymore.  We're going to report revenue per customer.

Start time: 891.36
End time: 898.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean that was partially to mitigate  the lackluster iPhone sales which  are down like 9 percent  10 percent something like that.

Start time: 899.38
End time: 906.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah it didn't look as good to say  what the unit sales were there.  But on the other hand their revenue  per customer is pretty darn good.

Start time: 907.36
End time: 945.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm happy for Apple to pivot to services  but the services better be damn good.  And they're not.  No I will tell you  that I fired up just for the hell of it.  Here for everybody listening  who cares about privacy here's  a fun thing that I discovered a couple days ago.  So I got  a subscription free  whatever for the new  Apple TV product which replaced  so I have not opened up  I haven't opened up iTunes.  When Apple started monkeying around with all of the playlists  I got irritated and  you know haven't opened up iTunes  or Apple TV now in years. Let me guess you're

Start time: 945.30
End time: 946.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  using Spotify. I am.

Start time: 947.60
End time: 999.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like the rest of the world.  So anyhow I opened up  Apple TV. Now I am somebody who anybody  who watches or listens to the show knows  cares a lot about privacy.  I have a different  made up email address and very difficult  password for every single  service that I use and none  of them are linked together.  Which I've done intentionally.  I turn on Apple TV  and right below  the new morning  show promo is  exactly where I've left off watching  Fleabag on  Amazon and exactly  where I left off watching  whatever I was watching on Netflix.  I mean it's all there.  And I was  my house had been broken into.  Well it's more I didn't I mean I guess  I gave somebody permissions at some point  through the TOS but man I was ticked off.

Start time: 1000.01
End time: 1013.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah I think the way that  works is if you've entered in your password  into those apps  on one of your devices it  can share that.  I guess is how that would work.  So Fleabag is on Amazon Prime.

Start time: 1013.20
End time: 1028.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have an Amazon Prime  app on your  Apple TV. You were watching  it on Roku. But as far as  that Amazon Prime is concerned  the platform is irrelevant.  It knows what you're going to watch next.  And then Apple TV does it.

Start time: 1029.48
End time: 1038.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it was iOS  porting everything in  into the new Apple TV.  Which is problematic for a couple of reasons.  It's not. It's not? No.

Start time: 1039.20
End time: 1067.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's your Amazon Prime. If you have an Amazon Prime  on your Apple TV logged in  it knows where you left off on every  other platform. And that's what's going to show you.  And then where you might  not like it all of that gets piped  into Apple TV.  That big front page app that they want you to use.  The only company that doesn't do that  you don't have to is Netflix. So you  notice it doesn't know what's next  on your Netflix. But it knows  what's next on everything else because you've logged  into everything else on your Apple TV. It doesn't have to go through iOS.  My point

Start time: 1069.32
End time: 1079.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is this.  Because it lives, because  where I left off on the show now lives inside  of the Apple TV app on my iPad  that tells me

Start time: 1079.32
End time: 1091.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that there's a... Well to be fair  it lives inside your Amazon Prime  account and all of those things.  And Amazon knows it.  Amazon's telling Apple when you launch  your Apple TV. That doesn't mean

Start time: 1091.38
End time: 1100.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple's... No, no. But you do have the option  to choose yes or no if you want  the TV app to use  those apps.  You could say no.

Start time: 1101.28
End time: 1117.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember of late because  services are so important for Apple. The TV  app has done a lot to promote Apple TV Plus.  And I don't want to see all those ads.  The same reason I stopped using Amazon devices  because it was all about Amazon Prime.  So if you want you can use the  Apple TV like it used to be which is just  your apps.

Start time: 1119.24
End time: 1139.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what gets me to the services.  Because I know that...  I'm not sure what Apple  is doing with music. I'm not sure what Apple is  attempting to do with these awards  and all of these other things. But if you think of  Apple as a sort of...  One of the things I've been thinking about is  is there a new kind of  meta-platform in the process of being born?

Start time: 1139.22
End time: 1142.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's a great question.  I think that's the case.

Start time: 1143.20
End time: 1167.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. That's what I... After I was  irritated and felt violated  the thing  that I was left with was, huh, whoever's  got the shell  the UX shell here  seems to  maybe potentially have access to  the data  that I've worked very hard to  de-identify across all of these different  services. Yeah, I don't know if they actually have

Start time: 1167.38
End time: 1185.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  access to the data.  I don't know if they actually have access to the  data. I don't know either. I mean  it's a valid question to ask, right? And it's  worth looking into. But I don't know if they do.  From what I understand, they don't. From what I understand,  it's basically just an API piping in  like what the watch  information would be. Unlike Google, Facebook,

Start time: 1185.50
End time: 1220.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Android, maybe  Windows, Apple tries really hard  to do stuff on-device. And  so I'm almost certain, and you're right,  I haven't looked either, but I'm almost certain.  I think it's usually safe to assume that that's the  Apple TV, that that data  is stuck in the Apple TV, that it's not sending  it back to Apple. But who knows?  There's value in it. And frankly,  if I were you, Amy, I'd be more worried about the fact  that if you're watching that on a Samsung  TV or a Sony TV, it's telling  Samsung and Sony that you're watching it.  I mean, if you've  got an Amazon Echo running, it's probably  listening in. If you've got a Google  phone, it's almost certainly

Start time: 1221.36
End time: 1235.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  listening in. Right. The kind of  interesting thing is that we believe  that when we watch something, it's one  directional. And really,  anytime we are watching anything,  multiple parties are watching us back,  not just one. Yes. Yes. So,

Start time: 1236.11
End time: 1298.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this is the interesting  point that I hear from Apple users all  the time is the reason they  use Apple is because they trust  Apple to a greater degree  than they trust all these other people.  And Apple certainly plays  on that by saying constantly  it's on device, it's on device.  It's why Siri is so useless  is because so little information  is getting sent back to Apple.  Now, it really,  all of this, whether how you feel about Google,  Facebook, Apple, anybody, Amazon  comes down really to personal feeling  because we don't have a lot of  information. It's all kind of a gut feeling  based on what we've observed.  And it could very well be, and I think  there are a lot of people make the argument, well, the only  reason Apple doesn't care is because they had  an ad platform that failed. So,  they're not trying to sell ads anymore.  They tried iAds, but it didn't work.  So, they're making a  virtue out of a necessity.  And who knows? I mean,  maybe they secretly harbor  an interest in collecting this data.  Certainly, there's a lot of revenue there.  If you're a services company, then

Start time: 1315.28
End time: 1338.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, let's go back to that idea  of a meta-platform. Here's  sort of where I think this is potentially  heading. You know, we have all  of these PII's personally identifiable  information following us  around everywhere. I'm going to sneeze.  No, I'm not going to sneeze.  I know something about you now.  Everybody does.  So, if  we're talking about...

End time: 1366.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So, here's the question.  Is it plausible that Apple  and others  are in the process of developing  sort of personal data records  a single place  that houses  all of our data within one system?  I mean, they're kind of already doing that.  But if you look at Apple's four end  health and healthcare systems...

Start time: 1366.60
End time: 1384.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's a perfect example. So, for instance,  Apple Health now lets me tie into my  medical provider.  And so, all my health records  are now in Apple Health. But Apple says  very clearly in the terms of service  this never  leaves your phone. We do not get this information.  It doesn't matter. That's the services

Start time: 1388.38
End time: 1417.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  derive value. Well, that's my  contention. So, Apple, as long as they see  a revenue positive  direction that protects privacy,  will go that way. As long as it makes them  money. In fact, it might make them more  money because they're the privacy  protectors. And a lot of people these days  are going to go there. They're going to  do that. But the minute it's a  money loser, I can guarantee you  Apple would say, well, now we'd like Siri to be  better. Or we could do a better  job of protecting your health if you would give us your  health information.

Start time: 1418.20
End time: 1447.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, that's the interesting thing.  On this thread, just really quickly, because Amazon  and Google are also both going in the same  direction. Well, we know Amazon is going out.  Straightening up all of our PIs.  The revenue derived is through  mining and refining, I think, on Amazon  and Google's side.  If Apple emerges as  the top tier,  I guess what I'm getting at is  maybe there's a new kind of wealth  divide in the process of being born,  but one derived from data.  People have said that.

Start time: 1448.26

To your point, Leo,  I'm not going to  try to speak on behalf of any  company, not even my own  that I work for. When it comes to this  stuff, Apple, I do think, you know, they've  made it very clear that one of their values,  or they've stated one of their values is privacy.  And look, we can be cynical and say it's probably  because it's a differentiator, right?

Start time: 1510.20
End time: 1537.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where I get cynical. When they say it's our DNA,  it's our values, we're living our  values. I don't buy that, because  when Russia says,  well, now you have to put the Russian apps on iPhone,  they don't leave Russia. When China says,  now you have to give us dissidents  data, they don't leave.  So their values are very  conveniently commercial. But honestly,  if you think any  corporation in the world acts  on anything but the profit motive,  you're naive.

Start time: 1538.28
End time: 1614.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is my point. I'm saying, like, I don't actually  care if it is a cynical reason or if it's something else  or maybe they don't have the abilities  right now to mine the data the way that Amazon  and Google do. I don't overthink that.  It's a good marketing ploy. It is.  But I do think that does create an interesting kind of  dichotomy, because to Amy's point,  there are these, we now have,  you have Google, you have Amazon, you have  Apple, who are all trying to very much  kind of do a similar thing in terms of getting  everybody to share their data through them  as kind of like the gatekeeper.  And if Apple is able to say,  well, we won't actually give up your  data or intermingle it and we are going  to be secure this way, but we are going  to charge you more.  As a result of that,  there is a large number of  people who have the means to do that who will do it.  But to Amy's point, like, that does then  create kind of this classed  society, which is, OK, the people who  have a certain amount of money can take  part in this and the people who don't,  their information is going to be mined.  Although I do have to wonder, though, at a certain point,  the people who are wanting to mine this data,  if you realize that all the high-income people  and the people that have maybe the most  are the most targetable and most desirable,  if they're not available to you,  does that ever at a certain point  lessen the value of the data  that's being leaked from others and  maybe make it not quite as  a threat?

Start time: 1616.71
End time: 1687.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is where scale comes into play.  So, you know,  there's far more value to be derived, I think,  in Amazon's version of this  ecosystem.  Amazon doesn't just have,  you know, Alexa  smart speakers.  They've got smart microwaves.  They've got many different smart devices.  They've partnered with Lennar, which is one of  America's largest home builders.  So in their process of building entire  smart homes, which you can actually buy  on Amazon. If you go to turnkey.com,  you can now  look for one of these homes.  And these are not super, super  expensive, multi-billion dollar homes  or multi-million dollar homes. I grew up  in Chicago  and not in a totally like  blue collar neighborhood and not  too far away from where I grew up are  some, you know, pretty  spectacular Amazon homes.  So if we start to  look at the downstream implications of all of this,  what does it mean?  It means that the people who are  being targeted in Amazon's ecosystem  are probably the ones who  are going to be on the more vulnerable end  in a free market economy.  You know what I mean?  We should mention that Amy's written

Right? Like the people who work there.  Well, but this is becoming a much bigger  thing, right? Like this has been happening with a lot  of the different contracts and a lot of the  people walk out with other things.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is exactly what I'm saying. And I think  that there  I think when we say things like  these companies are amoral and there isn't  anything, I guess, you know, we in  some ways kind of kind of walk it off as if  oh, well, there's nothing we can do and there's nothing to stop  any of this.  That's not true because the people who work at  those places to varying degrees do  have control  over things. And I think  this is why organizing is important. I think this is why  people speaking up is important. And why  it's important for the people who are involved, especially  in things that could be problematic  and could have  potential impact on lots of  different things. It's important for those people to feel empowered  to speak up and do things. It's a particular problem at tech

And so  when the engineers at Google stand up  and say, we don't want to do face  recognition for the Department of Defense,  that carries more weight.  If the people at my company  stand up and say, we don't want to do something, I just say,  well, thanks, see you later.  But engineers are such  a valuable asset. They do. I wonder  though, ultimately. Look,  you know,  you guys won the Jedi contract,  much to Jeff Bezos's  disappointment.  Google probably is doing  Defense Department work. Ultimately,  it's the responsibility of Sachin  Adela and Sundar Pichai and Jeff Bezos  to... Their ultimate  responsibility is to  balance all of this with  one goal, to produce value  for their shareholders.  And so they're balancing the  engineers not liking it, but  only economically, not morally.

Start time: 2046.73
End time: 2064.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Yeah. 60%  I think of the trades are  quant funds and ETFs, which are  initially designed.  So these are algorithmically traded funds  that have factors that are initially  determined by humans, but they're making  quick trades based increasingly  on things that humans aren't  determining. Yeah.

So here's where I think things are interesting,  because if you think again of  sort of the meta-platform  example, you know, there's nothing  like, what if Amazon decided  to start trading on its proprietary data  related to the housing  market? You know, in some way,  Amazon could be positioning  itself to in a very, you know,  it's just a couple of years, have more  actionable, meaningful  data about our US housing  market than the US government does.  And I don't think there's anything  stopping tech, like from a legal or technical  standpoint, stopping them from doing that.

I think it's certainly a possibility. I don't know.  If there are things, I'm sure there are things that  they would probably be able to find, you know, maybe loopholes  around. But typically, yeah, I mean,  that's a really good point that if they have that type  of proprietary information that they would be able to make  better trades on investments  in the housing market because their  internal data is better than what,  you know, the government

Transcript:  It's a fascinating topic.  And we talk about it a lot more than  I thought we would. When I first  started covering tech, I thought I'd be  talking about the latest computer  chips and how much RAM is  enough. It's really  metamorphosed as tech has  become an integral part  of the fabric of our society.  And we're all grappling with  what do we do  about it?  Even if  it's run, even if it's humans, as you  make an excellent point, it's like  Soylent Green. Big tech companies are  made of people.  But  they also move in a way  that is maybe less people  driven. So it's  fascinating to watch. I guess this is really  what you are constantly  banging your head against, Amy, as you  try to figure out what's going on in the future.  Let's take  a little break, come back with more in just a bit,  including, yeah, new leadership  at Alphabet,  which might not make any  difference at all. I don't know. I want to  talk to you about this thing, because this is  the best thing ever. This is my molecule.  This is the new mini molecule, or little molecule.  Molecule is  air purification  done right. It's not a filter. It's not a HEPA  filter. HEPA, which was  invented during World War II, is  really just a filter that traps big  particles and stores them in the  filter. Do you throw it out? Molecule  goes to the next step. It actually purifies  your air using something they call Pico.  Photoelectrochemical  oxidation.  It provides a solution for the entire  home when it comes to air  purification. And because they have  two devices now, you can choose the option  that's best for your space, the molecule  air for the big rooms, or this molecule  mini for a smaller  space, or a combination. We got our  first molecule, because Lisa  was complaining about waking up with sinus  headaches every morning, and  I felt bad, and so we got the molecule,  immediately cleared them up. And I thought,  oh, huh, this is  interesting. In fact, we know when the molecule  has been turned off, if somebody  unplugs it, the house cleaner's unplug it, or  somebody's in the, you know,  something goes wrong, and  she wakes up with a headache, and she says,  check the molecule. And of course,  immediately, yep, it was off.  We know it works. I want to show you  the Pico filter, because it's a really interesting  technology.  It's like a  electrochemical reaction.  So, it's like a metal ring  that attracts  the smallest things, not even  trappable by HEPA filters, like mold,  viruses, bacteria, even  volatile organic compounds.  Things like the formaldehyde coming off your  carpets, or paint fumes.  It traps them, and then  it uses a UV light to burn  them up. They are destroyed.  So, instead of becoming a  carrier for all these pollutants,  it actually captures them and destroys  them. That's Pico.  So, it's a two-step  filter. Inside here  is, this is the,  like a regular air filter,  and that gets the pet hair and the bigger stuff.  And then inside, I can't really take it out,  inside is the little,  the oxidizing tube, that captures  it, and then there's a UV light that just burns  it up. It is awesome!  Actually, you know, if you go to the website, you can see  how it works. M-O-L-E  K-U-L-E dot com.  This was invented  over, it was actually  patented over 20 years ago  by the director of the Clean Energy  Research Center at the University of South Florida.  They patented  this system, breaks down pollutants to  harmless components,  and it's been tested  in labs  all over the world.  It really works. I  vouch for it. It really does  the job. It's easy to use, if you've got  headaches from allergies or  sinuses, or if you've got  chemicals. This is  great in those sick offices where you  can't open the windows. It will  turn that air into breathable air.  You gotta get it. You get 10%  off your first air purifier  when you go to Molecule dot com  and use the promo code TWIT10.  You can even pair this to  your Wi-Fi. There's an app  and it will automatically, we just got our new filters.  It was kind of nice. I didn't know I was going to get them,  but it knows when the filters get low,  it sends you new filters automatically.  That's pretty cool too. Molecule dot com.  Promo code TWIT10 for 10%  off your first Molecule  air purifier. It really is  amazing.  Amy Webb,  Christina Warren,  we're talking about the week's news.  Can I pipe in with

Is anyone  going to like this? And I was like, oh, I saw  the first three episodes. I was like, oh, this is great.  I think this is going to be a hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Satanist, cynical.  Yeah, no, I know.  We all love Gilfoyle.  Let's talk about Larry Page.  He's stepping down.  Twenty-one years ago,  Larry Page and Sergey  founded Google  and built it  for a while. Then they hired Eric Schmidt  for quote, adult supervision.  Schmidt  let Larry take back over as CEO,  but as a number of people pointed out,  it seems like Sergey is pretty  dialed out and Larry was almost dialed out.  Didn't seem like they were very much.  Some employees said they haven't  been in all hands in ages.  So a lot of people are saying,  you know, it's not going to change much.  Sundar Pichai, who was CEO  of Google, will now be the  CEO of Alphabet.  He'll take over running the big  umbrella company. Larry  and Sergey will stay on  the board and of course still have the majority  voting stock. So  if they don't like something,  they can even get rid of the board. They have  that much power. So I  don't know how much this is going to change, Google.  What do you think, Amy? Is this a  transition that we should pay attention to?

Start time: 2960.73
End time: 3024.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean, I just echo  what you said, which is I think  every company as it grows  and especially very successful companies  at some point go through a series  of management changes and that typically  includes the founders of those companies.  So I don't think what's happening now is really  outside of the realm of what would be normal.  I think the  questions that I would have  are, you  know, this company has gotten very big  and there's not a single AI  for example, with artificial  intelligence, there's not one division.  There's a couple of different divisions and  kind of with a horizontal  structure that doesn't  entirely connect the two.  There are  divisions that you could think of as  almost orphans because there's  not a lot of  knowledge sharing between the different  parts of the organization. So I  wonder if  with Sundar moving up  and them moving out, if there'll be  a more streamlined structure going  forward, which would do nothing but help the organization,  I would think. You know, there's a

Start time: 3024.28
End time: 3041.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  certain analogy to Microsoft.  Microsoft's in its third  era now. You know, you had Gates, you had  Balmer, and for the last five  and a half years, Sacha and Adela.  Google is now entering its third  phase. It was a  big change for Microsoft. Christina, do you  think it's going to be a big change for Google?

Start time: 3042.75
End time: 3123.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think this  would be more akin to  I guess maybe when Balmer took over  from Bill Gates, right?  Business as usual kind of? Yeah,  right. Like I think that because Gates  was still involved, he was on the board.  He wasn't maybe doing day-to-day  things, but he was still involved in parts  of the business and whatnot. And then  towards the end of his tenure, I think there were some  differences. But obviously, there's been a much  bigger cultural and business shift  as, you know, Sacha took over  succeeded Balmer.  So I mean, I think that  in this case, I think  what's interesting is, I mean, my first question  was, okay, if Sundar is taking over  Alphabet, like, why does Alphabet still exist?  Why are we still doing the shell company thing?  Like to me, that's still unclear. Like I can  understand if you want to have these  sub-companies, I guess.  But if you're putting everything  under, if Google is under the auspices  of one guy and that guy is  also controlling Alphabet,  to me, the whole  point of Alphabet had seemed to be like, okay,  we have this one  kind of grander CEO of all these things  and then we have these individual leaders of  these different divisions. But if you have one guy  who's the head of everything and he's also  the head of the day-to-day for the  largest division, I kind  of don't see the point in having this shell  thing and instead you should, you know,  put all the other divisions underneath  Google. I don't know.

Start time: 3124.20
End time: 3156.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this was, I think,  more of an operational  versus a shell company  shift. You know, if you look at Microsoft over  the past several decades,  there hasn't been a lot  of stray from core competencies. So,  operating system,  cloud, you know, and the various  sundry services that go along with that.  But part of what was happening at Google  over the past decade was launching  into self-driving  car, you know,  work, I hear you,  interfaces, health care.

Start time: 3156.58
End time: 3173.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't disagree with that. I guess my point is,  if you have the same person who's in charge of all of these  things is going to be saying, okay, this is the  CEO of like the big, you know,  OSPIS thing, but he's also in charge  of Google, which  contains lots of these things,  some of which intersect with these other areas,  some of which don't.

Microsoft is in a better position  than Apple or Google, but I think both  Apple and Google are looking at a future  that doesn't include Google  Search or, you know, whatever. They're trying  to figure out what's the next thing.

Transcript:  This is basic research. You've got to do it, right?  So this is not unusual. So just for  context, for a big  technology or science  company, this is not, you know,  if you look at a Bose, for example,  or a  Bell Labs, you know, a long  time ago, you know, an  important component of their work was basic  research. It's just that you didn't tend  to historically hear about that basic  research until there was something to show for it.

Start time: 3276.20
End time: 3286.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we saw a lot of good come out of Bell Labs, but I  don't know if it was a lot of good to benefit  AT&T, and they eventually sold it, became  loose, and they got sold again.  I don't know how valuable...

Start time: 3286.77
End time: 3312.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think it was. I think AT&T  was split up by the government, and  if that hadn't happened... Honestly,  like that hadn't happened because they had Unix,  they had all kinds of other things, they had a lot of, like, video  telephony, like they had so much stuff that  if the Baby Bells hadn't been split  up, that's a very different scenario. I mean,  now they basically come back together, but that's  a very different scenario. I mean, to Amy's point, I mean, Google  obviously has many research divisions. At  Microsoft, we have Microsoft Research. You know, Amazon  has their areas, and I don't... And that's  why Google exists.

Start time: 3314.75
End time: 3382.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why is that a problem? A problem  at Microsoft... So some of the best  machine reading comprehension code  that I've seen has come out of Microsoft.  The problem with all of these  enormous companies is that you  have the researchers doing their basic  research or their, you know, their difficult  research. You have a product  team that's charged with trying to commercialize  as soon as humanly possible,  and you don't have an intermediary thinking  about the longer term opportunities,  risk, and implications.  So sometimes some of this  amazing research winds  up not making it outside  of the research division, and then  a long time after that, we all look back  and say, well, this was a giant waste of time  and didn't provide shareholder value.  So I wonder if  part of what's happening at Google  slash Alphabet is a  forthcoming reorg that will  help bridge some of the  divide between the pure research divisions  and some of the  other operations in a way that  doesn't force commercialization too soon  because that's an easy way for Google to  miss the mark on analyst reports  and to create crappy products and  all the rest of it. Understanding that both of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have a much better insight into these companies  than I do. I'm sitting outside looking in  with no understanding of what their plans are,  their goals, but the way it looks sometimes  from people looking in is you have  a CFO, Ruth Porat,  who has been very  aggressive about killing  non-profitable arms  of the enterprise.  She's the Alphabet CFO, not Google.  You've had, I think,  it feels like Larry and  Sergey saying, not this one, Ruth, not this one.  But you can kill that.  With them kind of dialed out  more of the picture, you've got Sundar Pichai,  who, by the way, I have huge respect for.  He's a good operational guy.  But I wonder if the combination  of Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat  takes Google  a little bit away from its blue  sky and a little bit more towards  its bread and butter.

Transcript:  disclosure, I have advised Microsoft.  I haven't in the past several months,  but I have. So let me say  this. We don't have  a blueprint that represents  the kind of companies that are in the process  of evolving. And we don't have a  template for the ecosystems in which  they're operating. And so that  really isn't... You can't look at somebody like Ford or

Start time: 3472.20
End time: 3476.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Toyota. You can't look at... There's no industrial era  company that's an analogy.

Start time: 3476.20
End time: 3617.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so. I think that  using the industrial revolution  as a shorthand to describe what's happening right  now... It's not even close.  It's really not. And so  we haven't had... If you look at  some of America's former  mega companies  like Ford, for example,  they were producing a fairly narrow  type of product. And they were building  a market and they were changing  the world, but they were doing it in a limited  way, in a tangible  way. These new companies  are predicated on data  and the way that those data are collected,  mined, refined, optimized, used,  and the various products  that... Whether it's  hardware  or cloud-based  or pretty soon wetware as they  start to move into health and  new types of human interfaces  that meld with machines.  All of this presents a new kind of  management challenge that  we just haven't had before. And therefore  it means new management.  I mean, one of the  things that I'm noticing is we have a  lot of people who are elevating through the ranks  of these companies. I think we  probably need some kind of new way to  train the people who are managing these kinds of  companies because you can't just make...  It might  be a short-term benefit to Nix  Verily, for example, or whatever  other projects they're working on  at great long-term  cost.  The kinds of  ancillary work that all these folks  are doing is not  the kind of research that's going to turn a profit  in the next couple of years.  There's whole new kinds of management  challenges that we've just never had  before and you can't look at managers from  the past.  Ray Dalio is  somebody who I think is incredibly  smart and usually very, very smart on this  kind of stuff and he's been writing a little bit about  this in different places.  It's a...  This is a problem that's going to  that Google is going to have to contend  with going forward.  Amazon has been very  secretive. Bezos just  added how many people to their executive  group? 22.  Yeah. 22, I can't believe it was.  I think this signals to me that  there's management challenges  that we're starting to see unfold.  Adding more people doesn't

It doesn't  quite work out that way.  And I also have to wonder... But this is hard.  It is hard.  I understand. In general,  my sense, at least in  technology, is that the incumbents,  it's the innovator's dilemma,  have a very, very, very difficult  time pivoting to the next big thing.  And at least until now,  the next big thing has always come from some  unexpected place.

Start time: 3662.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's easier to pivot and  follow somebody else's lead to  the next big thing. It's much harder when  you are the pivot. And you have to make  decisions about the direction  of the organization.  And I wonder how much these Blue Sky

Start time: 3676.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  research labs, like Microsoft's  or Bell Labs, which is by the way, now owned  by Nokia. Good luck, Nokia.  Or Google's X and  other bets. I wonder how, historically,  how important these  Blue Sky research  facilities have been to companies, whether  they really did make a difference. I know it  didn't help Xerox.  Classically, Xerox invented  the future and  went bankrupt. And so did Eastman Kodak.  This is the problem. Right, they

Start time: 3706.36
End time: 3759.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  invented the digital camera and then didn't know  what to do. So historically, this  is tough. And that's what I'm  talking about. You have, Microsoft has  absolutely  top tier, brilliant researchers.  This is a management  challenge. And it afflicts  every one of these big companies  because there's a tension  between getting something  to market to appease shareholders.  Shareholders, by the way, do not like R&D  investments because they're not revenue generating.  Amazon got spanked  somewhat recently because  they revealed the amount that they were spending on R&D  and shareholders did not like that.  And I kind of am like, well, what the  hell do you think is going to earn your revenue?  Where do you think the future value is  coming from? If these folks aren't doing R&D,  then they're going to take six years  to make a computer that basically nobody  wants, Apple.  Hashtag. Why does anybody want the  cheese fritter?

And that model has borne out.  And at the time,  every analyst on the street  looked at our research who was even  looking at it and was like, you know, they don't know  what they're talking about because  sometimes our hopes and desires for the  future don't mesh well with reality.  And reality is  you have to invest. You have to do that  R&D, but you also have to do it in a way  that  bridges the research  into the product and the area  where value is derived and that's management.  And my point is,  right, so I wonder if in this new  structure, if what's being set  up at Alphabet is a way  to better bridge  the gap between the really smart people working  on critical gnarly problems  and the people who would monetize.  That would be a prudent thing to do

But first, a word  from Worldwide Technology  and their Advanced Technology Center.  By the way, some good news. We're going out there  in March. We're going to do an event in St. Louis.  More details coming up.  WWT began  building this ATC about 10 years ago.  They built it initially for their own  engineers and they stocked it with  more than half a billion dollars in enterprise  equipment from hundreds of OEMs,  key partners ranging  from the big guys like NetApp  and Cisco and VMware  to Emerging Disruptors, Tanium,  Equinix, Expanse.  Inside there are half a billion dollars of gear  and the engineers use it to spin up  pilots, proofs of concept,  to create setups for  their clients. It's an amazing,  valuable system for  WWT but I also have to point out  it could be an amazing,  valuable system for you too.  It is an incubator  for IT innovation  and with on-demand  labs, scheduleable labs,  you can participate too.  Things like NetApp Cloud Volumes on Tap,  on Tap, on Flash, NetApp Disaster Recovery  as a service,  hundreds of other labs representing  the latest and greatest in everything  from flash storage,  multi-cloud hyperconverged infrastructure,  cloud data management.  It is a place where you can go.  They call it  Lab as a Service. It's a dedicated lab space  within the ATC  where you can perform your own  programmatic testing. Just like  the engineers at WWT too  using this vast technology  ecosystem that they've already built in there.  Half a billion dollars worth of enterprise  gear. And because  it's virtual, you can use it 24-7  anywhere in the world.  Is that not awesome? You don't have to go to St. Louis.  We are going to go to St. Louis. I can't wait to see the lab.

And  it's going to be a really interesting event  out there. We're all invited.  Google and everybody else are like  these guys are like captains of a ship  that's burning. They're building the lifeboats  as quickly as they can.  That's a good analogy. I have to point out  there is a massive storm  on the horizon and that's government  regulation. It's really interesting  that Larry and Sergey both said, okay,  you guys take it over at the very  moment that Google is under all sorts  of investigation. Their employees are  rebelling.  There are lots of challenges that have nothing  to do with can you make a better search engine  or a self-driving vehicle.  So let me ask you about  that. I'm going to ask Christina about this so we can  balance it out.  How worried should these companies be about  government intervention? Is this all just political  bluster or is the  next president going to say, Google, you got to get  rid of YouTube?

Transcript:  I mean, look,  I think it would be great if  there was more  sensible and  I guess focused. Maybe  the government was looking at things in a sensible  and valid way to say,  has there been overreach and are there things that  maybe these companies are doing too much  that we should step in at the same time?  I personally think a lot of it is just political  bluster. And I'm very  hesitant just because of  looking at everything that's happened in the past  that every attempt, anybody who's said  that we will regulate these things  has ended up not doing it. And in fact,  the trend over the last  30, 40 years, no matter what  administration has been in power, no matter who's  been in charge of Congress, has been about  deregulation rather than adding more  regulations. So I'm actually not in  any way hopeful  that there will be any sort of government  stepping in any meaningful way.

Transcript:  and regulation? I would like if it was done  in a smart way, in a focused  way, yeah, I think that there would be in some cases  definitely, especially around data usage  and privacy. I think that, yes,  I think that there are problems. The  European Union has done a really good job  in some cases, in some cases, like right  to be forgotten. I think they've gone too far. But in other ways,  I think they've actually taken  the reins and have done some  important things to at least try to rein  some things in. But  I'm right now,  even though I support a lot of the  candidates who talk about regulating tech,  I roll my eyes, if I'm  being completely honest, because I don't think  that it's going to happen and it's especially  not going to happen that they say that it is.

Transcript:  nationwide. No, of course not. I mean, similar with  GDPR, if you have to go through the process of rolling  those things out, it makes sense to try to do it  as broadly as you can, you know, because  it's a very difficult process  to have, okay, we're only going to follow these laws  or these rules in these locations.  I get that, and I'm a fan  of adhering to  these regulations if they make sense.  I'm just saying from a cynical standpoint, I don't  really have a lot of faith that  government regulation will come from  the House or from  any of the branches, the executive  branch, to  actually make a big  impact. And I would say, although it's  interesting timing with Larry and Sergei  leaving when this thing might be happening,  I mean, to me, Occam's Razor is a little bit  to me,  a little bit more applicable,  in which case, like, they're billionaires  many, many times over. They're probably  tired of dealing with a lot of the  BS and the minutiae that is  going on with having to do the day-to-day things.  You know, Natasha Tico's amazing article  for Wired,  that came out a few months ago about the last three years at  Google, if that was  what I was kind of having to contend with as  somebody who is being seen as the top  person in charge. And I don't have to do that.  I'm in a position where I can  still  stay over who is and who isn't on  the board. And if I really need to step in and  kind of make changes,  I can. But I'm a billionaire  many times over, and I've been doing this for 20-plus years.  Yeah, I'm going to  go live on my yacht and  do my own stuff, too.  I mean, why not?

Amy Webb, what do you think about  is, I mean, honestly,  you can listen to these promises  from Bernie and  Elizabeth Warren and go,  well, that's all nice, but don't forget,  you know, the president doesn't get to  is not a dictator.  You've got Congress to deal with.  It seems unlikely that a lot of these things they're promising  will happen. Bernie just said  something I thought was great. He said  high-speed Internet should be a right  in this country. Couldn't agree with him more,  but I doubt very much that  we have such, at this point,  our government is so broken,  I can't expect it. I don't expect it to do anything.

Transcript:  But let me first say, I  believe very strongly in public service.  We don't really have a culture of public service in the  U.S., and I donate about 20%  of my professional time back to public  initiatives.  I agree.  A couple of those initiatives have to do with  policy. So it's strange,  like I'm the person that's constantly talking  about data and privacy,  and so this is going to probably sound  very strange, but  I'm actually not in favor of regulation in this  case.  The way that the structures of our government  currently works,  and the levers that we have  that power our democracy,  the regulatory framework  would make it impossible.  There are larger forces at play.  Talk about

Start time: 4356.40
End time: 4383.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is that self-policing doesn't work.  The problem is that  our existing  regulatory framework doesn't make sense  in an era  in which  the evolution of the thing that  we're trying to regulate  is going to span the next couple of decades.  So,  and we have China  and to a lesser extent Russia to contend  with, and they're not playing by the same rules.  That's a really interesting one,

Start time: 4384.20
End time: 4389.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  traditional regulation.  I am, however,  I do think that we have  passed the point of no return,  and we have to do something.  So I was at the Senate  a couple of weeks ago  proposing a national office of strategic foresight,  and the paper is online.  I just put it in the,  that's it.  And, you know,  part of what, there is no  solution.  Even the regulatory frameworks  that Warren and Bernie are proposing  are going to wind up in court  for the next decade, so there's no easy fix.  And I believe it's smarter  to incentivize  all of these companies  to prioritize shareholder value  over stakeholder value, and there's a way  to do that without,  you know, they're still publicly  traded companies, and they have to turn up,  they have to serve their shareholders,  but I think that this can be done using different  types of incentives. So I've been  talking a lot to lawmakers about this,  and the office  would be non-political, and  it would be charged with doing long-range planning  and building all kinds of public-private  partnerships and putting  data and AI and other kinds  of technologies, and  classifying them as public goods.  So instead of regulation, you'd say  incentives? I would say  leadership.  Leadership would be nice.  And part of that leadership  is taking a much longer view.  The benefit of democracy is  you don't like who's in office, you vote them out in a couple  years. The drawback, of course, is  that this makes it very easy  for science and technology  to be politicized. And so,  you know, we're kind of at a point where  having political arguments about tech  is not in our best  interests. What would be in our best interests  is to figure out ways to get everybody to  collaborate. So that  paper, excuse me,  it was just at  showed that to the Senate. I've been on  talking to people about it. I also  wrote one and proposed it  at the, I did not send you guys that link,  but I was at the UN in Vienna  two weeks ago talking to them  about something similar but on a more global  scale. But  these are not politically,  these are  ideas that are so different  from how we would normally  broach and approach these problems that  I'm, you know,  I'm not seeing  traction as quickly as I'd like.

Transcript:  The government, interestingly  though, faces the same problem that a lot  of these companies do, which is that  at some point  the pace  and the rate of change  in tech and science is just  moving so much faster than your  ability to legislate or govern  or manage.  And so  that's the thing going forward that I think everybody's  going to have to contend with, which again is why I'm kind  of interested to see what Brad Smith is  doing at Microsoft and what the changes might be there  and what Sundar Pichai will do  at Google  and Apple,  I'm sorry, Google and Alphabet.  And why  Jeff Bezos is such a compelling  leader, because  nobody knows what's going on at Amazon.  You know?

So there's got to be  mass, but yet they do a really good job of, I guess,  preventing leaks because  none of that, none of the memos  get out, which is kind of, it really is, right?  Because literally this is a company where  as their executives, they write everything  down and are very memo driven, which I think is  fantastic, but we never  see any of that.

Amy Webb, Christina  Warren, two of the smartest  people ever on this show. I feel  like a moron. I'm going to try to keep up.  Let's talk about  Amazon. We've done Google. We've done Apple.  Let's talk about Amazon.  I thought AOC's tweet was  a little bit premature. Amazon  has leased  Office Space in the Hudson  Yards.  I think AOC said, see, we didn't have  to give them any concessions. We didn't have to give  them any money. They didn't leave  New York. Well,  it's not HQ2.  It's not HQ2.  Let's be clear about that.  The HQ2 campus would have been  6 to 8 million square feet,  25,000 jobs.  This is 335,000  square feet for 1,500  employees, many of whom are already in New  York. They're just running more  Office Space.

I'd be interested in her perspective, but I was very  annoyed with  the mayor and the governor's capitulation  to Amazon on that  end and was very glad to see it all fall apart.

Transcript:  They had planned $3 billion in  tax breaks and subsidies.  There was a revolt, not  only from people in Queens where the HQ2  would have been, but also from  city council members, state senators,  and of course, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  She tweeted  yesterday, would you look at that?  I love it.  I do have to say I love her style.  She's got her feet up. Would you look at that?  Amazon's coming to AOC anyway, or to  NYC anyway, without requiring the public  to finance shady deals,  helipad handouts for Jeff Bezos,  and corporate giveaways.

They've moved offices.  Right.  This is a universe difference  from opening up a space  with 25,000 people.  It's exactly what Christina  said.  The challenge here is  that there is not a single  city that I know of in the United States  that has any kind of foresight department  or that is doing any kind of long-range planning.  And that includes New York City.  Any  city that is doing long-range  planning would not have trod  itself out in the world's  most embarrassing beauty contest,  which is essentially what happened.

And they're like, oh, we will give you all  these things and we can support all of this.  And I'm like, okay, first of all, you don't actually  have any of the people who are skilled for these jobs.  So you would need to bring all these people  in. Where are they going to get housed?  How are they going to get to work? What is this going to do to the  traffic? What is this going to do to the other things?  But those are questions Amazon presumably  asked. Oh, which is why Amazon  laughed at them and was like, yeah, that's cute.

Again, Atlanta did the same  thing where they moved the brave stadium  out of Atlanta and into a place with  less parking,  even though they claimed parking was the big rationale  for moving out of Atlanta. Really, the rationale  was they wanted to take it away from people  of color because it's a racist city.  And that's a fact. And because  they were able to get Cobb County to pay for  more of it. But you're right, it's disgusting  when cities capitulate to  put things... It's safer in the suburbs, Christina.  Pardon me? It's safer

There's a beautiful, relatively new  stadium that is mostly empty  most of the time. Baltimore built a beautiful

Start time: 5532.79

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stadium for them. Yeah. I mean,  so much of it depends on how they do, right?  Like Seattle, for instance,  once the Seahawks started doing well,  and it's interesting because the rise  did... It's hard to draw a correlation because  the rise also happened to  match exactly the ascendance of Amazon.  But you saw what's happened, like when I've talked to people  who've lived here much longer than me,  the ascendance of the downtown area,  and kind of the way that  that area has become more developed  and has become...  Has started to make much more money  than it did before. So you look at  where the stadium is located before  the Seahawks, before kind of the rise of  those other things and where it is now,  it's certainly much better for them.  I think you could say that they've gotten their money's worth.  But it's obviously,  to Amy's point, it's hard to kind of extrapolate  what do you have to do to have all those  things align.

He might have made so much money  in Deadpool. He said, I'm going to buy a phone company.  Mint Mobile is actually, if you're  going to buy a phone company, it's a great one  to buy. Mint Mobile is putting  wireless cellular carriers on  notice. They're doing it wrong  because Mint Mobile  is doing it all online.  No stores.  Means you save a huge  amount of money.

Like most people only use rockets  10 to 12 times a year, but I use my mobile service  every day?  Okay. So,  I bought the year plan. That's 25  bucks a month, unlimited text and talk.  My phone bill is  25 bucks a month.  You can get down to 15 bucks  a month if you don't use as much data.  Actually, right now they have that three month phone plan  you'll save 40%.  So, I get 15 dollars a month.  In fact, now I want to  re-up because it's 15 dollars for 12  gigabytes. Look at that!  You've got to try Mint Mobile.  That Mint Mobile sim will go in your existing phone.  No problem at all.  So, you can use your own phone. Keep the  phone number if you want. You can have it ported over  to Mint Mobile. All your contacts will stay.  They also sell phones. You can go to  the Mint Mobile site. See if your phone will work.  Just enter in the IMEI number and you'll know  immediately. I use it with my OnePlus 7  Pro and it's a perfect match.  And if you're not 100% satisfied,  Mint has you covered. A seven day  money back guarantee. So, there's no cost  to trying it. Go to the site  and see how much they'll save you.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  Mint, like the minty  fresh smells  great. Mint Mobile.  But you've got to get this great deal  before it's gone. Mintmobile.com  slash twit. 15 dollars a month.  Three month introductory plan.  They'll ship it to your door. You put the sim in  and you are minting.  I mean, I don't, you know, I honestly  I'm just going to move all my phones to Mint Mobile.  I don't know how they do it, but that's  maybe they're, maybe Ryan Reynolds doesn't mind  losing money.

I don't know if any of it's important.  It's kind of hard to tell.  They spray so much stuff out.  Deep Composer was the keyboard.  They announced a new medical transcription.  Which, by the way, classically, medical transcription  is easy to do.  Because it's a constrained vocabulary,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right? Yes and no.  So my husband's an eye doctor.  And the problem with medical transcription  is that...  So this is like a... It's a tech problem.  It's a stupid tech problem.  Everybody's got different EMRs or EHRs.  So these are like the content management systems  that power medical offices.  And they're made by  people who don't practice medicine.  Yes, of course. Naturally.  Right. So the problem is, although it's totally  structured data and there's not a lot of  flexibility within the system, everybody uses it  totally differently.  So... And once you get into...  Most people just sort of click all the radials  that they have to for HIPAA and for insurance  and then they dump the actual  information that's usable in the notes.  So what you're saying is the transcription would work.

Transcript:  I mean, listen,  it's a...  First of all, let me just  say,  I think there's a fair amount of  Sino-bashing happening right now  that's somewhat reminiscent of us  bashing Japan in the 80s.  China's a huge country. There's plenty of  people there. Not everybody's doing bad stuff.  That being  said, these are Chinese companies  domiciled in China.  And one of the favorite things of these companies  to do is to say, oh, no, no, no. Our server  is in the United States. It's different.  TikTok did the same thing. TikTok  came under fire recently saying, you know, because  they're  gleaning and mining  information. Do you let your daughter do TikTok? Absolutely  not. No. For that reason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I will say  I think there's a difference though in some  things like some of the phones  and some of the devices. For instance, the laptops.  I actually draw a line with between the phones,  right, because it's being certified  by Microsoft.  It's the ones that you buy in  the United States anyway, or in Europe,  different from the ones you buy in China, have  the full TPM chips  where nothing has been monitored with  or dealt with. But that's a binary

End time: 6850.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure. So at this point,  I wouldn't buy another one, right? When I bought  it, I didn't have any any concerns about  that. Like when I bought it, I was like,  It's an Intel chip with an Intel TPM. Exactly.  Like to be clear, I wouldn't buy  a Microsoft service laptop from China  because it doesn't have the TPM  things because that's one of  the regulations about selling things  in China. You can't. So I wouldn't buy that, right?  But I would buy one obviously in the  United States or in Europe. So  with my laptop, like I had no problems  with that. And I did like I guess I did like packet  tracing stuff. Is it theoretically possible  that they could be somehow  embedding something into firmware  and could be like siphoning data that I  wouldn't be able to track? Sure. I guess that's  theoretically possible. Again, I'm going to play like  Occam's razor and say how likely are  they to do that? And are there better ways  that they could grab my data rather  than doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Totally. I mean, totally, which I think  is to Amy's point, I think that there  is like a valid reason to have some concerns  because these are Chinese domiciled  companies that are invested  in by the Chinese government that are  very, I think,  disingenuous about the separation between  where their services live and where the countries  and where the companies are based.  A lot of that is a lot of  their, I guess, like try to rationalization to  me is untrue. For instance, Deepin,  which is a Debian based  Linux distro. It has an  interesting UI, but a lot of people are really  trying to get like US people to install  it. I would never put that distro on my laptop  ever. Because it's from China. It's Chinese. Right.  Well, not only that, but they have a cloud service  that they want you to use that is based in China.  And there's no way. That's on Linux.  And people try to say, oh, but it's Linux  and you can invest the court. I'm like, no, I don't care.  I'm not putting that on my system. Right.  But at the same time, I do think  that some of the stuff is  FUD because to your point,  a lot of the, you know,  security implications were only brought  up when there was a trade war going on.

Start time: 6928.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And although we can say, and I  don't think it's wrong to say this, that the United States  might have some better intel  into security and might be a little bit more  up to speed than some other countries.  It does seem disingenuous to say it's the United Kingdom,  if Canada, if Germany, if France,  you know, if Austria, like all  these places that have, you know, Switzerland,  places that have their own,  you know, resources are looking  at this and are like, this is fine.  Australia, if they're all saying we  are okay with this,  then I want to see more information  than just, you know,  well, it's from China to convince me

Start time: 6964.30
End time: 6987.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that it's fine on me. Last time you were here, Amy,  we talked a lot about China, the Belt and Road  Initiative, about their economic ambitions.  I don't think anybody would deny that China  wants to be an economic force.  Do you think China wants to be  a political force  around the world as well? Do you think we are  threatened by China? And you know,  you live there, you have, you pay  quite close attention to all this.

Start time: 6988.24
End time: 6998.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they've already, under Xi Jinping,  the CCP,  the Chinese government has multiple  times expressed its global ambitions  to... More than economic ambitions.

Start time: 7000.71

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  geoeconomic ambitions, and we're already  starting to see that play out. So if you look  at China,  you know,  so I think that the future of warfare  is not  only militaristic in nature.  I think it's very, probably  also economic. And if China,  you know, what happens if China's  already waged an economic war and  we just haven't classified it that way,  we're really not set up to deal with something  like that. Through  some state initiatives and  complicated policies, China has  started to turn what was a  plan to build new  infrastructure in different  countries in emerging markets  as a way to increase trade.

Start time: 7044.20
End time: 7046.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the Belt and Road Initiative.

Start time: 7046.22
End time: 7151.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called the Belt and Road Initiative. And there are some others  that go, that sort of are adjacent to  it. They very cleverly  started to use that to build a new  kind of economic coalition  that spans beyond simple  trade, but also includes  things like data sharing,  because they're, in addition to building roads  and bridges, laying fiber  and  newer mobile networks, and they're deploying  ZTE and Huawei  and all of the different Chinese made.  So here's, you know, what's  interesting here. If you were to go and talk to  economists about this,  they would say, yes, China's economy  is large, you know,  but it's unstable. There are points  of wear that's vulnerable.  Once you're  talking scale, you know, if China has  all of these countries,  that market size becomes too big to ignore.  And we have already started  to, I think, see  the actual value of democracy  in the year 2019, because  like how much it's worth,  its monetary value.  Because we saw South Park  go to bat and lose, and  South Park overnight was wiped  off of servers and  access points in China. But  we saw other comp, like Marriott,  historically  bent to China's will  because that market is so big. That's just China.  Once you've all these, you know,  they've been playing long games, so once you've  got all these other countries,  that's a huge market,  and they're in the process of starting to lock  us out, which I think is,  you know, behind what's  happening with Huawei not  selling phones in the United States. I mean, it's not  a huge loss. It's not like they were going to make a ton  of money here because it's not a known brand.  And the...

Transcript:  buying your components. Well, if you're Qualcomm, it's  obviously a massive deal. But what I'm saying, though, is like,  it's not as if they were selling a lot of phones in the US  because the carriers never really had massive agreements  with them anyway, you know, unless it was under the  honor line. So,  who has a bigger advantage? I don't...

Transcript:  listen, I was just at  the Pentagon last week. So,  we have incredibly smart  people working in our  military and in our government. My concern  is that  the Federal Reserve, which is our  central bank, is not preparing for a future  in which a big tech company starts trading on  its proprietary data. And I don't think  that that is technique that would run afoul of our  current regulatory structure. How would you prepare for that?  What do you mean they should... You do the long-term  planning. And similarly, if China  builds this coalition, everybody  knows about the social credit score, which is super  like Black Mirror and Dystopian.  Nobody's talking about the corporate  version of that, which has already been  rolled out. So, what happens  if an American,  not a big, huge tech company, but like all  of the small companies  that power our  economy, that require on  goods and services and parts from China,  are suddenly locked out, not because  of a trade war, but because they don't have a social...  They don't have a credit score.  That is a way  if China erects sort of  a gigantic  digital  bamboo curtain  that doesn't need to be contiguous.

With a Muslim minority in China and China.  That's right.  So that's not good.  That being said, you could  say, you know, China is at least  somewhat transparent.

I know you're a futurist, Amy, but  how could you prepare for this kind of  stuff? I don't know how you prepare for this kind of stuff.

I can build several different models.  So that's why, if  there's a way to untether politics,  which I know is increasingly  difficult to do from policy  and  to decouple politics  from tech, that's our best way  forward. But we need a structure  to do that, which is why I've been proposing  this National Office of Strategic Foresight,  which, by the way, I don't want to run.  I just want to see it happen  and smart people work there  and lead.  So,

Transcript:  Good luck.  You know, like the Office  of Technology Assessment,  which was nonpartisan,  and the whole idea was, look, we're not going to make  a partisan political judgment here. We're just going  to tell you, fill you in on the technology  so you can make your  and leave it to the politicians to make the  partisan political judgments.  They have to deal with politics, but  these groups don't.  And that's a good thing.  Gosh, there's so much more to talk about. Let me take a break.  I do want to talk about France's  100% tariffs  on US goods, or no,  France saying, we're going to tax  big tech companies,  and the President Trump's response, which is  to put 100%  tariff on my blue cheese.  But first,  but first, a word from  Privacy.com, well  named in this day and age, and I am a  huge fan of Privacy.com. I've been  using it for a very long time.  What Privacy.com does is exactly what you  want, which gives you a  unique, brand new  virtual visa or mastercard number for  every purchase you make online.  It's a really easy effect. I have an  extension running in Brave and  Firefox, Chrome, Safari, that lets you  generate these, paste it right in,  just as you would a regular credit card.  But here's what's cool about this Privacy  card. As soon as you use  it, it's tied to that  merchant, can't be used anywhere  else. Or you can say, this is  a one-time use card, it can't be used  anytime, anyway. You can set a  total limit per charge, you can say  limit per year, per month.  You can freeze and unfreeze cards. I use  Privacy for all my subscriptions,  because frankly, I always forget  to cancel them. But with Privacy, there's just  one user interface at Privacy.com.  I freeze that, freeze that, freeze that.  And the subscription is over.  It is incredible.  Totally secure. You don't use  the same password on every site,  I would presume, so why use the same credit  card number when you shop online?  It is a great way to protect yourself  and Android and iOS  apps too. Now, I should tell you,  it's not a charge card, it's not a credit card  in the sense that, you know,  it's not like that. It actually links to your  US checking account or debit card.  So you pay it right away. It's not a way to  kind of create a charge card,  it's a way to buy things online  in a safe, secure way.  Spending limits per charge, per month, per year,  freeze and unfreeze cards.  PCI DSS compliance, so  it's exactly the same security standards  as your bank. I love it too, because  when somebody tries to use a card  that is assigned, like on my Amazon card,  if somebody else used it, I'd get a decline,  email, and a push notification.  So I know that, hey,  that card's been compromised. I can easily turn it off,  put another card in there.  Of course, it's strong encryption.  In fact, they believe so much  in privacy that they  have a split key encryption system.  Employees at Privacy.com  hold partial keys.  Separate employees, kind of like the two keys  at the nuclear missile silo, right?  So no one employee can decrypt.  I use the personal  I actually, I changed, I just changed.  I was using for a long time the personal plan.  That gives you 12 cards a month.  All of those features.  But they've launched two new paid versions.  I immediately sign up for the pro version.  You pay $10 a month,  but you get 36 cards a month.  That's got to be enough for anybody, unless you do  a lot of Instagram buys. That's a lot of money.  Plus, you get 1%  cash back on all purchases.  So it's a profit deal for me. I use  privacy enough that I make more than the $10  a month it costs. And you get additional  security and privacy features. Now, if you're  using it in a business, there's privacy for teams.  $25 a month,  you get 60 cards a month.  Plus a dedicated account manager.  You can have transaction limits tailored to your business  needs so employees can't just go crazy.  This is a really nice service.  Free for personal use.  I just want to say that, but if you are already  using it as I am,  I looked at the pro and I said, wait a minute, that's  going to actually make me money because I can get the 1%  cash back. So that's  and I've already made, it's not a lot of money.  I can't remember how much it is, but like $10  or $15 extra a month because of that.  Privacy thinks you should have full control  of your data. They have a web hook  API so you could even create  your own notifications.  They support two factor. Of course  I use two factor with it as you should.  Protect your privacy. Protect your money.  Virtual cards from privacy.com.  I'm such a fan. We want you to  try it. If you go to privacy.com slash  twit, you'll get a $5 credit off your  first purchase. And of course  if you're using privacy,  look at pro or if you want to use it in the business, look at  the team plan as well. That's a really  good way to make it even more  valuable. Privacy.com slash twit.  $5 credit towards your first  purchase. It's all I use when I'm  online.  Oh man, there's so much more to talk about. I wanted to talk  about 5G but my god that's another hour.

Transcript:  You get a lot of data from all those cameras  and those stores.  You can even see if somebody picked up an item, looked at it,  put it down. Why didn't they  buy it? Don't you think Pampers would like to know  why you looked at the Pampers and then bought  the Loves instead?  That's valuable data. That's another way  to make money and something to think about when you  use this.  A good piece in Ars Technica about  5G, kind of a 5G explainer.  There's high band,  mid band, and low band, the millimeter wave  5G, which has got all sorts of problems.  The reason I was interested, T-Mobile  announced this week, there it is.  This is 5G's on the horizon.  Here's what it is and what's coming. A great  tutorial, a primer on 5G.  The reason I was interested is  T-Mobile is saying we're launching 5G  across the US, but it's  the low band  600 megahertz.  Because the protocols are  different, you still need to buy one of those 5G  phones. They're very limited supply.  Samsung and  OnePlus phones will be available.  Assuming you'll have to sign up for  a 5G plan, pay the extra fee,  I don't know what it's going to cost,  and suffer the battery depletion  that is inevitable.  The OnePlus 7T Pro 5G  McLaren edition is 900 bucks.  The Galaxy Note 10 plus 5G  is 1300 bucks.  I have an iPhone  11 that has 600 megahertz, but it won't  work because it's a different protocol.  It's not faster.  Millimeter wave is the one that's gigabit.  This will probably be at best 100 megabits,  which is honestly kind of what you get  with a good LTE connection.  So I'm not sure.  I think 5G...  Do you want to say  anything about that? Anybody?  I think it's not

Start time: 7964.54
End time: 7981.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  other than the millimeter waves,  which obviously is a massive  difference.  Obviously, from a technology standpoint,  from a speed  standpoint, I think that has implications  and opportunities  and things like stadiums like we talked about.  The problem with

Start time: 7982.64
End time: 7993.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  millimeter wave is  it's at 24 gigahertz, which bounces off  everything, including rain drops.  And you have to be  something like 900 feet  from the transmitter.

Start time: 7995.09
End time: 8052.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what I was going to say though  is that with that being kind of  the big difference, and there  will be things that can use  cases where that will be useful, and maybe  there will be opportunities to put more transmitters  around and make this  more applicable in more and more areas.  I think that a lot of the  600 megahertz, 5G,  I think a lot of this is not as similar  to when 4G and  when LTE started getting rolled out.  There was  a big period of time of catch up  between when did we have the infrastructure, when did we have the  phones, and when did we see those speeds?  Because even when we had what I used to call  4G, which was like the fake 4G,  AT&T and T-Mobile and Verizon  would all say, oh, we have 4G,  and it was really just 3G,  maybe 3.5G.  But when we actually got LTE,  and they started to kind of  pop up in pockets,  and then it got more widespread, there was  a pretty seismic change  in how you could speed  and what you could do.

Start time: 8054.24
End time: 8058.20

That and Nextel, those are the two things that killed Sprint  were Nextel and WiMAX.  And WiMAX  was not great, but it was  what it was.  I think that it's not going to be the same level as what we saw  going from 3G to LTE, right?  But in some ways,  it's not that different than when we went from  2.5G to 2G to 3G.  You guys are going to benefit, because you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  both in highly dense population  centers where it's much more likely  to be available. Maybe even, I think  one of the interesting applications, Verizon's  already doing this, is as your home  internet, because it's fast enough,  it's low latency enough  to do that, and if you're in an area  where it's built up, that might be  good. That might work.

So the question is, and then you've got to  have rights to put the technology  on the different buildings. Right. Bulls and all that.  So, that's why I think,  I mean, I know that we're going to see the rollout first  in the stadiums, because those are controlled environments.  So AT&T has got a whole plan  that's coming next year, and  you know, you've also got  a critical mass of people and an ability  to do something with them, again, in a very controlled way.  But what that means,  we still need the phones,  you still need the applications  that can make use of it. Right.

Transcript:  Intel made a, well,  Bob Swan, Intel's new CEO, made an amazing  admission at  the Credit Suisse Technology Conference.  He followed AMD,  and he said, we blew it.  This is Intel's CEO  for the first time saying,  we made a mistake trying  to maintain 90%  CPU market share.  Which we had.  But he says,  we're going to change the company to think  about 30%  of all silicon now.  Here's the quote, we think that having  30% share in  a $230 million  silicon total available  market that's going to grow  to $300 billion over the next four years,  we prefer that to,  I'm trying to destroy the thinking about having a  90% share inside our company.  Because I think it limits our thinking.  I think we miss technology  transitions. We miss opportunities.  Because we're so preoccupied  with protecting our 90%.  This sounds familiar. It sounds like other  companies might have gone through this. Instead  of seeing a much bigger market with much more  innovation going on.  Quite an  interesting revelation. I don't know what it means  for Intel, but it sounds like  they'd be happier with a third  of a total silicon  market than a 90%  of the CPU market. That's interesting.

Transcript:  Right, exactly.  By being so focused on, oh, we have to  maintain this percentage  of CPU, this dominance here,  they completely missed  what the next big  evolutions and  the next big waves of  innovation in computing.  Which is, to his point, not necessarily  controlled by the CPU.  I've said this  before. I think this is obviously too late  now. Intel's mobile thing was  such a failure. I feel like they had an opportunity  7, 8 years ago,  they could have become, similar to  Qualcomm or Samsung, they could have been their own  arm. They could have had their own  arm  process  of having their own arm ships  that were under the Intel name.  I feel like if they'd done that, they might  have actually been able to even maintain  something in the  mobile space.  At this point, mobile is gone  and Nvidia and lots of other companies  are really steaming ahead. AMD  in GPUs,  yeah, I think this is smart.  It's a kind of incredible  admission on his part. But also,  it's, I think, a good thing to see  that at least there's an admission from the top  that they haven't been on it. And that they've  missed things that really could have  been key to the future of their business.

These accounts had released leaked  US-UK trade documents  in an effort to  impact the upcoming  US-UK trade talks.  When they discovered  this, they banned 61  redditors. They killed a subreddit  because  they were trying to manipulate  the US and the UK governments  through reddits.

It's a fun company to make fun of.  Listen, Roni years ago when they were supposed  to show something  at a Ted talk,  wound up on stage wearing a space suit  and danced around to weird music for seven minutes.  They mentioned that, yes.  There is plenty here that ...  They made ridiculous promises that even went beyond  must-collect promises.

Transcript:  Okay, but they are also built ...  What I have seen them working on  and what they are building is like nothing I've  ever seen before.  This to me falls within the realm of basic research.  It is the exact reason why the  street punished  Amazon and punished  the big companies because they don't want  work being done that's not revenue generating.  Which is fair.  Well, listen, Magic Leap  is working on the kind of stuff that's not going to  generate revenue for a while.

Start time: 8830.28
End time: 8845.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is fair.  I think the argument you're making is fair, but I also think it's fair to come back  and say the problem is that they  didn't ever sell themselves as that.  It wasn't ever expressed as  we're doing these things that will be  however many years in the future and this is the building block  of this, this, and this.

And I'm not saying that there's a way,  I don't know if there's a way that they could have  won or they could have done better, right?  Which is disappointing and which is sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  question because you say, now you've used  the beast, right? You used the big thing.  No, no, I've got. So what they  sold and what I've used is  basically, and we're talking about,  I just assume people know what Magic  Leap is, I shouldn't, we're talking about an  augmented reality headset.

Start time: 8924.20
End time: 8930.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and a wristband. And that's what they sold  for, I think, fifteen hundred bucks. I can't  remember. It was expensive. It was a developer's edition.  That's what this information  article is talking about. They say they've only  sold six thousand instead  of a hundred thousand.  That's not a big deal. Is it,  have you tried this little headset and  compared it to the  real product demo that was getting people like  you and Steven Levy all excited  in a froth. So there's a difference,  obviously. There must be. Here's what I would say.

Start time: 8959.31
End time: 9011.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a,  we need to be patient. We're talking about  the kind of basic, that we're talking  about fundamental shifts in communications  technology that are going to be rolling  out over the next decade or so.  Every company is working on  connected glasses. Amazon's already  got a product. You know, 2020  is the  year of the beginning of  glasses.  The problem is that this is much more complicated  technology. It's not like  iterating on a mobile phone. So it's  going to take time. I  stand by what I continue to say  which is what I have seen  and what I have read and what I've experienced  from Magic Leap is unlike anything I've ever  seen before. Now,  whether or not they can create  a commercial product at scale using  that technology in a time frame  that appeases tech bloggers,  you know, is, I don't know. It's probably,  that's probably not going to happen.

Start time: 9012.28
End time: 9023.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I know, and it's not a bad thing.  I mean, almost every technology  has gone through that cycle and it's very  frequent. Look at the railroads. We got  a transcontinental railroad, but all the companies that  built it went bankrupt.

Start time: 9024.26
End time: 9044.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And maybe that's what happens  here and that's unfortunate. The only thing I'm not going to  give the company a pass on because I will  completely agree with everything Zeymue is saying and  that it takes time.  It is a long slog. You have to raise money to do this.  It's not something you can iterate quickly on.  But for better or worse,  they did make the decision to make  the outrageous claims. They did make the decision.

Transcript:  More than that, I think honestly,  the biggest  disconnect they had  was that the  demos that Stephen Levy and people like Amy  have seen in the future and saying it's the most impressive  thing you've ever seen, that is completely  different than what shipped.  And there was never a clear  explanation from them.  Well, no.

Transcript:  Well, hang on. The stuff that's impressive to me  is the physics.  So I don't need whales jumping out of  wherever.  The fact that I can map  the spatial computing environment allows  me to map without lag on a  normal crappy network in the middle of  New York City to  map a space and I can  release objects that observe physics  in that space and are relatable to me  and that I am part of that computing environment  is what knocked my socks off.  Okay. Fair enough.  So I don't...  And in fact, by the way, that is

Transcript:  The model is that the thing  that replaces our smart, the smartphones,  this is the model that I  built a couple years ago talking about the future,  is that smartphones recede to the background  and are replaced by  connected glasses and some  other thing like a ring or a wristband  for the time being.  We're in the process of that starting to happen.  How many companies made smartphones

Transcript:  Was Magic Leap doing something qualitatively different  from HoloLens?  Yes, absolutely.  So the thing they put out was very much like HoloLens.

Start time: 9162.83
End time: 9250.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  HoloLens, I think...  HoloLens is a better...  It's a better AR.  So I think of HoloLens  more like live mapping.  So you're in a...  You're a construction person  or an electrician and you're trying to compare  blueprints and do the repairs at the same time  and you can see the overlay.  And that was the original promise of AR  when it was first conceptualized.  Magic Leap is different.  In a spatial computing environment,  you are also the data that's being computed.  So to me,  these are different things.  It's an entirely new ecosystem  that's in the process of being born.  And I completely agree.  Making crazy promises,  working on commercial...  Here's the problem.  There's a bunch of areas of tech and science  that require massive sums  of money  for research and that used to be provided  by through grants from the federal government.  But the federal government in our current  administration has cut back on funding.  So we're expecting the commercial sector  to fill the gap.  And when...  And that puts a lot of pressure on these companies  to rush things to market before  they're ready.  The dumbest announcement  I think I've ever seen in my life  came from Google last week or the week before  when they announced that DeepMind  was powering recommendations  in the Play Store.  That's the stupidest use  of the smartest people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But to me, that's totally  illustrative of the problem.  The pressure to  produce the product.  It costs a lot of money  to do this.  It's a lot of binary sums of money.  And if the government is not going to fund it,  then we can't get pissed off  when the private sector  is spending  that money and doesn't razzle  dazzle us every quarter with something  cool and shiny and new.

Transcript:  You're not wrong.  I would posit with Magic Leap that  one of their issues is I think that they were secretive  for a long time. People didn't see things.  They might have served them better to stay secretive  and stay doing things and not to  productize it at all, to be honest.  And I told them.  If they hadn't productized it and they just stayed  incognito and were doing this  and then eventually would have the technology,  none of us would be questioning where  this money went and what this was about.

Transcript:  there was a Theranos-like  reaction to this story  by Alex Harvey in  or Alex Heath, I'm sorry,  in the information, according to  Alex.  After the story was published, the information  learned of an internal Magic Leap all-hands  meeting earlier this week  in which Magic Leap's  chief marketing officer described  the story that they were working on as clickbait  and a bunch of BS. He called this  reporter an a-hole and said,  others in the media were looking to expose the next Theranos  or WeWork.  I don't think anybody's that interested in Magic Leap.  It's not that level of scandal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm not talking about her, I'm talking about  the broader kind of like,  the CNNs, the big  headline things about what this is going to be,  becomes this narrative and then we are,  the tech press does  enjoy being able to tear it down  when it doesn't live up to expectations.  There's a certain, oh, this high  floating thing, everybody thought it was going to be so  great and now it's not. There is a  certain joy that people get out  about whether that's fair or not. My only comment  and you and I are in agreement on it  was that they shouldn't have productized this, they should have kept this  as an incubated research thing  because the problem is now that it is a product  thing and it's not, and they have actual  numbers to look at that unfortunately  will impact how much more funding they can get,  which is really detrimental  probably to the progress for  this field in general. And they're going to need it
