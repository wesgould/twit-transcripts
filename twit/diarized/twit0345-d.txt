End time: 715.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you have any that well here you can look at that. Yeah. Thank you  Isn't that beautiful? Go ahead just type on that. What do you think about it?  It's really good-looking isn't it no I  I'll tell you at first I thought this screen was gonna like your eyes would go like Jessica Rabbit would whine  But they don't they don't actually do that  It's it's not immediately apparent how better much better it is  But as you spend time with it, it gets better and better you where do you notice it most?  well launch a book application would be one thing to do because  Text is of course incredibly crisp  So I'll watch the kindle app and you'll see kind of immediately that it's also in video and HD video  It really really looks good. Well, that's one question because okay the the the screen is quad resolution 3.1 megapixels  And it is it is now, you know 2048 by 1536 means it's it could do 1080p video  But on a screen that size, I don't know  Is there much of a difference between a 720p video and a 1080p video? Do you notice a difference?

Start time: 716.56
End time: 736.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I I mean I was testing some clips I have here and definitely the 1080p video I downloaded from iTunes  It looked better way better on the the new iPad versus the iPad 2. I mean you definitely see the difference  I just see the difference that even standard definition video on that screen. I just I just feel like it's not it's the same IPS

Start time: 738.00
End time: 747.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Style LCD screen is not a super amulet or something  But I do but the resolution is so high it is it is I think 260 pixels per inch that it it just feels a lot

Start time: 752.70
End time: 757.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 758.00
End time: 761.42

Transcript:  Those of you listening Leo has the cover of the iPad well, I have one of those like a visor

Start time: 772.24
End time: 827.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have one of those iPad covers that see the camera is right down here  So the I normally the cover folds over the camera  So I have to do that or you could take a picture like this  Which is equally kind of dorky to have they have the cover hang down from the bottom  But you know what? I think we're all gonna get used to the idea even when I pull it out  It still looks kind of silly  But I think we're all gonna get used to the idea because it is, you know, it's essentially the same sensor  I guess in the iPhone 4 with a lens system from the iPhone 4s, but it's it is so good  That really is so good that and and what's different? What's exciting about it is you're seeing the image. It's like a view camera  Remember the old days when you know on the three stooges or the Wild West movies?  They'd have a guy and he'd have the thing on the tripod and he put a black hood over his head and say watch the birdie  And this is this is cut you could almost do that put a hood over your head and because now you're seeing a  Full-frame rendition of the picture

Start time: 827.26
End time: 836.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, not the point was made is when have you ever been able to take the video with the same view as it?  Will be as it will be consumed exactly. Yeah, and and so as a result

Start time: 836.42
End time: 852.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it is a remarkable experience for a videographer or photographer and then you add to that that this has got LTE  Which is really fast and you've got great software on it  I think in some ways the camera might be to me the most exciting part of this. I really like so

Start time: 853.48
End time: 884.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Everything go ahead. I'm sorry. No, no, no, go ahead. I say that's interesting because I just finished writing my review  I've written a number of pieces on the iPad this past week and I wanted to take some time and write the review  so the review will be up tomorrow, but I  Was I come to the conclusion and I don't want to I mean it's the conclusion everyone everyone else has come to which is  Really that the screen is the biggest part  But that other biggest improvement is the camera but I'm not sure a lot of people buy a new iPad for a camera  But it's funny. I've been hearing that a few people just don't really see the improvement in the screen

Start time: 884.74

End time: 943.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Big battery huge battery they went to a 40. I think 45 watt hours from 25  Yeah, and you need to obviously for LTE  I think that's more for LTE than it is for the screen  Although we don't know that's got a much faster processor and a much of course more dense screen

Start time: 962.04
End time: 965.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was wondering in the Wi-Fi only versions. Do you get a boost then?

Start time: 966.10
End time: 997.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I'm actually I'm in the corner of my apartment right now running a battery test  I'm running the same HD video on both the iPad 2 and the iPad 3 and I expect that the iPad 2 will last  Probably a little bit longer or around the same amount of time as the iPad and I have LTE off the new iPad  I have LTE off just running on Wi-Fi because I expect that the screen  They've boosted the battery just to give you just as much as you would get on Wi-Fi in the out on the iPad

Start time: 997.60
End time: 1007.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Too because of the screen. Yeah, I think we're I think we're saying so so it is the it's not the LTE that it is the  Screen that's sucking all that right juice. All right, well that makes right

Start time: 1007.34
End time: 1013.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, you'll get our less with LTE on right so you boosted the battery just to compensate enough for that screen Wow

Start time: 1014.04
End time: 1026.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I was I was completely wrong. It is the screen that's sucking all that juice  LTE is notorious for being a battery hog, but that's 10% more if it's only one hour. It's going from 10 hours to 9 hours  That's not a huge

Start time: 1027.50

Start time: 1033.62
End time: 1055.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That sounds right. Yeah, it's more than the old one, but that's a decent profit margin  Yeah, I think Apple would like more but of course, I'm sure they make more if you buy the LTE or you buy more RAM, right?  Yeah, also in the teardown. We're finding that it has  Let's see  The a5 I guess we knew everything else. So it's it's it's really the battery size. That's new information

Browse your Wi-Fi because it would and when people came over to visit you'd have to say I'm so sorry  We have a horrible neighbor and what if that happened and what would you do?  We'll answer that question in a second. That's a tease. That's a tease baby, but we want to also say hello to is that Josh over there?  How are you good to see you it's tech TV week here at  At the twit brick house good to see you Josh  This show brought to you by our friends at Citrix makers of go to meeting  Have you ever been to a go to meeting meeting all you got to try it?

We're doing a site redesign for the radio show  We do regular meetings they do it they call them scrums  There's this whole agile development thing and yet you have sprints and you have scrums and seems too athletic for me  But anyway the the the in these meetings occasionally we want to review wireframes  The company we're working with is a distributed company Lullabot doesn't have an office  People are in Rhode Island people are in Minnesota. They're all over the place  So we use go to meeting and we can look at the wireframes together. We can see each other  It's just really fantastic. I want you to try it go to meeting comm click the try it free button use the offer code  Twit and we thank Citrix for their support of this week in tech. So Bluetooth for the whole point of it  Apparently according to Bluetooth comm is its low energy  So you can have Bluetooth devices that operate for a long time  They say months or years on the little lithium coin batteries  so health care  Sports, you know fitness applications security home entertainment  You could have a security camera that has this little battery in it and then uses Bluetooth to connect  So that's what 4o is and it was just announced in July.

Transcript:  They live for this time sales go through the roof when there's a new version of Windows  They would love Microsoft to do what Apple does and release one every year  In fact Microsoft kind of implied that they are gonna start doing that  Starting with Windows 8 and I'm sure that that's driven somewhat by the hardware market that says please  You know  They practically put the hardware market out of business with Vista because it was so delayed and these companies knew  Every business is waiting for the new operating system and they're not buying new hardware

Start time: 2498.88

Transcript:  Okay, here's my big question because everyone's talking about the iPad as a creative tool the iPad create with it  Phil Schiller's up there saying oh, yes, you can create I call total BS until they get application switching under control  It's a debacle on the iPad for me when I'm creating and I'm moving between applications on the iPad  I find it absolutely laborious  will Windows 8 in tablet form get application switching or  Multitasking down in in a format that is better than the iPad. They already do

Start time: 2619.38
End time: 2627.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, they already do and I actually wrote this in my review that will be coming up tomorrow  And I'm trying to figure out how to drop in my link to my preview of the consumer preview someplace

Start time: 2636.12
End time: 2680.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'll see so I took a very deep look at the consumer preview on a tablet that Microsoft sent me  before it came out and  The application switching is one of the things I love the most and what I actually wrote in my iPad review  Is that I hope when they do the software update later this year  Is that sort of the schedule that Apple's been on that they do address?  How apps work side-by-side and how they sort of address a little bit of the operating system to make it a little bit different  Than it's looked in the past  and so when you are in Windows 8 you can drag apps in from the left or the right and then  Adjust how they appear on the side with a little bit of a slider thing and I would just think the way they're doing  Apps and how they work with each other is is pretty amazing

Start time: 2681.14
End time: 2766.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree. You know it basically on the Mac desktop now in Lion  That's how it works when you go full screen with an app  You can do a three finger or you could set it to four finger swipe and you just slide  It's kind of reminds me the palm pre where you're sliding from card to card cards  and so this is this is you hit an interesting point because  Happens we are we are used to the idea of having multiple windows open and being able to context switch programs  Even without sliding the screen just on the same screen and then many of us have now got  27 inch or 30 inch screens for just that reason so we can have a browser open a word processor open and we can cut  And paste or we can go back and forth and tablets really don't do that  And multitasking is really a myth on devices like this  I don't think you really should even multitask on on memory and processor constrained devices because  You're looking at one thing at a time and you can context switch  You don't need to fully multitask unless you're listening to Pandora or something, but it is I think  So so you have this issue you want to operate full  Only swipe this window off  What's happening

Start time: 2877.24
End time: 2915.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what I was saying is lion does this you can swoop back and forth and I think that that is actually a very nice  Natural way to context switch there will be lots of people say but no I want two windows open side by side so I can look at them  But guess what? The world's moving away from that  It's moving to four minutes. So I think that's a good thing  But guess what the world's moving away from that it's moving to full screen apps and it's because of tablets and  I think I guess we'll get used to it. Yeah. Well, I just  The iPad you could totally have an app an app an app  Yeah, or does it do it already? Is that that's that new multi-touch you have to enable the gestures? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me see if they're enabled on mine. I probably didn't yeah multitasking gestures use four or five fingers  To pinch to the home screen swipe up to reveal the multitasking bar swipe left or right between apps  So in fact if I had yeah, see look at that. So I am doing that. It's not easy, but you can do that

Start time: 2935.22
End time: 2947.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right. Well, that's it. That's definitely a step in the right direction because I think that the problem with creation in  Individual apps is that that doesn't reflect how people truly create it's across many different apps and and media sources

Start time: 2947.94
End time: 2971.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And yet for novice users and I think that that's really where the conversation is happening here  Is that Microsoft and Apple have both decided that there is a far larger number of?  Neophyte users who don't know how to use computers for them. It just makes sense one task at a time  Occupy the full screen  Have an intimate experience then when you want to do something else go there

No, look what Apple's done  It's true. I photo and then you see Avid studio as well as iMovie  That's for sure true, but they've also put voice dictation in which solves kind of the keyboard issue  They've added Siri style voice dictation androids had that for a while. It does a very good job  I think you're seeing a lot of apps. It took a while for word processors  Spreadsheets presentation managers to adapt how they think to a touch world  And that was part of the problem on that.

They showed the judge. I'm like look  I mean, this is costing me more money on a tiered plan  But I complained to AT&T and they actually changed me back to unlimited said okay, you know, alright fine  I won't do it anymore as long as this court thing is going on

So what happened was  A paralegal before court the day before court sent me a letter saying basically you better drop your case because you don't stand a chance  And that came at 430 p.m. The day before court  After I went in court  I waited a couple days let things kind of cool down and I called her up and she took my call because she didn't recognize  the phone number I guess  And I just simply asked her two questions  I said are you gonna pay me or are you gonna appeal if you're not gonna appeal when can I get a check?  She said that the corporate department is handling it now  She's got nothing to do with it  But after I get a judgment to email her a copy of it and she would put me in touch with whom I could ask  Those questions too  So I did that and then I called her two or three times and sent at least two maybe three emails and she never  Responded to me. So I said, okay. Well, I just gonna have to wait and see what  What what time brings if they're going to appeal or not?  But just that they told the press doesn't mean they're going to  So after that I was just gonna let it lie and then I got a call from mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oftentimes especially when you're dealing with a big company like AT&T if they're gonna settle a case like this  They are going to want you to agree  Not to talk about it and those agreements generally are mutual. Okay, I have a quick question for you  Yeah, as long as you got your counsel here, go ahead and I have a question for you, too

Start time: 3931.42
End time: 3942.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So let's fire him back and forth. Do they usually require you to sign one after you've won a judgment?  Because I figured the settlement talks are supposed to happen before the judgment is done

Start time: 3942.88
End time: 3961.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oftentimes settlements happen after you get a determination in your favor because but can't you just you already won though  It wouldn't have even talked to you without that determination in your favor, right?  So now you at least have some leverage and they're gonna come to the table. Yeah, they didn't they didn't reach out to me a single time

Start time: 3961.30
End time: 4033.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean I sent my demand letter 30 days in advance  Just like the contract says and I called customer service and asked them if they had a legal department and how I could get in  Touch with them and they said no there isn't  I called the executive resolution team and I actually spoke to someone there and she just  She's a reason why why I decided to file it  But yeah, no one no one ever reached out to me. I was always the one doing the calling  right and then when they give me this letter and and here's the thing I and I told them I would absolutely  Sign that thing. Let me run it by a friend of mine  Who's an attorney because I don't know about these things because he was talking about the mutual non-disclosure agreement  And it's a little over my head. I mean, I think I can handle small claims  But you know the attorney guys definitely got one up on me  So when I gave it to my friend and we we read it together  All that stuff about hey, we can terminate your service and all this didn't need to be in that letter  And my intention was is hey, yeah, let's sign it and see what they have to say  I mean, maybe they're gonna offer me a ton more money money just to shut up  When they when they threw in the threat with it it was like, okay that just way put me over the edge you tweeted

Start time: 4033.70
End time: 4050.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And the presentation in your case is a little bit different. I mean if you're gonna settle a case  that's where the agreement to  Keep things confidential usually comes in as part and parcel of the settlement and NDA in advance is a little bit unusual  And he won right? So yeah exactly

Start time: 4051.26

Transcript:  Hey, let me ask you this Matt. I  I just would love to be able to sit down like we're sitting down with you with the fellow that AT&T sent and I'm sure  We're not gonna have the chance to do that  But when that person was there did he attempt to make the argument on AT&T's behalf?  That you actually still were receiving unlimited service  Unlimited data just did a throttled amount

Start time: 4084.78
End time: 4148.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Absolutely did and I'll also read you this this real quick thing. It says 1.3 in their contract  This is this is I don't know if you could see this very well, but this is what he brought to court  That's the contract  It's double-sided pages and it is  61 pages she's and it says  It says we may change any terms conditions rates fees expenses or charges regarding your service at any time  Where's the contract in this?  That to me says they could do whatever they want and he read that to the judge or had the judge read it and the judge  Says what does that mean?  Does that mean you can do whatever you guys feel like doing?  Yes, and he basically said yes, and he says listen, I don't think so  It's basically where you're gonna learn your lesson  You cannot tell somebody that you're the fastest wireless network that you're gonna get unlimited service and bury it somewhere in a 63 page  Contract. Oops, unless we say otherwise

Start time: 4150.52
End time: 4173.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Right, but I'm not quite going to the unless we say otherwise point whether or not the whole contract is enforceable is another really good  Question that I think the judge was probably  Urged by but but how they have a valid point I think that  If they're going to give you unlimited data  They didn't say anything about how fast you can pull that data down that that was guaranteed

Start time: 4174.34
End time: 4178.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

End time: 4213.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't look no no, they don't look to me that you see all the time  You see tons and tons of commercials about AT&T being the fastest wireless network and that goes that you say that point  That goes to my point of justifiable reliance  If if they're saying it over and over again my Ferrari analogy and we all know a Ferrari  I'll do 200 miles an hour  But it when you take it to the dealer for an oil change and you get it back and it only does 45 miles an hour  You can wait a minute.

Start time: 4264.26
End time: 4273.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Then well, they're not dumb they're not gonna write that down no, of course not they may have 61 pages  but I guarantee you there's no there's no words in there about a  minimum speed or anything Leo

Start time: 4274.00
End time: 4333.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I I would encourage you to look up the concept of justifiable reliance. It's really important  I think in the California legal system and once I started talking about that and giving the example and showing the  Advertisement all over AT&T's website about the speeds at which  4g is four times faster than 3g and LTE is ten times faster than this one  That's when I think that I really won the case  That's when the judge really seemed to look like whoa  Wait a minute and then the point also that that the judge made  During the decision was you can't tell him that he's gonna have the fastest wireless network and then slow him down and then say  Unless he pays more because the guy said that to the judge  He said if he is upset about the speed  He's more than happy to go to a tiered plan which never gets slowed down and the judge really got upset with that one, too  He's like wait. So now you're telling him he can go faster. He can get unlimited as long as he pays for it

Yeah, there's the tip. Keep it  It was like Xerox costs  Thanks, Matt. Congratulations. Thank you very much. That's Matt Spaccarelli. Yeah, I think he's kind of a he's fighting the fight whether  You know that you can go back and forth about  Justifiable reliance and then contract law and all of that, but but it's just he's fighting  Just for the for the just the  The fairness of it, right and yeah ATT might have find some legal justice, but we're talking just being fair

Start time: 4413.54

Transcript:  We really should mention to that ATT won a big case before the US Supreme Court last year  having to do with a different  Claw a different issue under its mobile contract with users  And whether it was going to be able to bar users from being bringing class-action lawsuits under that contract whether it's  Arbitration clause was going to be enforceable because it purported to do that two courts in California said no way  Consumers have to be able to bring class actions. The Supreme Court said no  You can bar those class actions  so this small claims case that Matt brought is important because  You know if he can get a groundswell of support of people to do this  It could take the place of a big class action doesn't cost much though.

There have been incidences like these and it was an unusual amount of  cya  from this american life in the episode  And when you I think they were really nervous about it  They didn't trust him completely and one of the biggest things it turns out is when they were doing the fact-checking  He would not give them the name of his translator who was a central part of the story  he said kathy introduced him to a 13 year old girl or  kathy was with him when this man with the mangled hand and when the  hexane cleaner  Uh the people who'd been had neurological damage from hexane cleaners were with him and he wouldn't give them

Transcript:  The two biggest significant fact problems in the story were he made it seem like there are massive underage workers  Not so right. That's the biggest that's the biggest part right there  Yep, and then I think the second one that was called out and all this was um  the npr reporter in china just  Found real inconsistencies and rob schmitz and he went out and in fact checked it and found the interpreter who said no  It didn't go down like that. So the second biggest inconsistency is that when people are hurt they can sue for damages?

Transcript:  Totally agree and I think the the positive outcome that came from from this although it's sad that it came out at all  In the original report is that apple became more transparent?  People had their attention focused on this people think maybe I hope they think more about  Where these gadgets come from now given the nightline report and lots of others like like the new york times reporting it  So, you know, I don't think there was really  Any benefit into the the embellishment that went on but if we had to pick what something it would be the this transparency

Transcript:  It's really interesting because bill we are who's one of my new colleagues and and the and the reporter who went to nightline  Really sort of was struck by you know, he said he kept looking for what daisy described  And that doesn't he didn't find it  But that doesn't make anything that he reported and the footage that he brought back any less compelling and any less sort of powerful  I mean when you look at that stuff, you really see that  The nature of the problems there  I mean, of course the pictures of the nets have been around for years, but anytime you do see them  It's very powerful stuff. So  Yeah, I I don't think  You know in the end, I I don't think  There are no issues there  There obviously are very very big issues and it should be very interesting to see the results of the audit  Which I think we're actually due last week or we should be seeing them soon

But what a can of worms they'd be opening to investigate the truth of all that

Uh, he's no longer ceo there  He's still a I think a shareholder at both dig and revision three but devoted all his attention to his own investments as an angel  And to milk his new company mi.lk and milk  The idea behind milk was it was a small team. I think seven people there including daniel burko who's the original designer for dig  chris hutchins  um, and uh, and they made an app called oink which I loved but uh,  Five months later not enough adoption. He's he told us on the stage at leweb  That 150 000 downloads in the first month, which is pretty good  But it just stalled and what he had always said is what we're going to do with milky is we're going to iterate  We're going to do something never done before we're going to try stuff  If it doesn't work, we're going to drop it and move on  So I wasn't too surprised when he sent an email out to all the oink people including myself saying  We're we're you know, take your data. We're gone and they did they gave you the data which I don't I don't it's an all  An xml. I don't have anything to do with it.

They've completely locked us out of youtube live. They won't let us do it  They they they constantly pull down our shows from youtube itself. It's not a very good platform for us  so, uh, I feel like  Because google is going for the internet  I feel like  Because google is going into the content business the content creation business is a conflict stick a stake into my heart and shoot me  And if they buy revision three

I worry about the independent content creator  Because now one of the things that I celebrated about podcasting was anybody could create a show or a network  And compete with nbc and abc  Clearly the major networks with all due respect joanna and becky, but the major networks are struggling  And what but now what's going to happen is google going to become the new nbc?  I hate to see that because what we don't want is media conglomerates. We don't want the concentration of  voices we want  Everybody to be able to participate and because google runs search. That's a real conflict of interest

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The recent debate over copyright laws like sopa in the united states in the actor agreement in europe  Has been very emotional  And I think some dispassionate quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate  I'd therefore like to propose that we employ we enlist the cutting-edge field of copyright math  Whenever we approach this subject for instance just recently  The motion picture association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft  Now rather than just argue about this number a copyright mathematician will analyze it  And he'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across ocean boulevard to the west end  And then to mars  If we use pennies  Now this is obviously a powerful some might say dangerously powerful insight  But it's also a morally important one  Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we're talking about but this is actual economic losses  This is the equivalent to the entire american corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops as well as wheat  tobacco rice  sorghum whatever sorghum is  Losing sorghum  But identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math  Now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since napster first came on the scene  So that's a chunk of what we're looking for  But total movie revenues across theaters home video and pay-per-view are up  And tv satellite and cable revenues are way up other content markets like book publishing and radio are also up  So this small missing chunk here is puzzling

Transcript:  Since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms  It's not additional growth that piracy has prevented but copyright math tells us it must therefore be  Forgone growth in a market that has no historic norms one that didn't exist in the 90s  What we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy  50 billion dollars of the year which is enough at 30 seconds a ringtone that could stretch from here  to neanderthal times

Transcript:  I have excel  The movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over  370,000 jobs that are lost in the last three years  Over 370,000 jobs to content theft which is quite a lot when you consider that back in 98  The bureau of labor statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing 270,000 people  Other data has the music industry at about  45,000 people and so the job losses that came with the internet and all that content theft have therefore left us with negative employment in our  Content industries this is one of the many mind-blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day  And some people think that string theory is tough  Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians toolkit  It's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated  Hollywood and congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law  Some people think this number is a little bit large  But copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year  Now when this law first passed the world's hottest mp3 player could hold just 10 songs  And it was a big christmas hit because what little hoodlum wouldn't want a million and a half bucks worth of stolen goods in his pocket

Yeah, and and the slant on this familiar with this space and then so on the user review  They've got all the users on the right hand side and they're they're you know  The users are actually rating on the 10 point scale and doing it over there, right?

Start time: 7387.38
End time: 7396.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um  I don't know. I guess it kind of is that was my answer saying we yeah  We've done reviews on the site for a very long time, but not like this. So it's more refocusing

Start time: 7397.08
End time: 7399.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh from the social site to more of a review site

Start time: 7400.00
End time: 7459.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right exactly  So we found a couple things one the user reviews on the site was always one of the best parts of the site  it was one of the things that people got the most out of and  Enjoyed the most when they contributed to them and the way that we do user reviews is very unique  um with like a kind of criteria based rating system and um  what the users kept telling us was that  We should be doing more in the review space and you know, i'm not really satisfied with what?  publications out there doing mean I I think that there's a lot of really amazing reviewers out there and  Uh, you know, I think they've definitely carried the torch into the new media space  since you know, we've kind of gone into the  You know post  You know  magazine like review form online, but we haven't done the next step which is to  Build an experience that's much more useful on top of the great review work that other people are already doing

Start time: 7459.94
End time: 7485.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's what I was saying is this I think people you know  while there's a place for the 20 page  review what people really want is a single page they can go to and get a  Is it is it worth buying what are the pros and cons and you do this really well  By both aggregating other people's reviews your conclusions  And I think you're right. I think highlighting the user reviews is a really great idea  Plus the design is fantastic pictures look great. Yeah, the design is beautiful

Start time: 7485.44
End time: 7521.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
