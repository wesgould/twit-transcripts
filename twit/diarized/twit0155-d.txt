This is Twit, episode 155.  And for those of you who agree with Robert Scoble that enthusiasts, blogs, and podcasts  should not cover business but should cover, I don't know, bits and bytes.  This is not going to be the show for you.  This is going to be a business show, I think.  But we'll see.  You never know with this bunch.  Starting with Jason Calacanis from Mahalo.  Hey Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, how you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't talked to you since you gave up blogging.  I want to ask you about that.  But not yet because I want to introduce some more of the panel.  John C. Dvorak is not here.  He's flying up to Port Angeles carrying in a couple of keys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, can't be here but dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't touch my bags if you please Mr. Customsman.  Here also actually in studio.  It's really nice to have him.  Andrew Horowitz.  He is the disciplined investor.  Howdy.  He's wearing his under armor.  Today.  Why is that the logo all the kids now wear the under armor logo?  What's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that an H for Horowitz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, is that a H?  Oh, I thought it was UA.  All right, now I understand.  Andrew hosts the Disciplined Investor podcast.  Also has the book Disciplined Investor,  which is available on audible.com.  And you do a bunch of other stuff too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we have a blog that's pretty popular and actually  right for MSN.  And actually, just starting this week, MSN Strategy Lab.  I'm one of the five contestants vying for the big prize  of winning the brass ring, it seems.  I manage a portfolio live for MSN money.  Is it a real portfolio or is it a foe portfolio?  It's foe.  But the rules are all the same about how I would invest  and how you could short, you can go long.  And then right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the prize?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nice.  What do you think?  You're not talking about it?  I win, it seems.  That's all it is.  There's nothing.  You get to do it.  There's no prize.  There's some bragging rights, I guess.  What they do, it's interesting because what they do it for  is really not so much as a competition, although that's  part of it, of course.  It's a learning exercise.  Any time I do buy or sell anything,  I actually have to send in an entire summary of what I'm  doing.  And that appears on the site.  That's actually really nice.  It's a really nice setup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also here from Business Week, their technology editor,  Mr. Peter Elstrom.  First time on Twitter.  Peter, good to have you.  Hey, Leo.  It's good to be here.  You're in New York City today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm actually in the suburbs of New York,  up in Westchester, where I live.  Yeah, our offices are in New York City.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's good to have you on.  This is a good, auspicious time to have three guys who know  something about business on.  I know, I'm just going to say right now,  nothing about business.  That's why I'm doing 40 hours of video a week on Twitter Live  for absolutely no money.  So I'm obviously the wrong person  to ask about any of this stuff.  Actually, I think one of the big stories is the Rackspace IPO.  We haven't seen an IPO in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll give Bronx a cheer for that one.  Didn't do so well, did it?  No.  I have a theory why.  I can tell you why that is, actually.  One of the big things in IPOs, if you think about it,  is it was always put out.  It would be when the underwriters are involved,  they have to support it.  And I think it was coming out at, I think it was 12 was  Rackspace, I believe, or 14, whatever it was, exactly.  The underwriters don't have the money to support it anymore.  They just don't.  They have to put their money somewhere else.  And that's why the last two that I saw, there was a solo one,  Rackspace both fell terribly right afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What did Rackspace end up down?  It was down 20% or something?  Yeah.  Yep.  Today it was terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, look at my Bloomberg application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think that's the whole point of the IPOs  is that days are numbered.  If these guys aren't going to hold it up, Goldman or Morgan  or whoever else it may be, there is no way  that you're going to have people coming out with the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think black helicopters are flying in.  What is that?  Are they coming to get us?  I think it's Dvorak coming down from Port Angeles.  He said, wait a minute.  I got to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I have telecanis on the show.  I got to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's very serious about his anniversary.  I planned on coming out here for three months,  and we talked about it constantly.  And all of a sudden he says, no, I have to.  This is his anniversary?  Is that what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yesterday.  Yesterday.  Oh, isn't that sweet?  With Mimi, how long have they been married?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That woman is an angel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's been around a long time.  That woman is an angel.  That's all we can say.  So Jason, there hasn't been a tech IPO in a long time.  When's the last tech IPO?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's been some semiconductor stuff  and some other stuff.  There haven't been many IPOs at all, frankly.  It's been a bad market for that.  It's actually, you know what?  A lot of the companies now are just,  there is much more capital out there available to people  from other types of funds.  They don't need to do the IPO.  They don't need to do that.  I mean, you have people like Legg Mason and Fidelity now  doing investments in the C&D round,  which is the later stage round for venture companies,  like Slide, like Ning, et cetera.  So you see these 30, 40, $50 million rounds.  They're just basically,  it's almost like IPOs happening in private companies.  They're putting in that level of money.  And you raise 30, 40, 50, $100 million in an IPO.  And now you've got private people who can put it in.  And it costs you, I think probably,  a million and a half, $2 million a year to be public now  because of all the Sarbanes, Oxley stuff.  It's just not worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what DeVorex always says.  Sox is killing the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, here's the Rackspace graph on Bloomberg.  It's a good graph.  That is horrible.  That's when you only have one day of trading.  It's just basically, it's-  What'd it go, 14 to 12 or something?  It went 12 and a half to 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that was, by the way, on a week  when we had a 300 point up on the market.  I mean, that is horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happened in the market, by the way?  Why did it, what happened there?  Why did it go up 300 points?  Was it the price of oil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, oil prices are finally coming down.  How long can they come down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that's just a blip, right?  I mean, is it really gonna come down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is my hot button here.  You know, the Enron loophole,  not to really get crazy with everybody here,  but this is unbelievable.  Back in 2000, there was an opening in the energy area  where Philgram pushed a bill through,  allowed Enron to have these rolling blackouts out here.  You remember that?  And this was a shortage.  That was all for trading.  Essentially for less-  Yeah, screwed California is what they did.  Totally screwed California.  Well, this was open.  This whole same thing never closed up all these years.  And it was allowing for trading to happen on the ICE  outside the parameters of any regulatory body  of the United States.  So all that was trading outside of that.  And the limits were small.  Bottom line is they finally, Feinstein,  your senator out here,  she actually went and pressed it real hard  and put it to part of the farm bill  and closed up that loophole.  And wouldn't you know it, it was finally closed,  but they left out oil.  They just closed down heating oil and natural gas.  And that's why that happened.  And speculation was the whole problem here.  It was not, the supply of Van Crap was just bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The price went up because of speculation.  The speculation is over,  so the price is gonna stay down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And now they're running for the hills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's good news for us.  And everybody's happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you would have seen the whole invasion,  the Georgian invasion,  devil went down to Georgia on Friday.  Why, was that a nightmare?  But that should have pushed prices of oil up, right?  Didn't.  Nope, and gold came down too.  So-  Didn't, why didn't that scare people  that Russia invaded Georgia?  It may have, but it was good.  The whole issue of the speculation just,  just pushed everybody out too quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, enough of, enough of,  let's talk about gold.  You mentioned gold.  Gold.  Salon.com, Andrew Leonard,  How the World Works, great column.  He writes, yesterday afternoon,  while my son was upstairs leveling up his blood elf  and exalting in his new ostrich mount,  I was downstairs working my way through  the 87 page research paper, quote,  gold farming, real world production  in developing countries for the virtual economies  of online games.  A professor at the University of Manchester in England  wrote a paper on why gold farming  is good for the economies of third world nations.  Gold farming is making fake gold  for World of Warcraft, you understand, right?  Yeah, alchemy, virtual alchemy.  It's poor people sitting there  kind of slung in and out of World of Warcraft,  and then somebody comes along, gives them real money  for all the gold they've earned,  fishing and hunting and mining.  Apparently, there's a relationship, a parallel  between the gold farmers and the treatment  of Chinese immigrant labor working laundry shops  during the gold rush of the mid to late 19th century  in California.  The same repetitive work in front of a machine,  the same association with gold,  and similar tropes of associating East Asians  with disease and pestilence  that justified the need for their extermination.  What?  I don't know, World of Warcraft,  there's a real economy in there.  You guys, anybody here play World of Warcraft?  No, not at that. You got a real job.  Don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Peter, you play?  I don't, no, no, no, it's tough to find the time.  I just think it's tough to find the time.  I checked it out once or twice, but no, I can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got my level 70 night elf,  and I'll whip your butt anytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's way up there, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, I'm just kidding.  Jason, you play World of Warcraft, I know you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know who does?  I've got 60 hours free a week over here.  You know who does?  Joey Ito.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Joey, yeah, well.  He thinks this is like the next place business happens,  like the golf course of the 21st century.  No, incorrect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What happened to Second Life?  That was gonna be the golf course of the 21st.  That was the next thing too.  That's a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I, yeah, I was.  Hey now!  It's true, he's not lying.  You go in there, people buy nude suits,  and they wander around naked,  and you can get sexual positions.  Very weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a word I think it's called desperation involved.  It's kind of lonely, lonely people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ryanair making a nice move.  This is, I kind of equate this to Hasbro's move  with the Scrabulous folks.  Ryanair has decided that it will,  Ryanair is the Irish discount airline  that makes it very cheap to fly around the European Union.  20 bucks, right?  Yeah, I mean it's like a bus,  but it's really, it's been huge for the-  Is that a BYOB or a BYO chair or something?  BYO chair, yeah.  It's huge for the economy of Europe because-  Make your own jet fuel.  These workers now, because they're EU citizens,  they can travel around very easily,  and Ryanair makes it very possible.  They said yesterday they're going to unknow  all bookings made through third party websites.  You book a flight through say lastminute.com,  which is a very popular site, VTours, TUI, O'Poto.  You book a Ryanair ticket there.  I mean this is money going to Ryanair.  It's not like they're stealing money from Ryanair.  Ryanair's gonna cancel the booking.  And then what?  They'll give them refunds.  And then the people have to go book it again?  Yeah, I guess-  How inconvenient is that?  It's completely insane.  This is the same idea as, I don't know what,  is the deep linking lawsuits of a few years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this was like Ticketmaster, I guess,  where Ticketmaster didn't want people  to deep link to their stuff.  And now there's no way to use,  the same way like SideStep and Kayak  can create these really interesting looks at the data,  these meta search engines.  Yeah, what's wrong with that?  Brings you business.  Well, it brings you business,  except what they've found, I think,  is they don't want people comparing the prices,  most people are too lazy to.  And if they let one of these other people  get a hold of the consumers,  then it's gonna cause them problems down the road.  So it's sort of like music industry  gets in bed with Steve Jobs and the iTunes store,  and now they're like, oh my God,  now we've got this juggernaut to deal with.  I think Ticketmaster didn't wanna make  a secondary ticket market  that they would have to then deal with  if they caught on and had a lot of traffic.  So that's probably what Ryanair's trying to do,  is not have somebody become a layer on top of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Last thing we want is intelligent consumers  that we can't rip them off as easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and efficient ones, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Efficiency's bad for our business.  Not to bring, what is it,  the six degrees of Kevin Bacon, right?  Six degrees of John Dvorak, everything relates to him.  But didn't something, his son do a deal  where the whole, it's down, they shut him down.  They shut him down.  He was doing the same kind of thing  where he was, instead of going to Craigslist,  we could find one area.  He was doing a massive search of the entire database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Craigs, it was called Craigsfinder.  And it's craigs, F-I-N-D-R dot com.  And it was, I thought, a great idea.  John mentioned it on the show, I think last week,  saying it's, you know, he's just waiting  for the other shoe to drop.  It dropped.  It dropped.  It dropped.  Craigslist is blocking Craigsfinder.  If you go to savecraigsfinder.com,  there's a whole bunch of stuff on there.  And John actually did say, can you please mention this?  Because his son is miffed.  But this is a little different though,  because they're scraping information off Craigslist.  Right, but if you read what the responses,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's totally a joke, the responses that they got,  asking why is this, and they gave him back a response  why they didn't want this to happen.  It's a total joke why it's not being allowed.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What, what, they don't want somebody in between them  and their customers?  Is that the idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the way Craigslist works, it's local, right?  So you go to San Francisco or you go to New York.  You don't go to both.  You have to go one at a time.  So the Craigsfinder scraped them all.  And so you could combine multiple locations of Craigslist  and do a search that way.  Now why they wouldn't, now the difference is  Ryanair's getting the money for the booking.  The difference here is, you know,  Craigs, I don't know how Craigslist makes money.  Does anybody know how Craigs makes any money?  It's not.  There's no ads.  It's not, it's not.  How, Jason, explain this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They charge for certain, they charge for jobs  and real estate listings in certain cities.  So in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles,  you post a job, you post an apartment.  They charge 75, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So not all listings are free.  They have some charge, because there's no ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  99.9% of listing categories are free.  They just basically waited until they hit critical mass  in the top, like five markets, 10 markets,  and they turned it on when you really have no choice  but to use those markets.  And it makes probably $30 million a year, the company.  Maybe 40 or 50, even now.  Interesting.  No design cost.  It's making a lot of money.  No design cost, no.  It's all text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No design cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now that's interesting, though,  because that runs counter to the notion  that once you give away something,  this is Twitter's problem, right?  Once you give something away for free,  isn't it impossible to go back and charge money for it?  But I guess it is with Craig, anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and the way people feel about it is,  oh my god, Craig's List is such a great service,  and everything's totally free.  If I have to post a job, $25 or $50,  not such a big deal, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's usually the employer that's paying money, right?  It's not the employee's looking for jobs.  So the employer's wanna find somebody,  and they'll pay a little bit of debt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's good money, isn't it?  On a lot of sites, for a while,  we even looked at doing a Twit job site,  because there's good money in these job listing sites,  right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, you're looking at,  people spend 20, 30% of the person's salary  when they use a headhunter.  So when you're looking at 10, 20, $30,000 fees  to headhunters, $150, $400,  that seems, if you can get qualified resumes,  to be pretty cheap.  And the reason, that's the reason why local newspapers  are having so much of a problem.  So what basically Craigslist did was they said,  okay, let's take the entire 100% market  of job listings and classifieds,  let's shrink it down, make it free,  except for this 1%.  And they didn't have any percent,  so for them making 30, 40, 50 million a year,  you know, the 1% of the classified industry  is great for them, but they basically destroyed  the entire industry to take their one little slice.  It's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the challenge for the newspaper industry, right?  They're getting that small slice of revenue  and sucking it out of the newspapers  across the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's why they're going out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's my question, why would CraigsFinder hurt Craigslist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll tell you the reason why Craigs says it,  because this is like maybe the 10th time  that they've shut these things down, and I know him.  He'll fall back to the community, you know,  we don't have permission from our community  to re-syndicate our stuff, and the community doesn't want it,  so he sort of falls back on what he knows of the community.  Craigslist is a Web 1.0 company.  It wasn't intended to be like,  oh, we have an API, go take our stuff,  and we'll make derivative services out of it,  and they don't want to make these visualizations,  so the other company that made a visualization service  out of it got shut down.  They basically scraped the entire thing,  and they took all the pictures, and they said,  okay, search for one bedroom, two bedroom, a three bedroom,  and we'll show you a grid of all the pictures.  It's a pretty cool idea, right?  And they shut that down, too, so they're basically saying,  our community doesn't want it, which is sort of a little bit.  That's BS.  That makes no sense. It's sort of BS, yeah.  Basically, it's their data, it's their business.  They're saying, we've created a business

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  with a significant barrier to entry,  so we can sit on our ass and make a crappy site  that doesn't have any of the features of any modern website,  and you can't do it either, but because we dominate,  no one else can come in, so what? Too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's a death knell for them.  If somebody comes in behind them.  Can somebody come in? Yeah, somebody can come in behind them.  Obviously, they have huge momentum,  and they're, you know, niching what they do,  because it's cheap, and it's the garage sale of the Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got a new site, and I want to do Cool List, C-U-I-L-L-I-S-T.com,  and we'll just be a better Craigslist.  What do you think?  The spelling is work on.  It's Irish for I'm rich, I think.  Biatch. I think Biatch is in there.  Biatch? Yeah, I'm rich Biatch.  There isn't a direct translation in Gaelic to Biatch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But somebody can come behind Craigslist,  and then they're just going to be in big trouble.  You think? Yeah, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there isn't such a significant barrier to entry.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's no barrier to entry except brand,  and a 10-year-old brand like that, it's very hard to display.  What if you did something that was really good,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that was a mashup, you know, like this Google Map mashup?  What if you did something really good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In order to get people to switch a service,  it's going to require hitting them  somewhere between three and seven times with a marketing message,  and it's going to require having a product  which is probably 50, 100 percent times better.  So you can't just make it 10 percent better,  because there are search engines that are 10 percent better  than Google or whatever,  but to get people to switch off a brand,  there is zero switching cost, theoretically.  You type in a different domain name,  but it means you have to market the heck out of it to displace it.  So if somebody wanted to start, you know, this seven days in tech,  and it's a show that's twice as good,  it's going to take them a couple of years to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, good, thank God, because I'm basically resting on my butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In a world where everything is a commodity,  brand becomes the differentiator, brand becomes the defensibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tom Peters, didn't Tom Peters say that a product,  to replace, supplant another product has to be not twice as good,  not three, it has to be 10 times as good to supplant another product  with an established brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what you get, you know what you have, you know what, you know.  I take the chance, unless I could see a significant improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Craigslist does the job, people use it, does the work, could be better.  But I hate, here's what I hate, yeah, that's the thing,  I hate seeing somebody say, yeah, so you can't beat us,  so I don't have to innovate, I don't have to do anything,  and I can just, I can, you know, dump on innovators,  because I don't have to, you know, improve.  That's kind of sad, don't you think?  Come on, Craig, talk to Craig, Jason, will you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he's a friend of mine, I mean, the other thing I have to thank you...  He's a nice guy, but he's not Mr. Excitement.  Here's the thing,  not everybody has to have the same philosophy of how to run a business  and what they should be, should be allowed,  people should be allowed to do with their data.  You know, you know, Kevin Rose from DIG thinks it should be open to a point,  you know, like he's not letting people create totally open search engines  based on his data.  Delicious believes that there should be open,  except you can't go make a search engine with it,  so when you start getting down and peeling back the onion,  like even the people who are open and have APIs,  they open and have APIs to a point,  not to the point at which you create a really valuable business,  so I kind of think the whole API and openness thing is really disingenuous,  and it's kind of refreshing for someone like Craig to be like,  you know what, it's my data, I built this business,  you don't have a right to it, sorry.  If you want to start from scratch, go ahead,  whereas some of the other people are saying,  oh yeah, you can build anything you want  unless you start infringing on the business,  so they basically make the throttles into the API and the rules  such that you can't build a compelling business on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Jason, the only difference here is that...  I think also at Craigslist...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead.  I think also at Craigslist,  we had the chance recently to talk with Jim Buckmaster there,  and it seems like they're very focused on the community  and what their community wants,  and they're less concerned with if some business partner wants to come in  and try to build something on top,  it's just less of a concern to them, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're telling me the community won't want greater exposure  and people to find them in a much more efficient manner?  That just doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if you were to present it to them that way,  they may respond positively,  but I think it's not what they're asking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a red herring.  That's a total red herring, that argument.  It's like, oh, we don't really...  Our community doesn't want it.  That's basically a way of saying,  you know what, stay out of our business.  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is mine and you're not a part of it.  Na na na poo poo.  It's an interesting culture clash, really,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  between Eric here, who is John's son,  who is really of this new generation,  this open API, scrape everything, mash up generation,  and the older generation, Craig and Jim,  who are just really saying, no, no, this is what we do.  It's plain white paper, black text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The younger generation has the belief that  it's a sort of technological determinism where  if I can technically achieve something,  then it is allowable.  Right.  And that's exactly how Napster felt.  That was the first example of it.  I technically made this happen, therefore it's allowable.  How could you stop it?  And that's actually how these young people think.  They think, well, you can't stop me,  and I can just scrape it, and if you block my IP,  I'll get other IPs and I'll keep doing it.  And they don't actually, they're so young and naive,  that they don't understand that there's law  and that there's fairness and that there's ethics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's the entitlement generation is what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I wonder though, who's gonna win?  Aren't they gonna win in the long run?  Isn't that the future?  We all die.  No, I don't think it is.  We all die.  We, what are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless you take the history of,  you take our entire legal structure and playing field  and you throw it out, the answer is no, actually.  I mean, YouTube, in fact, is an example of that techno  sort of determinism, oh, well, we were able  to create this platform, anybody should be able  to do whatever they want, and the madness of the mob rules,  and then all of a sudden, Viacom says, mm, no,  or Craigslist says, ah, no.  And the way I try to explain to people is,  this young generation has to learn  about the concept of fairness.  There's fair use, like what you're able to do legally  in fair use, but then there's also this concept  of being fair.  If you build a business based on Craigslist business,  you owe them something.  Yes, yes.  So you need to go to them and ask permission.  Just like if I wanted to take Twit and remix it,  I should go to you and say, hey, Leo, I have this idea,  I wanna put Twit onto a P2P network  and I'm gonna share it with people.  You would give permission to me.  Well, here's an interesting thing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and I think this is where the kind of new generation,  the old generation differ.  Twit is licensed with a Creative Commons license  that lets you do exactly that for non-commercial purposes.  Non-commercial.  Without permission, as long as you attribute it.  Now, as soon as you start charging,  then obviously you need permission,  but that's a choice I made in terms of licensing.  It's a choice a lot of people are making nowadays  in terms of licensing,  and that I think is kind of the new generation.  The new generation recognizes the,  maybe, and maybe the pendulum has swung toward the Commons.  They recognize what Larry Lacey caused,  the tragedy of the Commons,  the need to have this stuff be available to work on.  In fact, there's a great article  in the August 11th New Yorker by James Surowiecki,  who wrote The Wisdom of Crowds.  He calls it the permission problem.  He says, a lot of innovation is stifled by the fact  that they have all these different business interests  who can't act economically rationally.  He gives us an example, an oil field,  where it turns out if too many people wildcat the oil field,  it's bad for everybody.  You get less oil total out of it  than if one company gets the rights to it.  He says the economically rational thing would be  for one company to say,  I'm gonna give you all a little bit of share.  We'll all make more money  if you let me have exclusive rights to it.  That very rarely happens, if ever,  even though that's economically rational behavior.  And so it's an interesting issue.  Look what happened with Hasbro and Scrabulous.  Businessweek just had a very good article.  What was it?  Hasbro learns to spell B-O-T-C-H.  Love that title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this is a great segue to the whole discussion of blogging.  So much of blogging is just a cut and paste  and a one line sentinel in the financial world,  especially one line about what it is.  I mean, where's the originality?  Where is the sanctity of someone's own idea  and having some of their own idea?  Well, I agree.  We call that reblogging.  Yeah, so it's unbelievable.  And Jason, I was writing for AOL blogging stocks.  I still officially write for them when I choose.  But so much of that is just repurposed information  over and over and it's this giant vat of,  to get through the information is just unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then there's the people like,  well, this show's an example.  We don't generate new information, new news.  We rehash old news, but we add opinion  and analysis on top of it.  There are people who add value.  A good blog is gonna add value.  Correct, correct.  I mean, Walt Disney didn't make up Cinderella.  Walt Disney didn't make up Snow White.  Walt Disney didn't even make up Mickey Mouse.  And yet they might want to assert the rights  to that in perpetuity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was some brain enhancing things  that helped him through that, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wanna actually ask you, Jason, in just a sec,  we talked last week about the weblogs Inc.  Frufara, and maybe you can give us some insight  into what's going on over there.  It sounded like, according to,  I think it was Dvorak or Harris last week said,  they're just gonna stop paying the guys, basically.  Also Propeller, which was your creation at AOL,  seems to be foundering.  I wanna ask you about both of those things.  But before I do, that's called a tease,  I do wanna mention that this show is brought to you  by the good folks at Visa.  It's funny, since we started doing these ads for Visa,  I've been getting more and more email.  It's so great from people.  Time after time, we said, yeah, you know what?  We got ripped off online.  We called Visa, and they immediately made it good.  And they pursued the guy.  They didn't say, oh no, let's see if we can get your money.  They made it good right away.  Visa knows you've got better things to think about  when it comes to shopping online.  Whether you wanna get that Tesla, or the Roadster,  maybe the four door.  It's a tough decision.  You shouldn't be thinking about  whether you're gonna get defrauded.  All the purchases you make with Visa are safe and secure.  They use a lot of very sophisticated online software  and technologies to prevent, detect,  and resolve online fraud.  You know what?  You don't need to know the sophisticated stuff they're doing.  You just need to know two words, zero liability.  You are not liable for unauthorized purchases.  You're safe online with Visa.  That's peace of mind.  Safe, secure, Visa.  Keep those emails coming in too.  I'll start quoting some of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo, could you use the Visa to set up your Audible account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, you could, but that'll come later.  Okay, just checking.  Thank you so much, Andrew.  That's really, frankly, that's Jason's job  to bring in the Audible.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Visa, great card.  Had one my whole life.  Home wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just went through my wallet, all Visa, all the time.  Well, wait a minute.  I have one American Express card.  Is that okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you something.  Visa, yeah, of course it's okay.  Visa, great for if you're selling something online.  It's a very low merchant fees.  We sell tickets to some of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, that's the problem with American Express.  It's a huge cut, isn't it?  They think it'd be a big cut.  Double.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's like one and a half versus three and a half,  four percent.  It's crazy.  I mean, what you have to pay for,  that's why a lot of restaurants,  like smaller restaurants that have low price food,  they're like, no, American Express, sorry.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because four percent could be a big part.  You know what's weird?  Explain this to me.  I went to Costco.  They won't take anything but American Express.  They got some deal.  American Express paid them off.  It's a five percent back.  That's a sponsorship deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's gotta be.  That pisses me off.  But now they have the plum card.  You know, they have the black card,  they have the blue card, they have the plum card.  Plum card gives you the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you have a black card, Andrew?  No, I don't.  Jason, do you have a black card?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  No comment.  He has a black card!  Do you have a plum card?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got to offer the black card.  Yeah?  And this is how cheap I am.  I grew up so broke and poor that I just,  I can't spend money on certain things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the yearly fee on a black card?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So my guy, you know, I got a guy,  and you know, he manages the stuff.  Yeah.  He's like, oh, what do you need?  Is there anything you want?  I can get you anything you want.  What do you want?  You get like a concierge.  You basically, so my money manager got it.  So he's like, you want a black card?  I got black cards on the way.  No problem.  I'm like, oh yeah, I like a black card.  He said, yeah, it's like, he's like,  it's great, it's made of metal.  I'm like, okay, well-  It's made of metal.  It is made of metal.  And I'm like-  You can slice your meat with it,  you can slice a steak.  The thing is, it is literally metal.  I mean, it's impressive.  And I'm like, okay, well, that's cool.  Maybe I'll get one.  And he's like, $4,500.  I was like, well, what do I get versus my platinum card?  You get a concierge.  He goes, it's the same thing, basically.  Same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the same thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only reason I, the same thing.  The only reason I pay for the platinum card,  which is $400 a year,  is because you get free companion ticket  when you buy a full class-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you spend $3,000 on a business class ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know what?  I do a ton of speaking gigs.  And when I do speaking gigs,  my guy Tyler sets it up and he says,  we'll buy the ticket, we buy the ticket,  and then I can bring my wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Perfect, because they pay for the first class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I went to, when I went to-  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll have to do that from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you're just in Asia,  I just came back on Cathay Pacific's business class.  Wow.  Oh yeah.  That was unbelievable.  I haven't been on-  What is it, like $50,000?  It was $28,000 for first class,  but it was, business class was,  but I don't pay for that.  I mean, it's all miles.  The whole trip was all miles.  But-  You know why I got a platinum card?  Oh, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because they could helicopter us out of Egypt  if we'd gotten sick.  Oh, that's good.  That was the only reason.  Platinum card's my card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was the only reason.  That's the perfect, platinum's the perfect, like, good deal.  If you get sick in Egypt.  You know what, I'm so cheap,  I'm like addicted to finding the $300 round trip flight.  You know, I like to go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, don't do it on Ryanair.  Yeah, really, and yeah, don't scrape those sites.  I love, do you use that sidecar?  What is it called, sidecar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Side step?  Side step, I love that.  Yeah, side step and kayak and all that stuff is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So how do you get a good fare  if you're so cheap, Mr. Jason Calacanis?  What's your technique?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I go to my assistant and say,  find the cheapest ride possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does he do?  Hey now.  Hey now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is called cheap, weird cheap,  like cheap with the wrong reason,  like Thurston Howell cheap.  Well, I just want to get the lowest fare,  so I go to my personal assistant and say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I told assistant number two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lovey.  If you could see the IRC room right now,  it's like, this week in rich people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is, it's this week in rich people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So when you travel with your staff, Jason,  do you sit like, visit less,  and they said coach?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did that once with Dane.  I felt so guilty, I'd swapped seats.  I said, Dane, come up here.  I'm sitting back there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't feel bad about it all.  You know why?  Because I busted my ass so long.  I'm sorry if I can't say ass.  You can say ass.  Busted my ass so long in coach,  like if I could, and I fly,  I do three, four trips a month.  I'm 37 years old.  I'm old now.  I get my back.  It's old.  It's like one thing,  if I can get a business class,  I go once in a while, it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Peter, you're like me.  We're sitting here.  We're impoverished journalists.  We cover these rich guys.  We interview these rich guys.  Does this make you nauseous?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't sound familiar.  Yeah.  It's making you sick.  It's making me sick.  I got two little kids too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's tough to go anyplace with two little kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait till they get the college age, Peter.  Let me tell ya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The good news is when you cover my company,  you have all the power over me,  and you can just totally flood it.  Which is what I was, a journalist,  that was what I loved.  I'd be interviewing billionaires.  The first time I met Mark Cuban,  I wrote a destroyedbroadcast.com and editorial,  and he had to deal with me,  and we got in a fight in the lobby of the NASDAQ building.  That must have felt good.  It was hysterical.  I wanted to become good friends, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember when I was on MSNBC on the site,  and I did a commentary.  It was when Internet Explorer 3.0 came out,  and I said, sell your Netscape stock,  shut the place down, it's over.  And I'm told Mark Andreessen just hit the rev.  I've never been,  remember you said, let's get Mark Andreessen on the show?  Very sensitive about it, yes.  Yeah, I don't think he'll ever come on the show with me.  He will, he's a very cool guy.  He might have forgotten by now.  That was 1996, that was a while ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He listens to the show too, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well Mark, I apologize.  I just want to point out, I was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know what?  When they got bought, credit to him,  they were making $600 million a year when they got bought.  Yeah, they were doing fine.  I was pretty.  And it was like servers and software, and yeah, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was making a point, I wasn't trying to say really,  obviously it's not all over,  but once Microsoft got to Internet Explorer 3,  it really was all over.  I mean, they were gonna dominate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they're gonna dominate,  we talked about the satellite thing?  In the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're gonna dominate this thing?  In the browser, and what's interesting,  I think it's amazing, is Mozilla has come right back,  and it's what, 60%, 70% market share, it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's so much better.  It's so much better.  I mean, it's just, there's no question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although Safari is hands down the best browser.  You think?  I don't think so.  Fast is most stable, it's so much better than Firefox now.  It doesn't have all the plugins.  I know, but you know what I do?  I keep Firefox open when I need to use a plugin,  like a delicious bookmark,  and 90% of my browsing's in Safari or WebKit,  which is like the open source base of Safari.  The WebKit.org, you could get the daily build.  So fast, the daily builds.  It's so much faster than even Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jason, does Safari do, seriously,  do they do something with the tonality  and the colors of, do they make it richer?  Seriously, it looks richer.  What, Safari?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, when you're in Safari,  everything looks a little richer.  I think it's the minimal nature of the stuff around it.  Actually, I'm gonna tell you something.  Andrew's not wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Safari is the only browser  that actually does the proper thing with colors.  It does look better.  As a matter of fact, you're absolutely right.  Safari pays attention to color profiles,  all the other browsers don't.  That's interesting.  Yeah, so if you're-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's something new every week.  Yeah.  Will Silverlight work in Safari, did they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Silverlight will work in Safari, I think, yeah.  Let me see, let's try it.  I'd love to see other sources.  So you guys, what'd you think of the opening ceremonies?  You think this is,  I Twittered, ladies and gentlemen,  you've just seen the beginning of the Chinese century.  I think it's very clear,  China was making a very clear statement.  They were saying, not only do we have a lot of people  who can do exactly what we say in perfect unison,  but we've got the technology too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When he started walking around that wall,  to light the flame.  Amazing.  My jaw was hanging open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amazing, I mean, it was artistically brilliant,  but it was also technologically very,  what'd you think, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I only saw the drumming part of it.  I didn't see the rest of it.  That was enough.  2008, guys.  The drumming part, I just said to myself,  only the Chinese would create this incredible technology  to make all these drums and this stuff,  and then say, oh yeah, let's make it manual  and put it, how many was it, 5,000 people?  Yeah, so they're like, okay, let's put 2,000 people  on the floor to run these obviously  technologically sophisticated devices.  That is the perfect metaphor, and you're correct,  of what the world is gonna look like.  Two billion people with massive amounts of technology  is a lot more, it's very intriguing  how the world's gonna change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it was extremely compelling and very interesting,  and it was a clear message.  They said on the TV, announcers said that in the rehearsals,  they finally had to tell these drummers smile,  because it was so scary.  These guys were frowning serious in perfect synchrony.  You gotta figure they're probably  from the Chinese army, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it made it look like it was,  I mean, it did look a little Nuremberg,  not to go Nazi on the show, what are we, 42 minutes in?  Bill Godwin's law has now been officially, yeah.  First Nazi reference, 42 minutes in,  but it did look a little Nuremberg,  stormtrooper kind of situation,  where like, okay, these people could be also carrying rifles.  But you know what, I'll say, any country  that is putting people in jail for free speech  and does not have a democratic process,  is not gonna be able to compete in the way  we may be, you know, whatever,  less than 15% of the size of their country.  Yeah, but they're a massive size.  We're a free country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're massive sizes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think that's true, Nessie?  I wonder, I would think a totalitarian,  a well-run totalitarian regime, like say, the Nazis,  what an economic machine they made  out of a very small country that very nearly does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not innovation, innovation works best  when you have a free market and a free people,  because people are not gonna invest their lives  playing in a rigged game.  That assumes that they know  how to get a rigged game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's that?  First of all, we're in a rigged game now,  but that's a different discussion.  We just don't see it that way.  I would submit that's true.  They don't see it that way either.  You don't necessarily know that you're in a rigged game  when the game's rigged, if it's being done correctly.  Or if you're a nationalist and you say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see my country succeeding.  Look, you gotta understand,  China went from the worst possible third world nation  50 years ago to, you know, maybe they're still  not a first world nation, but they're moving fast.  I just got back, it's unbelievable.  Peter, what do you think?  Peter Elstrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm amazed at how fast the economy  has been able to come on.  You're talking about double digit growth  for a good number of years, you know?  So maybe it doesn't have all the liberties  that we have right now, but as an economic power,  they're certainly coming on strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a really interesting question  you raise, Jason, is do you need a democracy  and capitalism for innovation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're gonna have like the, yeah,  if you're gonna be a competitive,  if you're gonna need that,  because you're not gonna get investment  and stuff like that in young people doing stuff like this  because I know VCs, I know one VC invested  in a company over there, and this is a couple years ago,  probably less chance of having now,  and then they invested in the company  and then the company was gone.  And they're like, where'd the company go?  And then like the government basically just took the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Jason, you're showing your age right now.  Let me just give you something to consider, okay?  You ready?  Roman Empire.  The fact of the matter is that what we've had now  is the last 50 years has been an extraordinary revolution.  And we've seen things that have come on so fast  compared to what it's been like.  But that does not necessarily  has to be the plan moving forward.  And the sheer strength,  I mean, consider what's going on in China.  1.3, 1.4 today, tomorrow 1.5 billion people there.  I mean, the amount of materials, the amount,  I mean, if you think they eat one chicken a week  per person in China, it's 50 billion chickens a year.  Where are they putting all those chickens?  It's unbelievable.  It looks good, it looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where are they putting it all?  Where are they putting the chickens?  What's happening here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, let me tell you something.  You know the problem is you can't keep,  you can't put the freedom genie back in the bottle.  And so I believe that it's gonna be a democracy.  I agree.  It may take a long time.  I don't think it's gonna take that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's moving very rapidly that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Last week they put people in jail  before the Olympics started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, they'll keep trying that,  but I don't think you're too far off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're doing it successfully.  And a lot of kids died in that earthquake.  And a lot of people were trying to do investigations  into what happened in the buildings  and who was responsible.  And I have family over there  and they basically bought them all off  and shut them all down.  The ones they, the freedom of speech,  in order to have true capitalism  and free markets and true innovation,  you must have freedom of speech  and you must have a free country.  You're just not gonna be able to keep up.  We got to the bomb before Hitler did, right?  Right.  But barely.  Yeah, but we did.  And there's nothing like freedom  to get people motivated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they're still selling Volkswagens in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're saying our freedoms helped us  develop a bomb that killed millions of people?  Is that what you're saying?  I'm just working this out here.  No, no, I'm saying is the innovation,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there's an innovation that had to take place there.  Somebody had to get to it first and the free country did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Peter, go ahead.  But I was gonna say there are freedoms in certain areas  and there are not freedoms in other areas.  Maybe more sensitive when you're addressing  certain kinds of political speech.  But when it comes to the economy,  you pretty much have freedom to develop  the kind of businesses you want.  I mean, you see a lot of pretty strong  entrepreneurial companies there coming up right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've done an interesting thing,  which is to, you have to compartmentalize to say,  we're gonna create free economic zones.  We're gonna let capitalism operate here in this key scope  but not there.  That's innovative.  I think that's very interesting.  Kind of semi-democracy, semi-totalitarian.  It's either innovative or desperate.  I don't know if desperation, well,  you got a big population,  you got a lot of pollution problems, obviously,  and you've got a lot of other issues.  But chickens.  And you got a lot of chickens.  Where are they putting the chickens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I said I would-  They could have riots in the street  for the next two decades.  They could have civil wars over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  And it is a very difficult nation to govern.  They have apparently, I'm told,  there's a lot of local autonomy,  which is both good and bad.  Part of the problem with the earthquake  was that the local authorities there were incompetent.  I think it's fascinating.  Anyway, I think what we saw in that opening ceremony  was clearly a message from the Chinese government  to the world that, hey, we're here.  We're numerous.  And we're not illiterate.  We're not, we've technically very,  that 147 meter LED screen was mind boggling.  But how does it look on Silverlight?  Actually, it looks good.  Look here, see, this is the Silverlight.  I was-  What about NBC?  What about NBC kind of doing this deal with Microsoft,  going after Adobe, saying,  hey, you gotta download Silverlight.  You wanna watch the Olympics online.  What about that?  Is that an anti-competitive move of exactly the same kind  that they got in trouble for with the DOJ  that they're still in trouble for with the EU?  Or is it just good business?  Andrew, you're looking at me funny.  This is a radio show.  It's a choice.  You can't give me a look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  La la la la la la la.  It's a choice.  I mean, so nobody said they'd use the flash.  It's how they-  The flash is also proprietary.  Right, so if you didn't do that, you'd watch it in flash.  What are you gonna watch it in, QuickTime?  Right.  It's not happening.  You know, you're gonna watch it in,  so you're gonna have a choice.  So what Microsoft did was step up to the plate  and they're really trying to push this whole,  it's there, MSNBC, it's the MS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm looking at the Silverlight on right now.  I think it looks spectacular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That looks great.  I mean, that must be, they must down sample it  depending on- Your bandwidth.  The bandwidth.  That must happen,  That looks great.  But what's really neat is if you can,  the sidebar here, there's a little button,  couple buttons, you can actually put in your zip code  and your phone and your cable provider, let's say,  and you could use picture in pictures.  It's really neat.  Yeah, like that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can also choose what you wanna have  in the various sidebars.  In the different, yeah, that's kinda cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, they stepped up, that's a nice looking,  I will tell you, I have some relationships with Microsoft  and they, Silverlight is a big push for them.  Big. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I said I would ask you,  and I'm gonna ask you, Jason, about Propeller, first of all.  That was kind of the dig clone that you created  when you were at AOL, and now the stories are  that it's kind of, what's going on with Propeller?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From what I understand,  you laid off a couple of people  and didn't refill a couple of positions,  and you know that AOL, and all I know  is what's really publicly out there.  Well, that's not true.  I do know some stuff that's not publicly out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People must be calling you there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the people who work for me always send me everything  and then I act like crazy, so I don't,  I'm always trying to be honest on the show,  so I do have some inside information,  but in terms of publicly available information,  AOL is shutting a lot of things down  and trimming a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Time Warner is.  Time Warner, I mean, AOL is one of its loss leaders,  but you take the magazines in AOL,  those are both sinking Time Warner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a big problem, and they're selling it, obviously,  and it's been, they split up the company,  Buca said publicly in order to split it,  so there's an access business  and there's an advertising business,  and when I worked there, that process was underway, actually,  and that's public knowledge as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think they're gonna do?  You think they're gonna sell one of the pieces  or both of the pieces?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think that they could sell,  from what I've read and what's out there,  I think they can sell the access business  to either a financial company,  like a private equity company,  or to EarthLink, people like that,  so that's probably what will happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As an ISP, it's kind of just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, just give it to another ISP,  then the traffic from that would still go to AOL.com,  and then they try to sell AOL  and all the other things they own,  like movie phone and whatnot,  to a Yahoo or Microsoft,  and you have three or four big assets in there.  You have mail, they're number one or number two in mail,  instant messaging, and news, and sports,  and some of those things,  so a lot of the verticals, it would fit nicely,  but the truth is, I think a lot of these companies  like Yahoo and Microsoft may not be that interested.  If they did, they would have bought it already,  and it's really gone south in a big way,  really quick, actually, since John O'Left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the demographics for the people  who use AOL's core AOL dial-up slash program?  What's the demographic?  80 or so, and they think AOL is the internet.  I have to go to AOL.  I use the AOL.  And I think that when I say dying business,  I mean, I really believe it's dying business,  and as a matter of fact, it's losing money,  and they've done, I think, they have some of their sites,  and I agree that they're good.  I just think that they're way out of the loop,  and I also think that once everybody gets in the light,  and when they get that Google bug,  it's like a disease that takes down companies.  They just can't recover.  They just can't think of anything else  other than how to beat Google.  Just get away from it.  It's just, you don't have to be an advertising company.  Go over and do something else to make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there is a little bit of Google envy,  and AOL never had it, right?  AOL is like, we're gonna do display advertising.  We're gonna create an ad network  that's based on display, not search advertising,  and they did really well.  So yeah, it seems like it's a bit of a mess.  The propeller stuff is not that big of a deal.  You cut a couple of positions here.  It's not gonna really affect the service,  and the service is the number two social news site.  Oh, actually number three now,  because Yahoo Buzz is number one.  DIG is number two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Buzz is just by virtue of the fact  that it's Yahoo is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But see, the thing that's frustrating for me  is when I was there,  I was trying to do what Yahoo Buzz was doing,  which is have it integrated into AOL's homepage.  It would have been as big.  And I had the same exact idea that made Yahoo Buzz work,  which was sell people the chance to be on the AOL homepage,  which will send you 400,000 people  instead of 40,000, which DIG can send.  That gets publishers really interested,  and publishers are really participating in Yahoo Buzz.  That's why Yahoo Buzz is actually beating DIG  in terms of traffic from what I understand.  I think that's out there.  Oh, and it's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and so if that's the case,  Yahoo was able to create DIG and not buy it, right?  And Yahoo had been an early suitor for DIG.  I created Propeller at Netscape,  and they were able,  they're actually now starting to follow the Buzz thing,  which was my original idea.  So they're gonna be able to beat DIG.  And so that's why I think DIG on the market  is maybe not so quickly closing as a sale.  But with the web blogging situation,  it's a whole nother mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, like I said, I wrote for them,  they're shutting that down left and right  and taking out the payments,  and really I think blogging buyouts is gone,  and a few other things are cutting down  and just scaling back on entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think it was,  I got the whole lowdown of what happened.  They basically got to the end of the month,  they realized they overspent for the year.  So then they did a bonehead move,  which is they said, everybody stop blogging.  And that just scared the hell out of everybody.  And this is a mobile workforce,  a work from home workforce that I curated  and built out with my team.  For those who don't know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this was Jason's company, which he sold to AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Engadget, autoblog, joystick, et cetera.  And so the worst thing you can do  with somebody who's working from home  and not in the office is tell them,  oh, there's no work for you for the next 10 days,  no warning, et cetera.  And we're talking about 500 blog posts  at 10 or $15 a piece, it's five to $10,000.  The average senior vice president  as executive vice president over there gets paid  three or $400,000 to seven or $800,000.  To take the salt of the earth people  and not pay them the $5,000 is just so bonehead  and so unfair, and really to be honest, it's just.  Well, is it that they're not gonna make payroll?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm ashamed.  Can they not make payroll?  I mean, what is the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they can make payroll.  It's just a bunch of spreadsheet wonks  going you're over budget  and then they have to pull back really quick.  It's not only that, the way that they presented it Jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  was horrible, it was an email, it was quick,  it was like, thank you very much,  but we're not gonna be paying for it.  Don't write anything, stop.  It was just like, what?  It was not a graceful. Explain what you're doing.  So it was supposed to be a team effort  but whatever, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stupid, and I asked them to sell me some of the blogs  that they weren't using.  Really?  Yeah, and they shut down like Card Squad and Divester,  which are about scuba diving and poker,  my two of my passions,  and they won't even give it back to me.  You know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How humiliating if you take them, you turn them around,  you make them viable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whenever you have people work with you,  you should forever try to make them feel good about you  and wanna work with you.  And with me and the rest of the team,  they basically just, they never really reached out to us  or tried to make us feel good.  They should treat us like alumni, you know?  And they don't, and that's why people hate AOL.  It's too bad.  You should treat your alumni well.  Google does that, Microsoft does that,  Yahoo does that, AOL doesn't do it.  It's just terrible.  I'm actually just.  Let's change the subject, he sounded terrible.  He sounded awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jason, you're sorry about that, buddy.  Think about the Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just pisses me off because you know,  I feel a lot of responsibility to sell a company to somebody  and I'm responsible in some ways for those people  when it happens to them.  And then to shortchange people over nothing.  And they realized it was a bonehead move  and then they tried to backtrack.  And then the bloggers, God bless them,  are so loyal to the brands,  they're like, they created shadow accounts  like Twa Blogger and TV Squad Blogger.  So they could blog for free  and then they put their byline in the body of the article  so it wouldn't get caught up in the accounting system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you want, I have the email that goes out to all the blog.  You want me to offer something from you to them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you could.  I'd offered them all jobs already.  Did you?  You're a good guy, Jason.  Yeah, my non-compete's over.  I tried to buy the ones they were shutting down  and rehire the bloggers  because I could run it for five grand,  each of these blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wasn't expensive, Jason, it wasn't that expensive.  I mean, they were paying very small amounts of money  for each post.  10 bucks, 15 bucks a post.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's public knowledge.  Anyway, you know what?  Big companies, when they're in trouble,  they start flailing around.  They flail.  And then people get knocked over.  And it's usually the little guy gets knocked over.  Trust me, no executive vice president over there  is missing a paycheck.  Yes, you should.  The biggest sacrifice they're making is like, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stop managing for the rest of the month.  We will not be paying you for any managing you do  for the rest of the month.  So please, unless you choose to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No flights on the private G5.  You think that's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, one tank of gas on the G5  would pay for all those bloggers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, one third of an hour.  It costs about 15 grand to run a G5 an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unbelievable, unbelievable.  You see, there's a really good example.  That's a different, no,  that's a different accounting unit.  There's a different spreadsheet.  You can't cross that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's going on across the board on all of this.  I mean, the fact is that, you know,  we're probably in the worst, Jason and Peter,  we're in the worst time for this dislocation  of the average Joe to management and corporate America  than I've ever seen.  And I've been in this business 25 years  and it's pretty bad, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the balance of power between the executives  and the global reserves.  What is the balance of power?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, as I call it, the milli-vanilli world.  You know, they kind of talk and it's not coming out  the way they supposedly say in it.  And you know, it's just that the lying and the manipulation  and this, you know, it seems that they keep getting paid  but everybody else gets screwed along the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who's gonna buy AOL?  What's gonna happen to AOL, do you think, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, I just, the asset is going down in value so quickly.  I don't, they'll sell the ISP to EarthLink, you know,  or one of the other ones, Net Zero, whatever.  Right.  And the content stuff will probably get sold off piecemeal.  It's a disaster, it's a disaster.  They had a good strategy to grow.  You have to invest if you wanna grow.  And everybody in the space is investing.  Yahoo, Microsoft, even Ask.com, News Corp.  Everybody's putting money to these things  and all AOL has done is cut, cut, cut.  You're not gonna build something innovative  when you have VCs investing in startups  and all the incumbents investing in buying startups  and building new product.  You have to invest for growth.  You cannot grow by cutting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I just got an email from Barack Obama.  He says, here's a guy who has definitely understood the web  and used it well, he's on Twitter,  he's the number two guy on Twitter,  right after Kevin Rose.  He's, he's, yeah, he's used the internet very well.  He says, I am about to announce my vice president  sometime before the convention, which is next week, right?  And if you sign up, I will email you or text message you  the announcement before I send it out to the press.  What do you think?  What a clever way to get email addresses,  cell phone numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What a bad way to piss off the press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I can tell you the press is probably doing  what I just did, which is I signed up immediately.  Right, so yeah, exactly.  So who's the- So it doesn't really matter, does it?  But it sure looks good  from the point of view of the people, right?  And especially the dijorati.  Don't get me started.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a game.  What's a game?  It's called politics.  Yeah, but it's the whole way it's been structured.  It's just that this whole thing has been so,  just it's been, just-  Hey, hey, sound like you're-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me ask you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm in the financing.  Who believes that if he comes in,  we're gonna have a really good economic situation  in front of us?  I mean, come on, he has no plan.  I'm not saying the other guy I like either, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead, Peter.  It's not clear that either candidate  is that strong on the economic side.  I totally agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also not clear that, do you think anybody  could do anything?  I mean, is there somebody who,  what magic person's gonna come in and fix everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bloomberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe Bloomberg could probably do it, yeah.  He didn't run though.  Vice president.  Ah, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's just, he's pretty, he's said many times  he really wants no part of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he's not the kind of guy  who wants to be vice president, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, no, he wants to keep it going in New York  and keep things going and I don't know.  It just, listen, Bush didn't do any good either, right?  But it doesn't seem like he.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, he didn't do any good.  It was a disaster on a fiscal basis, a disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Disaster, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, worse than any Democrat  in terms of fiscal responsibility, like ever.  Worse than any three Democrats ever.  True, exactly.  Actually, you're probably correct.  If you took the financial situation  and the amount of like, from surplus to debt,  I mean, even if you did it in, you know, like real,  as opposed to real dollars,  doing it in like time adjusted dollars.  No, the numbers are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It would probably be the worst, yeah.  Yeah, the numbers are just, I mean, you know,  and just keeps on spending and spending and spending.  One of these days, not to get too deep into this,  we do that on the podcast.  We get into this whole thing and my rants and my craziness,  but there is just way too much money  going everywhere but here.  It's, I don't know where they're coming up with it  and if you just say, oh, well, they print it,  but you know, that's the whole point of our dollar.  Why are dollars in such bad shape?  It's that we've spent recklessly  and you know, these bailing out these companies.  I mean, you know, talk about GM.  Oh, GM and you know, they're having problems.  Oh, don't worry, GM can't go bad.  They'll be bailed out.  I mean, when's it end?  When's it end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Moving along, I don't wanna get too much into politics  because all of our geeks hate that when we do.  Big story in the business week, very interesting story.  Insiders at Facebook selling stock  at prices well below the valuation.  People were once claiming for it.  Microsoft, when they bought that little equity stake  in October, what that made it about,  a $15 billion valuation.  They're not getting that.  What's the story there, Peter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, one of our reporters dug into this reporter  by the name of Spencer Rontay  and he found out that there are a number of people  who are selling stock, including Mark Zuckerberg.  And he names another guy, Kohler, who's also selling.  And he looks at the valuations  that they're getting for their shares  and it's not encouraging.  I think the value ranges from about three,  just under $4 billion up to $6 billion  for their stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So maybe this isn't surprising.  If it hadn't been for the $15 billion phone evaluation,  would that be so very bad, three or four billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a very good question.  Oh, it certainly wouldn't be that bad.  I mean, they'd be very proud if they could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fantastic given their revenue.  Yeah, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a few Teslars.  Yeah, what's the P to E on that?  I mean, that's pretty good.  It's not, yeah, it's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  300 million in revenue.  That'd be 10 times their revenue number.  Their earnings would probably be 50 million,  so that would be 60 times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  60, that's good.  So another is 15 is insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the question that we...  You raise a good question.  $15 billion, was that a phone evaluation  or not a phone evaluation?  Microsoft and Facebook put out the press release  saying that it valued the company at $15 million.  It's not like that was made up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, so it wasn't just the fact  that Microsoft bought this little bit  and that multiply at times the total amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a very important caveat here  which is preferred shares versus common shares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But is Facebook here to stay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an important distinction.  I mean, the shares that Microsoft got are preferred shares  and they have certain rights associated with them,  including liquidity rights,  so that if the company gets sold,  they get paid off first before anybody else at the company.  So that's, you know, that certainly makes them more valuable  than the common shares that people are selling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much stock are the insiders dumping?  Is it a significant amount?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, we don't have precise figures on that.  1%, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I saw somebody back into an estimate.  Usually the employee stock option pool is 15%  and so if people were selling 50 million,  100 million shares, you get back out of it  into maybe 1% or 2% of the company, maximum.  And that's basically what happens now  in C rounds and D rounds in order to keep the entrepreneurs  and the management team at the company.  Because the liquidity events are getting pushed out  and there's no public offering  and no liquidity in the stock,  they're basically saying,  in your B round, your C round will give you some money.  I mean, Kevin Rhodes, I think took a million dollars  off the table in his second round.  That's why he can buy cars and not,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  he's still running dig, right?  Right.  Facebook in response has instituted this program  where employees can sell some of their stock  and I think the upper limit on that is 20% of their shares.  So you're giving them a chance to get some money and get out.  But it's obviously controversial with the VCs.  They're not crazy about making people rich  before they get a liquidity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and according to Spencer,  there's also a requirement that they not value it,  that stock not sell at more than 3.7 billion value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's very curious  and there could be a couple of reasons for that.  One, Facebook has told the IRS  that the company is worth 3.75 billion dollars  according to their IRS calculations.  So if they have a bunch of people sell  at prices higher than that,  then they have to revalue the company,  can create tax events for certain people.  Also, it may just be to try to persuade people  not to sell their stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I still question is Facebook,  why does Facebook necessarily have to be here?  I mean, it's back to the advertising again,  that's the whole, where they get all their money  or a chunk of their money.  And do we necessarily think that Facebook has to stay forever?  I mean, I know now and it's been popular.  I can't go there.  I mean, there are the spammers  that are just constantly writing junk  and I have to go here, I have to go there.  I mean, it's just, it's kind of become  less intimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eric Capote says there's an issue too  with allowing these guys to take this money out.  He says, you gotta ask, are you facilitating people  leaving the company to start their own businesses?  Are you just giving them the seed capital to say,  okay, I'm gonna start the next Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it is controversial.  After we did the story, I got a chance to talk  to a friend of mine who does these kinds of investments  and he was saying that from their standpoint,  they hate seeing employees cash out.  One, because they haven't had the chance to cash out yet  and two, you give people a little bit of dough,  maybe they're not working quite as hard as they were before.  He said, it's one thing if they need a house,  if they need a place to put their family  or a decent salary, but they don't want them getting rich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you think Kevin took a million out of dig  in that third round?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I heard that.  I don't wanna make too much speculation,  but when they did the last round,  I think he was able to take a little off the table.  Good, I'm glad to hear that.  I heard that from multiple people.  Who knows if it's true or not, but you can ask him.  Hey, I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I probably shouldn't have said.  Given that opportunity, I'd do that.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I probably shouldn't have said that.  Sorry, Kevin.  I don't know if that is true.  I've never heard it from him.  I just heard it from two or three people around him.  But I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he can afford that sofa now that he's been wanting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Listen, it's very good.  Where are the other one?  Really good for a young entrepreneur.  There's different people in different situations.  If you haven't had your first hit  and you're sitting there like in a studio bedroom,  you're gonna wanna get out  and you're gonna wanna get some money.  And in that case, it's good for the VC  to let them take a million dollars off the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not so much that they're gonna say,  okay, I'm gonna give up,  especially if they think there's some real value  in what they're building.  But it's enough so that they don't say,  what am I doing this for?  Am I wasting my time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Enough so when they're doing the five year, six year,  seven year marathon sprint,  because you're basically sprinting the whole time,  but it's marathon and duration sprint in terms of pace.  You at least have your apartment  and if they can go south and you swing in for the fence,  at least when it ends,  you have your apartment or your house.  What if they're getting paid?  They get a salary.  They get a salary, but just let you sell a couple of shares  and it's very common for people to do this.  And yeah, it's a good idea.  When it's not a good idea is if you have somebody  who already has sold something and you're like,  they wanna sell, it's like, wait a second,  you've got money in the bank, you don't need the money.  And you wanna take another two or three million dollars  off the table, why?  I mean, you're unfaithful.  That's something to worry about.  In the business.  That's something to worry about, yeah.  A lot of VCs were upset about this Founders Fund,  which is Peter Thiel, the guy who started PayPal's company,  Founders Fund, which is,  they're specializing in this.  Their shtick to entrepreneurs is,  when we do the next round, we'll give each of the people  quarter million dollars, half million dollars  on the management team.  They take a little off the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're gonna take a little break.  When we come back, I wanna mention  an article in US Today that says,  Kids, kids today are downloading  and getting addicted to digital drugs.  Binaural music that makes them high.  Is it the new addiction?  Or is USA Today just trying to sell newspapers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where can I get some?  Andrew Horace says, I want some of that.  No, I think we should, in fact,  while I talk about this audible,  maybe you guys, you wanna go out  and download some binaural beats, some digital drugs,  get high, let me know.  Would you get back to me?  I'll be back.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Meanwhile.  Dude, dude, pass the bits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the stupidest article I have ever read.  I can't wait to talk about it.  Meanwhile, I would like to mention this show  is brought to you by the good folks at audible,  audible.com slash twit.  That's where you can go to get yourself a free book.  Oh, some audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the digital, this is the drug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the drug for Jason.  He loves these books.  What are you listening to these days, Jason?  What's your latest audible book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tell you what I'm listening to for the second time.  Good to Great, because I gave it to my team.  That's a good book.  It is the best business,  I think it's the best business book I've ever written.  I bought a couple copies of this for people, audible.  You can burn CDs, it's very nice.  Hand them to your people.  Hey, listen, I bought like three copies.  This is something you can do for your business today.  People go on retreats,  they spend thousands of dollars and stuff like that.  Or people go have a dinner with their company,  thousands of dollars, and it's gone once you spend it.  Here, you go buy yourself five copies  of a great business book on audio.  You hand it to people.  You say, put it in your car and listen to it.  Put it on your computer right now and listen to it.  This is something that I think all companies should do.  I'm actually thinking about creating a little audible  sort of budget for my management team.  Let them spend a hundred bucks a year on some business books.  That's a great idea,  because there's a lot of business material on there.  It's just great.  It's a really great thing to do,  and audible makes it simple and easy.  Does he read it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who's reading Good to Great?  Is he reading it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I'm listening to it again for the second time.  No, I'm just wondering who the reader is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  if it's the author.  You know, it's funny, my wife read this book.  She said, well, she's calling me Leo.  She says, honey buns.  Or she calls me Leo, depends on her mood.  You should read this.  And I read it and I was blown away.  I don't know where she found out about it, but it's great.  And then my brother-in-law,  who's a dean at a major university, he read it.  He said, this is great even for us.  It's really about how taking any organization  and making it a great organization.  The author does case studies on some of the best  organizations who've taken kind of a good business  and made it a really great business.  What is, I'm trying to remember  what the businesses are in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true, I forgot the names of the businesses in there.  But you know, it's basically the-  Is it FedEx, one of them?  I can't remember.  Yeah, basically what they did was they basically  did a study where they looked for companies that  did average, then grew much higher percentage  compared to the market and stayed up,  as opposed to people who grew and then came back down.  And they look at that and they say,  well how did this happen?  And this is how they figured it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it was a true transformation.  It wasn't just the market improved or whatever.  Yeah.  I think Jim Collins reads it.  There's so many good business books in there.  I'm gonna have to look.  Yeah, I think that's a great recommendation.  One of the great books for investors,  of course, is our own friend Andrew Horowitz,  is The Disciplined Investor.  Did you read that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I read it.  That was quite, they asked me to read it  because I had the podcast and they said,  people wanna hear your voice.  I thought, sure, I could do that.  Have you ever done- Hard work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did a children's story.  It was about three- Scrueling.  It's scrueling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's scrueling.  You saw it, it was sitting in a box  for like a week and a half and you know,  you have them constantly, do that again.  Oh, I don't wanna do that again.  Come on, do it again.  It was sounding, and it's pretty grueling.  But it came out good.  I think it's, I've gotten a lot of good commentary about it  and it's a good teaching about the world of investments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there's a couple of great books for you.  The Disciplined Investor by Andrew Horowitz  on audible.com, good to great, by Jim Collins.  Let me tell you, if you want a free book, go there.  Audible.com slash twit, not just business,  fiction, nonfiction, history.  I love your lot of history, because I love the history,  but even things like radio shows, great dramas.  It's a fantastic source of wonderful audio entertainment  and I just love it.  50,000 titles, audible.com slash twit.  You do audible ads on your Disciplined Investor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Love it, love it, yeah.  Can I, I don't know if I mentioned it before to you,  but since we started this show with the Nazi discussion,  I thought I'd bring this up.  Yeah.  Jason and Peter, did you ever read or hear IBM  and the Holocaust?  Did you ever hear that book?  I heard the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't read it about the role that they.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fascinating.  Horrible.  Fascinating, fascinating.  The thesis of the book is that, and the premise is  that without IBM, it would have never happened this level.  Few years before, with all the punch cards back then,  they were able to automate the, you know,  we always hear this used to be,  oh, how'd they know where we were?  Well, there was a census done a few years back by IBM  and they did it behind the scenes  and this whole amazing story about Watson  and how the CEO at the time of IBM  they pretty much automated the slaughter of the Jews  through the Holocaust.  A very fascinating story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's an interesting example of how technology  and totalitarianism can go hand in hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd really recommend that.  It's just an unbelievable book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's by Edwin Black.  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  You know what book I'm reading right now  which is a great book to read is A Sense of Where You Are.  Don't know that.  What's that?  It's about Bill Bradley.  Bill Bradley?  Yeah, when he was like, you know, in college at Yale.  It's just incredible.  I don't know.  I don't think it's available on Audible yet.  Yet.  There's a request for Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was at Princeton, not Yale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Princeton, right, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Excuse me, as a Yale man, I have to be,  I have to say that while we would have loved  to have Mr. Bradley on our team, in fact-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mr. Bradley's services would have been fantastic.  Had he been a Yale man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was a tiger, not a bulldog.  Let's get this straight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Made an obvious mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it go on past his college years?  Does it go to his-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm only halfway through,  but I think it's just his college years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fascinating fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I sat next to him at dinner  at an Allen and Company retreat  and got to spend time with him,  had lunch with him another time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just all I can do.  I guarantee you it doesn't  because it was published in 1965.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't even know if it's in print anymore,  but I mean, that's what they need to do  is because Audible has narrators.  When you go to Audible and you go to the left-hand column,  they have, you can browse the narrator.  So if you find a narrator who,  I mean, I know this sounds corny,  but this is when you start to get into audiobooks.  Like I love the narrator from Shadow Divers.  Was that the one we talked about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like that narrator from Shadow Divers is amazing.  You know, this is an error.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no way that came out in 65.  He was at Princeton then, I think.  This came out later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think McPhee, no, I think McPhee-  It's 41, 43.  Loaded for the New Yorker right around that time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah, it's John McPhee.  I love his stuff, by the way.  Yeah, he's fantastic.  What a great writer.  Good, thank you for the recommendation.  It's not part of an Audible commercial,  but it's just a recommendation.  I don't mind that.  I love that.  So, oh, I had a story I was gonna mention.  I forgot, what did I tease?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We were getting stoned on the computer or something.  Oh, yeah, so this is USA Today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a category of journalism,  particularly in the tech journalism.  It's kind of the scare tactic.  Your kids right now are talking to pederasts on Facebook.  Or, you know-  Cyber porn.  Yeah, did you know?  Cyber porn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you know that-  Is there a new app for the iPhone?  I think there's an iPhone app for that.  Yeah, $999.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we gotta talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll talk about that in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love to talk about it.  All right, let's talk about that.  It's called I Am Rich.  And eight people bought it.  I'm thinking, Jason, you gotta be one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I took seven of the eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm so rich, I bought it for my whole team.  Yeah, I got it for everybody.  Talk about a stupid app.  There's a couple of questions here that come to mind.  First of all, this app, it's called I Am Rich.  It's the most expensive app.  iTunes doesn't go above a thousand bucks.  It's a thousand dollar applicator, or $999, whatever.  So the guy obviously spun the dial  until it went to the very top and wouldn't go any higher.  All it does is a little ruby.  It says I Am Rich.  It's on your iPhone desktop.  You press it, a big ruby comes up.  It's got some mantra if you press information.  It says I Am Rich and I deserve it  and I'm healthy and my life is good.  I love myself.  I love my- Wonderful, wonderful.  Beautiful.  And that's it.  And the point, I guess, is if you're so rich,  you could just buy this and not think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of like the license plates vanity  where you have the number one.  And that means whatever it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like a black American Express card, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Apple has to allow these apps-  Well, that's my question.  Into the store.  How do they allow that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eight people buy it.  First of all, you gotta wonder who these nuts are.  At least two of them said I was a mistake.  Could have been the company itself, good point.  But Apple does take a third, so it costs some cost.  It's promotion.  Yeah, they're good.  So Apple approves it.  And I gotta point out that I've talked to a number  of developers who have very interesting,  there's an application, for instance,  for managing your Netflix queue and your Blockbuster queue.  This guy's been sitting on this application.  Apple will not approve it.  There's some games out there that people wanna see.  Apple will not approve it.  Apple approves this nitwit application  and then three days later pulls it.  My question is why do they approve it in the first place?  And even more importantly, if they're gonna approve it,  what right do they have to pull it?  Was it illegal?  Did it break any rules?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the question is who approved it?  And don't they just have discretion to pull off anything  that they want to because it's embarrassing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Embarrassing the Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, the voice over IP was pulled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually-  The what?  The voice over IP, wasn't there a voice over IP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and there was another,  Null River had one that allowed you to use your iPhone  as a tethered modem.  The modem, oh yeah.  Which Apple pulled for a legitimate reason,  their contract with AT&T prohibits that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What about this one, the grand dialer,  they say if you're gonna get around  and use the touch to make calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  And that's the Grand Central.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've also blocked the GPS turn by turn navigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By contract, the developers are not allowed  to do such a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, Steve Jobs actually approved of,  he approves each application from what I understand.  No.  Yeah, absolutely, it all has to be approved by Steve Jobs.  He plays each one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a real problem at Apple.  Talk about a bottleneck.  That can't be the case.  I'm told he approves the manufacturer of the t-shirts  in the Apple store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He approves, this is a true story.  When I had my magazine, Silicon Island Reporter  back in the day, we tried to get the ad agency  or whatever to, and we had other advertisers from them  to put Apple ads in.  And we kept talking to them and it's like year three  we're talking to them about Apple ads.  And they're like, listen, Jason,  I can tell you something, but it's totally off the record,  blah, blah, blah.  And the statute of limitations is up now.  Yes, you can say that.  Steve Jobs picks the magazines that Apple advertises in.  He wants it in Udnyay Reader, he wants it in Wired,  he wants it in this one.  Mother Jones.  He literally picks what magazines they put their ads in.  Crunchy Granola Review.  This was told to me by his ad agency.  I don't know if this is still the case now, but.  Of course he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This man is talking about micromanaging,  and this is both the, obviously, the strength  and the weakness of Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's a big weakness.  That's a huge weakness.  I mean, if that really is true,  then the shareholders have an absolute right  to be very upset if there is any health conditions with him.  And the fact is, if that is true these days  compared to where it was, I think that there really needs  to be some kind of chain of command movement  and a long term or a short term fix to this,  because that's just not a good thing  to have one person in charge.  We know that.  I mean, everybody knows, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I have a different approach with the,  in terms of his health.  I thought that what, who is the guy  who does fake Steve Jobs?  Dan Lyons or whatever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dan Lyons, yeah.  He stopped doing that, by the way.  He's not doing it anymore.  He's a bit of an idiot.  Yeah, is he really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know him?  Not to be personal, he's a bit of an idiot.  I mean, he's very funny.  He's very cynical.  He's like 60 years old, and he acts like all Link Bater.  You know, like, you have this like seasoned journalist  acting like, you know, Owen Thomas from Valley Way.  So it's like, he doesn't blog age appropriate.  You know, like people don't.  Act your age, Ron, act your age.  He basically like goes on this, you know,  whole jihad against Steve Jobs.  And it's like, you know what?  If you give, if you make every CEO disclose  all of their health information,  nobody's gonna wanna be CEO.  Just like nobody wants to be president of the United States.  So for all you investors out there,  you have to give some leeway to your CEOs  or else they're not gonna do the job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, there's a difference between giving leeway  to your CEO and your CEO running the company single-handedly  that everything that happens has to pass by their desk.  And there's a difference.  Well, they don't go together.  They don't go together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If your management style is micromanaging,  that's okay as long as you have results.  I'm not saying I agree with it, but if you have results  and then you as an investor know,  number one, Steve Jobs has had cancer.  That's all you need to know.  Steve Jobs is of a certain age and he's a micromanager.  If you don't like those risk factors.  Don't buy the stock.  Then don't buy the fricking stock.  And don't be a crybaby that you need to know his health  and every six months you gotta get a thing  and he's under some obligation to give it to you.  There's no obligation here.  His stock is tradable or not.  You're free to trade it or not.  And if you don't like his management style, tough sugar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tough, no, you can't say that either.  Tough, yeah, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you.  I didn't mean to say that.  But I mean, that's another thing I'm pissed off about  is all these people like this, such sense of entitlement  that Steve Jobs' personal life is everybody's business.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, it's not.  I agree with you.  It's totally not anybody's.  It's totally not anybody's business.  I'm talking about a different situation.  I'm saying that just as a suggestion  to a company that I'm a shareholder  and it'd probably be a good idea  to have a spread of the management  if he is being such incredibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have made a good case that they've got,  what is it, David Cook?  They have good people in the number two,  number three positions.  They're not, maybe it's not, you wouldn't know  because Steve's doing everything.  But presumably the board is there making it,  who knows, I don't know.  The board is probably a little bit in the captive board.  But do they have beard poppers?  No, they don't.  By the way, we want to thank beard poppers  for providing the cream puffs for today's bread.  I love beard poppers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, if you listen to an,  if Jason listens to an audible book  and eats beard poppers, I gotta tell you something.  You never move again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all over my Visa card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, really, so they have beard poppers in LA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all over my Visa card.  It's everywhere I wanted it to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's some undercard.  Hey, did they have beard poppers in LA or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do and there's a wine outside and it's delicious.  Did you get the coffee flavor, green tea?  What was the flavor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh no, he only brought chocolate and plain.  Oh, don't invite me back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They usually have a third special flavor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are fine, I'm not complaining.  This is the next Krispy Kreme.  Have you had these, Peter?  Are they only California?  No, I don't know what they are.  Beard poppers, fresh and natural cream puffs.  Basically, they come in a dozen like a donut box.  I thought you brought a donut box, Andy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think they only sell them usually in one.  I said, load them up.  Load them up.  The price is the station.  What do you think?  There's only two of us.  I didn't know.  I thought we were sharing with the audience.  I had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's how they do it.  When you go to the store, they have them made already.  It's a Japanese thing, I believe.  And they take the puff and then they have a big pump  and they put the cream in right on the spot.  So the cream, it's not like a soggy thing.  It's crunchy and delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is, it's Japanese.  They actually do have those in New York, by the way.  They have them on the Upper West Side.  I think they have one or two stores.  Yeah, they're fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I saw them.  I was staying in a hotel and I passed by.  I said, oh, I have to bring some of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad you did.  You want to listen to a little Beard Papa's?  He's saying something.  I don't know what I'm saying.  Downtown Osaka, Japan.  It started in Downtown Osaka.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everyone that lived nearby knew about it.  Everyone loved the delightful sweets  and the town was always filled with the pleasant aroma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not the best audio on the Beard Papa's website,  but they can make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they need to get the guy from Shadow Divers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It sounds like the guy recorded it in a cream puff.  But anyway, so these are from Japan.  He looks like a cream puff.  Look at him.  He looks like a cream puff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He looks like the cream puff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody loved the cream puffs.  Cream puff, cream puff good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many are you supposed to eat, actually?  We've been through 60.  How many are you supposed to eat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think there is any therapeutic dose  of the Beard Papa cream puffs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Serving size is six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But look at him.  He looks like the Gortons of lobster fishermen.  He doesn't look like a cream puff guy.  He's got a pipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's fresh and natural here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're saying they've already made the dough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're kind of sitting in.  And then they put the cream in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have a little pump.  Mm-hmm.  I think I'm going to need a little pump to get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we lost half the audience.  The other half is off to Beard Papa's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So anyway, so let's talk about this.  Kim Commando, who I admit is a competitor of mine,  she does a syndicated national radio show on technology.  But that's not what offends me about this USA Today article.  What offends me is without any evidence at all,  and she doesn't cite anything.  In fact, the only evidence she cites  is two studies that say this couldn't possibly be true,  says that kids today are downloading digital beats  that are designed to get you high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She says it's a gateway drug.  Well, I think her audience is a, she's got a totally,  she has a totally different audience than you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the point is she does.  She has the audience of normal people  who are going to be terrified.  Anybody who listens to us is going to go.  Not normal?  No, they're going to go, come on.  You're insane.  But what I'm afraid of is there's a bunch of little old ladies  who are going to read this and say, oh no,  the internet is distributing drugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, those are the people on AOL  that probably listen to her anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I get that on AOL?  Is this music, is the album named Dark Side of the Moon  by any chance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I seem to remember it from my childhood,  listening to Dark Side of the Moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the theory?  So the theory is that you're going to download  whatever this is and you're going to get in some,  what is it, maybe you get in a trance or you're,  there is some kind of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me read you from the Wikipedia article.  As we know, the Wikipedia-  That has to be right.  Bastion of all knowledge.  You don't yet have a Mahalo page or I'd read from that.  I wonder if your pop is in there.  Binaural beats or binaural tones  are auditory processing artifacts or apparent sounds,  the perception of which arises in the brain  independent of physical stimuli.  This effect was discovered in 1839  by Heinrich Wilhelm Dove or Dove.  So apparently they're of interest to neurophysiologists  investigating hearing, but also they may influence  the brains through the, this is so-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is like licking frogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is, no, it's not, that's something.  This is made up.  This is nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to play some.  Hold on, let me get, hang on a second.  Let me get my sunglasses.  Can I play some?  It can affect an entire audience.  Do you think there will be a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It dose us, dose us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will there be a liability?  Kim, come on, I'm going to play some binaural beats  because I'm a pusher.  Let me see if I can find them here.  Jason, if I start saying dude, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If I start saying dude, take me away, pull me away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is from healingbeats.com.  Ladies and gentlemen, listen now.  At your peril, you may get high when you hear,  we're very low.  I guess, oh, it's not music.  It was subliminal.  Well, it is.  Can you hear it?  It's very low.

Coming right at you now.  So we play the binaural beats on Twitter.  Do you think we'll get sued  by somebody who's parent, some parent who says my kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hear something.  I can identify something.  You hear that?  Dvorak.org slash blog.  Do you hear that?  Do you hear that?

Transcript:  It's just like a,  does make me want to eat some cream puffs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a fifth dimension beyond that  which is known to man.  There's a dimension of vast space and timeless.  That's infinity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where it goes Heinrich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In night and shadow.  Inside superstition it lies.  Between the pit of man's fears  and the summit of his knowledge.  This is the dimension of imagination.  It is in this area which we call the twilight zone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't believe you know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Twitter zone.  How do you know that?  I'm reading it from the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  from the Wikipedia page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm very impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, enough of the binaural beats.  Does anybody feel high?  I got nothing.  Nothing.  I got a headache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, brain tonic's working us on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, have some brain tonic.  That's a lot.  That stuff works.  Brain tonic and you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't want that brain tonic right on your head?  Just pour it right on your head.

Transcript:  Where do they get the design of this body?  You think it's anything to do with the Red Bull?  I mean, it's kind of, that's.  No, no, no, it's no,  there's no caffeine.

Apple engineers say,  this is from the unofficial Apple web blog,  which by the way.  I started.  You started.  It is one of the web blogs,  Inc's companies have been told not to post anymore.  On Monday, a group of,  maybe there's a certain affinity.  Maybe that's why they're publishing this story.  Apple engineers,  a group of Apple technical staffers filed suit against Apple  on Monday, alleging the company denied them over time  and meal compensation required by California law.  The suit also claims many Apple employees are subjected  to working conditions that are similar  to indentured servitude.  The lead plaintiff was an Apple network engineer  from 1995 to 2007 says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was often required to work more than 40 hours a week,  miss meals,  had spent evenings and weekends on call  without any overtime pay or meal compensation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The horror.  Over 40 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's indentured servitude.  Really?  I think they need to understand  what indentured servitude means.  That's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, get a rip.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, how many shares do they get?  And that's Steve fella.  That's rude.  Where's the indentured part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I'm trying to figure out.  Maybe they thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If people do this over and over again,  what's gonna happen is,  they're just gonna move all the jobs overseas  and they're just gonna put everybody  as independent contractors.  Yeah.  Oh, whoops.  That already happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, oh, too late.  Too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yes, I am an indentured servant and I like it.  That's correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would be glad to do that for you.  Just look at the pharmaceutical industry,  it's pathetic.  Over in India.  Oh really?  That's everything's moved on?  For generics, you can't even make any money  in that business anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder if Steve Jobs,  oh no, Steve didn't have anything to do with this.  Apple pulled the phone saber from the iTunes store.  What do you mean the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They pulled it.  The lightsab?  What, you're talking about the,  I have that and I'll fight you anytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, get your phone saber out.  Oh, where's mine?  Oh, it's gone.  I put it, they can't, they don't, they can't.  No, they can't take it.  No, but apparently Lucas complained.  THQ.  Wah.  Wah.  This is a show about people, wah people.  This is definitely a whiners kind of fiesta.  So THQ what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not gonna buy any more Star Wars material  because I have a lightsaber on my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, that's really gonna put them out of business.  That was the first one that I would show people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, look at this.  And they're like, what is it?  I don't know, but it's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's a company that apparently has the license  to do all mobile phone Star Wars stuff.  And they didn't do it.  So, but apparently unlike Hasbro,  which didn't make a deal with Scrabulous,  these guys are gonna make a deal with the phone saber guys  and make a really good,  a really good Star Wars branded phone saber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that was Steve who approved that too.  I mean, obviously.  Obviously.  You gotta really get him to get, you need that list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a question.  If George Lucas can stop the lightsaber on the iPhone,  why couldn't he stop Jar Jar Binks  from being in the first?  Jar Jar Binks.  Meesa.  I love that guy.  Meesa Yusa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He has a really good vocabulary on that guy.  He needs work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Meesa gonna be famous and rich?  Meesa iPhone.  I bought the best phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was bad too.  That was bad too.  So Apple apparently, according to CNN,  Apple does have a kill switch on the iPhone.  Did you see this?  Apparently they have the technical ability  to kill any app if it should, you know,  I don't know what.  Wait, you mean go drown?  If it should become sentient and try to rule the world.  I don't know what it is.  But they have a kill switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Come on.  You know, that's just too, you know, I don't believe it.  Let me give you a back to the war.  That's bogus.  That's bogus.  These guys are scaring at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They watch the Terminator one too many times  and they think they like,  these the engineers and they want to work 35 hours a week  to go to France.  So here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  And the Tesla's not coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, by the way, when are you getting your Tesla?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks like September.  They delivered four last week, Larry and Sergey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's theirs.  What jalopy are you driving now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right now I'm pushing the Corvette C6  and Mercedes GL550.  At the same time?  Yeah, and I got a Mini Cooper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When do you drive?  Do you drive the Mini Cooper to Beard Poppa's?  Is that what that's for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, when I was broke, I bought the Mini Cooper.  I like the Mini.  So you get, when you go to drive,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  when you go to drive-throughs and stuff,  you don't want to drive the Mercedes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's great for the great dog car, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't want to bring the Merc to In-N-Out.  So you drive the Cooper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I like the Cooper.  Jonathan Zdziarski, who is an independent iPhone developer,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  discovered a URL while poking around  in the iPhone 2 software that downloads a list  of malicious applications every once in a while  to the iPhone.  And apparently the idea being that,  there's nothing on this list right now.  The idea being, if there were anything,  the iPhone would go to this site,  see it, and kill it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that, the ones in the background,  it all happens.  Apparently the iPhone checks this website  every once in a while.  Which is probably why the battery is so horrible on it.  Maybe it's constantly checking that site.  Hey, let me ask something about the same situation.  You know, I was thinking, you know,  I was at a conference this week,  and everybody's giving out these little USB key chain things.  Yeah, they're cheap.  Yeah, but what's interesting about that,  they used to give it out to you,  you didn't have a little storage thing,  you had a name on it.  Now they say, plug it in, it'll take you to a website.  I'm thinking, what a great tool.  It is.  What a great tool to whack somebody's computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it is.  There, we talk about, you should listen to security now,  we talk about this all the time.  This uses that U3 technology that auto launches stuff.  And there are hacker toolkits that go on these things.  You know, here's what you do, if you're a hacker,  you go to a public terminal, maybe a library or whatever.  You plug the USB key into the terminal,  it checks to see if the hacking software's been installed.  If it hasn't, it installs it, and you walk away.  Takes 15, 20 seconds.  Next time you come back, that software's been logging  all the keystrokes on that machine.  You go back, it does the same check, it says,  oh, it's here, download the keystrokes.  And you walk away.  It's a great way to, oh, it's very dangerous technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think it's pretty innocent,  people don't really know when they get to freebie.  Oh, I get a free, I get a free, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People are, doesn't that ring any alarm bells for anybody?  No.  and I'm just gonna plug it in  and let it run into anything it wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they think it's free, who's paying for it?  It's like the 800 number, who pays for it?  It's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have we learned anything from Sony?  Lenovo's quarterly sales, very strong.  10.5% increase in their first quarter fiscal,  first quarter revenues.  Overseas, not gonna stand.  Overseas, why is overseas sales  doing better than US sales?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because you get just a two-for-one sale with a dollar.  I mean, it's a big.  But Lenovo's a Chinese company.  Nah, but it's all, it all flows through IBM.  You know, all through that whole, that whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sales up in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 26%.  Asian Pacific sales up 11%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  America's, nah, down.  It's the same report that has been  for every single company, every company.  Apple too, except no, Apple was vice versa.

You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What would you do with the other,  is that so you could have long lunches?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're basically supposed to just get up from your desk,  and you're like, oh, well, my company is competing  on this global scale, and we all wanna get rich,  but we can only work 35 hours a week.  It'd be like telling Michael Jordan,  you can take 100 shots in practice a week, but that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, and by the way, I'm not coming in in August.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But how do you go back to work after having drinks  in a siesta for four hours in the afternoon?  I can barely have water in the middle of the day  and survive the rest of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know it's aggressive wine, you have a meat day.  It's fine, you take a nap, you'll be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's okay, I'll come in for a few hours.  We'll wrap this up, there's no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Harris Ranch, you plug it in Harris Ranch,  have a nice steak.  How long does it take to charge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It depends, if you're on the 220 volt,  which is like a dryer plug,  I think it takes like six hours.  If you're on a regular thing,  it might take like 20 hours on a regular plug.  And that's just to top it off.
