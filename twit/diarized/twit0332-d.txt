Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  SOPA, PIPA and Mega Upload. Sounds like the three dwarfs. The Stop Online Piracy  the House version of PIPA which is the Senate version of SOPA. SOPA is was been  marked up on Friday and interesting because normally the Congress would have  adjourned by now and all be home for the holidays but for reasons as not I have  to think is pressure from the music industry they're gonna stick around and  Wednesday they're gonna continue this vote on the Stop Online Piracy Act. So I  think Neelay as an attorney you probably the best equipped to tell us

Start time: 407.02
End time: 540.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what's going on with SOPA. So SOPA and PIPA which is the Protect IP Act  right now procedurally you've got it exactly right so they were the House  Judiciary Committee was meeting to bring in amendments to SOPA. Eleven hours  these guys don't these guys don't work that hard. So that you know the 11 hours  is it was fundamentally a filibuster by the opponents of SOPA right. Oh good. So  they kept on bringing up amendments and they say no they demanded to have the  entire text of the bill read aloud okay you usually waive that sort of thing you  have to do it and they basically delayed and like gave up and then the outcry in  the press and from constituents basically was so loud and vociferous that  the next day when they met again they said well we're adjourning without a  vote and we'll we'll try again as soon as possible and normally as soon as  possible in this case because of the holidays would mean next year and I  think there's such a groundswell of opposition to SOPA and sort of the  concepts that represents at a technical level that I'm pretty sure Lamar Smith  the representative from Texas who wrote the bill and chairs the committee and  chairs committee he knows he can't wait that long so I think he's he's trying to  do it again and I think he's just gonna run into another filibuster I don't I  don't think you know any other representatives who spoke out against  SOPA are gonna like get fooled by this maneuver I think they're gonna ask to  have it read again introduced another 70 amendments to it in an effort to slow  it down now I will say this about SOPA SOPA is a bad solution to a real problem  and what I what I worry about and I am writing a piece this week about it what  I worry about is that the bet we've spent so much time sort of as the  internet community focused on the bad solution right and the bad solution is  we'll screw with DNS right we'll screw with what Google puts on its search  results all which are bad I think everybody agrees that these are bad  solutions but we've sent so much time focused in being outraged by the bad  solution that we haven't spent any time thinking about a good solution for a  real problem and so what SOPA SOPA basically is a response to the fact that  the internet by design does not respect the existence of the United States right  it's a political entity with laws it doesn't that's the internet is not any

Start time: 1041.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is great and I and I would love it if we could come up with a solution but I just  think because I think to me it's a priori impossible but let's see what

Start time: 1066.16
End time: 1240.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Andy has to say really all I wanted to say is I think I agree with Neil a  nearly a hundred percent only in the sense that our opposition to the  opposition to this is very very important because this is a far far too  overreaching sort of legislation it gives far too big a club into the hands  of a private company interest as opposed to allowing the freedom of the  internet to have its own say and have its own response to those kind of acts  while we are we should not delay and not reserve ourselves and trying to get this  thing get this for at this thing becoming law let's not forget the fact  that this is a real problem of a distribution of illegal content on the  internet I'm in the business right now of trying to fit in 2012 I really want  to do a lot of self publishing and over the past year I've been looking at so  many different solutions for do I publish under DRM do I just let people  download a free and open EPUB and there's no solution to the problem that  doesn't end with me saying I have to be okay with the idea excuse me not I don't  have to be okay with the idea that a lot of my stuff is going to be pirated but I  have to accept that the price of securing my content to prevent that from  happening is higher than the benefit of locking it down right I do think that I  do think that we I think that if we really had had a focus and a commitment  to solving this problem I think we could find a way to serve the needs of both  copyright holders and don't think of just of Universal Music think of guys  like me think of I think of a friend of mine who works for a literally a  three-person animation company that you probably know I wouldn't mention this  person's name just in case they wouldn't like their name we mentioned but this is  an animator whose name is pretty well known who does all the animation himself  and one big part of my friend's job is going on to YouTube going out to all the  file size to look for copies of his shorts impossible right whack well no no  no it doesn't work well because the two points there is that there are mechanisms  in place by YouTube where he can say that okay here's a copy of our seven  minute short that was not posted by us could you please take this down and they  have the legal wherewithal to make that happen that's why it's an important law  and the reason why it's important it's not because this little three-man  animation studio is trying to preserve its billions of dollars for the profits  but because that DVD that they sell with these five or six really popular shorts  on it that's how they fund their next movie they operate on a shoestring and  if that 15% or 20% of their annual budget were to go away they wouldn't be  able to make those movies anymore so Neely I'm with you in this I'm with you  that we have to while we are mobilizing against this legislation not forget that  it's a bad sucky thing that it's so easy to pirate content and there's it's so  hard to adequately defend yourself against that sort of stuff if you are  the creator of that stuff and you just want some have not even just get the  get the money off of it but at least maintain some control of how it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  torn but the one thing I know for sure is that the idea that Congress is making  decisions about this stuff is terrifying to me because the more you  know about a topic the less confident you are that those guys you know know  enough about it to solve it and particularly with something involving  technology I just don't feel that the people that legislative body know enough  to know the implications of what they're doing and they don't seem to care actually  exactly right it's worse than that they're not seeking and you know they  don't know they don't want to know I do feel I do believe in intellectual  property I believe that if you create something it's okay for you to have some  control over at and in fact it should be legal for you to make stupid decisions  about things you own if you want to hold it back even if that's self-destructive  maybe it's okay but I do just come back to the fact that nobody seems to have a  solution that's actually gonna work yeah it's like it's like the store where you

Transcript:  here's my my big copyright law rethink right and I think the fundamental  problem with copyright law is that is the exact thing that you keep talking  about it's that once you turn it into bits you can copy it as much as you want  right and that's stupid right we copy it off fundamentally regulates copies it's  right in the name it regulates the act of copies because before bits making  copies was hard so rate limited how you could make copies and you could find  the people who are making the copies because they had equipment to do it and  you could say well you have a copy machine we're taking it away from you  everybody has a copy machine now a perfect copy machine and so we can't  regulate copies anymore that's foolish it doesn't it doesn't even it doesn't  make sense to any teenager you ask right hitting command D on your computer is  by law that is stupid what we need to regulate is access to content because  that's the real thing we're talking about and if you if you look at it the  market has already started to understand how to regulate access to content and  you hate DRM and I hate DRM but there are massively successful DRM systems in  place right now that people love wait a minute love Netflix right they love  Netflix wait there is no DRM that works period

Transcript:  people are complaining about Netflix is not DRM Netflix is streaming but if you  want to see any movie on Netflix you can go to BitTorrent today and download it  how does Netflix work people pay for it they call well now see I think you're  conflating two ideas that means I don't that doesn't mean Netflix is good DRM it  means that people are willing to pay for content and that's my point of view is  there I want you to show to me who's losing money because of piracy piracy  provides copies of people who wouldn't buy them anyway there are plenty of us  in fact I'd submit all of us who are willing to pay for content we're not

Start time: 1588.18
End time: 1657.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stupid we understand how content doesn't happen change okay I'll let you talk I'm  sorry you're asking how I would change copyright and I would say the market is  providing examples of ways people pay for content and what they they don't  want to pay for copies I don't think people think about copies anymore I don't  that doesn't make any sense even people who buy things from iTunes right they  don't know that it's a copy and it's regulated and what they can do with it  has been regulated unless they pay for iTunes match and they gain an additional  set of rights about what they can do with their copy that is bonkers right  that is that is a legal fiction that no longer applies what people want to pay  for is access to content so they pay for Netflix they don't complain that Netflix  is wrapped in DRM to the hill they pay for Spotify they don't complain and not  Spotify music is wrapped in DRM to the hill why because they're just paying for  access to content and that's what we should really be talking about we should  be really talking about well I can pay Andy's friend who makes the movies for  access to his DVD and then I have the right to just go and get it from  wherever I want I bought the LP well then I can I can rip it to a CD and and  I can download the mp3 from a torrent site that makes sense to people that's  the common sense I think there's a reason one of the reasons there's from

Start time: 1657.76
End time: 1687.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the copy one of the reasons there's a lot of piracy is because for a long time  the companies that created this content did not make it available digitally so  people who wanted it digitally went and got it it's true it's point of access so  my my position is Netflix is not DRM I choose not I know it's DRM but it's not  about the DRM it's not about iTunes DRM it's about point of access it's about  that it's easy and I could press a button and get it but the DRM but that's

Transcript:  absolutely right and that's DRM is about preventing copying and and then  copyright law is about preventing copying and you and I are agreement on  that this is what I was saying is that now we've gotten to the point where the  technology means copying is trivial and no matter what you do to prevent copying  it will be circumvented because it's easy right so we can't we can't think  that way we can't regulate copying because it's not gonna that's that that  horses left the barn so how do we regulate access well I'm saying I think

Transcript:  being who connects so my submission would be that maybe people who create  content need to start becoming real people they need to start treating their  audience as a community they need to say look you know this works the problem is  you can't take the old business model and shoehorn it into the internet world I  agree with you right so what we need to do is instead of thinking of ways to  force people to accept the old way of doing things which is what all of this  is about we need to start recognizing the world's changed and a person like  Jonathan Colton or Louis CK or twit we can all do just fine if we start  acknowledging our users not as thieves because that's what all DRM assumes is  you're a thief so I'm just gonna make sure I lock this down because you will  steal it if I don't instead of treating our consumers that way we say your  community we're peers we're sharing you support us we support you what the hell's  wrong with that that sounds utopian sounds like a good world let's not

Transcript:  he is okay so this is so this is now currently up yes YouTube decided that it  should go back up so UMG took it down and then there was an appeal UMG's it's  kind of weird because we thought it was a DMC takedown and then at one point  UMG's lawyers said oh no we have a side agreement yep we have a side agreement  with YouTube that says we could take anything down we want because the  dispute is do you in fact own the rights to this now I understand this and that's  a legitimate dispute this is where it starts to irk me a little bit and I'm  sure you too Neelai Tom Merritt and tech news today our news show a daily news  show as we have just done covered the story and played a clip UMG pulled tech  news today down just for reporting on the controversy now we've had this  problem time and time again almost every time I play a clip whatever show I play  the clip on gets pulled off YouTube we appeal it sometimes it gets back up  sometimes not actually let me ask you Neelai our our defense and I know it's  a good defense is that we're it's we're using it for commentary it's a news show  it's fair use but that's a defense right it's not I don't understand what

Start time: 2865.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so do you want the the law school explanation yeah so I'll do it I'll try  to be fast okay section 108 17 U.S.C. 106 says here are the exclusive rights that  you own as a copyright owner and you know listen off and and then 17 U.S.C.  107 says here are the limitations on your rights right and then the  limitations include news commentary and news reporting and commentary so I don't

Start time: 2921.06
End time: 2961.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and then so it's a legitimate defense and a judge would say yeah you're fine  yep the issue is it still gets pulled down and on a news show the appeal  process takes ten days so in ten days a new show is worthless it's fish rap it's  worthless tomorrow and constantly this happens on YouTube in fact I'm really  actively considering just not using YouTube ever again well but I can't  because it cost me thousands of dollars when they pull this stuff down now it's  an opportunity cost it's not money I would lose you know if I want if not on  YouTube I'm gonna lose it anyway but but I just it's annoying to me that they can  do this and there's no way to stop them apparently so well so the deeper so the

End time: 3001.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  deeper stuff is crazy here and the real the real mechanics of what happened are  sort of insane right so it's kind of crazy because we think of YouTube as  being part of the web and being open and free and it's there and it's not  basic right but it's not YouTube is run by Google which is a huge company that  has lawyers and it's and they want music videos and stuff from Universal on  YouTube so they make deals right they make deals about what you and I probably  think of is just part of the web is a free thing that exists and one of those  deals was Universal has access to YouTube CMS so they acted they acted  outside the law right they said well we're just taking it down and you mean

Start time: 3111.74
End time: 3122.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  entered for point I was really good I don't like it what I like it my biggest  complaint there's some things are great the camera is great the new calendar app  the new Gmail app there's a lot of the apps are fantastic but I don't like the  soft buttons I think it's really a bad user interface model to have things jump  around move around be unpredictable they've moved the search button up to  the top I like to have it always available at all times it is not it is  only if you have a special Google ad at the top of your screen which I don't  like you know I always take off that Google search widget but now that's the  only way you get the search button is by having that Google search widget and and  that's on top every page it eats up some real estate these buttons are no  longer hard buttons that they used to be at the bottom and admittedly the  carriers screwed it up by moving them around all the time but having four  buttons back home menu and search whatever the order is great these  there's no longer search button there's no longer a menu button this button  which shows you recently opened apps is a ugly and useless so the home button in  the back button you know where's the menu button show me the menu button there

Start time: 3578.10
End time: 3614.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hated the menu button and what yes I mean well how could you hate a menu  button in principle it's a good idea but the problem is that it makes  application designers lazy because they tended to stuff stuff in there you  really never knew what would be stuffed in the menu button it varied from  application to application and the fact that iOS doesn't give you that forced  developers to create better interfaces where you could find stuff and also the  back button does not behave the same way in every application I really feel that  if Google could start all over again and do a UI with no buttons we'd be better  off really they didn't do that and I like the back button I think the back

Transcript:  great as a it works great as a recently used application launcher I think that  putting up putting icons on the desktop is not as useful as simply maintaining a  list of things you've recently launched I do like that if that were available if  that were checkbox on the iPhone I would definitely be using it but I think I do  think that the ice cream sandwich is an improvement but it reminds me that  Android is like the Remington house where it doesn't look like they there is  a couple of people who sat down and figured out what this phone should do  and how it should behave it's just room after room after room where one  experience is gonna be different from the other a text input that works okay  in one app works completely wrong on the other app a button that you think you  know what it's gonna do when you push it in the on the on the home board doesn't  work correctly when you go into the browser you still got that problem where  every phone that does not run Android has this liquid response to your touch  this still has the sort of thing where you touch and then it thinks for a  moment about what you want to do and then it activates whatever thing the

Transcript:  smell order drive now while iOS itself is consistent I do have to say that one  of the things that's always bugged me about all apps iPhone apps are just as  bad if not worse is that every UI is different in every app you have to  learn every app I pick up you've got to figure out how to use it again because  there's kind of no standard about how the apps work so there is that feeling  to iPhone too I think iPhone fanatics kind of ignore that but that's really a

Transcript:  problem I don't think that's a universal problem because I think that there there's  holistic elements of the Android interface that no matter what app you use  and no matter how you're navigating from one app to another you still have to  deal with this top-level Android I also think that the community of iOS  developers is a little bit more thoughtful in how they lay out an app  and how they present those features to the user then the Android community

Transcript:  way more thoughtful it's like Mercedes-Benz dealers did you by the way did  anybody see the did you see that Motorola and I think Sony both put up  these lengthy explanations of why they want to buy a scream sandwich anytime  soon really and part of it was we need to spend a lot of time modifying the  user interface and that made me so sad because their phones would be so much  better if they didn't modify the user interface yeah just gave you raw ice  cream sandwich and my favorite Android phones are the ones that have the Google

Transcript:  logo on the back where they didn't mess they mess with it as little as possible  actually I'm sorry no I think there are two two ways to do Android correctly  one is just so simply say accept every decision that Google make don't try to  clutter it don't add crap where don't add any sort of layer on top of it the  other answer is to say we're gonna throw out everything they did we're gonna  build a brand new interface that's more unified more pretty and a little bit  more focused on the task at hand than what Android as it is originally  conceived can do for you when you do anything in the middle especially when  you have something like moto blur the like oh honey it's isn't adorable we're  gonna put this interface you create it on the fridge we're so proud of it oh  that's lovely and then you go back to using the plain ice cream sandwich
