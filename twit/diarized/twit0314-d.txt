We've had live panels every week and every time I keep saying  this is the best show and then the next one is the better.  It's just been great.  Just seeing people in person, I think, makes such a big difference.  So what is it about August?  There's something.  So first of all, the 30th anniversary on Friday of the IBM PC.  The week before was the 20th anniversary of the first public worldwide web pages.  Next week is the anniversary, ninth anniversary of IE of Internet Explorer.  And there's another anniversary this this month.  I can't remember what it is, but this is like, is this when is it?  It seems like August is usually the silly season, the slow season for news.  But maybe that's oh, Linux.  20th anniversary of Linux is this week.

Start time: 312.66
End time: 320.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 336.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Traditionally, August is like the slow time for news.

Start time: 336.88
End time: 344.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But actually, news is huge.  It's not anniversaries, but there's tons of news.  This I was just astonished how much news we've had in the past.  Tech news. Absolutely. Yeah.

Start time: 345.30
End time: 367.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's crazy. There you go. There you go.  Let's talk about some of these things.  It's the 16th anniversary of Internet Explorer, not the ninth.  Although Internet Explorer really wasn't significant in the first few versions  as opposed to now.  Now it's so important.  Well, actually, OK, it's on the other side of its success, basically.

Start time: 367.66
End time: 388.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I also remember people in the office at Windows.  It's funny, we were talking about Windows sources.  I've talked more about Windows sources in the last two hours.  Classic Davis magazine.  OK, but it was but people were like, laughs Internet Explorer.  Ha ha ha. And like three years later, Internet Explorer hits version three point  oh destroys what was that company?  How much was it valued out? Yeah.  And it was it was three point oh and really changed.

Start time: 388.62
End time: 400.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they did destroy it intentionally.  It was a beautiful thing.  It was one of the greatest business moves in history.  They gave away I.E.  Yeah. Netscape was a paid product.  Let's give away. He will cut off their air supply.  And they did. Yeah.

Start time: 400.48
End time: 436.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the one way of looking at it is that  Netscape killed itself.  I don't think Internet Explorer killed it.  They had the lead position and they could have done the free Internet Explorer.  They could have they could have done free free Netscape, free Netscape.  Yeah. And they could have done, you know, a lighter, cleaner, easier to use product.  And they didn't do it.  And they went out and did all sorts of other crazy things.  I was there. Yeah. That company was a disaster.  Is there a lesson for Firefox for the Mozilla organization?  We're seeing a repeat. Same thing's happening.  Well, it's different. I mean, they were just a different logic.

Start time: 436.76
End time: 455.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were at the top of the companies in Silicon Valley.  You know, Mark Andreessen and Jim Barksdale.  I also come in for the Wall Street Journal.  And it was just a very heady time for them.  And I think the combination of the attack from Microsoft  and their own inability to focus their business was both.  It didn't help that Microsoft was coming in with a completely free product.

Start time: 456.04
End time: 467.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could they could have theoretically done a free product,  but they didn't have the genes for it.  I mean, they just raised all this money. Right.  And they were trying to show that they could be a new software company  and make money selling the product.

Start time: 467.66
End time: 469.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not a lot of software was given away. No, no.

Start time: 469.56
End time: 481.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was exactly it was a totally different era.  And there wasn't the business model that there is now with Firefox.  I mean, Firefox is free, but they make it up on the back end with the Google deal.  Right. That didn't exist. Right.  So how would they have survived otherwise?

Start time: 481.84
End time: 496.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, they were going into the servers, mail servers, all those kind of things.  They had all the other products with the enterprise related products.  You know, I think managing people's Internet access at that time  was a big deal for companies. Right.

Start time: 496.38
End time: 505.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they lacked the vision that if we control the Internet,  Microsoft had this vision.  If you control he who controls the Internet, he controls the spice. Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. Makes the money.

Start time: 505.86
End time: 523.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, you know, Microsoft hasn't held up on the Explorer, too.  I mean, so it's just it's good to have all this competition in the browser business for one.  And technically, AOL killed the Netscape browser.  I mean, they bought it later and then didn't do much with it.  I mean, the intervening years when Chrome jumped up, all kinds of things,  so they certainly could have stayed in the game. They just didn't.

Start time: 523.94
End time: 536.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a little modern irony because Microsoft and others accuse Google  of doing the same thing with Android, of giving away Android for the same reason.  Undercut iPhone and Windows Phone and BlackBerry and Nokia.

Start time: 536.82
End time: 538.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are some metaphors. Yes, there are.

Start time: 538.56
End time: 543.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it works. It's working to an extent.  To an extent. Is it reprehensible? Is it bad for consumers?

Start time: 543.04
End time: 545.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've got some issues around patent issues, though.  So it's not the same thing.

Start time: 546.68
End time: 552.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But is that why that attacks going on?  Because that's the only way that they can they can stop this Google giveaway.

Start time: 552.76
End time: 559.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it is it bad for consumers?  There you can get a smartphone for like 90 bucks.  Now, here's the theory about it. It's great for consumers.

Start time: 559.52
End time: 563.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the theory about it.  You give it away until you dominate and then you stick it to them.

Start time: 564.20
End time: 565.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then somebody else comes along and gives away.

Start time: 566.16
End time: 567.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, are we talking about AT&T or Android?

Start time: 569.20
End time: 571.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's the idea. AT&T has never given us anything.

Start time: 571.90
End time: 577.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You. Yeah. You know, this is a family podcast.  I can't really speak clearly about it.  That's not quite true.

Start time: 577.76
End time: 591.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  AT&T funded Bell Labs, which gave us the chip and thousands and thousands.  That's a very good point.  Let's not go there.  They that's a company which does a lot of stupid things.  But back in the day, they also were responsible.

Start time: 591.30
End time: 595.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I believe there were like three or four divestitures between Bell Labs  and AT&T Wireless as we know it today.

Start time: 596.50
End time: 601.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just because they have the name AT&T doesn't mean they're really that AT&T.  It's a different company.

Start time: 602.24
End time: 626.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But these Android patents are very serious.  They're very serious.  They're not just to get Android.  They are. They seriously have borrowed.  I'm going to say it nicely until they get correctly sued.  But they borrowed some patents that they don't have rights to.  Google has. Google has.  And that's why they tried to buy the Nortel patents.  And that's why they're, you know, that ridiculous diatribe from David Drummond  a couple of weeks ago, I guess it was two weeks ago,  where he just sort of whined about Apple and.

Start time: 628.55
End time: 638.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  The one where he said that they're trying to stifle us by buying out the patents  because they can't compete with us for real.  And then all of a sudden, I'm afraid.  Don't worry.

Start time: 638.90
End time: 642.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, all of a sudden, then Microsoft released emails where they were trying to.

Start time: 642.56
End time: 681.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where they're like, do you want to bid with us on these patents?  And yeah, Microsoft's like, hey, you should talk to some of the other council  inside of your building since obviously.  Yeah, obviously.  But it's been interesting watching like the blogosphere reactions, columnist  reactions, where it's polarizing to watch the argument back and forth  with whether or not Google is doing all of the things that Google claims to despise  with Android. And I think it's interesting.  It's like, is Google sitting here basically like, OK,  instead of spending four billion dollars buying the patents,  maybe we'll spend four billion dollars on lawyers and try to figure out  and and and lobbying in Washington to try to see if we can crack patent law as we know it.

Start time: 681.58
End time: 686.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This patent issue is going to be a big deal.  And it's somewhat stifling to innovation.  All of it.  If you if you can.

Start time: 686.42
End time: 710.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, I've tried to explain to my staff, you see that wardrobe over Kara's shoulder.  If you just close that door, it's driving me crazy.  Yeah, you can. You can.  It's in Kara's single.  And it just drives me crazy.  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt everybody.  But like the Felix Unger.  I've been trying to signal, you know,  just turn off that light. That's it.  Thank you very much.  That's a pure talent.  This is his pretty new studio.

Start time: 710.76
End time: 712.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We must have a show the wardrobe.

Start time: 713.74
End time: 715.29

Transcript:  All right. Thank you.  I'm sorry. Go ahead.

Start time: 716.52
End time: 718.74

Transcript:  We were stifling competition and ruining technology.

Start time: 718.98
End time: 723.55

Transcript:  How much of the lawsuits are not just about Android, but about Linux  somewhat?

Start time: 724.18
End time: 727.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Linux is protected a lot better than Android.  Microsoft indemnifies.

Start time: 727.80
End time: 753.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microsoft indemnifies its customers against Linux lawsuits.  And and the message from Microsoft, which is involved heavily in these Android lawsuits,  the message from Microsoft about Linux is, well, you can use you could.  If you're a Microsoft customer, go ahead.  Don't worry. We'll take care of it.  But everybody else, you could get sued like crazy if you use Linux.  I have a feeling it's not just Android.  And even if there are problems with Android, it's all about Linux, too, isn't it?

Start time: 753.96
End time: 762.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the entire thing is going to be, I think,  one of the most important stories around these patents.  And I think a lot of including myself don't have as much patent law background.

Start time: 762.66
End time: 780.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nailay Patel has been very good job.  He's an attorney by training.  Yeah. He writes, of course, for This is My Next Dotcom.  And he's done a number of articles about software patents.  He it's funny, I would think that of all people, he'd be the one saying,  abandon them entirely.  No, I don't think he does. But he doesn't.  No, he's trying to fix the system.

Start time: 780.82
End time: 787.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it fixable? Well, we had them years ago.  We had Nathan Mirabold who had started that company that was buying a patent.  Intellectual ventures.

Start time: 787.50
End time: 791.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, he's he's a patent role.  We have to say now. Yes. Yes. Yes.

Start time: 791.28
End time: 802.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what they he he denied it, of course.  And it went back and forth.  But it's a it's a very interesting time for these things.  And there should be a way to protect your intellectual property  and at the same time, not stifle use it to stifle innovation of others.

Start time: 802.62
End time: 813.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's a. That's the question is, how do you protect it?  Do you need patents to protect it? Right.  Or is there or trademarks and copyrights sufficient?  Or do you not need it for software? Because it's not it's not hardware.

Start time: 813.38
End time: 849.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's not just software also.  I mean, you look at it, it seems like, you know, you look at Disney's  trying to protect the mouse.  So Disney completely destroys public domain in their efforts to protect the mouse.  And then realize that, oh, the lawyers like, you know, we should have just  trademarked it because we can sit on trademarks forever.  So we're going to trademark all of our characters and then we can protect them  legally. And by the way, we're really sorry about public domain.  Actually, they're not. They don't care.  They forgot about it as soon as they stopped.  They don't care in the least defense. Right.  But it's a result. You end up.  It's a mess. You know, are patents important?  I think so. People should be rewarded for innovating.  People should be rewarded for pushing.  I just don't think patents are the solution for software.

Start time: 849.14
End time: 850.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there must be other ways. Why not?

Start time: 850.98
End time: 864.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if I if I invent a method for something,  whether it's to make cotton or to run a spreadsheet, what technique?  What philosophically is the difference?  I mean, yes, the legal system with patents right now is a disaster.

Start time: 864.40
End time: 875.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. But perhaps there's a way if you, for instance,  the problem is, of course, that people are patenting all sorts of kind of  generic processes, methods and method for patenting.

Start time: 875.50
End time: 909.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, they're you know, when you were they never implement it, they just patent it.  Or they patent things that don't exist yet, or they patent things that have existed for years.  For example, sort algorithms. Right.  And nobody bothered to patent because it was commonly taught in universities for 30 years.  And so you end up with this and you partially it's like, hey,  what if we actually funded the patent office and funded the patent office  to the point where they could hire experts that could actually decide on something?  I don't want to slag on the patent office because, you know, they're in a hard position.  But it's like, you know, maybe if we maybe if we actually paid attention  and did things the right way the first time, we wouldn't end up with gigantic messes  that get settled out over years in the courts.

Transcript:  I think we could do something similar to what the open source has done is  essentially companies create a pool of patents and a not for profit group  running a pool of patents and people companies like Google spending money,  buying patents, submitting it and then giving it to this open source foundation  and essentially using that as a way to circumvent all the problems.  So if you're a member of this open source, open patent foundation,  you kind of get around it. Right.  So you can you can use that as a lever  because these are the patterns which are more commonly available,  easily available. More people tend to adapt them.  More products are based on them. That is one way to fight it.  I guess, you know, I don't know how the rules are going to change,  but how about creating a new model of using the patent?  I think that's more achievable.

Thomas Jefferson, who was the first head of the patent office,  besides being our third president, 1790, he argued against patents,  once calling them embarrassments to the public.  He worried that abuse of frivolous patents is likely to cause more inconvenience  than is to countervail by those really useful.  In other words, it's been a problem since 1790.

Transcript:  Kill all the lawyers and then move on.  Linux 20th anniversary, IE we talked about.  Let's talk about the PC in just a second.  30th anniversary on Friday, August 11th, 1981,  the IBM PC shipped 1500 bucks for the first PC, about seven thousand dollars in modern money.  And you didn't get much for 1500 bucks. We'll talk about that.  And for those of you old enough, your memories of 1981.  But first, I want to talk a little bit about our friends at GoToMeeting.  We've come a long way since 1981.  GoToMeeting is, of course, the great online meeting service that we've used here at Twit  for practically every meeting for the last five years.  They've added a new feature that is mind boggling.  I just love it. They call it HD Faces.  And you've got to try it to see.  It's you still having these online meetings where you can share your screen,  but now you can have as many as six video feeds,  high quality, crystal clear, really good quality right there in with the screen sharing.  It transforms your online meetings because, as you know, seeing somebody's facial expression,  seeing what they're thinking, their raised eyebrow, their curled lip, this is a value in a meeting.  If you're pitching a client to be able to see their body language while you're pitching for them to be able to make  connection with you and see your face worth so much.  And now GoToMeeting has this incredible HD Faces technology.  Good news. You can try it free for the next 30 days.  You can really see what I'm talking about for Mac or PC.  Here's what you do. You go to GoToMeeting.com, G-O-T-O, meeting.com.  Click the Try It Free button. Use the offer code TWIT.  You'll try it for 30 days free.  Throw a meeting. Just enjoy yourself.  You know, call a client, call a colleague, say, hey, we've got to try this.  I want you to see me. Call mom.  GoToMeeting.com and then use the offer code TWIT to try it free for 30 days.  It's really fantastic.  Even if we're not going to use the faces or the screen sharing, whenever we have a meeting with colleagues or vendors or whatever,  we just say we'll start it with GoToMeeting. It's very easy.  You click the button, sends out the email invitation, gives them a conference bridge that they can call or a VoIP line or the video line.  And it just couldn't be simpler. I just love it.  GoToMeeting.com, offer code TWIT.  1981, you remember when the... Are you old enough to remember the IBM?  Yes.  PC. Wasn't the first computer.  No.  I got a great note from a guy who was the editor of Interface World at the time and was invited to Boca Raton,  along with a lot of other press, to see the PC when it first was ready to ship.

And he said one of the things that irritated the journalists at the time is IBM's co-option of the word personal computer.  Because it wasn't the first. There was Apple's, there were Altares, there were Atari's.  PC versus Mac is ridiculous. I mean, they're all PC.  Exactly, yeah.  And yet, 30 years later, a PC still means a Windows computer running on an IBM computer.

Start time: 1302.20
End time: 1314.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually couldn't use those. I have to use the mushy keyboards because on the radio you can hear...  Exactly.  It's like, can you stop this geezer show?  So Tom Fox, who was at the time the technical editor of InterfaceAge,  he said there were three things that surprised the editors when they went to see this PC in  Boca Raton. One was that they took the word PC. The other was an unease with IBM's choice of  system software. Surely they weren't going to single source with that vendor. We're talking...  Microsoft.  Microsoft. PC DOS 1.25.

Start time: 1513.98
End time: 1539.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they didn't single source. There were three operating systems available.  You could get DR DOS, couldn't you?  PC DOS was the only one that was $40. CPM, I think was...  Did you get Xenics?  I don't know. But the...  They're still going home.  CPM was like $240. But this was key. IBM's decision to not build everything itself  and to go to Microsoft and to Intel and to Epson for components was a watershed in the way that  computer hardware was...

Start time: 1540.06
End time: 1561.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's what Fox said really was the number one thing was astonishment at this idea of an open  system documenting the bus design. They didn't open BIOS, but they made it simple enough that  it could be reverse engineered. And it was less than a year later that Compaq came out with the  first PC compatible. So that was a huge shift for IBM. I remember they're the ones who sold...  Are you bored home? Are you going to play...

He was flying his plane.  So they didn't buy DOS from him. They went up to this little company in Seattle, Microsoft.  They said, do you have a PC operating system, an 8088 operating system we could use?  And Bill Gates, famously, even though they didn't sit...  Yeah, and we got one of them. Call me tomorrow.

And what was interesting is a couple of weeks ago, you hear all the tech neradi talk about  Google+, and it's exhausting to listen to them talk about it.  I was with someone who was not a non-tech person.  And one of the things they said really struck me is that on Facebook, I've kind of messed it up.  I have too many people. I didn't organize it right.  And now I know how to use social networks. So Facebook taught them how to use social networks.  This is a chance for a reset.  Reset. They want a reset and they don't want to reset on...  They don't think they can reset Facebook because they've already claimed their name there.  And so it was an interesting...  That's an interesting point of view.  I thought it was from someone who wasn't Robert Scoble.

I mean, by the time Google Plus, if it works according to plan,  which I believe it will, is going to become a giant, pervasive social network.

They don't have to.  What's the end game?  This is their Internet Explorer.  Their Internet Explorer. Exactly.  Larry woke up and said, just like Bill Gates woke up years ago with that Internet,  his jihad many years ago, and Larry woke up and said, social is this.  And that's what they've shifted.  And so the question is, do they really need to make money or is it—  to me, it's all part of the phone, search phone ecosystem they're trying to build  beyond the web, PC.

Transcript:  Well, they want you to use their calendar and their mail and their phone together  with their Google+.  And actually, if you look at it, the Google+, mobile app is terrific,  comparatively to the— the service is a little wonky and a little bit kludgy,  but the mobile app is terrific.  Really? You think so?  Oh, yeah.  I think it feels very limited.  Oh, I like it. I think it's really clean.

Transcript:  It is telling that they released Google+, both on the web and mobile,  simultaneously.  Very quickly.  I mean, people are saying that, you know, whatever the trends are,  the number one trend is— what do they say?  Mobile social local.  Right.  One trend.  Google has that.  Yes. Google owns that now.

Start time: 1981.28
End time: 2002.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think the other interesting aspect is that Google is trying to unify all its products  and create a unified experience.  Right.  Whereas Facebook, on the other hand, is trying to do  disaggregated experience of Facebook services.  With Facebook Connect and personalization.  Facebook Messenger.  They're coming out with the Facebook photo app soon.

Start time: 2002.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they have two apps on the iPhone now.  They have a Messenger and a Facebook.  Facebook.  Now they're going to have a photo app.  A photo app.  And I think you—  What's the point of that?

Start time: 2009.52
End time: 2040.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I think what's happening is that this one size fit all social network at some point  becomes too much.  Such a thing.  So you need to have focused applications for the mobile device to have a focus.  I think that's pretty interesting to see how they go about doing it.  I do feel that Google's going to stumble a little bit on Google Plus for a bit  before they get it right.  I do want them to get it right because there's three players in the market is always a good thing.

Transcript:  Who are the smart people here?  I'm just curious.  We've got a very smart panel.  You must have thought about this.  This really is going to come down to who makes the right moves in this chess game.  Actually, is it Mark Zuckerberg?  Is it Larry Page?  Is it Steve Jobs?  Is it whoever runs Twitter this week?

Start time: 2056.04
End time: 2080.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the only thing is Mark Zuckerberg has this many 750 or 800 million people on that thing.  We'll see how Google Plus emerges.  It's only 20 million people.  It's wrong.  It's very exciting.  It's only 20 million in a month.  True, but people know how to use social networks.  I mean, Mark Zuckerberg came from almost nowhere to be using these things.  I want to see what happens to the next 100 million for them or the next to get to 100 million  I don't know if they will.

Transcript:  Here's the thing.  I just was in Asia.  Walt and I went to Asia because we were doing an Asia conference.  And we were in Korea and Japan.  None of them, not Facebook, not Google+, are popular in either country.  The local solutions there are the popular ones.  In Korea, they have Naver.  They have all kinds of things that are local.  Brazil is Orkut.  That's a Google property.  But actually, other local things are growing there.  In Japan, Mixi remains the most popular service.  I think Facebook has 4 million people using it.  It's a very small amount of market.

Start time: 2124.54
End time: 2125.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 2126.08
End time: 2133.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is, but maybe they're not using Facebook and Google+.  As well, maybe they're using their local solutions.  It's a very complicated thing where you're trying to get into big numbers.

Start time: 2145.82
End time: 2155.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or those countries will do fine.  Those local solutions like a Mixi in Japan will do better.  So it's not inevitable that Facebook and Google are going to march around the world  taking over social networking.  I just...

Transcript:  Is it possible that Facebook will follow...  Are social networks disposable if they get unwieldy enough?  Can Facebook possibly follow MySpace into obscurity?

Start time: 2164.35
End time: 2179.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's possible.  I mean, we've seen it before with MySpace and Friendster that the cool kids will abandon  a social network when it becomes slow or bogs down or there's...  And part of that is the perception that it's not cool anymore.  I think Facebook has crossed that barrier.

Start time: 2179.58
End time: 2234.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're incorrect in assuming that Facebook is a social network.  What is it?  It is actually a communications company.  It is the new mobile.  I think people are not...  They're focusing on the wrong things on their company.  We focus on the front page of that company, of that service.  Whereas what really is, is their business is connecting people and finding ways to  figure out what is the things we like or things we share or things we do.  And build basically advertising solutions based on it.  I think Facebook Messenger is a good example of them trying to be  a communications company.  And they have 750 million people are the identity now is Facebook.  Look at like you can't log into any app now without using Facebook Connect.  I mean, they're just becoming pervasive in a very strange sort of a way.

Transcript:  So speaking of mobile, what do you think of their relationship with Skype?  How important is that?

Start time: 2238.32
End time: 2275.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty, you know, it's a pretty close relationship.  Their relationship with Microsoft, Skype is part of the whole, you know,  it's their version of the web, right?  Which is they are controlling it as a communication channel.  I think that's what scares Google more than anything else.  It's not how many friends you have that scares Google.  It's if you are communicating through the Facebook communication system,  you don't quite need Google in that environment.  Because you're going to suck in all the time away from Google into this,  you know, that threesome.  Facebook dialed to is dialed to what?

Start time: 2276.20
End time: 2304.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if Facebook, for example, just putting this out,  what if Microsoft handed Bing over to Facebook?  That would be it.  No, it could be.  And they use search on Facebook using Bing.  There could be lots of things that Facebook could do to get into.  The two of them are moving so closely into each other's businesses  that it's a question of whether there's two kinds of search,  regular search and people search and Facebook owns people search  and Google owns regular search.  So question is how we begin to search in the future.  I wonder how many people use Docs.com.

Transcript:  That was the Microsoft web based office that was tied into Facebook.  You don't hear a lot about that with the launch of Office 365.  But that's another example of Microsoft's tight integration with Facebook.

Start time: 2318.98
End time: 2330.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, exactly.  I mean, that's an interesting pairing.  Even though people like to crap all over Microsoft all the time,  it's still an incredibly powerful company with a lot of assets  that they could bring to bear help in this alliance with Facebook.

Start time: 2330.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, they're doing some relevant things.  I mean, they connect is terrific.  The phone is not that bad.  It's not the worst.  It's just not.  Well, and they've done the same thing with the phone

Start time: 2341.34
End time: 2349.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that they're doing with Facebook.  They've joined with Nokia.  Again, attempting to keep relevant by partnering.  And the other thing is they have tons of money.  I did not go there yet.

Start time: 2350.14
End time: 2399.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I do think because mobile 7 with Facebook is as powerful as Google.  Twitter and iOS.  Yeah. And it's the same kind of relationship.  I think it's still like, you know, you look at the Facebook video powered by Skype.  There's going to be some interesting stuff happening there.  I think Facebook is completely thinking differently about the web.  They are years ahead of everybody else, in my opinion, on social.  And there's one thing you cannot forget that Google's social efforts  are run by two guys who can leave any time.  Right. I mean, not that they will.  Vick and Bradley Horowitz.  Because they work for the company.  They're not the founders.  They're not Larry and Sergey.  Mark is just there.  Like he's not going anywhere.  And just like Jack is back at Twitter, he's not going anywhere.

Start time: 2400.02
End time: 2404.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So to get back to my original question, these guys are what powers it is, his brains.

Start time: 2405.64
End time: 2440.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, the Twitter DNA and Facebook DNA is all social.  They have had few years to think ahead of Google.  Google has great people.  You know, I think Bradley is one of the smartest people at Google right now.  And like, but Larry and Sergey, I don't think they're convinced  entirely on the whole social thing.  There is a lot of lip service there.  I still don't buy into it.  You don't go from, you know, one day, you know, you're not really a social person.  And like 12 months later, you're a very socially aware company.  It's like Microsoft and the internet.  It's just so app.  That's such an app parallel.

Start time: 2440.28
End time: 2472.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think almost talking about a bigger idea is that these focused founder based companies,  of which most of tech companies are still today when we're only 20 years into it,  really, the web itself and these founder based companies,  jobs at Apple, Mark at Facebook, Jeff Bezos at Amazon and Larry and Sergey at Google.  It's a very powerful thing if Mark's just focused on one thing and they're focused on,  I don't know, what aren't they focused on at Google?  Right.  Self-driving cars?  Cars, you know, although that's cool.  I don't make fun of that car.  I'm not making fun of their car.  But they do have a lot of interests.  Yeah.

Start time: 2472.68
End time: 2476.16

Transcript:  I mean, they've got a lot of a lot of irons and they're interested people.

Start time: 2476.16
End time: 2489.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's why they're like that.  But they mostly search is what their business is still.  And so the question is, can you really if one company is completely dedicated to one thing  and another company has dedicated to several things, it's who wins there?  It's just it's an interesting question if they can.

Start time: 2490.14
End time: 2498.52

Transcript:  And is it important that the founder, that the visionary, the original guy, I think so.  Obsession is really helpful when you make that's what happens.  Is that what happened with Microsoft with Bill Gates left?

Start time: 2498.94
End time: 2519.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think a little bit.  Steve Ballmer is no Bill Gates.  He was an early founder.  He really was a founder in a lot of ways.  And they certainly have an interconnection that was important.  But he doesn't have that vision.  He's a sales guy.  He's not the tech leader, which tech leaders are really important.  And that's why you see trouble at certain companies and not trouble at others.  It's not just tech.  They take the Starbucks.  Starbucks.

Transcript:  That's not true.  Like I started my business in a Starbucks.  So I owe them a lot.  But coffee is not that great.  But there is there's a thing you have to have an obsession.  You have a long term vision.  You build big companies.  You have a near term vision.  You're going to build some tiny little company.  Jeff Bezos didn't start this company today.  He started it 16 years ago and he's still not even done.  He's still like tablets.  Why are they thinking about tablets?  So they have this big founders, big winners, big idea guys have this grand vision of the future.  They want to rearrange the web and the world according to how they see it.  Those are the people who build big companies.  And I think that's the difference.

Now I don't know about you but if you spend a lot of time commuting as I did for many years  there's nothing like audiobooks and audible.com.  Literally I think saved my life.  I would have driven off the road years ago if I hadn't had engaging audio entertainment  in the days before podcasts from audible.com.  I want you to try audible.com.  I think it's just the best way to spend time when you can't hold a book reading.  I think reading of course is still very important.  It's how you learn things and it was always made me sad that I just  didn't have the time or the inclination to read.  Audible brought it back into my life.  In fact I've been an audible member since 2000.  I have over 500 books in my audio library on audible.com.  I can listen to them on my iPhone, my iPod, my Android phone.  If you haven't tried the iPhone or Android app by the way, great apps.  Audible is such a great resource for anybody who's at the gym, doing housework, driving the car.  You can always listen and get reading done.  I still get a couple hours of reading done every single day thanks to audible.  Try it right now.  What we're going to do is we're going to set it up so you can get two books free.  So you really get a sense of whether audible is the thing for you.  If you go to audible.com slash twit two right now, you'll be signing up for the platinum account.  That's the subscription that I use.  It's two books a month and the first month is free so you can get two books.  You can cancel it anytime, pay nothing.  I don't know where to start.  This was a great book that is now being made into a major motion picture.  I don't know how it's going to be as a motion picture but boy, if you like baseball,  moneyball was an amazing story.  The story of how Billy Bean was able to…  Oakland A's is the team you're trying not to name.  Yeah.  The good team in the Bay Area.  I'm a Giants fan.  I'm sorry.  But Billy Bean made the A's what they were by avoiding conventional wisdom,  using stats to find players that nobody else wanted and yet make an amazing team.  The art of winning an unfair game.  You know what's interesting since this book came out a few years ago?  Every major league baseball team now uses these moneyball techniques.  I can't wait to see the movie.  It's the lean startup ideology.  It is.  Actually, it is.  It's the lean startup ideology.  Another movie coming out very soon.  I like to listen to the book before I see the movie because it makes the movie come  to life in my head and it doesn't spoil the movie.  It just enhances it whereas seeing the movie first often does spoil the book.  I've got to be honest.  This is a great book.  Really good dramatization by the way.  Some of the audio books on Audible are not just somebody reading a book but they actually act  the book out.  They dramatize it.  This is probably the best example.  The Help by Catherine Stockett.  A great movie out right now and a really, really good book.  I can go on and on but I'll tell you what.  Why don't you try it?  Go to audible.com.  Browse around.  There are 85,000 books.  Pick two.  Then go to audible.com slash twit two and they're yours free.  I know you're going to love Audible.  Audible.com slash twit.  I'm kind of tempted to read David Mamet's book.  He went from being...  He kind of went crazy.  I don't know what happened to David Mamet but he's become this crypto-fascist.  His new book is The Secret Knowledge on the Dismantling of American Culture.  It's like an Andrew Keene style book I guess.  Anyway, I love to listen to this stuff too.  You know, you got to hear from all sides.  Audible.com slash twit two.  Give it a try.  This was a story and maybe you guys, because you're all in San Francisco,  have more to say about it than I do but I was kind of shocked by this story.  A few...  I guess it's now been a couple of years ago.  Bart police shot somebody and it was very, very controversial.  He was a 45-year-old guy.  Basically, he was lying down at the request of the police and they just came up and they shot him.  And there may well be more to the story.  The police officer was acquitted.  It was a controversial shooting.  But it was very controversial.  Saturday, there was going to be a protest on Bart during the busy evening commute.  Actually, I guess it wasn't Saturday.  It was Friday.  Or no, sorry, I'm sorry, Thursday.  This past Thursday.  Bart made a very interesting choice.  They shut down cell service in the Bart tunnels.

Transcript:  Now, we should put this into context for everybody who doesn't live in the Bay Area.  Bart is Bay Area rapid transit.  It serves a huge area of northern California.  It's not just a city subway system.  Muni is the equivalent of the New York City subway system.  Except, unlike the New York City subway system, Muni doesn't actually run very well.  A lot of it's above ground.

Transcript:  The thing that's so fascinating about this is that  arguably this isn't illegal.  It's just really bad.  It's just a colossally stupid idea.  They own those wires.  Although it's a public agency.  I mean, the cell companies put the wires in under contract or something.  I'm sure...  I mean, Bart made the decision to turn them off.  And they took responsibility for it in their own statement.  They said, you know, we said this is a public safety issue  because Bart isn't a place for demonstrations.  Like I said, legally they might be in the clear, but man, it's a bad precedent.  And where do you draw the line?

Transcript:  I think the issue is that they did come out and say they were doing it.  So instead of being caught doing it, which was one thing, which was interesting,  but in hopes that people would understand.  And so they always pull out this idea that we have to save people.  We're saving regular people against the fascists.  And it just starts to get into this...  It does appeal to people.  It's why we have all these things around 9-11, which is coming up.  There's going to be a lot of anniversary discussion  about this issue of safety versus freedom.  And I think in this case, it was like...  Do you ever see that movie with Tom Cruise?  They pre-arrested people.  Yeah, pre-crime.  Pre-crime. It's sort of like...  Well, it's prior restraint.  It's censorship.

And it's like, dude, you grew up in LA in the 70s when you could see the air.  I grew up in New Jersey.  I might be a little afraid of the water back in Lyndon,  but I couldn't see the air.  And so the idea that the people's Republic of California,  the guy that runs the BART police made a stupid decision,  the chief of the BART police.  And for example...

I'd be a horrible police officer.  I understand that.  But the guy made a decision that I just don't think was very American.  I also think Congress made a horrible decision in passing the Patriot Act.  When you have an act that's so ugly,  the ACLU and the NRA are working together to stop it.  You know, this is probably...  Think about that.  Both the ACLU and the NRA were both like the Patriot Act is a horrible idea,  but it's the Patriot Act.  So I have to pass it because we're going to protect the people.  And it's...

If he thought, well, this is going to be a real problem  because we're in tunnels down here, we're in trains, it's a closed environment.  We don't know how violent these people are.  Maybe he got information that there were planned violence.  So close BART.  Close BART or put more police officers there?  Right.  Put more police officers.  Because it can't possibly be the cell phone.  The ability to make a cell phone call is going to be the determining  fact on the success or the demonstration, right?

I don't use the product anymore.  I used to.  First of all, I think the service is behind the time, if I may be honest here.  Because it's just an insurance play.  It's just backup.  It doesn't do any of the cool stuff that Dropbox or Sugar Synchrony or these things do.  It's just backup.  And Apple's going to eat their lunch.  iCloud, Dropbox, Google Docs, Mesh, Carbonite.  SkyDrone.  I don't see it.  Okay.  Plus, their S1 is kind of a mess.  This company has never made money, ever.  They're running out of money.  They needed to go public.  Oh, that's bad.

About 11 days ago, that it was going to be in October.  The iPhone 5 launch was going to be coming.  And then we got caught in the, is it an announcement or a launch?  Is it a launcher announcement?  Is it jobs there or not?  And then it was stupid.  I made a stupid remark to Arnold Kim, who's a very nice guy.  Because I had gotten...

I don't know if they're going to pre-announce it.  They might pre-announce it.  They've done it before.  They could... The actual launch event of the...  There's a little out for you.  So they could announce it on September 7th.  We believe that everything is going to happen in October.  And if it happens in September, we were wrong or they changed it, one or the other.  And that's fine.  We'll say we're wrong.  What are we talking about?  Apple.  The thing is this stuff goes...  It's fascinating that one company gets so much attention about just an event day.  I know.

Start time: 4473.46
End time: 4479.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 4480.57
End time: 4488.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, but it's relevant because there's a lot of people who are trying to decide,  well, should I hang out with this old iPhone?  I think most people will hang out no matter what.

Start time: 4488.44
End time: 4513.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what's interesting about it is that...  I think there's a lot of stock speculation around this stock too.  So it's... You know, you never know where anything is coming from.  And anyone who's covering, including us,  have to be super careful about what we're saying about it.  And, you know, what's most important is what is in the iPhone 5?  What's it going to be?  What's in the iCloud that's supposedly coming?  Which we believe is also coming.  How's that going to...  The products are what matter and we should focus on the products and not on...

Start time: 4583.54
End time: 4636.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, on the FCC website.  Whoops.  In which they basically said, for instance,  while the deal to acquire T-Mobile is going to cost $39 billion...  And one of the pros of this deal was that,  well, we're going to bring LTE, fourth generation wireless networks,  to 97% of America by this $39 billion deal.  It pointed out in this letter that the cost of bringing that coverage to 97% of America,  if they were just to do it themselves, would be $3.8 billion.  One-tenth the cost.  So there goes that excuse.  They're spending a lot of money to do something they could have done for one-tenth the cost.  There's a lot of overlap.  They talk about the overlap between T-Mobile and AT&T's infrastructure.  There's not really two companies joined together.  It's they're acquiring the customers.  They're acquiring...

Start time: 4637.56
End time: 4655.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, what I think they're trying to do is make sure that there is no remaining company  that provides excellent customer service in the mobile market.  And once you've eliminated actual real-world evidence of thoughtful,  considered customer service, they can go on and continue to drive what little customer service  may offer into the ground.  That's my theory.

That's not cool.  That's not cool.  So is that what they did?  Did they reveal this?  I just saw the hack site.  I don't know what they stole.  Begin a black fax and email bomb action where it would fill every inbox and fax machine at BART.
