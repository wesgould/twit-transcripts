And friends, I'm just going to sit back and bathe in the brilliance of our panel this week.  It's fitting because this is our 11th anniversary episode.  The first twit, which at the time was called the revenge of the screensavers,  was broadcast or released to the wild.  We didn't stream it live. We didn't do video. We only did audio.  We only did 25 minutes on April 17th, 2005 with Patrick Norton and Robert Heron and Kevin Rose,  my old friends from a tech TV. And that's how we began 11 years ago on this day.  And fast forward and it's been a wonderful ride.  There it is. In fact, it's still online. If you want to go to twit.tv slash.  What is it? Slash twit slash one. You can hear the first episode.  Now I had to bleep out the word screensavers because shortly after I recorded that,  I got a letter, cease and desist letter from G4 Tech TV, which had bought the show and bought the network.  Oh, for goodness sake.  Saying you can't use that name. So we couldn't call it the revenge of the screensavers.  I asked our audience to come up with a name. They came up with this week in geek was my favorite.  And I thought, what if it were this week in tech that we could call ourselves twits,  which seemed like a good idea at the time.  We had a competition for the logo and a wonderful logo from Lori LeBeau Walsh that we're still using.  So it was. And at the time we distributed it via BitTorrent because I didn't have any bandwidth.  And that was the only way we could get out.

Now, you all in the in the other you've been waiting to get this cake.  I said you couldn't have the cake till we started the show.  You may now come and take your cake.  And Ian wants a piece and Ben, I'll send you one.  You'll get it sometime next year.  Nice stale piece of birthday cake.  There you go. Ladies and gentlemen, where's Waldo?

Transcript:  Good. And congratulations.  I'm honored to be here on the anniversary.  I think 11 years ago, I remember listening to you pretty early.  I don't know if I listened to that episode per se, but 2005 or so.  That sounds long time. Yeah, I was working on.  I remember the project I was working on and this idea of I could listen to podcasts at the same time.  Were you Nokia then? Where were you?  No, I was in I was I was in Taipei.  I was building out a a computer based teaching system for for English schools.  That's cool. Yeah.  I mean, I started out a an itinerant world wonder before I actually realized you worked at Apple.

Ian Thompson, thank you for being here. We appreciate it. Always fun.  I know I could start we hit we before the show.  We started talking about Tesla and actually what we'll do is we'll take that conversation and we'll go to it right now.  Because I thought it was a very interesting conversation about the you did a good piece a couple of weeks or maybe last week about the rollout of the Model 3.  Ben says Tesla is really a real car company now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 396.01
End time: 399.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't understand it. And that's probably what is that?

Start time: 399.06
End time: 411.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's that's that's that's the real question.  I think I think that my broader point was that there's something very powerful that they've built here from a branding perspective.  And it could only have been done over the high end. They were very smart.

Start time: 412.00
End time: 423.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They play and you know what? They played it very guts early because you know that he bootstrapped the whole thing and it really wasn't viable until he showed that.  He could sell him in mass quantities. Well, it's not clear that it's viable.

Start time: 423.34
End time: 526.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's still the that's still the open question.  I mean, they're a company that's still if you if you if you they was only about Tesla is they in their financial statements, they when they calculate their gross margin, their cost of goods sold R&D is not included.  That's that which is typical for tech company usually for a tech company.  The cost of goods sold is only the actual cost of the goods in whatever the device is like an iPhone and the the R&D cost is separate.  You know, for a traditional car company, that's not the case.  Usually the the R&D cost is included in the calculation of gross margin on sort of thing.  If you calculated Tesla's financials like you would a a traditional car company, they would be they would have a neck.  They'd be losing money on every car sold and a significant amount of money.  And the problem is there's not there's not any evidence that they can manufacture this car for the price that they said they can manufacture that.  That said, to your point, I mean, if they can pull it off, like basically all they have to do is actually do what they say they're going to do.  And they are going to be very successful, much more successful than most people realized.  And and the way they came at the high end and built this powerful brand is a big part of that.  So I mean, I'm certainly it's certainly fascinating to watch.  I mean, that the it really is the new Apple, not just from a brandy perspective, but in the passion and fervor of their fans perspective, as I discovered.  Oh, yeah. Did you get in line?  I I did just kind of like, why not?  Why not? But you make the point that it's refundable thousand bucks.

Start time: 526.10
End time: 527.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not like they get to keep the money or anything.

Start time: 529.22
End time: 534.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I mean, I'm fortunate that I can afford to go without that money for who knows how long.

Start time: 535.06
End time: 538.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's kind of a nice long term loan to you.

Start time: 538.54
End time: 558.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, well, yeah, the problem is that right now you can't buy Teslas in Taiwan, which is a pain.  Although just a couple weeks ago, there's some some someone found like a company registration from Tesla, like maybe they may be going on sale soon.  The other problem is just the infrastructure here is tougher.  You everyone lives in these. That's the real issue.

Start time: 559.54
End time: 567.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kind of media. Where do you charge it? Yeah, exactly.  That's what's held back electric cars until now is that it was massively inconvenient.

Start time: 567.34
End time: 648.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think that that's changed a lot. Well, I mean, if that's part of it, for sure.  I think what I appreciate about Tesla, I appreciate the approach and the way they've built this brand is.  I. And kind of the point of the article that I wrote was the Gartel was called It's a Tesla is I'm not convinced that those three hundred thousand people or however many of registered now are really that interested in buying an electric car.  I mean, certainly that plays a part in what it means to be a Tesla and why they're excited.  But it doesn't follow that just because three hundred thousand people put a thousand dollars on a Tesla that there's a big market for the Chevy Bolt, for example.  What is so great about what what what Elon Musk has accomplished with this is he just to be not to be tried about it, but he made electric cool.  And that's something. And if you go back and read his master plan, people have talked about always paying paying a forward or paying a future cars.  There's not really that much evidence that's happened.  But what there's a line in there that talks about if we want electric to change, to take over the out of the world, we have to make it like basically says it has to be cool.  And that's what he has absolutely accomplished.  And that's what's so impressive.  And, you know, certainly, you know, more more more power to him.

Start time: 649.80
End time: 658.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think getting that many reservations probably makes it easier to go to the investors investment market and say, absolutely.

Start time: 659.97
End time: 727.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. That's the real point, really.  Right. Absolutely.  Because everything they've done has been paid for primarily by issuing stock or taking nothing but lose money from day one.  Right. And this this this makes that possible.  And, you know, certainly, you know, there's, you know, the cost of batteries is coming down.  That's that really is the controlling factor.  I mean, I think the battery bottle has cost like thirty five thousand dollars on its own, which is really a bunch of tiny batteries all wrapped together.  And there's the extent that, you know, says unless earnings call basically that with the model last they were trying to figure out how to make a car.  Whereas with the whereas with this, whereas with the Model 3, they can really like build it for manufacturing, build it for scale.  And that there's that's totally valid.  Like that makes a ton of sense.  And there's no question they'll get they'll be able to move on the cost curve much more efficiently with the Model 3 simply because they know what they're doing.  Remember the roadster, they didn't really build.  I mean, they built it, but it was that was that was that's what the drive.  Right. That's about figuring out how to build it.  Basically, my life, it's been I think this is a real case study on how to bootstrap a business.

Start time: 729.00
End time: 751.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's quite fascinating.  He's quite smart, quite gutty, too, because I'm sure the day before they they put they opened up the orders for Model 3.  He's like on tenor hooks because either I mean, here's an opportunity to go big and really go home or if it's a flop, they don't have a company.  So it could have gone either way.  And I think that it went as well as it could possibly have gone for him.

Start time: 753.58
End time: 769.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was trying to think when the last time you actually saw people queuing up outside a motor show, a car in order to actually buy a car.  And it's virtually unheard of.  I can't think of it happening with any other.  The question is, can he ramp up production quickly enough?  That's going to be absolutely key.

Start time: 770.18
End time: 796.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He has a real problem now because he has five years of orders.  Exactly. And they need to be fulfilled before people lose interest.  He has to give people in a year.  And I think that's where that's where he goes to the equity markets and says, OK, we need to take this new me plant, which could be really expanded.  I think he's only using like a fourth or fifth of the capacity and maybe build more.  And he's going to have the giga the giga battery factory goes online in time.  That's part of it, too.

Start time: 797.00
End time: 802.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's also going to need some serious supplies of lithium and various other elements just to get the whole thing up and running.

Start time: 803.00
End time: 814.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, though, this was a very well played chess game.  Like he kind of he took big chances.  It's a big gambit.  But he I think he saw the end game at the beginning and he knew where he was headed and he did a very good job.

Start time: 816.28
End time: 911.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I think the only caveat, the reason I start with this and like I said, I wrote I wrote the article I wrote was very admiring of this.  And really, he's done it different than the kind of traditional business approaches that he should or whatever.  And I think and I think it's because brand matters and make electric cool matters.  I guess the only caveat I would say is that he hasn't won yet.  Like things are looking great.  You cannot be in a better position given his strategy.  But the actual hard part and that feels stupid to say because everything they've accomplished has been so incredible and against the odds already, which is why you don't want to bet against the guy.  But if you look at it objectively, like the real hard part really is now because this is of a scale of complexity and difficulty.  And like Dave, this is they've pushed all the chips in the table now.  And and it's going to be fast.  It's going to be absolutely fascinating to watch.  Yeah. If they can deliver at the price they need to and in the quantities they need to.  The other thing that's so that's so risky about this is, and I think Ian just made the point very well, is they're risking not just the company, but the brand.  The brand is the value that they've built right now.  Absolutely.  If they don't deliver this car on time and they don't deliver it to the point they deliver to it, it takes like years, then it's going to be that much more damaging to them.  If GM screws with the bull, no one cares.  GM, they screw up everything.  Like so it's a it's a it's super high risk.  But you know, the risk goes both ways.  There's upside risk and downside risk.  And the upside risk is massive with the with the approach they've taken.

Start time: 912.58
End time: 917.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's kind of nice that they're trying to save the world, too.  It's kind of a kind of a.

Start time: 918.43
End time: 950.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does seem ridiculous.  We're still burning very valuable hydrocarbons in this day and age.  We could be using electricity, which I think also going further ahead.  Electric electric cars offer one huge advantage, which is if you can put motors on all four wheels, the performance and cornering ability of these cars just goes through the roof.  We're going to see with there's a hill climb event in California later on this year.  And their electric cars are outpacing petrol engine cars simply because they can independently control their wheels and they just go like rails through all wheel drive.

Start time: 951.16
End time: 962.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the one the X and most of the seven the S's.  But not all the the threes have two engines, one for each axle, but they don't have four engines yet.

Start time: 963.34
End time: 971.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be that would be I mean, I think originally that's going to be the the the the remit of racing cars.  But it'll come, you know, these things filter down.

Transcript:  I was thinking Bridge, but yeah, the guy strategizes so far ahead down the right down the line.  It's just smart guy.

Start time: 984.02
End time: 1055.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and the real advantage he has is is and this is the power of being, you know, mission driven is if he fails, if Tesla does not successfully make the Model 3 for the for the price, he says.  And all this sort of stuff.  What's the worst that happens?  One, he accelerated the move down the curve when it comes to batteries.  To to the kind of point of the article, he made electric cool in a way that certainly I can't like Jim was going to.  He is motivated.  The car companies to really accelerate their efforts in this space.  And if his if his goal is not just to build a successful company, but to really shift the world in a meaningful way, you know, away from from carbon based transportation.  I mean, that's that that's a nice sort of that's a nice failure option if that's your real goal.  And that's the power that really comes from being a real.  Sort of mission driven companies, you kind of get loosed a bit from the from the financial imperative, something or other.  Something or other doesn't change the fact that they still have real, very real questions they need to answer.  And I can understand why so many people start their stock and all that sort of thing.

Start time: 1056.32
End time: 1066.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you're going to short them, though, it's a long term short, I think.  I mean, I mean, at this point, they've got years.  They've got some runway. Right.

Start time: 1067.00
End time: 1069.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they don't have that much money.  I mean, they have a little over a billion dollars.

Start time: 1070.00
End time: 1072.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't they raise money on those three hundred thousand preorders?

Start time: 1073.74
End time: 1106.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. I mean, that's a huge benefit of of this.  They've really demonstrated a real sort of demand and power in the market that I think will let them raise money at a at a better rate than they would have otherwise.  I think at some point they're going to have to make that money back.  And it's still an open question. Like I said, I mean, the if the the their margins are going in the wrong direction, actually, in 2015, they went down, not up.  And that's they're not moving down the cost curve yet.

Start time: 1106.46
End time: 1124.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've in fact, you know, shown an amazing capacity to lose money and they're having technical issues with their Model X.  All of the Model X's were just recalled.  They're only a couple of thousand. They were all had to be recalled for safety issues.  They've the company itself said it. We actually showed some hubris.  We tried attempted too much and we're having difficulty making the car.

Start time: 1126.54
End time: 1129.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they would not do the Model X if they could do it all over again.

Start time: 1129.68
End time: 1138.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I want one. Right.  Don't you don't you want the car that was the biggest stretch unless it's unless it's a piece of crap.  But I don't think it's going to be great money for a full out for an pencil right now.

Start time: 1139.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's only it's 10 years ago, though, that there remember the documentary Who Killed the Electric Car?  And it showed me remember the General Motors EV1, which came out in the 90s.  And the documentary really documented, I thought very effectively how the oil industry, the the the government, the battery industry, the car industry all united to say this is a bad idea for business.  Exactly. So we're not going to let it happen.

Start time: 1171.04
End time: 1189.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it was a it was a huge mistake because I mean, given the fact that first Toyota with the Prius and now Tesla are basically eating American car companies lunch.  Where would you be today? Exactly.  If they've taken that opportunity 20 odd years ago and address this market, they could be earning big bank right now.  And as it is, the nature of competition, someone else is earning it.

Start time: 1191.22
End time: 1204.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think Elon did learn a lesson from that, that one of the things people would need is range.  They would also need a way to fill up. Yeah.  And Tesla very wisely addressed that early on with the superchargers.

Start time: 1205.38
End time: 1322.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the supercharger network is one of the most impressive things about Tesla.  And, you know, it's funny because Tesla actually says that they will share the super network, supercharger network with other cars as long as they share in the cost.  As long as it's not a Chevy Bolt.  Well, no, I won't.  But I'm very curious as to how Tesla measures that cost that the other car company has to contribute to.  I imagine that the amount is exceptionally substantial.  And it's interesting because in some respects you get a weird it's not I'm not saying Tesla will sell because of a network effect, but you get a little bit of a network effect in that the more Tesla's that are on the roads, the more supercharger stations they can afford to build out and justify building out.  And so you do get a fact where there being more Tesla's makes your Tesla more valuable.  But again, this is more of a weaker effect.  I'm not saying that's why they would or wouldn't be successful, but it is interesting that there is a little bit of that of that effect there.  And again, if Tesla's like, you know, of course, we'll be open with the supercharger network.  You just have to pay us X billion dollars because we all the R&D and all the cost that went into it.  You have to pay your fair share.  And no. And I mean, that's the real advantage they have by being electric only.  The way they think about what to invest in is very different than a company like GM or even BMW or Mercedes, where all their revenue comes from a different part of the company that already has infrastructure in place.  It's definitely an advantage. I do think just to go back to a point, GM gets a little bit of a bad rap for that electric car in that movie.  I mean, any rational manager would have done exactly what GM did, which is collect all the cars and smash them to bits because they were on the hook for the cars cost them a tremendous amount of money and continue to cost them money over time.  And they did them for for for very rational reasons, I guess what I would say.  I think they're painted as a they're painted a bit as a villain when what they did, I think was again, a sensible business move.

Start time: 1323.64
End time: 1331.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I don't think anybody I don't think anybody disagrees with that.  The question is, did their business interests coincide with our national and global interests?

Start time: 1331.54
End time: 1341.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's also an element that this was this is very like the Kodak case where, you know, they could have ruled the digital camera market and they decided to put it to one side because it was interfering with their main profit stream.  I take it.

Start time: 1343.54

Start time: 1349.00
End time: 1379.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's GM wasn't as bad as the film made them out to be, but they were pretty dunderheaded in this whole thing.  I mean, people wanted electric cars, people with their reverse, they protested and they fought to keep them.  And they still had to hand them in.  And that caused an enormous amount of bad feeling.  I mean, electric cars make sense.  I don't see what the argument is now in terms of the market has spoken.  People want these things.  Other car manufacturers are going to have to supply them as well because not everyone's going to wait.  They also bring emissions down, right?

Transcript:  I mean, there's a there's a mandate.  There's a governmental mandate.  They have to get their overall emissions of all their vehicles down significantly.  One easy, fast way to do that is with an electric vehicle.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, to that end, it was not clear that people want electric vehicles.  That was kind of the point of my article.  People, it's clear people want Teslas, which is amazing.  No, I know.  You're right.  I don't say that.  That's brand.  That's so powerful what they've built in their approach they've taken.  And to that end, GM is farther ahead than a lot of other car companies.  I didn't think I'd be on a textual defending GM, but they're ahead of a lot of other car companies when it comes to electric cars.  They have the Volt already on the road.  The Bolt is coming out later this year.  And the problem is no one's lining up to buy a Chevy Bolt.  And the truth is every single electric car in the market has sold massively under expectations, not just them, but also the leaf, also any number of other ones.  The truth is there's not evidence that they're popular to.  I mean, again, to go back to the EV1, they sold it because actually California passed a law that you had to sell an electric car.  And so it just gets to the limitations, if you will, about when it comes to sort of government mandates and stuff.  I mean, GM lost money on these cars because they were mandated to do so.  And then when the mandate went away, they got rid of them.  So they want to keep supporting them and keep losing money on them.  I mean, you could just as feasibly make an article about when government regulation doesn't work, but that doesn't fit with the world, probably the world of filmmakers in this case.

Transcript:  I think, though, I mean, again, I can't remember.  You said you're going to include that extra.  I'm not sure if it's in there, but to go back to the actual quote, the secret Tesla Motors Master Plan, which, again, I think all the focus on them somehow paying it forward and all the financial.  No, he wrote this in 2006.  Right.  So the parts that people are focusing on in this plan, none of it's actually reality.  Like the I mean, again, Tesla is paying for the Model 3 or will pay for with capital raises, not from Model S profits, because there aren't any Model S profits.  If you if you calculate it on a traditional car company accounting basis.  But he says in here, I am funding the company.  He always says, like, why do we have this as well?  Why do we have this amazing car that wants to kick everyone's ass?  This is because the overarching.  I'm quoting the piece.  This is because the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors and the reason I'm funding the company is to help expedite the move from a mine and burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric company, which I believe to be a primary nexus.  So critical to making that happen is an electric car without compromises, which is why the Tesla Roadster is designed to be the generic gasoline sports car like a Porsche or a Ferrari and a head to head showdown.  That what I think is getting is getting to with that is.  You you have to make people you have to make electric cool in the way you make it cool is by having videos of a Tesla racing a 737 down the runway.  It was came out last week, right?  I mean, it's that's cool.  It's desirable and it makes people be willing to pay one hundred thousand dollars for a car that feels like a forty thousand dollar car.  A car or a thousand dollar car on the on the interior or however much wherever it slides into.  And that it's that line that to me is is really the most remarkable thing about the approach is taken and really insightful in his kind of understanding of the market.  And people do want Tesla's remains to be seen, as I said, if they want electric.

I mean, Steve Jobs turned the iPhone, which was a quite frankly in hardware terms, a second generation well behind the pack phone and made it really, really sexy and everyone wanted it.  I do think the big worry I have with Tesla is that they've got a long term problem in that these battery packs don't last forever.  Now, paying thirty five thousand for a Tesla three is all well and good.  But if you've got to pay another ten grand in four or five years time, then is that going to turn people off?  Is that going to really damage the brand in that regard?  I'd love to see some more stats on how long these batteries will survive.

I mean, certainly not from a financial perspective and no one's saying that.  And it drives me with the wall and people email back.  I'm telling those financials actually heard Apple.  We're talking about France.  That said, I mean, the the the iPhone was was a technologically forward.  I would disagree with you.  I guess on that point.  And I think there's a lot of Apple does think about this.  They talk about stuff like the chamfered edges and they buy these these machines and all this sort of stuff and all the all the stuff they go on about about these sort of high end finishes and touches.  A lot of that is about building, building the building the brand.  And I think, you know, I will be as annoyed as anybody else by the argument that Apple, Apple's built on advertising or marketing.  But I think the reason there's there, it's also not true to say that it's just purely popular because for technical reasons, that's not true.  To have an iPhone is is to mean something.  It has status. You pull it out and you put on the table to show something, particularly in other parts in certain parts of the world.  And and I think just as much as it's silly to say that's the only reason people buy iPhones, it's also silly to say that that's not doesn't play a role.  And and absolutely that's Tesla. I think has pulled that off.  And people don't buy something without put down a thousand dollars on even knowing what something looks like without there being powerful brand and play.  They don't line up at six forty five in the morning with my friend and be one hundred twenty third in line without having seen the car without there being something really powerful at play from a brand and what it means to be a Tesla.

Transcript:  Well, we're in the club. It's a club because we suffered to get our Tesla.  That's what makes you in the club. Let us let us take a little break. We're going to have a great time today.  We'd have lots more to talk about. Ian Thompson is here. It's Thompson and Thompson, Ian Thompson from the register register.  Code UK, Ben Thompson from Stratecary.  And we are talking about high tech. I want to talk about tracker and why I will never again lose my keys.  This is a really great success story that started in crowdfunding and has now really become, I think, one of the best products I've ever used.  Tracker. These are this is a tracker. It's on my keys. It's a coin sized device that pairs to your iOS or Android phone.  It has you have a key loop, but you can also use adhesive and glue it to something.  And and what's cool is if you lose your phone, you press the button on the tracker and the phone rings, even if it's on silent.  And if you lose your keys, your phone goes, hey, your keys, it even has a map of where your keys were seen last.  But here's the thing I'm very most excited about. This is also a crowd sourced network because the tracker for battery life reasons has a one year battery rechargeable.  You just put a new lithium cell battery in there. But it doesn't have GPS, but it but it does pair with your phone, which does have GPS.  So what they've actually built is a tracker network. One point five million devices now.  That's more than anybody else out there. And if you lose something and you lose your that's your trackers attached to, it can show up on your map on a map, even if it's far, far away.  It's kind of remarkable. Scroll down a little bit and you'll see the map of trackers in the wild right now.  And this map is growing and growing and growing. And this means no matter where you lost it, by the way, not just your phone, this is small.  If you could put it on a dog or cat collar, you could put it on your laptop. I keep it in my backpack.  The tracker records its last known location on a map. And if another tracker user comes within 100 feet of your lost item, you're going to get a GPS update of where your item is.  So it says, hey, I just saw your keys. They're in San Francisco. That is amazing.  They just introduced this tracker Atlas. It works with a tracker Bravo, which is what I have here, or a third party Bluetooth tracker to pinpoint your items in a customizable floor plan of your home.  So it's one thing to know your keys are in the house. It's another thing to know they're under the sofa cushion.  You'll save time and energy just by asking tracker Atlas where your item is, and you will instantly get a location.  This is truly amazing. These guys have really figured it out.  And I kind of want to get more people to buy them because the more people who have them, the bigger the tracker network gets, the better it gets.  And, you know, I want people to buy them all over the world.  Notice Amazon Echo integration. Just ask your Echo. Hey, where's my phone?  I love this. You got to get it. Here's the deal.  Go to the tracker, T H E T R A C K R dot com.  And you're going to get 30 percent off your entire order right now if you use a promo code to it.  So get three or four. You'll find lots of places to use it.  It is a great idea and you will never lose your phone or your keys or your car or your home.  I don't think people lose their homes unless they're on wheels.

Transcript:  It is the sense of Congress that no person is above the law.  Economic growth, prosperity, security, stability and liberty require adherence to the rule of law.  So all providers of communications, services and products, including software,  must to uphold the rule of law, listen to a judicial order and in a timely manner,  respond to an authorized judicial order for information or data.  It has to be intelligible information. In other words, not encrypted  or appropriate technical assistance to obtain such information or data.  This is not prescriptive. It doesn't tell us how we should do it.  It doesn't mention back doors. It's just your requirement.  If you're Apple or Google or Microsoft or Dropbox or anybody selling stuff,  you need to have a way to unencrypted if law enforcement comes knocking on your door.  Furthermore, it also applies to third parties, so-called license distributors,  which means that Apple in its app store and Google in its now store  and Microsoft in its Windows store would be required to verify that every single app  sold in those stores also provides access. They are required under penalty of law.  So if this bill were to become law, it would be the end of encryption in the United States.  Not the end of encryption, but the end of security.

I think it's got to committee.

Start time: 2406.00
End time: 2444.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they released a draft of it, leaked out to the Hill about 10 days ago.  Then this version, which they've put in, is amended slightly,  so that the bill can only be, a court order can only be raised with a serious felony or a drugs charge,  or a whole bunch of other charges that you could probably make stick to pretty much anyone.  But it just, it's so overarching.  There's no hint of what the penalties would be.  There's no hint of how this should be done.  And then they have the nerve to say in the bill,  of course, we're not prescribing how these things should be billed,  which is exactly what the entire bill is all about.  It's frankly insulting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean, it's going to be very unlikely that this bill, as it stands, goes through.  What is worrying though is that this is a sign of the position the government is taking,  and they will carry on hammering away and hammering away,  as FBI will do with the next Apple iPhone case that needs to be decrypted.  And if this is their starting point, then we're in serious trouble,  because if something like this eventually goes through in two or five or ten years' time  after a big terrorist attack and everyone's very panicky,  then they'd say, oh well, let's give up our security just this once.  And this is the kind of thing they're trying to do.  And yeah, California, their bill couldn't even get a seconder.  In Congress, however, what is this, 60% of Congress are lawyers.  There's only about five Congress people with any direct technology experience,  and that's even if including Darrell says, you know, car alarm systems.  There are very, very few people who know anything about technology in Congress.  And with the first crypto wars, Congress ducked it.  It passed a stupid law, and it took the courts to resolve it.  Now, thankfully, the EFF and others are coming in on this.  But, you know, if something like this goes through,  the results are going to be catastrophic.  And getting us, getting security back from this is going to be a really tough job.  Any thoughts, Ben?

Transcript:  A few.  No.  So I think to go back to when this Apple FBI thing broke,  I think I was on Twitter actually that week.  And my point then was exactly this,  that the real danger with that case was not that particular phone.  And what the FBI was asking Apple to do was certainly problematic,  particularly from the government compelling Apple to weaken their own security was a problem.  But that was, I'm pretty sure I said that at the time, I certainly wrote it at the time,  that was a very small problem relative to their,  a political movement forming to weaken encryption.  And that's exactly what this is.  Fortunately, I think I would hesitate to characterize, you know,  Dianne Feinstein and Richard Burr as the government.  It's two senators in the government.

Transcript:  It's true.  But I mean, I don't think that just to go back to the 90s,  I mean, one, this was an issue and Congress did pass a law.  They passed the Kalea Act, which basically, again, it's a very complex issue.  And I am going to very oversimplify it,  but basically led to the capability of the NSA to force telecommunication carriers,  let them listen in on everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it did.  It did.  And but I mean, it didn't allow them to dictate the design of devices.  And that's arguably a core reason why the All Rights Act does not apply.  Because basically, the All Rights Act is, if nothing else in the law applies,  then apply this.  But the core argument, Apple's legal briefing and this argument under which,  in this Brooklyn case, the Apple was found to not have to unlock the phone.  In that case, is that actually clear specifically considered this question  and chose not to make them design it.  That said, it did in effect.  And I think to Ian's point earlier, in effect,  clear did force communications carriers like AT&T Verizon.  You know that secret room, right?  In the search centers, that's an outcome of Kalea.  But but clear also at the same time also did say that encryption,  it did legislate encryption and say that encryption was allowed  and that the government could not allow encryption basically,  which if you go back at the time, that was an open question.  There was the you couldn't export encryption.  You can only have it for the US, which the net effect was everyone got  the crappy encryption, 40-bit encryption in browsers,  which we're still dealing with problems today because of that.  But but I guess the good there's good bad news.  The good news is this is the this is the negative outcome.  I certainly fear from the beginning when it comes to the Apple FBI case that  because which wasn't about encryption actually was about weakening  their security measures so they could they could brute force a phone  afforded to passcode.  But the concern is that this would result in a political movement  to weaken encryption.  And that's and that's where we're are.  And the fact that just a fight that we as an industry are going to have to win.  But again, I don't know how far we're going to get by by demonizing  the opposition or calling people names.  I mean, this is this is an argument that it's on us.  It's a complicated argument.  It's one that's hard to explain.  And it's on us to explain exactly why this is so problematic  and make the case that it not only is the wrong thing to do for technological  reasons and for privacy reasons, but it's the wrong thing to do for security reasons.  That's the big deal, right?  It makes us less safe.  It does. And basically to to get into this and there was a good video by a CPG  Gray this week kind of getting a little bit into encryption.  It wasn't it didn't quite there's like one more point you could have made.  It would have made it even better.  But basically the idea is that, you know, we in the physical world were OK with  with granting the police power with a warrant to break a physical lock basically  and do that. And I think that's an important point for for advocates of encryption  to make that to acknowledge there is a legitimate need for this.  And and that's the case.  I think I think the trick, the trouble is when the government breaks a lock and  they're doing it in the in the physical world, that is one lock.  It's constrained by by by by the if you want to play an example of a golden key,  like if you want to like the TSA luggage, Roo ha ha like, you know, TSA now  luggage has to have a TSA approved lock, which has a can be unlocked by a  particular set of keys that that only the TSA has.  And then someone stupidly took a picture of it and put it on Twitter.  And now you can 3D print the key that can unlock basically all the luggage in the  world. It's a great example of the problem with golden keys that they do leak.  And when they do leak, then now everyone has accessed every single  luggage lock in the world was weakened immediately.  All at the same time, the difference is you still have to get the key and go to  every piece of luggage and unlock it one by one by one.  There's a physical constraint on what can be done with with a golden key.  The real danger with a digital golden key and this idea that there I mean, the  only way that you could build in the only way to fulfill this law.  The only way is that Apple has or or Google or WhatsApp or any service Amazon.  And this again, this applies to basically every single company that's anything over  the Internet period that every single company has to retain a key that can undo  their encryption. But the difference is when and if that key leaks and these  things do leak.  And again, you don't design for the best case, you design for the worst case.  So you presume what happens if if this key leaks, if this key leaks, not only is  every single piece of software and every service and everything that that touches,  immediately vulnerable, but it's vulnerable in a way that can be taken advantage of  immediately and at scale because that's how digital works.  Like some bad guy in some Eastern European company or Russia or China or or in the US  or wherever it may be can immediately compromise and take advantage of that  weakness in a matter of minutes.  And that's very different than having to go to every single piece of luggage in the  airport and lock them one by one.  The degree of risk is massively, massively greater.  And you put that in an equation where figure out who has the most to lose, who has the  most to keep secure.  If you did a census of every single country and every single citizen and every single  company in the world, who has the most to lose?  And if you put this in a ledger and you weigh it out and you balance it out, it comes out  that the United States has the most to lose of any single country in the world.  And instituting an environment where the you're hoping you're basically your security  rests on hoping that stuff doesn't leak or doesn't get out, which the history of  everything shows never persist and over the arc of time will get out.  That's what happens.  And that's why you design security for the worst case.  You don't design it for the best case.  So when it that happens, who will be decimated?  It will be us.  It will be the US.  And that's the argument that we need to win on, not calling them idiots, even though they  are.

I mean, I'm sure they're being told by the intelligence agencies that they are going  dark and, you know, but we seem to forget that before smartphones, we did have a pretty  good record of catching criminals.  You know, it wasn't.  What did we do before phones?  Yeah, exactly.  You know, I mean, we've had encryption now for decent encryption for decades and we're  still catching criminals.  There are still stupid people out there.  It's just it's that mindset that this will make law enforcement's life easier.  Therefore, we should do it and we should ignore the consequences.  And as you say, Ben, the consequences of this are absolutely huge.  If the government's OPM department can't keep its senior fingerprints and securities  and their experiences safe, if Microsoft can lose its source code, if Google can suffer  serious outages, you know, I mean, there is no way to keep an escrow system key safe.  And if you're going to introduce a deliberate flaw into the encryption, China, Russia, Malware  writers will do a Manhattan project to find out what that is and to exploit it.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Just to be clear, you can design a golden key that cannot be discovered.  I mean, it's a like the problem is the golden key can and will leak or can and will be discovered.  And and I think I really think a core a core issue here is I think it's hard for normal  people to to.  I mean, what do tech companies sell?  They sell them, especially take them like Apple.  They sell magic.  They sell like it's a magical device.  It's amazing what we can do with all these things we can do.  And then I think to go back to brand, I mean, they're selling this kind of amazing behavior  and look, we made we made a robot that can beat, can win it, go like can be the best  player in the world and amazing these amazing innovations, all these sorts of things.  And it to turn around and say, sorry, can't do it impossible.  Well, true.  It in many respects goes against the image that tech has been selling of itself for a  long time.  And and frankly, you know, oh, sorry, that's hard to use.  Sorry, computer crashes.  Stuff's you know, this stuff's really difficult.  Well, you know, it I think it's just hard for people to to appreciate that this really  is it's a fundamental trade off like either because the difference is the difference with  encryption, the difference with encryption is with real encryption, with proper encryption,  where every device and every person has their own individual key.  That's like I mean, in the case of an iPhone, right, it's based on the passcode is a is a  is a piece of the key that goes into unlocking that phone.  And can you can that passcode leak?  Can there be an iPhone and the passcode or the password?  Even they got super secure.  Let's say I have a you know, there's a Nexus, say I have like an 18 digit passcode on it  or something, which is basically unbreakable.  If it's, you know, with a computer, particularly given the speed of the processor on here.  And can that leak?  Yes, it can.  And this phone could be compromised.  But the difference is the only thing that's compromised is this one phone.  And that's a big difference with a golden key where when and if it leaks, every single  phone in the world is not compromised or with WhatsApp.  Every single message in the world is not compromised or with Amazon.  Every single transaction and everything that involves that is compromised.  And that's the other thing.  It's not just about like it's not just about iPhones.  It's every like everything on the Internet depends depends on this.  And to think that it I don't know to make a broader point just to make a broader point  is this is that the obvious point that we haven't said yet, but it is a key thing is  that the U.S. can ban encryption doesn't mean encryption goes away.  Right.  So encryption is fundamentally an idea that is manifested in ones and zeros that is at  a high level manifested manifested in code.  And the idea is out there.  You can't put it back in a box.  So given that highly motivated, sophisticated criminals will always have access to encryption.  So the only people that are that are hurt by this is one law abiding citizens and two  stupid criminals who are dumb.  And to that end, the police in the U.S. are mostly concerned with stupid criminals that  are dumb.  And a lot of us do with drug charges.  We can which is a whole nother debate.  But it has to do with and it could do with murders.  It could do with these terrible crimes.  But and this is the heart I can make you sound very callous making it at the end of the day,  the sort of folks that are going to pull off a 9-11 sort of attack, which one as awful  as it was, was in the four digits.  And you put that up against other things, you know, people who die in car crashes, for  example.  But even said the people who have the sophistication to pull off that degree of an attack by  definition have the sophistication to get an encryption algorithm that was made outside  the U.S.  The sort of people that the police will not be able to get to because an iPhone has encryption  or because WhatsApp has encryption.  Those are the sort of people that the degree of crime they can commit.  And again, they could be murder.  It could be awful crimes, terrible crimes.  But the physical constraint on their actions just by virtue of no one person could be in  a ton of places at once or pull off something of that of a huge magnitude.  It goes into the pros and cons equation.  And it sounds very callous to say that.  But the tradeoff, not all criminals are the same.  The sophistication of the crime, I think, probably correlates very closely to the sophistication  they have in getting encryption on their own relative to someone who gets encryption on  accident because Apple happened to include it on an iPhone, if that makes sense.

Transcript:  Microsoft's getting into the act.  They have filed a federal lawsuit.  They say to stand up for what we believe are our customers constitutional and fundamental  rights, rights that help protect privacy and promote free expression.  They don't like the fact that so many government orders are secret and cannot be revealed.  And they have decided that they are going to pursue this in court.  And good on them.  Good on Microsoft.  They say over the last 18 months, they've received 2,576 legal demands that as part  of the demand required that Microsoft not say anything about it.  They couldn't tell customers about the warrants or the legal processes.  And of those secret demands, 68%, 1,752, didn't have an end date.  So it means that never, not a year from now, not 10 years from now, there is no statute  of limitations.  Never could Microsoft tell customers the government is obtaining their data.  And they think that they believe that violates the Fourth Amendment and the First Amendment.  They should be able to talk.  And the Fourth Amendment protects you against unreasonable search and seizure.  They would like to change that.  And they've gone to a court to sue over it.

You have the right to know if you're being investigated.  And to be secretly investigated, I understand that that's a useful tool for law enforcement  if they're trying to crack a drug ring or find a terrorist cell.

Transcript:  No, there's a specific, like to Ian's point, I actually have the article in front of me.  There was a provision in the Patriot Act called Sneak and Peek, which basically is the ability  to conduct a search while delaying notice to the suspect of the search.  It's this point exactly.  Although this is about an actual physical search, I believe, not about this point specifically,  but it's the same principle.  And in the, when this went through, this was actually a very controversial provision  and they stated that this was only going to be used for terrorism,  to investigate these crimes without tipping off the terrorists.  Robert Mueller said,  is an invaluable tool in the war on terror and our efforts to combat serious criminal conduct.  Well, since the Patriot Act has been passed, there have been over 11,000 Sneak and Peek requests.  And of those 11,000, a total of 51 have been used for terrorism.  There you go.  Which an infinitesimal percent of the vast majority have been used for run-of-the-mill drug cases.  And again, I'm more than happy to have a debate about the war on drugs  and the destructive impact it's had and the questionable motivations for why it even got started.

Really, it was because we couldn't really just go after black people.  We couldn't really just go after hippies.

Who wins out of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean it's my fault for setting this down this rabbit hole.  I don't mind though, I think it's fascinating really.  But here's the thing though, even if, the reason why it's maybe not productive, not to take over your show,  but the point being is that I think we can all at least agree that the war on drugs is not, does not rise to the level of 9-11.  I mean the problem is that, and this is what's, this is the key to this debate, is that the reality of the matter  is that the law enforcement in general are cloaking themselves in terrorism and people's fear of things like 9-11.  And child pornography and...  The debate I would have is that the real problem is we wildly overestimate the cost of terrorism,  again not to trivialize people who died in 9-11, but you compare it to one, other countries,  and two, the number of people who died and any number of other things and on a cost benefit basis our reaction is completely out of whack  and that's what really needs to be fixed. But, that's a whole other rabbit hole.  But the fact of the matter is even as bad as it is, I think all evidence is that law enforcement is being duplicious  in leveraging that fear to in fact get a tool that's going to be used for drug dealers.  And I think that's the case that, I think if people understood that this would be a different conversation  because the fact of the matter is this Feinstein-Berr bill, all these bills are going to do nothing to disrupt Al Qaeda,  they're going to do nothing to disrupt ISIS because this technology is out there, it exists.  The only people that it's going to help, the only law enforcement that it's going to help, and we have evidence of this,  is small scale stuff and do we want to trade the ability to more easily arrest a drug dealer for exposing the secrets and value  of all US corporations and property to whoever may come along. That's the real issue at case here.

Transcript:  Yeah, this is the case I referred to earlier where Apple actually did win the first round.  What's interesting about this particular case is in some respects, this is an easier case for the government to win  because Apple can just unlock it. They don't have to actually create a West Secure operating system and all this sort of stuff.  This is actually because it's running iOS 7, it's not full disk encrypted.  iOS 7 has some encryption, but it's not full disk encrypted.  And Apple has unlocked these cases in the past. In this case, the judge actually invited Apple.  In all cases, Apple just acquiesced without agreeing or disagreeing with whether it was justified.  In this case, the judge actually asked Apple, do you actually think this is legally permissible?  And Apple came back and said, actually, no, we don't.  And the judge agreed initially.  Right. Well, it's interesting because the guy went to prison and so they kind of fell off the radar.  But then once the San Bernardino thing happened, Apple actually went back to this judge and said,  you know, why don't you rule in that case? We're curious what you think.  And that ruling came out before the San Bernardino case was wrapped and the judge ruled in favor of Apple.  I think this guy is kind of a well-known agitator in this area, so Apple probably knew that was going to happen.

Now, it's ostensibly about regulation, the No-Rate Regulation of Broadband Internet Access Act.  And by the way, a strong 241 to 173 vote.  Ostensibly, this just bars the FCC from regulating the rates.  However, the bill is worded in such a way, according to the EFF, it could be used to keep the FCC from enforcing other consumer protections,  including the net neutrality regulations that they propose.  President Obama says he will veto the bill. It has to get through the Senate.  Just thought I'd pass that along.  And here's another tip. Thanks to Mike Elgin for this.  Do not carry a satellite phone in India.  Oh, yeah, this was terrible.  Chris Daniel Morton, he's 65 years old. He lives in Illinois.  And he's a physician.  He carried a satellite phone into India with him because he needed to stay in touch in some of the rural areas he was visiting with his patients and his hospitals.  He was arrested.  Turns out it's illegal to have a satellite phone in India.  He didn't know, apparently. But of course, ignorance is no defense, even in a case like this.

The FBI says talk about losing the golden keys, says a mysterious hacking group has had access to government files for years.  Yep. Since 2011.  And there's nothing they can do about it.  The group known as APT6 have compromised and stolen.  So this is a quote, stolen selective and sensitive information from various government and commercial networks since 2011.  This is an FBI alert.  It comes months after the government revealed the group of hackers widely believed to be working for the Chinese government got into the OPM, the Office of Personnel Management, stole data about millions of government government workers.

The point is that you have to, like just the broader point is you have to design for failure.  You have to presume that security will fail.  You have to presume that people will break into anywhere and everywhere.  And you start with that and then you think through what makes sense.  And that's where and that that at a very core level is why this golden key thing is the issue is because you have to presume it gets out and then if it gets out, how do you mitigate the damages?  Well, if you're in a situation where millions, hundreds of millions of services or devices are compromised immediately and because it's digital, said compromise can be exploited immediately and at scale.  That's a that's that's the fundamental problem with with the golden keys is the fact that it compromises everything at once and it compromises all immediately and can be taken advantage of immediately.  And that's the key thing about this that I think so many people who who who like, well, the government, you know, the government, you know, we let the police have a warrant.  We let people break locks.  Like once you get digital, just it changes everything about this.  And again, yeah, you have to you have to design with the assumption that everything is compromised.  And that's what's brilliant about encryption is that it really can make it.  Encryption defeats the power of scale because it can be encrypted on a one to one.  Every device can have its own individual encryption key.

And you know what? We got a great record on that.  We were able to hand over data in 85 percent of those cases.  Now, tie that into the story that's going around.  And I don't know if I'm if I'm completely worried about this,  that Uber's new Android app asks for access to your history of your browser and your text and a whole bunch of other stuff.  Browsing history, bookmarks, running apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I mentioned this, but I'm going to I'm going to jump in here because this there's we can't have our cake and eat it, too.  Like you can't at the end of the day.  We'll start with the law enforcement thing.  I mean, the police do have a legitimate interest if they have a warrant in getting information for one, for two,  like there's tradeoffs you make just to live in public.  I mean, you're asking to use a car service.  Right. And I agree with you.  And will your credit card and presumably it's a high thing for fraud.  So the large number of these requests are about fraud investigations for the use of stolen credit cards.  I mean, I guess the.  I worry about this privacy absolutism for lack of a better lack of a better term.  And I I'm kind of in agreement with you.  I am. I'm pro privacy.  But at the end of the day, it's dangerous.  I'm concerned about the conflation of Uber responding to legitimate law enforcement requests with this bot battle of Golden Keys, for example.  And I'm not saying you were doing that, but it happened to come in a show kind of next to each other.  And I brought it up. No, and I'm just saying that.  But there's people who are doing great work online about privacy and and and all that sort of stuff.  The problem is it's definitely an area that you can be a bit of an ideologue about.  And the fact of the matter is, like everything in the world, there are tradeoffs and there are difficult tradeoffs.  And we're not the issue is not preaching to the choir and making us all feel good about ourselves because who can come up with the most witty insult for government officials?  Although that is fun. It is fun.  But the reality is, is this is a political fight where it's going to come down to winning the hearts and minds of the American people and not to get all grandiose about it.  And we're not going to get there by being absolutist and fundamentalist about about this issue, even.  And I mean, we get into the whole problems with our politics in general.  But the idea that there is no compromise in my team has to be right no matter what.  And the refusal to see and acknowledge the shades of gray in almost every issue, you know, take, take fracking.  You have to take fracking fracking.  We want to be one an absolute thing on fracking.  Meanwhile, there's also news this week about Saudi Arabia and like, quote unquote, holding hostages to the U.S.  about the other side, 11 bill.  Those are actually intimate related because we are we are we are Saudi Arabia is less influence over the U.S.  because fracking has really so much so much so many energy reserves.  Again, that doesn't mean one issue or the other.  You can still be against one or for one.  But you have to think through there's multiple levels going on and there are very few actual right answers to any one question.  Not to bring politics into it, though, I'm not saying my position on either side, just that these are super duper complex.  And we do ourselves a disfavor by coming across as as as ideologues because it's not about preaching the choir.  This is a real political fight. We have to win.  I'm sorry I'm going on and on about this.  I believe so deeply that this Golden Key stuff in this bill is such a bad idea.  And because of that, I'm almost more worried about demonizing the whole thing because we have to actually win this fight.

Transcript:  Really, you could use this to prove your point, which is to say that there are plenty that we are not going dark.  There are plenty of legitimate ways that law enforcement can fight crime, can fight terrorism.  And these you know, this is an example, by the way, the Uber story that Uber was asking for all these permissions in its Android app.  And I'm always a little nervous about these permissions things because the way permissions are clumped together.  A lot of times you can ask for permission to do something you need to do, and it includes a whole bunch of other stuff.  The response by an Uber engineer a couple of hours ago was these permissions were mistakenly introduced by an engineer on the team who thought a third party library needed them.  When in fact, it does not. We definitely do not need or want those permissions.  And we have released a new version to the play store that does not request them.  So please upgrade to version three point nine eight point three and you won't be asked for permission.  Of course, nobody trusts Uber. So the immediate response was, well, really?  Another oopsie from Uber. But I think this in this case, it probably wasn't.

Transcript:  With the request for information, what was most disturbing for me was that the bulk of these requests weren't warrants.  They were subpoenas. And you don't necessarily need to go before a judge to a lower standard.

You just go to a portal on the phone company's website and pay a buck fifty and say, where was Ian Thompson the other night?  That's the real point. My wife finds out about that. I'm dead.  The good news is finally Congress has recognized that just because email is 180 days old, it is not abandoned.  Yeah. And that you can't just because for until.

Because they have email too. They understand that one.  But also, I mean, the original email legislation that we're operating under was written in 1986,  where people store their email on their personal computers. It wasn't given out to a third party cloud provider.  Now it's the case. But when was the last time you really delete a Gmail email?  No, I have email 10 years old and more on my Gmail.  Exactly. And that's all open. That's open to law enforcement.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think that fortunately, that's something you take your own hand. You can not ride an Uber.  And so it's good that this is being exposed. This is why journalism is important.  This is why the news is important. And then we as you as a consumer can make the decision.  Is the convenience of an Uber worth knowing this is the case?  And so I'm glad we know I'm not going to demonize Uber for it, though.

Transcript:  The most interesting one I heard was possibly the man's Daily Mail Mail. Yeah.  All the fails is known in certain. Isn't it like a tabloid? The mail? Yeah.  Well, it's a tabloid with pretensions. Even worse.  It's the Daily Mail is read by, as the US Minister famously put it, the wives of the people who run the country.  Oh, well, but it's they've built up this enormous, salacious website that is the number one news website in the world.  It rips off everyone else's copy in occasionally.  It is if you try reading it, it gets very depressing very quickly because it's sort of slightly lurid and very pious and that sort of thing.

Start time: 5314.04
End time: 5334.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you imagine? Oh, well, I mean, yeah. For sale, one slightly used Internet company, Verizon, Yahoo might also go to Verizon.  Of course, they just bought AOL. Yeah, it would make sense.  That's where that's where I think the real value at this point of Yahoo is as much the information they have about their users as the content.

Start time: 5335.00
End time: 5378.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, big problem is they don't really know anything about the users.  Yahoo brings scale. They bring a lot of users, mostly on the desktop, but still a lot of users.  And it there's still value in that.  And frankly, AOL has much better technology than Yahoo does.  It's a good investment they've made in that over the last three to four years.  And so I think bringing that better technology in understanding tracking users, serving ads, all that sort of stuff to bear on Yahoo's user base could make this a something that makes sense for for AOL as a part of as a part of Verizon.

Start time: 5379.22
End time: 5425.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  AT&T Comcast also considered, although maybe not as many bidders as you think.  Aaron Griffith, good friend of the network, writes in Fortune that many of the so-called 40 bidders for Yahoo have never even signed the non-disclosure agreement to view the sale book, which means they're probably not that interested.  It was helps get a bit of public publicity in there. Right.  SoftBank, for instance, never signed the NDA.  And actually, according to the New York Times on Friday, isn't interested in bidding anyway.  The Daily Mail has never signed the NDA.  Microsoft never signed the NDA.  So there are probably a lot of people doing due diligence and maybe dipping their toe in the water.  I think Verizon.

Start time: 5426.10
End time: 5439.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Verizon makes sense to a certain degree.  It all depends what's included in the package as well, because the Alibaba stake is basically Yahoo's complete value at the moment.  Everything else is just.  Oh, it's definitely not included.

Start time: 5439.00
End time: 5443.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the whole point here is to separate the Alibaba.  So how much is that actual value?

Start time: 5444.35
End time: 5453.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yes.  So how much they're going to pay for it?  I mean, I've got 20 bucks in my wallet.  I mean, to buy a loss making enterprise like that, you know, you've got to have some value in there.  And you're right. The value is with the users.

Start time: 5454.61
End time: 5483.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's not loss making, though.  So, yeah, I think the problem is that Yahoo throws off.  Yahoo is profitable and they throw off a lot of a fair bit of cash, albeit a declining amount of cash.  So there is.  The problem is, yeah, all the trends are in the are in the wrong direction.  But there is cash flow there.  So you could there's theoretically a deal with like a leverage Biosphere deal, too.  Again, the problem, though, is just the fundamentals of the company and where they exist in the current environment are all wrong.

Start time: 5485.08
End time: 5528.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm not encouraging the buyers either.  They're, Aaron quotes, one senior private equity executive whose firm expects to make an offer, saying the auction process has been an effing joke.  Most financial bidders were required to listen to a lengthy pre-recorded management presentation before they'd even answer questions over the phone.  This sounds like water torture.  The few suitors are granted face to face meetings with management.  Verizon and Comcast among the lucky few, even they struggle to extract information from Marissa Meyer and CFO Ken Goldman.  They were rebuffed asking about after asking about current revenue projections for Tumblr.  I think one of the reasons this article has even been written is that these people are coming out of these meetings calling Aaron and saying, this is horrible.

What she saw as proper management roles within Google and three years down the line.  Well, you know, a bit more time maybe.  But I just it's got a an aging user base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you, it's just what frankly starboard or whoever the managers are.  I mean, you can call them vultures.  But as a shareholder, I'd be certainly very pleased that they're there.  The reality is, is that they're saying there's zero right.  There's zero indication that that Yahoo under its current direction has has value in the long run, frankly.  And honestly, I don't think it's necessarily Meyers fault.  I think that she was the wrong hire.  And I think she was the wrong hire because I think Yahoo hasn't known what itself is for a long time.  People think of Yahoo as being a tech company.  The reality is that Yahoo started out by being a a human curated list of the Internet, right, which was so non-technical that they got their rear end.  They couldn't keep up.  Google. Yeah, because Google was a technical solution to indexing the Internet.  Yahoo was a a human based solution.

It was small enough that they had the servers on premises in a closet.  He said, there's Yahoo. I said, oh, there's Yahoo.  And then mostly it was a lot of people, right.

Start time: 5701.70
End time: 5739.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That said, Microsoft would be up on their investment if they had bought it.  Because that would have included all the Alibaba stake and stuff.  So it would have been terrible strategically because they would have had this anchor tied around their ankles.  But I mean, I can criticize Balmer left and right as much as this version.  But that deal is people forget about that part.  That part of the deal.  It's actually thirty six bucks now.  No, they would have backed into that profit.  Right.  I think they wanted it for strategic.  It was a terrible idea.  It is the right way.  That said, it wasn't quite the financial disaster that it is with the way these things work though.

Apple made at least seven hundred million dollars out of the Newton on the Newton.  And the reasoning is that you never know that would.  No, in terms of building and designing and selling the product, they lost one hundred million.  But as part of that, they needed processes to make the arm.  So they bought a big stake in arm, which they then sold for eight hundred million dollars.  So Laura, what are the consequences?

Start time: 5773.22

Because they've got because they've got to do things to do connections.  You know, well, hang on.  They probably also don't have access to clean water, electricity, enough food, diarrhea kills 2000 children a day around around the world.

It's an HHVM, which they call the hip hop virtual machine.  I don't know what the HH is.  Box and Wikipedia now both do it.  Data centers, they open source.  They did a huge amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they build their own hardware.  But I mean, one thing Facebook has been very good on is open sourcing a lot of these designs.  We saw this with the knowledge of the equivalent, but the other two net extension technologies they're talking about the redesigning cell towers and redesigning aerial systems.  They're open sourcing that as well.  Let telco gear is getting open sourced.  Facebook's also building its own switches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google point is important, though, because the reason that what makes the open compute project so brilliant strategically is Google had a and especially internally countered it as a significant advantage.  Their expertise in billion data centers and by all the component parts and really reengineering what meant to be a data center and Facebook five, six years ago when they started the open view project, it was a classic.  It was a classic strategy move and just brilliantly executed.  You know, the the the leader is fully integrated, has a superior solution.  So what we're going to do is we're going to, you know, commoditize it.  We're going to make it completely open and get people right on induce competition in all these various areas and give it up, give it away.  And the net result is actually as of I believe was earlier this year, Google actually joined the open compute project.  That's great.  Not and Google has previously open source on things, but it's been stuff that's been well developed and is out there and and they're get less of advantage from it when they joined a few projects actually contributed.  I can't remember what specific things I don't have in front of me, but they contribute and that they're actually actively working on that.  Previously, they would have viewed as a differentiator for themselves.  And the reality is that Facebook has completely commoditized that advantage for Google via the open project.  So it's achieved Facebook's strategic goal.  And in the meantime, yeah, it's a big problem for Cisco.  It's a big problem for, you know, a lot of these data center providers.

So it's not like I'm going to build one of these switches, but somebody in Asia might.  Oh, yes.  And so they are cheaply.  Right. Yeah.  That's I mean, in a way, I kind of applaud.  This is this is pretty impressive that they're giving this away.

Transcript:  It's what Google did with Android.  I mean, the the reality is it's in your interest to understand as a company where your differentiation comes from.  You want that to be exclusive and you want to commoditize everything else in your value chain because that makes your piece more valuable, makes your piece more expensive, depending on how or that that price is attention, where that price is time, where that price is money.  So it was it was a brilliantly executed strategy.  And and by the Google added a new rack specification that was forty eight volt power distribution.  You were wondering. But it's the same thing with the with the open with the open compute thing.  I mean, yes, it's there's lots you can you can be critical of it for for lots of different reasons.  And I think the India aspect of it was very interesting, particularly the ideas of digital colonialism and all that tapped into India's history with the British Raj and all that sort of thing, which I think Facebook to their was not nearly as aware of as they should have been and were kind of oblivious to this.  But it doesn't it's so facto make what they do being wrong.  I mean, open compute project is a it's a good thing.  And the fact that benefited Facebook along the way is worth understanding.  It goes both ways from one.  Let's not overpraise Facebook just as we shouldn't have overpraised Google for Android.  And nothing was more galling than the middle of the iPhone Android stuff.  People going on and on about how Google is some intrinsically good company because of because they're open.  No, they're open because it serves a strategic interest.  But let's not go to the opposite side either and say this is this is a bad thing because it's serving their interests.  Well, they're they're big companies. That's what they do.  They they and let's understand that.  But let's not make moral judgments in either direction, either good or bad.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's I agree with you on an awful lot of that.  I think what worries me about free basics and this was something that they actually said last week was they said that of the people that use it,  50 percent will buy an independent data plan within 30 days.  And they're saying basically this proves our point that, you know, once you get people excited on the Internet, then they will get on the value of the real Internet.  Yeah. But it did also make me think that, you know, well, yeah, but it also kind of demonstrates the point that free basic sucks.  You know, if you only got access to a couple of hundred websites, a couple of weeks, I tried this.

Transcript:  So it's like we talked about before with the tradeoff stuff.  I mean, everything's everything's a tradeoff.  I mean, you could and the free basics, you know, Facebook's position is, well, it's free basics or nothing.  Like it's like it I you can see it's kind of unfair to say Facebook ought to they ought to give the whole Internet  and every site, whether or not that site has optimized itself for free basics, which is a key part of being a part of free basics.  Yeah. That you're not taking I mean, the average Web page is like multiple megabytes in size, which it's not financially viable for to give that away for free.  Just not so. So but on the flip side, well, who's making the decisions?  Who's doing this sort of thing? So again, you can argue both sides, but I don't think it's particularly valid.  Well, I mean, there's no having your cake and eat it, too.  It's like everything like there are tradeoffs and should is it better to have nothing or is it better to have something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but a free basis as it stands only works at the moment if they've got an Internet connection they can access in the first place.  I think what's interesting about Facebook's request is that it has the equivalent drones.  It has the ability to go to places where there is no Internet access.  Now that I think is going to be a very handy. It will be handy for the people who are getting the Internet access.

Transcript:  Yeah. Let's see here.  So I guess what we should really talk about is the bots, because that was one of Facebook's big announcements.  This is not the first time Facebook has announced, hey, we're going to do poke or we're going to do Facebook home or a variety of project products that serve Facebook's interests, but did not pique the interest of consumers.  This is, you know, we've all been looking at messaging as a platform.  It's pretty clearly a powerful platform in countries like Japan and China where have you used WeChat?  You're in Taiwan, so I don't know if WeChat is as big as Taiwan.  No, Line is the one here.  But both of these are chat platforms that allow you to do things like buy tickets and, you know, a whole lot more, right?

Transcript:  Is that overstated here in the West?

Start time: 6797.63
End time: 6808.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it is overstated.  I actually don't think Facebook's announcement and I think Facebook should have framed it better because what's interesting here is not necessarily bots.  The reason they talk about bots is bots is kind of the developer angle on this.

Start time: 6809.06
End time: 6813.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. They're the apps that sit on the platform, which is messaging.

Start time: 6814.05
End time: 6945.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, also, maybe.  The way WeChat works in China, for example, and WeChat is by far the most developed here, is actually...  So if you're a business owner, you can get what's called an official account.  And an official account, the vast, vast, vast, vast, vast majority of them, you can build a sort of bot type framework on it, but few do because it doesn't make sense.  The vast majority are actually web views.  Yeah, I heard that. So it's just really a portal into a website.  It in all types of purposes that lives in the WeChat UI.  And what makes the WeChat...  What makes this powerful is the context that's delivered by WeChat.  WeChat knows who you are. WeChat has payment attached.  WeChat knows your location.  There's all this context that WeChat provides.  So what it allows is you can have these very lightweight interactions with businesses,  whether it be buying something online, whether it be ordering dumplings down the street,  whether it be interacting with government services, like all the government various agencies,  like the water utility is on WeChat.  But you can do all this stuff via WeChat.  And the reason, again, it's powerful is like if you're on a mobile web page, you have to enter your credit card information, say who you are.  Like it's just there's so much friction there.  But by being in WeChat, there's no friction.  It's very easily discoverable.  It's very easily discoverable.  QR codes are a big thing.  You can just scan it. It's super easy.  Everyone knows what it's for, where it's used.  And there's no friction.  It reduces all the friction in these interactions.  The reason why I think this is so misunderstood in the US is I've been writing about messaging for a very long time.  I think my third or fourth ever post has checked who is about messaging.  But it's always been about the WeChat or the line or in this case, Messenger.  Because the fact of the matter is the reason this area is interesting is because WeChat, for example, has built what is effectively an OS on top of the OS.  Like these messaging apps are the browser on top of Windows.  And the reason that's interesting is the browser was what broke windows in the long run, right?  Because you no longer were locked in.

Start time: 6946.10
End time: 6950.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And how is it different than a browser, though?  It sounds like it's just another kind of browser.

Start time: 6951.20
End time: 7010.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is in a way because it delivers all this context in a very frictionless way.  Like the difference between I can on WeChat so I can open up WeChat.  I'm not now because WeChat in China is different than outside China.  But say I'm hungry. I can open up WeChat. I can go near me.  I can see there's a dumpling place on the corner.  I can go to that place and go into the site, which is again just HTML and CSS.  I can make my order. I can click buy because WeChat knows where I am and knows who I am.  And it has my payment information attached.  It is all the context.  See, I love this idea. Is this where Facebook is headed?  That's exactly where they're headed with Messenger.  And Messenger, they want to get this context and deliver it.  The reality, though, is that one of the ways you could deliver it is via bots.  But the fact of the matter is, at least at the beginning, and if you go to the WeChat example,  most of it isn't bots.  I personally am convinced that all the bot hype is wishful thinking for the most part.  They're kind of clunky.

You can get a summary, which I think is going to come from chat.  And then there's something called Ask CNN, which I don't want to get in a dialogue with CNN,  but maybe... I don't know what exactly.

Start time: 7048.04
End time: 7071.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they demoed this at the actual keynote, and this was something that was just like...  CNN will send you a list of what the headlines are going to be, and then you can ask for more information.  But I'm deeply skeptical about this move from Facebook, simply because they touched on it slightly.  But this has to have a human working behind it as well.  It's not totally an AI system.  Well, that's just... OK, so I typed Rio Olympics.

Start time: 7072.16
End time: 7168.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not Facebook's problem, though.  I mean, Facebook, in the long run, the value will come from providing the platform.  And so it's on the individual businesses to have that back end.  Unfortunately, most of the demos are terrible demos of what's available.  I actually thought the best demo was the 1-800-Flowers demo.  Like, you could envision a world in the long run.  Pying flowers, yeah.  Yeah, well, for example, you could see a flyer or something, and it has a QR code around Mother's Day.  Maybe there's an advertisement or something.  And again, people mock QR codes in the US just because it's never been implemented properly.  But QR codes are a huge thing in China. They're a huge thing everywhere.  And the reason they're a huge thing is because everyone knows where to use them.  They're used in WeChat, right?  That's always the problem with QR codes.  What do you do with it? Yeah.  What, do I just take a picture? Then what?  Well, this is the way it would work for Facebook theoretically in the long run.  Is you say you see an ad for Mother's Day.  You open up Messenger. You open up Messenger.  Boom, you scan it.  Now you're in an application you do, order flowers.  And they're like, oh, order roses for my mom.  Like, oh, what's the ad?  And you get this kind of... you just put in the information.  It already has your payment information.  It already has various aspects about you.  Maybe because it's Facebook, it already knows your mom and where she lives.  I mean, who knows?  But you have all this context where it's a trivial transaction.  You have to go download an app.  You don't have to go to a website.  You don't have to enter your credit card information.  Like, there's lots of friction that can be removed.  And chat is better than calling on the phone.  Like Zuckerberg said, who wants to sit on hold?  You can have an asynchronous conversation.  I'm not convinced of that.

End time: 7234.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again, bots is one possible implementation of this platform.  And frankly, I think Facebook screwed up by over indexing the bot thing.  Because what makes Messenger interesting, what makes WeChat interesting, has nothing to do with bots.  Bots are an implementation detail.  And frankly, I think the vast majority of Silicon Valley is missing the boat on this.  Because Silicon Valley gets so wrapped up in scale and a technical solution.  When what's interesting about the real work that needs to be done here is actually going to like businesses and getting them online and getting them like their stuff integrated.  And no one wants to do that because it doesn't scale.  And it's not a VC type of business.  And so everyone's trying to put a VC business framework around this opportunity.  When the fact of the matter is the opportunity is pretty exclusive to Facebook.  And people, I think, just really, really hope there's a there's the next app thing or whatever.

Oh, anyway, why don't you tell me where you are?  I need to know so I can give you the forecast.  If you're on a phone, you can send me your location, too.  So I typed in the city. Oh, Petaluma.  Right now, it's clear there.  Is this the location you want?  And I will click the button. Yep.  And then I guess from now on, may I send you a weekday morning weather update at 8 a.m.  Or just tell me when you'd like to get the morning forecast.  Yeah, yeah. Send it to me at 8 a.m.  That sounds that sounds good.  So great. So I've so I've had an interaction, which actually I guess I'm going to get bothered every morning.

Transcript:  No, no, I'm ranty about this because I think Facebook screwed it up.  And the reason they screwed up is I think there is a real opportunity here.  But by everyone, not just you, Leo, but everyone is thinking about what they said about Messenger as being about bots.  And the opportunity is not about bots.  That's maybe the developer opportunity, but that's not the real promise of what they can do with Messenger here.  And the problem and the concern is people like you don't get asked Twitter.  You don't get multiple chances to make a first impression.  And these implementations are terrible.  It built a lot of bots and AI. These are these are this is the discredited form of AI.  The idea that we can anticipate every possible action and given in given answer to it.

But this is how they were billing it at the conference was, OK, our AI systems aren't there yet.  But stick with us, baby, because we can make this work.  And I don't think they can at the moment. I mean, they're still reading from the fact that they were, oh, yeah, we're going to build an AI which can defeat a human player at go.  And then Google did it. Google the next day.

Transcript:  Well, that's the that's the that's the long run. Yeah, for sure.  I mean, it's getting any sort of multisite network off the ground is devilishly difficult.  So Facebook has to sell this this benefit to two businesses.  And, you know, there's lots of reasons the Chinese market is different.  Actually, one of the things really interesting with the Chinese market is that there's a very famous probably the most famous flame out of a Western company in China is Groupon,  which went in there with a bunch of Western managers and and just got obliterated and they got obliterated in part by all these these imitation sites that spring up,  the largest of which Plumet one is still around.  But a ton of money went into it and a lot of this money went into like going out and going having sales forces going into all these businesses,  wiring them up with with like cash, computerized cash registers and tracking stuff on stuff so they could take advantage of these coupon offers and all this and a tremendous waste of money.  This kind of gets to the some of the stuff we talked about earlier. Just a huge waste of money.  You know what's been happened, though? Well, what happened, though, is when these new services, these new generation is called Oto in China,  this kind of like these whether it's food delivery, whether it be the WeChat stuff, the payments.  What happened was all these small and medium sized businesses had all this technology already in place that was helpfully put there by all the VCs funding Groupon and all their clones.  And so in some respects they were they were more primed to to leap forward in this respect.  Just kind of an interesting one of those interesting unintended consequences sort of stories.

Transcript:  The way they've evolved is really interesting.  I mean, because where they started was Facebook had like there was a a hole in the mark.  Facebook has always been kind of from day one.  This is where we're about this week has been about your public persona and public representation of yourself.  And that left space in the market for kind of your private persona.  And Snapchat filled that.  And over time, Snapchat has expanded out of that.  You know, they added there's the stories feature, which are public to to anyone who follows you and is kind of like TV.  You can now with the latest update, you can actually sit and just go through stories and you can see how maybe an ad might fit in there.  They have the discoverer, which is professionally produced content, which has massive engagement numbers.  You talk to any of the publishers that are in there and it's huge.  And again, and then now with precious content, there's maybe a better fit for professionally produced advertisements.  The challenge for Snapchat is the engagement numbers are fantastic.  This is an amazing place to be to own this sort of private communication.  There's a couple of challenges.  One, just generally, are they going to be able to spread internationally because this space is filled by apps like Line or or or Kakao or WhatsApp, frankly, in other countries.  And to kind of take this full circle of the Tesla Apple stuff, there's a brand promise of Snapchat, which is this sort of we don't it is private.  And to get effective advertising where they're going to have to do more tracking and more targeting, which, by the way, they change their they change some of their policies with the latest update, the privacy policy in terms of conditions and stuff to make it clear.  This is going to be happening now.  That's going to be the real challenge for them.  I think it's a product that is here to stay.  It's a but the to pull off the monetization is going to be tricky.  But that said, you know, they've really executed, I think, really, really quite brilliant.  Now, the big concern I've made is joke on multiple mediums and platforms.  So I'm sorry to reuse it, but I like it.  Is that I know what you're doing.  I mean, you talk about turnover turnover can refer to revenue.  But in the case of Snapchat refers to their executive ranks and that, you know, there is a question about about, you know, Evan Spiegel, is he does he have it in him to build a business, right?  Not just build a really compelling product.  And that's a hard thing to do.

Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  Wrap this up.  Got a few more things to talk about our show today brought to you by Gazelle.  If you're in the market for buying a new gadget or selling your old gadget, this is the place to go.  Gazelle has a variety of iPhones for sale, including the success to success plus iPads, Samsung Galaxy phones, each device fully inspected backed by a 30 day return policy sold without carrier contract.  You're going to get a great price and you can even get financing now.  Gazelle is aft added financing by a firm.  You give them your basic information during the checkout process and you'll get approved instantly with easy monthly payments of three, six or 12 months through bank transfer, check or credit card.  Just check the box.  It says financing with a firm has never been easier to buy a new device.  They even offer 12 month warranties through assurant for cell phones and iPads covers water damage, cracked screens, hardware defects and more.  And of course, it's still the best place to go to sell your used stuff.  Get top dollar.  You're guaranteed for 30 days.  You lock in that price from them, which means that you have the flexibility to decide any time in the 30 days whether you're going to take their offer or not.  They can't change the offer.  Although I have to tell you, they're really good about upping the offer.  Twice now I've used Gazelle that they've actually given me more money than they offered because they said, oh, no, this is better than you said.  And G A Z E L L E to buy to sell, give new life to use electronics, trade them in for cash or buy certified pre owned.  There's nothing better.  Keep that around.  Keep it.  Keep it in the back of your mind.  The next time you're ready for a new one or the kids are or you drop a phone G A Z E L L E Gazelle dot com.  I don't know anything about this.  Somebody called the radio show and said, did you know Dubai is putting high speed li fi into their streetlights?  Lifi is really weird.  It is LED lights that blink and transfer data.  It's not Wi-Fi.  Yeah.  Well, it's kind of like how fiber optic works.  It has potentially very high speed in the labs.  It was invented by a Scottish as many good things are professor.  Yes.  And at the University of Edinburgh, he gets 224 gigabytes a second over this network.  Now, of course, it's not going to work with your with many smartphones.  You have to have a smartphone that can see the light and transmit the light.  Yeah.  But apparently many new smartphones are starting to include this live by capability.  And Dubai has plans to get this all over in their streetlights by the end of the year.  It's the first kind of wide scale test of Lifi li fi.

It's good to get a test because it's going to be interesting to see how it works in the real world.  I mean, I've looked at various parts of this and it's it's a really cute idea.  If it works as specified, it's going to be very, very good indeed.  But I'd like to see a real world.

But the fact of the matter is that compatibility and all those sorts of things are product features just as much as what's on the spec sheet are.

Start time: 8156.04
End time: 8195.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly why they should go high end because the people who are buying this are people who highly value having a dedicated reader.  They value it for lots of reasons. It could be battery life, it could be usability, or it could be they like the e-ink display.  But in any niche market, you're better off going high end than you are because the low end is going to be taken by the...  Increase the profit.  Right.  Yeah, and that's what people value. The people who are still buying e-ink readers really want an e-ink reader, and they are much more likely to pay for the best possible e-ink reader.

And they were just like, they'd led off with, we found two critical flaws in QuickTime.  Oh, and by the way, you should probably take QuickTime off because Apple's not supporting it anymore.  And that led to like, hang on a second.  So I checked with Microsoft, checked with Apple, didn't get a response from either of them,  although Microsoft did at least return the phone call.  But Apple had been absolutely quiet on this.  And it took US Cert actually to put out a warning about this.  The Computer Emergency Response Team.  Yeah.  Wow.  And they put out, after the Trend Micro report came out, they put out a report saying, QuickTime's got to go.  But Apple has said nothing.  They've left all their customers dangling in the dark after 21 years of building this software,  which isn't the best software in the world anyway, and then just to say, well, okay, we're not going to support it.  But I know there's some critical flaws, but you know, we just don't make a say.  It's really embarrassing.  And it just, you know, screw him.

I get that some this happens.  Sometimes software needs to be deprecated.  But then it's on you to put out Apple has a big megaphone.  As we know, they were willing to use it for the iPhone to say how much they care about security.  Well, if you really care about security, then use your big megaphone to tell people that you're exposing them to a real security risk.  And this is a genuine risk where people again, we're dealing with digital here.  People can use these bot networks.  Here's your bots to or infected computers to scan computers everywhere.  See you as this involved.  Take advantage of the vulnerability and take their information.  And it's Apple's fault.  And and frankly, it it's super hypocritical and it really bothers me.  I mean, and Apple has lots of security issues.  I mean, look at I was ranting on Twitter this week about the modal dialogue you get on your Mac asking for your password in the pops up all the time.  And any third party app could pop up in identical modal password.  It's bad security.  And that's for your iCloud account.  The fact the matter is, is Apple, I as much as I support this because of the principle of the matter, Apple has an awful lot of hypocrisy going on when it comes to security because they have a lot of bad practices.  And this is just the latest example of it.

Transcript:  I've heard that now some theaters do have this, but is assigned seating.  This whole like you line up and rush in to find the best seat is ridiculous and barbaric.  Like you should be able to buy your seat ahead of time, specify where it is like you do on an airplane,  which is the way it works in I think most countries in the world.  And on there, you and that if you had that in place, you could enforce this sort of thing.  You could have like certain rows are cell phone enabled or allowed or some rows aren't or some theaters are.  I don't know.  I think this overreaction is ridiculous.  And frankly, I don't know.  Yeah, I like to eat vegetables.  They like what?  Like maybe some people want to do this.  Why?  Why are?  Why am I worried about what other people do in a movie theater that I'm not in and I'm expressed expressly to?  Would I want to go to that movie theater?  No, I want to watch the movie.  But I don't know.  I mean, this this whole outrage thing really kind of annoyed me.  Like people, I don't know.  I do let people do what they want.  If people want to go to a theater and look at their cell phone, more power to them.

Transcript:  But and I for sure.  But they're talking about having like theaters where it was expressly allowed.  So you know what you're getting into.  Right.  Of course, in a normal movie, I want the option to be able to go to a movie without these damn  young kids, you know, on their phones, Snapchatting or, you know, so.  But yeah, I don't know.  It's it's the whole it's the whole like and I don't know.  That's that's what annoyed me about it is like no one was saying we're allowing cellphones  in all movie theaters.
