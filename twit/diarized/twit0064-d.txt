Transcript:  This is TWiT This Week in Tech, Episode 64 for July 31, 2006, Chaos Theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Dr. Jerry E. Pornell, are you there, Jerry? That's me. Hello. It's working. It's working.  Wow. He's the sit-in curmudgeon on this show. So let me, Jerry, let me introduce everybody  you're talking to. Some of them you may know, some of them you may not. Doug Kay is here.  He's with IT Conversations, the IT Conversations Network, and probably the Proto Podcastor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also here, Chris Perillo from Locker Gnome. Hi, Jerry. Hi. Do you know each other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, everybody. I don't know. I never remember. I'm 75 years old. I don't remember anybody anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But Jerry, you're not confused about the internet being a tube, are you, by any chance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but you know, if you called it pipes, the poor, the guy ought to be giving a little credit on that, shouldn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think you could call it pipes, but then the question is, can the pipes get filled so that his email wasn't going to arrive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's it. I think that that's it. Yeah, given the amount of dark fiber we got left in this country, probably not for a while.  I think that's a misunderstanding on his part. On the other hand, I do understand that the AT&T people,  it's very much in their interest to convince him that bandwidth is a short supply, I think,  and they have to have money to allocate lots of it type of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that was really the issue. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, sure. You know, Adam Smith, no two capitalists ever got together,  but what they started a plot to get the government to restrict entry into the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The invisible hand ain't so invisible when it comes to Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It, but it's inevitable. You expect it to happen, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you do. Patrick Norton, are you there now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm there.  You have an actual picture. I look at your thing and I see a picture. Everybody else is just a blur, just a cartoon.  Perilla's got a picture of a chihuahua with glasses.  How do you put that? I guess I'll fool around with it until I find out how to do it.  It's in your profile.  Okay, then I'll get the picture of my paladin off of World of Warcraft and put it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you play World of Warcraft, Jerry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  David Prager is also here. Both David and Patrick were with us at Tech TV and also are now run their own independent IPTV operations.  David Prager does Revision 3, which does Dignation and System and a bunch of Control Alt Chicken, a bunch of other stuff.  Control Alt Chicken.  Guess what that show is about. What do you think Control Alt Chicken is about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a computer and cooking show, of course.  What else? Patrick is my former co-host on the screensavers and now does a show called DLTV.  I would actually have to respond to your invitation to be on DLTV. I would like to actually do it, Patrick, but if I can defer it a little bit until this podcasting book I'm working on is closer to shipping, that would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there any actual money in podcasting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, we can begin. Let's begin and we'll answer that question.  Frank Barnaco, it's actually one of our stories this week in CBS Market Watch said some podcasts, I think he named us by name, should be making a million dollars a year.  Chris Perullo, you said yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.  How?  Anything that can be published can be monetized and anybody who says otherwise doesn't know they're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many reports have we read from various places that are like, we're getting X number of hundreds of thousands of viewers per day.  That's a good three quarter of a million dollars a month if they have a clue.  And it's like, nobody ever talks about what comes between the traffic and the advertising and a lot of non-web page based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know how to make money at these things because I don't know how to sell ads.  I have done not badly with public radio type subscriptions to my two websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we should mention that Jerry, of course for years Jerry Purnell wrote the fantastic Chaos Manor column in Byte Magazine.  Then Byte kind of went away as a paper magazine but at Byte.com Chaos Manor continued for several more years and now you're doing your own thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now they basically, we had an amicable parting of the ways they decided their budget could not sustain the amount they were paying me.  And I decided I didn't want to write it for them for that price.  But then I found myself in a dilemma. The Japanese and Brazilians and Turks and oddly enough Riyadh still want the column.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you heard specifically from Riyadh and the Turks. We want Chaos Manor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Chaos Manor column is published in Riyadh, in Arabic, in Istanbul, in Turkish and I'm apparently very popular in Turkey.  I say this because I meet members of the Turkish press at shows and things and they tell me I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well you actually know as well as those of us in podcasting what a global market this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course the Japanese market is very large and Nick K. Blake's business publications pays me as much as Peterborough used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well you're answering your own question there Jerry because clearly they're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's not podcast, that's writing column.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay but wait a minute. I have absolutely no problem approaching any business that wants coverage and saying hey would you like to sponsor our show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now that's interesting. You're not trading editorial though. You're giving them advertising.  Yeah of course.  You're not saying we'll give you editorial coverage.  No.  Some people are doing that. I mean there aren't... Doug K. isn't that PodTech's kind of business model for PodTech?  I know you're not involved with PodTech but I know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah they have a mix. Certainly John's doing a lot of podcasts for hire and he's mixing that in with his own podcast as well.  So he's got sort of a hybrid model there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is where Scoble went. I think the hybrid model is a problem because editorially it's very confusing. Is this guy paying for his coverage or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think so. You put them on the same website and it's hard to tell what you got there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We are very clear that editorial is not for sale anywhere on this network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah no we're doing the same thing with Gigabox Media too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But how do you separate editorial from sales? That's always been the problem.  McGraw-Hill went to enormous lengths to do that. It was a firing offense for an ad salesman to approach editorial and suggest that we ought to review somebody or that we ought to take it easy on this guy, that type of thing.  That was literally a firing offense for a salesperson to do that.  I think as it is with a lot of other companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Same thing Patrick, as if Davis of course, right?  Yeah same thing as if Davis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe as if now since Michael Miller became, it certainly was not the case as if Davis some years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In which having worked at Ziff Davis for on and off for a decade, what phase are you referring to Jerry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quite a long time ago.  Before then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because in the 10 years I've been involved with it, it's been a firing offense. It's a firing offense. It's seen that in a lot of the other major publishers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The mainstream media you know or you hope you know that that's going on, but who's watching over user created content like podcasts and blogs? How do you know whether to trust them or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The blogosphere. It's a self correcting mechanism. That's what makes it so powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  People will know. You think people can tell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can do it this way. You can say, yes indeed people are paying me to write about their products, but they are products I use, products I endorse, products I would not endorse if I did not believe I can recommend them to you.  Now at that point it's a matter of how credible are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well we're faced with that on Twitter. We have some advertisers, both advertisers I use, we have two more coming. Both of which I use.  And we also make it very clear that now comes the ad.  And I think we also make it very clear that our coverage, and I think if you listen, our coverage is not biased toward or in fact in some ways it's somewhat biased against, I shouldn't say this, but the advertiser.  We're certainly bent over backwards not to look like we're in their pockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well but Leo, that's a real problem. That happens more than once in people who think they're trying to be fair. They end up being unfair to the people who are supporting them. And that's not right either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We certainly, AOL has been very good providing bandwidth for this podcast from day one, and they provide a lot of bandwidth. In fact I just found out a podcast, Twit 55, which emerged at the same time as a big ad campaign on Morpheus for Twit, had 700,000 downloads in about three or four weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  For the single episode?  700,000, 400,000 downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are people paying for those?  Well that's the thing, AOL gives us the bandwidth. If I were paying for the bandwidth, this network wouldn't exist. So AOL is a sponsor in kind, and I have to admit, if there's a negative story about AOL, I'm disinclined to ignore it.  I certainly don't want to look like we're ignoring the negative stories. But you're right Jerry, that would be biased in the opposite direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know, do you have an ad on Morpheus, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It wasn't an ad, Cast Universe, who's one of the podcast agencies, very kindly gave us a free bug on the new Morpheus service. I actually didn't know this, I was just talking to Ray Slikinski today.  And he said, hey, did you notice any bump from the big Twit ad on the Morpheus client? And I said, when did you do it? And he told me, and I said, oh that explains it. I thought frankly it was a fluke, it was an error in the measurements.  700,000, which is twice what we normally get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I was wondering what happened to ours too, because we were part of that Morpheus campaign.  So you had to jump too?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's it? There you go.  And who was that? Cast Avenue you said?  Cast Universe. What's his name? Mark Jeffries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mark Jeffries and Ray Slikinski. And Ray Slikinski is the guy that did iPod-er, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yep. Now all these guys are trying to, there are a number of companies, and I don't want to get too inside podcasting here, because we have other news stories, but just to round this out.  I mean this was a story. Frank Bernacco saying this kind of got my ears burning.  There are a couple of agencies, we use one called PodTrack, that really is attempting to convince agencies of the value of podcasting.  And I think, Chris Perillo, you tell me if I'm wrong, but I think they're starting to make headway. I think agencies are starting to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but ultimately I think the person in charge of the brand is going to be able to make the best decisions for that brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I agree, and it's easier to go to those guys than the agency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well yeah, I mean if someone were to come to me, and of course I do a large part of the production of our program, I mean self-titled, the Chris Perillo show,  but the person who produces a lot of it is the person in charge of advertising and putting all that stuff together.  We've got a better grasp on our audience, on our metrics, on the kind of sponsors that our audience is going to react to positively.  And so for us, we think, well who would be an ideal person to incorporate in a very NPR style model with our show?  And then we just go from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We do also the NPR style advertising, although I just don't have the bandwidth to go out and talk to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I hope that Frank's wrong because tonight we're launching two new channels.  Both of which are advertiser sponsored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  GigaVox launches, GigaVox media launches tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In fact, as soon as we're done recording, I have to get the site up and running before you get the show notes done.  What is it?  Okay, so GigaVox media is my partner Michael Gohagen and I put together, and it's a for-profit media company based on the same technology as the Conversations Network.  And as of tonight, you'll see three channels there, IT Conversations, Open Source Conversations, and the Podcast Academy channel.  All advertising supported.  All advertising supported. We've actually had two advertisers step up even in advance before the channels are out.  Zend Technologies for Open Source and BSW USA for the podcasting channel.  They're out there already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, that reminds me of Zend's story.  Did you see the lead developer on Zend quit in a huff this week?  Really? I won't mention that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's alright.  But we have, we're very similar to what Chris does.  We have spots in the intros and outros of the show.  They're very independent of the content entirely.  Now we're lucky we're not reviewing products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't like to do interstitials. I like to do them live.  I don't like to do interstitials. But that's me. I can do that because that's my background in radio.  We're also not doing product reviews.  Well, we have an agency, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, in our case we're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In our case we're in-house. We have an in-house staff of ad salespeople.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Both you and Chris Burillo and Doug Kaye both are doing it in-house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but if you're in-house staff consists of you and your wife when you can get her away from doing something else, that makes a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's my staff, Jerry, except my wife won't help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you have an agency. On the other hand, you're employed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have a day job. In fact, all of us have day jobs.  We're not yet to this, well actually, Doug Kaye, you don't have a day job.  I don't have a day job.  You retired on...  I have a day and night job.  But you made a little money in the internet business and you could afford to do this.  But all of us have other incomes, let's put it that way.  But I think you're seeing right here, I'm glad you're here, Jerry, to say, you know, where's the beef?  I think you're seeing right here there is something happening.  It's really starting to take off.  And I think in the next year you're going to see...  I think Frank Bernacco underestimated the value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, once again, I can say from my own experience that with essentially no push to get subscribers,  I got enough to make a retirement living out of the public radio model with my old website before I started Chaos Manor Reviews.  I think you're right. I think the niche...  Now, it's about retirement income, you understand.  Not hundreds of thousands of dollars, but enough that I could have paid the rent and lived with that and Social Security on that and nothing else and just kept it going.  But unlike most of you guys, I don't have a day job and I don't have anybody subsidizing my bandwidth.  I have to pay Zidane for whatever bandwidth is used and that makes quite a difference, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So tell us a little more about Gigavox, Doug.  I want you to get the plug in and then we'll move on.  Yeah.  This is... because IT conversations have been non-profit, so you've decided to do a little profit thing, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, IT conversations was not so much a non-profit as a no-profit up until now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mean it was...  It's a non-profit, but it wasn't planned that way.  I know a lot of companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  An intentional non-profit, as are we.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we do. It's confusing, but we do have the Conversations Network, which is a real, legitimate non-profit and they have one channel there so far called Social Innovation.  That's doing really well. That's funded by grants, so that's doing very well.  On the for-profit side, though, we've taken that technology, like I say, and we're going out and building a major media company.  And we're just launching essentially our first three channels tonight and then we'll be adding more over the rest of this year.  But it's an exciting project. We do have people who are doing regular sales, traditional media sales, and we're going to be building that up rather quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm totally unfamiliar with this, and if I am, I suspect some of those listening to this are.  What is it you are selling when you're selling ad? That is, what is your product? I don't even know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Well, it's gigavox.com, which if you go there now, there's nothing, but six hours from now there will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If all goes well by the time anybody hears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If the gods of DNS be willing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think Kevin Rose can give you some help if you need any help.  Flip, dig around pretty quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, you know, we have content that's topic based. A lot of it comes from conferences.  There are a few hosted interview shows as well.  And we take those conference recordings, audio today, video in the future, and we make those available for free.  And they are sponsor supported.  So we basically are inserting audio and video spots in the intros and outros of the program in order to pay for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What do you think your hits are going to be? What are the big, what are the flagship shows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right now it's the conferences.  Conferences, okay.  Yeah, I mean, conferences are the big ones.  Because if, you know, we have three years of doing this and there's no question that the most popular programs we've ever had are always solo conference sessions.  At the bottom of the barrel are panel discussions.  Panel discussions are always the lowest rated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the speeches, the keynotes, things like that are very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the keynote speeches that you would pay $3,000 in terms of registration and travel and you get them for free.  No, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get like Bill Gates talking at WENHEC, that type of thing, and put those up?  Correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Leo, you'll remember that the most popular is still WAS.  In fact, Chris is here.  The most popular was WAS at GnomeDex.  How many years ago was that, Chris?  Two, three years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's still the most popular program and we still get a few thousand downloads every month of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Chris, you do a deal with...  And how do you get them?  Yeah, you do a deal with IT Conversations, Chris, to bring in Doug's team to record the conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, at GnomeDex 4, yeah, certainly we did.  And it worked out very, very well for both of us, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In fact, Chris is my only conference producer who hasn't renewed because he does such a good job of it himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a large reason why.  That's absolutely true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, most conference producers don't have the skills or have the interest in doing it.  They just don't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everybody else is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How do you get the rights?  You ask.  And I seem to remember that you delay the release of these so that if people are going to sell tapes  and people want the tapes, they'll get them right away.  That's where they don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a fairly complex relationship because, again, over three years we've learned what it takes to keep the conference producers happy  in terms of helping them generate some revenues, which we do through something called QuickCast.  QuickCast is essentially a fee-based service for early access to the audio.  That replaces the old cassettes and CDs on site.  Oh!  Right?  So we spread the content out over time as well.  And then we're working with those producers also to help them feature their upcoming new events as they come back around.  I love that, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you doing things like American Association for the Advancement of Science, then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would love to, Jerry. I should talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the AAAS does a brisk business in those tapes,  but most of the professors who go to it would really rather have something other than those silly tapes  as the means of getting recordings of the conference sessions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think Doug has a really good business model, frankly.  Let's move on, though.  I don't want to be too much of a podcast-specific podcast.  That's the kiss of death.  Patrick Norton is on right now as he talks to us on a Core 2.  And how are you liking that Core 2, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, a lot, which I should, considering it's like a $7,000 system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is a test system you have for DLTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a test system we're filming for...  Whoops!  Sorry, I opened up a window and shiny happy noises started coming through.  It's all right. We don't do those.  It's a test system we're filming for PC Magazine and we're going to use it on the show on DLTV tomorrow.  Whose system is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Excuse me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a Falcon Northwest system.  I like Falcon Northwest.  The phrase ridiculously fast comes to mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It booted up quickly because Patrick had to reboot at the beginning,  and boy, you're back on about three seconds later. It was really quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually I rebooted up twice.  Wow.  If you're looking at the benchmarks, like high quality, Doom 3, ultra quality,  it levels off, seems to be throttled by the graphics processors.  You're looking at like 120 frames to 114 versus an Athlon 64FX system.  But if you get something where it's like medium quality, where it's not throttled by the graphics,  you're looking at like 260 frames per second versus 149 frames per second.  That's significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you see the difference when you're playing the game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't. I mostly look at things like Windows Media Encoder tests,  where the same file is taken, it's like in Athlon, the best of the Athlon system is taken like five minutes and 46 seconds.  This machine is taking about four minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's interesting. We may look back at this moment and say this was AMD's peak,  because Mercury Research just released a report that said AMD is at the highest ever market share  in CPUs, its market share is now 22%.  And all of a sudden Intel comes down to 73% and comes back swinging with Core 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they come back swinging with the Core 2, but the real question is,  does anybody need that much computing power?  It depends on what you're doing, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  Chris Perillo says yes. What are you going to do with it, Chris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, when have you needed less computing power in your entire life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I've had this same conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got plenty of computing. I'm sitting here with a dual Athlon,  and it's doing piggy old outlook, which has got to be the hoggiest program in the world.  I'm talking to you people, and there are three or four other things running in background,  and it's all doing it fine.  Now, I couldn't play Doom while I'm doing all this.  Well, there you go, you see?  That's my point. That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I wouldn't.  You wouldn't, Jerry, but I think there are those who would.  I asked Craig Barrett this once, and he actually got visibly irate with me and said,  well, that's a question old journalists often ask me.  I asked him, who needs a 2 GHz chip?  And he said, you just ask a college kid who needs a 2 GHz chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought you could do anything you needed to do in 64K of RAM.  Well, you can't.  No, no, no, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm more in Jerry's camp on this.  I'm more in Jerry's camp on this.  Stop, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The business of you can do anything you can do in 64K of RAM or 1 MB of RAM  was clearly erroneous when it started.  I am just saying that I know, except for massive video editing,  I know of very few people who have any software that can make use of this new power.  What waitel vista comes out?  Well, and the question becomes,  AMD has bought a lot of loyalists because their stuff works very well,  and for a while, Intel stumbled and gave you machines that you could bake pizza in,  and they weren't very fast, and they weren't very reliable,  and a lot of people went to AMD.  Now, the question is, will they go back if they've got machines that are good enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you're still looking at, you're still looking,  I mean, as somebody who's still using the $500,  you know, at home, I'm still using the $500 PC I built probably in 2003 or 2004.  At work, I can't get a fast enough machine fast enough.  Yeah, but you're doing some unusual, he's compressing video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you're compressing video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I have, David M., of course, can use every,  David M. uses more bandwidth than the rest of us put together,  but David does these enormous video files and things,  but down the street is my friend Will, who teaches at CalArts,  and he has a G5, and he runs, you know, 70-layer drawings,  and also does his email, talks on Skype,  and all that at once on the same machine.  He has no interest in anything faster.  Yeah, but when it comes time to processing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.  No, go ahead, Chris, please.  When it comes time to process video, audio,  doing any type of mega-tasking, as AMD's calling it,  that's when you need more processing power,  and unfortunately, when you're sitting there typing in Notepad  or Outlook, that's not the time needed.  But isn't that what people do most of the time, Chris?  No, it's increasingly, there are more people looking into  expanding and increasing their lifestyle on their computer.  Audio, video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're playing Second Life and they're listening to the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  3D, I mean, this is where all that processing power really comes in.  It's not for the times that you're sitting in Outlook,  it's for the times that you're trying to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think a lot of people are going to be going to the market  going buying new computers when Vista comes out anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would have said at least two months ago  when they were paying me a dollar and a half a word for them  that I was doing something when I was writing my columns.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Good point.  We do not get a dollar and a half a word for this podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I did need to have high-speed access to the internet  to check facts and get pictures and get links to the things  I'm talking about and send out to my friends.  What do you think of this?  What is it that's driving the faster processors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's gaming, it's video compression, it's 3D graphics,  maybe things like Second Life.  But video compression is mostly going to be Apple, isn't it?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Apple's not going to AMD anyway.  No, Apple will take advantage of this Core 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think you're going to see Apple with Core 2 boxes from Apple  in two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And don't most people who do high-end video use Apple?  Patrick?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's really divided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think some of the people in the industry,  I live here in Hollywood, but I don't pay as much attention  to it as I might.  But some of the people I know in the industry here  are using Windows machines because they had to,  but they just can't wait to see it.  They just can't wait to get faster Apple's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, they're going to get their wish, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I don't know.  It just seems to me most of the video freaks I know  are Apple loyalists to the point that they let Apple  defecate upon them from a very great height  and still paid the money.  They were so loyal that they let Apple do all the terrible  things Apple did to its loyal base back when they were  down around 2% market share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that was mostly Photoshop users and Illustrator  users at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In any event, nowadays, they're all rubbing their hands  with glee over the Apples are coming.  And I have to admit, having played with a,  not Core 2, but a Core Duo Apple machine running  Windows stuff in parallel in it, it's pretty darn good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, here's the question.  Do people stay loyal to AMD, buying AMD chips,  even if they are plenty of speed,  plenty fast enough for them, when there's a faster chip  out there for the same or less, don't they just say,  I may not need it, but I'm going to buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Does it depend on the sweet spot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's all about brand.  People are brand loyal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've gotten emails from people who are like,  I don't care how much faster or how much more power  I can get out of the new Core 2 compared to an AMD.  I hate Intel, I'm still buying AMD.  I think there will be AMD loyalists who will do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what you're really going to find is the competition  is not going to be at the very high end anyway,  because I don't think there are many people who need  the very latest and greatest.  I think the competition is going to be around the sweet spot.  What can I get for $300, for $200?  What can I get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you talking about chip or system prices, Jerry?  Chips mostly.  What's interesting about the Core 2 rollout for Intel  is they've rolled out Core 2 processors fundamentally  from the $185 on up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I know, and that I think is what AMD should really  be worried about.  If Intel steals the sweet spot, then AMD's got a real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Intel slashed prices by as much as half on some of its processors.  Yes, see, trying to hang on to the sweet spot.  The low end stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, not just low end.  The low end is pretty high nowadays, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I agree, I agree.  I mean, we were singing its praises not so long ago.  What about the AMD-ATI merger?  We talked about it as speculative last week.  It happened.  Does it change the landscape in any way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've noticed the ground's a little tilted these days as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Tilted which way, Intel or AMD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just more laughing.  I don't think we're going to see much impact in our lives  for another couple years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nvidia has already said they're going to support SLI and Intel.  Of course, we knew that because we had Kevin Creewell on last week  and he said that, and it's been an open secret for some time.  But that certainly pushed them in that direction.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know if people really care about AMD and ATI  or Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is anybody likely to capture the high end of the video market for very long?  Not really, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In terms of graphics?  Yeah.  I mean, it's been down to just AMD and, or excuse me,  Nvidia and ATI.  ATI and Nvidia for a couple years now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  MDT or whatever we're going to call it.  There's nobody else left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the high end of any market is always relatively insensitive to brand  because they're always looking for speed and quality.  It's, you know, brand loyalties come usually a little farther down the levels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you see the snafu that Microsoft had with its Vista speech recognition demo?  Who saw that video on YouTube?  I've got it posted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell us about it, Chris.  It's hilarious.  They're, of course, touting the fact that Windows Vista's got better voice recognition, too.  Better voice recognition technology.  So what better way of showing this than to actually demonstrate it in front of a large crowd of press  and industry pundits.  Of course, when he said, dear mom, comma, it came out, dear aunt, comma.  And when he tried to correct it, it wasn't going to play along.  Dear what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Dear aunt.  Somehow confused about familial relations, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which Microsoft executive was doing the demo?  Hard to, probably one of the guys.  Oh, man.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know who did that segment was, he used to be at Tech TV.  He was at Tech Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The MSNBC segment?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't seen it yet.  What's his name?  Oh, and I hate saying this, but he's short.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he did the Silicon Valley Bureau.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, he's going to kill us for not remembering his name.  Oh, he's going to kill me.  I can see his face right now.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wait a minute, let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here it is.  Microsoft hosting dozens of Wall Street analysts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Jim Goldman.  Here at the company.  Oh, that Redmond Washington corporate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jim Goldman of CNBC.  Good for Jim.  Credit where credit is due.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of Microsoft beta stuff, what do you think about them charging for the beta?  A buck 50 to download the beta.  Well, they got three million plus downloads of the darn thing, and now they're like, well,  we're losing money and everyone really wants to use it and try it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a lot better than 25 bucks for beta two of Windows XP on CD.  Wait a minute, Chris Perillo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Chris Perillo, you're saying you of all people.  Chris Perillo is the guy who got in trouble for putting the Vista beta up.  You got a cease and desist from Microsoft.  Oh, yeah, it was a nice ceremonial, nice ceremonial cease and desist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have to say they were they were good sports and so were you when they when they gave you the cease  and desist letter.  Was that at Nome Dex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was at Nome Dex.  My point is, is that this technology exists and if Microsoft is whining about the bandwidth,  they need to let it go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not bandwidth.  You know what it really is?  They want to pre-qualify people.  They don't want the 12 year olds downloading this.  They want somebody with a credit card.  I completely understand.  Even a buck 50 is enough to eliminate the kind of the riff raff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or having a beta run for does the beta run for about a year?  Is that right?  A long time, at least until next year.  Okay.  Yeah.  So Microsoft Vista, a dollar fifty for a year.  It seems like a good deal.  It's not Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all good.  Yeah.  But why would you complain about a dollar and a half?  And if you really seriously didn't like it, you must have the email of address of at least  one of the nice young ladies at Wagner Edstrom, who will be glad to see to it that you can  get it free.  Jerry, not everybody has your cloud.  She will then put you down in her book is the worst cheapskate she ever met.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've actually been trying to get it.  I sent out the email and everything and I haven't heard back.  Not from Wag Ed.  I tried to go through the channels and I haven't heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will have to say I have wonderful relationships with Wag Ed.  But then I knew Pam Edstrom before she joined that firm.  I would expect that.  She was a journalist like everybody else.  I would expect that.  She and I and Esther and Pam Clark used to hang out at Comdex's in Las Vegas back in  the early 70s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Show of hand who's used Office 2007?  I have.  You.  Here.  How?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jerry, do you like it?  Love word.  Took a while to get used to the new reorganization.  You can't find anything, but when you finally do find it, you'll find it again easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a good, actually, that's a very good sign.  I don't like the ribbon, but I guess once, if you can learn it quickly, Chris, did you  find it quick to figure out and learn and use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, for the most part.  I was only disappointed in the way that the ribbon interface worked, but that being said,  they've posted on their blog, since the Office team has a blog, a video of how they're making  it so that you can hide or auto hide the ribbon bar through a keyboard shortcut.  Yeah.  It makes it so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think power users use the menu to figure out what the program could do.  Losing the menu is, I think, in some ways a loss.  Do you still have a menu of some kind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The menu now becomes the ribbon bar, and I think that really pushes the idea of a menu  or a toolbar, and it really moves it forward.  Just by the virtue of hiding that ribbon bar and not making it fully visible right up front.  Patrick, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For those of us who haven't seen it, Chris, what is the ribbon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a series of icons, all of which are different sized, which makes it annoying for me.  It's not uniform, but the idea is that they make certain sections of the program available  through this series of icons.  For instance, all your editing icons would be under this ribbon, if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Does it make it modal?  Does it make it all of a sudden like you're in the editing mode or you're in the graphics mode?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's sort of state-related.  I don't like that.  You get a graphics ribbon if you're trying to do things with graphics.  You get a formatting ribbon if you're trying to do things with text and so forth.  I didn't like it at first, but I find one thing about it is the old menus, the trouble is they weren't logical.  Right.  Things were just shoved in wherever Chris Peters could get them fit.  Right.  Now they've completely redone that, so it takes a long time to find out how to do something,  but once you find it out, you'll find it again fairly easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what this is all about.  It's what Microsoft's been doing for years, which is try to hide complexity and yet still expose functionality  so that if people need it, they can get to it and remember where it is.  Patrick, we didn't get your review.  You've been playing with it, yeah?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  I just find it's just another artificial environment to learn, if that makes any sense.  Here's the real question.  Here's the real question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is this just...  Look, Microsoft makes the bulk of its revenues from upgrades.  They've got to keep you buying new versions, and lately there really hasn't been a compelling reason to buy a new version of Office.  Is this redesign just to make you think you're getting something new and more powerful, or is Office 2007 actually better?  Eh.  It's not, is it?  It's just a way of making it look like a bigger upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just like their stupid ad campaign with the dinosaurs, man.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For whom?  For anybody who uses it.  For people who are just learning Word, it is easier to learn this than it was to learn the old...  Sure, but they're buying a new copy anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm talking about people who have been buying, you know, they have Office XP, Office 2000, Office 2000.  I wouldn't bother.  It's just another version, three.  I wouldn't bother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I wouldn't buy the new Office unless I were writing about it or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or if it were a buck fifty.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That sounds good to me.  That sounds like a good deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, on the other hand, if you buy it for a buck fifty and get used to it, you'll never be able to figure out how to use the old Word when you're a virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe that's the plan.  Get them hooked now.  Yeah.  So they can...  E3 kind of went back and forth on this story.  Initially, NextGen, which is a British gaming magazine, announced that E3 is dead.  I think they were just trying to grab headlines, but it does look like E3 is going to have to refocus a little bit.  What's going on with E3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think it's the same thing that happened with Comdex and the same thing that will happen with CDF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But how could this show be dying?  I mean, E3, I mean, this year's E3 was a gala event, huge, glitzy, lots of money being spent on booths.  You wouldn't look at it and say all of a sudden, oh, this is a conference in trouble.  Why are they worried?  Why are they downsizing?  Chris, you had some thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think the industry is moving towards smaller.  Smaller is better in terms of conferences.  I think E3 is getting a little too big, just like Comdex got a little too big.  And instead of facing an explosion, I think they're imploding.  And I think there are going to be smaller conferences that are going to happen.  And they're going to be a lot more targeted to various audiences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what you agree, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I talked to some of the gaming group people.  And the general consensus is EA alone spent $10 million on their surround sound, video, studio, booth, arena, whatever you want to call it.  And some people are putting their expenditures at E3 close to like $20 million, $30 million overall.  Which is in line with what I've heard being spent.  I remember 10 years ago.  How long ago was it when Sony launched PC Expo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't remember the exact date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, years and years ago, they spent like $11 million for that one small spot at the Javits at the trade show.  And what's generally the general consensus is that you've got too many kids who aren't really are great because they're members of the community and they're valuable,  but aren't really that good in terms of generating either the leads you need or the press coverage you need.  It's hard to, like Chris was saying, it was like when Comdex got up to the size of CES, it was getting impossible to make meetings.  It's impossible.  Is it over for CES?  No, I don't think so.  Because CES is a little different because CES is still about, CES is not so much about the insiders as it is about the entire industry.  So everybody from every single, when you've got somebody from a car stereo shop in Dubuque can walk into, they can see their monster cable dealer, they can go check out the new products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because the consumer electronics business is more diverse and there are many more retailers, they need a trade show.  But the narrow focused gaming business doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think it's also because E3 is just, you know, Chris was saying before, it's gotten big, it's gotten crowded, it's become enormously expensive to make any kind of a footprint there.  And it's becoming, the thing is people want to tie in, people want to tie in proof that they're getting value for the money they're spending at a trade show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I imagine what happened was that Sony, Nintendo, EA, a few of the big players, Microsoft, said no, we're not going to pay those prices or we're going to do something else.  If you had those four pull out, you wouldn't have much of a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you had one of them pull out, you wouldn't have much of a show.  So it could have very well been just one. And my guess is if it was the one, it probably was Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're not going to be in the LA Convention Center anymore, but they will stay in Los Angeles. They're not shutting down. They want everybody to know.  You know, I tried to get Gina Smith on the show because it was actually Gina who started the show, E3 show.  Remember, she had a magazine called Electronic Entertainment, E2, and they started the E3 show about 12 years ago.  But she's a little busy, but she's going to be on a future show. She was kind of perturbed that her baby was in trouble.  Do you go to E3, Jerry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have gone to every E3 and even before that to CBO's digital electronics conferences, which really was kind of the beginning of what became D3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are they useful for you as a journalist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I didn't go to this one because this year they decided there were too many people getting free tickets and they made us jump through hoops like you wouldn't believe.  They wanted me to give them tear sheets and copies of this and all kinds of stuff.  And I said, screw it. I went to the pepcon event and some of the private parties.  But in the first place, describing the E3 floor is a little like describing a scene from my novel Inferno anyway.  It's loud and you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which ring of hell is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. But for them to, and what they don't understand is the kids who are trying to wangle free tickets will jump through all those hoops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They'll do it. You bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That won't. And I really don't believe that Microsoft and EA were paying a great deal of money to be protected from me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They didn't get any ink from me because I didn't get to see their stuff.  Right.  I turned out, I'll talk to a lot of other people of kind of my, not maybe my age because I'm older than everybody else,  but people who've been in, you know, reporting in the industry a long time and who have some reputation and a bit of a name.  And most of them won't go either.  They just didn't want to go through the sheer hell that the convention staff was trying to put people through to get press credentials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  E3 is a little different than CES, isn't it? Because it's more aimed at the press than it is aimed at dealers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which you would think if they would make them want to get press people there.  But in fact they made a great number of the non-gaming press people very angry with them because,  well we never heard of you, you don't write for Computer Gaming World.  Well no, I don't. I don't do that. No.  I understand they made Mossberg unhappy and he said that to them.  That's not good.  So, you know, once they get in that mode of we're doling out the sacred gold and we would rather sell tickets at the door  than let somebody in free who might actually have some readers, I think that's one reason that didn't get much ink this year.  And that's one reason why a lot of the big players said, wait a minute, we spent all this money and the only people who wrote about us were the game magazines.  12 year olds.  Well yes, they were the only press people allowed under the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really too bad because I'm sure, I mean, I can see a little bit that they're worried about, you know, everyone and their dog can say I've got a blog and I'm now a journalist.  It's hard now to credential people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure, I understand, but when I went there, for God's sakes, I'm there for CMP and Byte magazine, which has been around longer than everybody else, including God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hope, you know.  Yeah, but it's no longer about how long you've been around, but what your reach is and what your actual audience reach is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I have a hell of an audience reach and a lot of the kids I saw wandering around at Pepcom with press crashes probably have 130 readers, including all their relatives and classmates.  Yeah, but wait a minute, what kind of audience?  They might be the influencers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They might be the influencers too, right, Chris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  If your audience is still, well, let's say if they're fine running their 386 at home because that's as much computing power as they need to complete email on Juno, you know, it's not the audience that they're going for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's also a different world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would have to say that Byte's readership is probably fairly sophisticated, power users and so forth.  It is a different world.  Certainly my readers are people who basically like doctors, who like to be their own MIS and architects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I bet they buy a few games, I have to say.  Of course they do.  A few gaming consoles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They play a lot of games.  I think you will find that a great number of business users, particularly small office people, buy a powerful machine so they can play Warcraft.  In fact, I know of hundreds of my readers who meet me in Warcraft games.  So I'm pretty, you know, so they may be old fogies, but they're fairly rich old fogies with a fair sophistication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jerry, what's your character in the world of Warcraft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I ain't going to tell you that on the air, that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm the tech guy in Lothar.  I'm an undead priest.  Come take me on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, what I hope people will do is give me stuff.  You see, if people recognize you, Jerry, they don't try to battle you.  They give you things.  Here, have a cloak of the demon of doom.  Real quickly, because we've got to run here.  I could go on for a long time.  This is a lot of fun.  There are a few big MySpace stories I thought I'd bring up.  First of all, MySpace was down.  They claim due to a power outage over the weekend last weekend, they say a power outage in Los Angeles area.  I've seen other blogs say, no, it's not a power outage.  They were DDoS'd and a number of other sites were down as well.  Six hours for MySpace out of commission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the whole Internet was down then.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I couldn't talk to any of my friends.  There's no Internet.  MySpace is down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  We're ignoring Dvorak.  We've got Jerry.  We don't need Dvorak.  The problem is I can't.  Right.  That's right.  Jerry is a.  I hired Dvorak.  Did you really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maggie Cannon was the editor of Infoworld way back when.  And I was one of the senior writers, freelance with Infoworld.  But Maggie and I talked a lot.  And this chemical engineer applied for a position as a reporter columnist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I might have to bring Dvorak in just to give him a little hard time.  Let's tell you what.  We'll make this be the old guys podcast.  David, are you the youngest on here right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If there's anyone else in their 20s, then I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How old are you, Chris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not in spirit, but you're.  Chris is younger than I am.  Chris, are you that young?  Yeah, I just turned 13.  No, I actually I just turned 33.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See, he's an old guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll tell you what.  We'll get the work in a little bit.  I want to do this.  My space.  We need the young people for my space.  My space.  Are you talking about the Billy Bragg thing?  Yes, Billy Bragg.  Well, I'll see.  Here's what happened.  My space changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a 13 year old girl.  She's the neighbor girl down the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wait a minute, Jerry.  You are a 13 year old girl on my space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a 13 year old girl character on my space.  And it is amazing.  The male idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're the one people are worried about.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not me.  I never I never I never say anything improper.  I'm sure you don't.  Very naive and really?  Is it that long?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I could see the headlines now.  Jerry Purnell, 13 year old girl on my space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm dead sure there are a lot of.  No, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the whole point.  No, the issue with my space.  They changed their terms and conditions.  And in a very, I think, critical phrase, they said that they would have a non-exclusive,  but fully paid and royalty free worldwide license to anything you put on my space.  And that's where Billy Bragg, who's a rock star, said, Whoa, I'm not giving them rights  to any of my music and pulled off of my space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think this is just the beginning.  I seriously I mean, we were put a lot of people are putting their entire lives on Friendster,  Facebook, my space.  It goes as far as Flickr, YouTube.  They're putting their entire identity into these third party services.  And what happens is that their whole livelihood just flutters away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I don't think my space really wants Jerry Pornell's 13 year old girl and her output.  But they certainly want Billy Bragg's right?  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I'm I've been a Billy Bragg fan forever and I understand why he's upset.  But it's like I'm more upset by YouTube.  You know, YouTube's recent announcement that they own, you know, they own the rights to republish or resell anything on YouTube.  And that if you want it, if you know, if they decide, you know, the only way to pull their right to sell your stuff that you post on YouTube is by pulling it off of YouTube.  So they can sell it.  You can be upset and you can pull it.  But they've already sold it.  Even that, you know, I mean, the whole if you post, we own it kind of thing is a little sketchy.  I mean, not just for I mean, you know, I mean, Billy Bragg, you know, who knows?  Maybe Billy Bragg will finally have that insane hit that pushes him into the, you know, top of the charts worldwide.  But but I can see him as a musician totally being like, no, you don't own rights to my stuff.  You can't resell it.  I completely understand.  I'm supposed I think they do that just I think they're doing it just as some sort of legal maneuvering to make life easier for themselves.  Well, we talked about this last week with YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think a lot of sites do this.  It's just a natural thing to do.  And of course, every time they do, people go, whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But of course, one of the main things that MySpace is famous for, aside from all the 13 year old girls, is the fact that it's a place where indie artists can do stuff.  And like indie artists are excited about getting their stuff distributed, but they also care about not giving themselves away.  And at the same time, you know, I'll agree with Chris in that and that the fact that, you know, you shouldn't be posting all your all your crap on a bunch of these websites like Facebook and MySpace and Friendster.  So, I mean, like, ideally, you know, if you're a musician, you'd find you'd make your own website.  I want to see Jerry's 13 year old girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You used a picture of a girl down the street.  Is that how you did it?  Oh, we've lost him again.  We've lost him again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the neighbor girl and her.  You have lost me?  No, you're there.  Am I not here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, you are. You know, you're cutting in and out.  And I think that maybe you have this is one thing you have to work watch out for with Skype.  You might have something going on, some network process going on in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it could well be.  Yeah, that'll kill the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I need a faster processor.  No, more bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  More bandwidth.  We need more bandwidth, Captain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Faster processor wouldn't hurt though.  I'll do a last one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want to do this.  See, he needs a core two.  You see, you're proving it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure, we've got bandwidth problems.  I'm watching Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you're cutting in and out right now.  So I'm not sure exactly what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what it is because maybe it's your mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Make sure that connect.  Yeah, it could be the microphone.  It sounds OK now.  Sounds OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, as long as it sounds all right.  Now, I got my neighbor's neighbor's permission to use their girl's picture.  You didn't use her name.  Of course not.  It's a made up name.  And I just wanted to see what would happen.  And it's sort of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, I'm curious.  Anybody else have a fake profile on MySpace?  No.  That you'd admit to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To define fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Uh huh.  OK, well, are you Patrick?  Are you a 12 year old boy?  I don't know.  I'm on MySpace.  You're not Patrick.  I'm Leo Laporte on MySpace.  I don't ever use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me ask you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I asked my daughter when she was on MySpace, I said, what are you doing?  Are you OK?  She said, oh, don't worry, Dad.  I'm a 23 year old guy in New Jersey that drives a Camaro.  I'm fine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I used to flip pizzas with that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm curious about it.  The music business, I don't know much about.  But I would think that if you're brand new and trying to get exposure, you're going to  have to give some things away.  Well, that's the thing.  You had to give them to the record companies anyway.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And indie artists, what do they mind?  It's a non-exclusive license.  It's not like MySpace owns your stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you get to go perform it, which means you're better off than, I mean, you're no worse  off than you would have if you'd gone to Motown Records 10 years ago, who took everything  anyway.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, if you're an established artist, you have more to lose, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, artists have a hate relationship with their publishers.  It may have changed recently, but I don't think so, that authors do not have with our  publishers.  I mean, publishers may be the class enemy, but we don't hate them.  Right.  They don't try to take everything.  But you will notice.  It depends on the publisher, Jerry.  Well, you should talk to my publisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know which one you have.  I think that's what's changing, though, and that's why I think consumer-created content  is so exciting.  I mean, we're publishing, you know, here we are, we're doing our own thing, and we're  keeping it ourselves, which I think is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But at one time, I know plenty of artists who actually like sent things out to my website,  letters to me saying, encourage your readers to rip anything off that they ever see of  mine.  I think that's smart.  Because I will never get any of the money anyway.  Oh, I see, yeah.  The record company is going to take all of the money, and do you know how they got that  in their contract?  The default in the copyright law that makes performance art by default be owned by the  publisher and not by the artist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there was a staffer in the Congress, in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, there  was a staffer who wrote in a bunch of defaults in the contract in the absence of explicit  differences in contract.  Then the publisher basically gets it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's in the DMCA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and he put it in the night after the second reading and before the Congress voted  on the bill.  The result of it is I have yet to find a congressman who admits that he voted for that.  Right.  Or knew that he voted for it.  Well, many of them said they didn't have time to read it.  Well, of course they don't, but the point is no congressman knew they were doing that.  And several have tried to get it out, but they can't because the lobbyist.  Meanwhile, that staffer is now the vice president for public relations of RIAA.  Oh, he got his.  Now, does that tell you what, you know, but so, but in publishing, the Science Fiction  Writers of America and the Authors Guild and some others actually went to the congressional  hearings, and we got some inputs into the act which at least protected some of our stuff.  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I remember that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I went back and spoke for the Science Fiction Writers and so forth.  And that, so published authors don't have that problem, but on the other hand, if Cory  Doctorow is right, it don't matter because copyright shouldn't exist anyway.  Everything ought to be free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, let's not get into that battle until we get Cory on here.  Maybe you and Cory, maybe a fun podcast gets you and Cory on to be.  Well, we don't agree on that.  I know you don't.  Congress is back at work because they've just passed, at least the House has passed,  the DOPA Act, there's a good name for a bill, Deleting Online Predators Act, and one of  the things it in fact does is it bans MySpace from schools and public libraries.  In fact, it basically says kids can't chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think what they need to ban is old guys pretending to be 13-year-old girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that, like trying to keep the kids from chatting is unenforceable.  I mean, it'll force them maybe on to texting on telephone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's exactly the point.  There's no way this is going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I would think, were I an independent record artist, that I would hate that because, as  I say, things like MySpace is their means of getting exposure.  But you have to be prepared to give something away.  Every one of us who makes a living in the writing business had pretty lousy contracts  the first time, then usually it had an option clause to let them have the next book at a  pretty lousy rate.  But if you were smart, you got an agent in there somewhere, and after that you didn't  have to sign that garbage anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're well over the hour, Mark.  So I tell you what I want to, I do want to bring in John C. Dvorak just briefly.  So David, can I let you go?  Yep.  I appreciate your being here.  David Prager, of course, with Revision 3.  Any, I ask you every time, anything you want to tell us going on at Revision 3?  Anything new?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will be back in about, oh, maybe two weeks and I'll tell you a whole pile of stuff.  Okay, so two weeks out.  I'm not saying two weeks out.  I'll just, I'll have more to say.  I know I keep saying it.  It's hard to give empty promises and I don't want to do an empty promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I think that's great.  I just give you the opportunity every time.  But of course you always can go there to see Dignation and Control All Chicken and more  to come.  I know, I think I have a little inkling of one of the things you're going to announce.  Really?  Yes.  I know a little bit about that from another party.  Nice.  And I'm very excited about it.  I think it's great and I can't wait until we can tell people about it.  Awesome.  All right.  Thanks, David.  All right.  Thanks.  Take care.  And we are going to add, if we can get John up here, John C. Dvorak because Jerry hired  him.  Yeah.  Hello, John.  Wait a minute.  It's ringing.  It'll take him a little while to answer, I think, because they probably went down to make  dinner.  He called us earlier.  In fact, we may not even be able to get him.  You see, John actually does have a picture.  There he goes.  John C. Dvorak, are you there?  Hey.  Hey, Jerry.  How are you doing?  Hi, John.  How are you doing?  Jerry was just telling us how he got you your job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't either, but Maggie did.  I was working with Maggie.  Point is, I was with InfoWorld before he was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You were with InfoWorld before anybody was, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was certainly there when Maggie hired John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's not the way I remember it, but okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I will have to admit that if you have a sharper memory of it, John, you may.  I just remember when I wasn't a staffer at InfoWorld, of course.  I was just writing pieces for them periodically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You were making so much money writing at Byte, I don't believe for a minute you would stoop to even write for this little bitty weekly at the time.  It was only 20,000 CERC for a minute.  But I did when Maggie was there too.  I know you did later. You did later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I did when Maggie was there too. I just didn't write much.  But the first three years with Byte, I had a non-exclusive.  They didn't have an exclusive write to anything about it.  Then PC Magazine offered me a good bit to alternate with Peter Norton in a column.  And Byte said, we can't stand that.  And I said, they're offering to pay me more.  And Byte said, we'll fix that.  So after that, yeah, it was in pretty good shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was there really that much going on in the Mesozoic era?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There really was.  You know, I always thought Peter Norton...  In those early days, there was real money for journalists in those days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I thought Peter Norton was imaginary. I didn't know.  No, we're just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was real money in those days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jerry did get me out of InfoWorld, though, I have to say.  So that's more valuable than getting me into InfoWorld, I have to say.  How did he get you out?  That's a long story that we'll save for our drinks.  Yeah, another time.  There's too many characters involved in that story, but the fact of the matter was...  And too many of them are still alive.  He found out something that I needed to know, and it was just a long story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, John, you already missed it, we already did, but I just wanted to bring you in  to bring the average age of this podcast now finally closer to my own.  We jack it way up.  We jacked it way up.  There's nobody under 30 in this podcast now.  Just to introduce everybody around, because you don't see Doug K., he's over on ISDN.  He's kind of in the back.  Hello, John.  Hey, Doug.  And Jerry Purnell, of course, you know, Chris Perillo is here, who you've worked on a book  together with, I know, and Patrick Norton.  So the whole gang is here.  I just wanted to bring you on and say hi, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like you got a big crew.  We're done.  Yeah, well, you had a big crew then.  We had a big crew.  No, I was in the middle of a conference call and the thing went until 6 o'clock, and then  someone said, aren't you going to do Twit?  I said, no.  I looked at the clock, it was, oh, yeah, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would have been screwed anyway, because we can't get more than five in here, so it  worked out fine.  That's fine.  Glad we could talk to you.  Anything good?  Well, we talked about that E3 thing.  I mean, did you have any thoughts about that?  Actually, I think we kind of covered it pretty well, which is just that it's inefficient.  And Jerry was complaining that he couldn't even, they made him jump through hoops to  get in.  You didn't even try to go, I imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually had to, if you contacted the right people in advance, it would be easy to get  in.  I mean, they were going to let me in and let my JC in when he was like only 16, so that  was violating their rules, but it was just a matter of contacting the right people.  The thing that my son mentioned, which I don't know if he brought up or not, but it looks,  it's kind of an interesting idea, which is that with E3 fading, the possibility that  the Game Developers Conference here in San Francisco could become the big, big show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It certainly is for the Game Developers and it always has been.  It's a great show.  But you mean a show from the point of view of covering gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this could be like a, you know, the show's been getting bigger every year  and now with that show missing a beat, it's possible that this show could become huge.  So it's not over for trade shows.  No, it's just, you know, these guys, they overpriced, they price things wrong.  I think it's a lot of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know the show I missed was Seybold's old digital conference they used to hold down  in Beverly Hilton.  And it was the conference was the important part.  They actually had conferences with people talking about this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you know what the problem is with those conferences today, as far as I'm concerned,  is that in the old days, most of those speakers got paid.  When you have a conference and everybody's speaking for free for quote unquote promotion,  and that's what CES does, by the way, that's why they have never had a good conference at CES.  It's always just crap.  Yeah, yeah.  And that is because they won't pay anything.  I mean, CES is so cheap.  I mean, even Comdex would give people a hotel room or a limo or they do something.  CES won't give you anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Comdex would at least give us something.  Of course, we gave their awards away for them.  You remember that panel you and I headed, the operation system shootout back in Comdex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was that in the DOS days?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was back in the 40s.  Now, this was when OS2 and Windows and Sun and some of the others were actually all viable.  And John and I were kind of the judges on a presentation of a bunch of these guys coming up,  presenting why their operating system was going to win.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who was the winner, Jerry? Who was the winner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think John and I both agreed that OS2 was the right one, but we also agreed that Windows would win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you were right on both counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was either that or I think Smalltalk. Maybe that's a shot.  Yeah.  I remember there used to be a guy that was one of the top, Sherlin was his name, Ed Sherlin,  who was one of the top researchers in the same group of Gartner and all these other guys.  And he spent a year promoting Smalltalk as the next big thing that would take over.  He pushed himself out of a job. I never seen anything quite like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, Smalltalk was highly, it still is highly influential.  It may not have made it in terms of market share, but a lot of influence, even on Apple, on Macintosh today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I don't think there's any doubt about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it got the whole notion of object-oriented message, message-oriented.  It was just unusable.  Yeah, yeah, as Smalltalk as such wasn't too useful, but the concept of object-oriented stuff was.  It sure was a revolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to wrap this thing up, but let me go through the panel and give everybody a plug.  First of all, John, you haven't said it yet. I want to give you a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dvorak.org slash blog. Is that what you're referring to?  People should rush there right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Possibly. That could be what I was thinking. Yes. Have a great night, John.  See you.  Take care. He's got to go off and make flank steak.  Jerry, you want to tell us where we can find you now? It's not at Byte.com anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no longer Byte.com. You can find me at JerryFernel.com, all one word, or at ChaosMannerReviews, all one word, dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is your new venture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ChaosMannerReviews is the column I wrote for Byte from 1970 until last month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And much beloved, I must say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's still the same column. You can come read it, and if you like it, subscribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Awesome. Will do. ChaosMannerReviews will put a link in the show notes so everybody can find it.  Jerry, it's been an honor to have you on. It's been great talking to you. Thank you so much for joining us today.  Thank you.  I appreciate it. Dr. Jerry Pornel, who I should hasten to say is also a great science fiction writer.  I think people forget that that's really what he is.  What he does.  He's one of the great science fiction writers.  Chris, how are things going at the Locker Gnome? You've got the Chris Perillo podcast, Chris Perillo Show.  Gnome Dex was a huge success this year, I imagine. Where are you going to have it next year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Most likely LA, because we found that a lot of the people at this year's conference were really into media.  And so we want to try to bridge that gap between traditional media and new media.  And we figured there's no better way of doing that than in LA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can we come this time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, yes, yes. I caught the podcast you did.  You didn't invite us.  No, that's not how. Okay, so yes, yes. And hopefully in a couple of weeks, we'll be able to talk about this new video project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm really excited about this. Chris, this kind of started in a, there's a back channel mailing list that actually Chris hosts very graciously for Tech TV alumni.  And it just kind of started floating around in this that maybe we should have a reunion of some kind.  It wasn't clear at first whether it was going to be a party or a TV show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think, well, the party is going to happen first. I know that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Chris Kosatch says, I plan my, whatever it was, high school reunion, college reunion. I think I can do that.  So she's back in D.C. with Alex, Alex Wellen, of course. And so I guess she's going to do the planning.  And I think when we do the party, it'll be, we'll do some sort of show with it too.  But then Chris had a great, Chris Perillo had a great idea. You want to kind of, should we hold on to it or should we tell them a little bit about what you're thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think all the listeners probably already know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You put it out there in a blog posting, which was heavily Doug.  Oh, wow. Yeah.  A site basically for all the old Tech TV alum to kind of post their thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. To upload new content, existing content. I mean, just make it easier for the talent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A centralized place where we can all let everybody know what we're doing.  And in a way that would be the beginning of the reunion, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'd be a nice way. And I think give us a way to kind of connect with the Tech TV community that we weren't able to before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's really there. I mean, it's bigger than ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm still blown away with how many people dig that story.  I just blown away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you know, at this point, there's no way we could bring back any of the shows because in nostalgia, in distant memory, they seem so much better than they actually were.  So we can't recreate them because they're better.  There's no way we could come close to the way you people are imagining it.  But we do all have other things that we're doing.  And that's what's really exciting and the good news.  And I do think a reunion show, I think it's not for a while.  I mean, if we're going to do a show, it's going to be probably not till next year.  No, I can't imagine.  It takes a while to plan all this.  But I think the site will be the beginning. And just keep watching.  We'll have details. And Chris, you'll come back and tell us all about it once things.  He's really taking the lead on this, which is great.  Oh, for sure.  Yeah. Thank you, Chris.  Anything else you want to plug?  Books coming out.  Anything else in the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, just Google for Chris and you'll find whatever I'm doing.  P-I-R-I-L-L-O.  Perillo.  Oh, God. Now I have a.  Buy my chest.  No, it's just rent.  I'm sorry.  You can't buy it.  It's not for sale.  You can only rent it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thank you, Chris.  Thank you, guys.  Have a great night.  Thanks, Leo.  DLTV is the place for Patrick Norton. And he does such a great job.  And tomorrow you're going to see his Conroe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It sounds dirty.  In action.  You're going to do that on the show tomorrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We get our Conroe covered starting in a couple of weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But this new machine you're playing with is Falcon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Falcon, this ridiculously insanely fast machine.  Yeah, that'll be fun.  Well, thank you.  It's also amazing to realize that big fans are back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Big fans, really honking big, great honking big fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, when this thing fires up, they've got this set up so that it has more cooling than.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The irony is it's a cooler chip.  It's a more efficient cooler chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think it's because gamers expect the big whoosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  These machines can actually be cooler, quieter and faster, which is pretty amazing.  All right, Pat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to figure out how to adjust the fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We'll see you tomorrow on DL.TV.  Thanks for being here for a late night to it.  A day late.  Certainly not a dollar short.  Take care.  Bye bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have a good one, Leah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And we're going to let Doug K go because he's got to do his server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, if all goes well, I'll have gigavox.com live before you get this show online.  So let's hope I can do that.  I think you will.  But also, you know, we didn't mention the fact that you're going to be an instructor at the Podcast Academy on September 28 in Ontario, California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So in conjunction with the Portable Media Expo, everybody who's coming to Podcast Expo absolutely should come a day early and or two days early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How long does podcast one day early September 28th?  OK, one day early and we have a great full day.  It's about half of it is all on video.  We've got some terrific video stuff, including Alex Lindsay is going to be there.  Oh, is he? Oh, great. Oh, yeah.  Alex is doing a presentation, a class on video and like I say, half a day on video.  And the other half is really for the serious podcast of the professional, the consultant and so forth.  And that's the half that you'll be in.  And because as we've always said, you have the perfect face for radio.

Transcript:  I'm a serious podcaster and I don't even know what I'm talking about, but I'm sure we'll come up with something.  The next day, of course, Podcast Expo, number two, which is really, I think, going to be amazing.  The first one, you know, was a surprise to everybody.  What a shock that was. Wasn't that amazing?  Tim Bourquin, who put it together of the podcast brothers, didn't even know that he was kind of concerned about, you know, he called the Portable Media Expo because he didn't know podcasting was had any traction.  It's still the Portable Media Expo officially.  But if you go to PodcastExpo.com, you'll find it.  And I'm going to do the key. I'm doing the keynote there.  One of those and one of the things I'm going to talk about in the keynote, I'm really going to address what's what's what's what are the issues going forward for us as podcasters, both video and audio?  Because I think there's some things that we need to set the agenda on.  So that's going to be fun. And then we'll be there to hear it.  Well, yeah. And then please join me, Doug, that afternoon, because what we're going to do is we're not going to do Twitter there, but we're going to do a special, a Twitter special from Podcast Expo.  I figured silly to try to do Twitter when really there's so many interesting people there will just do a podcast Expo show.  Please join me for that. In fact, I'd like it if you'd cohost it with me because you know everybody.
