Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is TWiT.  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is TWiT This Week in Tech episode 108 for August 5th, the crash of 2007.  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Audible.com.  For your free audiobook, visit Audible.com slash TWiT.  It's time to TWiT and with me John C. Dvorak from Dvorak.org slash blog.  He's going to be running out on us in a little bit, but we thought we'd get him on because  he's written a very compelling, controversial article in PC Magazine and we'll talk about  in a sec.  David Prager also from Revision 3.  I've been trying to get you on because there have been a lot of changes going on.  Jim Latterback has left Ziff Davis.  We knew him.  He was our editorial director at Tech TV and he worked at Ziff Davis practically his whole  life and he left to go to Revision 3.  He's now your CEO.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I guess officially started in July and I think-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then immediately took a month off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, originally he was going to kind of officially start after that point or officially  start as far as everyone else was knowing because we thought what's the point of having,  you know, hey, here's our new CEO.  He's gone in London for a month.  But then everyone's like, oh, Jim went over to Revision 3.  So, I'm like, yep, yep, yep, yep, he's over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of out there.  You couldn't keep it a secret.  Is this CEO, was Jay Adelson basically the CEO in the past or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Jay was I guess for more than a year ever since Revision 3 did its angel round,  which is about a little under a million bucks just under a year ago, Jay was like the interim  CEO because he was also over at DIG at the same time.  I used to tell Jay all the time, I'd say, well, he's just like Steve Jobs.  Steve Jobs has Apple and Pixar, you know, Apple is DIG and Revision 3 can be your Pixar, right?  No, it's a jet, I believe, actually.  But basically, you know, we went around for a whole year.  It wasn't an urgency to try to get someone to be full time doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you didn't take it.  How come you didn't take the job?  It sounds like you've been running Revision 3, David.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I kind of have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or maybe wait, let me, can I guess why you didn't take the job?  Because you went to the wrong building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  Well, I went over to the CNET building when they wanted me to do my job interview for  Is that true?  That I went to the CNET building?  Yeah.  Yeah, I dropped off Alex Albrecht at the CNET building to do the Cranky Geek Show.  Is that really true?  No, it's absolutely true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  John kept saying, ask Prager about this.  I thought he was teasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, no.  I mean, I don't know what I was thinking.  I just know that he was really late.  I was going to go somewhere else.  I took the 6th Street exit on 280.  It's not that far away.  It's two blocks away.  I came over to 2nd Hall of Ass up there, saw big green logos, had seen them, like, all  right, get out.  Here we are.  I was like, who am I supposed to talk to?  I said, wait a second, you're in the wrong building.  Get out here.  Get out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where's Cranky Geeks?  I'm sorry, that's down the street.  It's kind of fun.  It's just two blocks away from Z.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the following week or two weeks later, something like that, they both, the same two  people, Kevin and Alex, went over to be on Tom Merritt's show.  Not Buzz Out Loud, but they do a weekly live show.  Anyway, I told him to tell him I dropped him off at Ziff Davis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't believe how much production is being done now.  And I also can't believe how much like Tech TV, Revision 3 is starting to look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all over in the same area, which is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And this new Giga Ohm show is produced by or directed by Martin Sargent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, right now it's we've got Sarah Lane, myself and Martin kind of working on it because  everyone's got a million things to do.  So we're all basically paying attention to it.  And so that show right now, we're building studios right now.  So we're actually shooting that.  You're building studios?  Yeah, we don't have it.  We have an office under construction and a studio under construction.  Where's that going to be?  It's all going to be on along the third street where the new Thursday rail is in San Francisco.  There's these little big warehouse building.  So we snagged a spot to have an office in there and a spot to build a studio in there.  That's really amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we're really.  Tech TV is kind of coming back on the Internet basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess it's been doing that for the past two years now.  I mean, with both whatever with CNET, with Ziff Davis and with with Twit and with Revision  3 and a couple others.  So yeah.  Yeah.  Who knows what would happen without.  I wonder if it would have the landscape would be the same if tech TV hadn't gotten sold.  I mean, the technology would have evolved the same, I think.  But I don't know if all the personalities would have been so quick to start putting  out content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is so much better, to be honest with you.  I mean, it's not as easy to get.  And I know people complain about that, but it will be.  Now Patrick is going to join us supposedly.  He's in Vegas for DEFCON, the big hacker conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he never wants to get online over there because he's terrified.  He said he was going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know because he's afraid of getting hacked.  I don't blame him for that, but he's probably looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What can they do to him?  What does he have on his machine?  So valuable.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What you ought to do is just have an EVDO card.  I think that's quick enough to do a Skype conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I finally got one of those things.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which ones you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Sprint or the Verizon?  Just the Verizon EVDO.  Yeah, I have the Verizon.  And at least in most, just about any city, I could just turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know there's a five gigabyte a month limit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't know that.  Are you sure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Huh.  If you use more than five gigabytes, you're doing, you're doing, you're probably doing  something that's not permitted.  Like using the internet, I guess.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I can't tell.  It's slower.  After that.  For what I do most of the time, what I would need it for.  I mean, I can't tell the difference between being on a normal broadband connection because  all I'm doing is going through web pages quickly and uploading and downloading piles of email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, Patrick's leaving.  We'll talk about this when Patrick comes on.  But Patrick has announced that he's leaving DLTV.  And his wife's having a baby.  His wife's having a baby.  I don't think he's leaving to raise the baby.  Is he?  I mean, he must be going somewhere else.  And my question for you is where?  Do you know?  Well, I'll ask him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Long silence.  Wasn't that long?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, we'll find out.  I'll ask him.  Patrick's, you know, that's his story.  We'll ask him.  He's not going to tell you.  Bubble 2.0 coming soon, says John C. Dvorak.  Wait, how can, wait a minute, John.  You're saying that the boom cycle we're in right now, and we're seeing it, boy, in media,  what we've just been talking about, you're saying that's kind of a mirror of what happened  in 1999?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not right now.  This is a mirror of kind of what happened in 1997 when Netscape appeared.  But see, the difference is there are those big IPOs.  We've got a ways to go before this gets crazy.  This isn't crazy yet.  It's just kind of nutty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you think there will be another one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You can see it coming.  I mean, look around.  But there won't be the IPOs.  I mean, what Prager's talking about, they're building studios.  Building studios.  People are spending money.  Disney just bought the little game company.  Hang with them.  They're going to buy three guys for $700 million.  Yeah, that's amazing.  They couldn't do it themselves.  I mean, it's one thing after another, and it's just going to continue to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't the difference that there are no IPOs, doesn't that change the quality of it  considerably because there's no pressure from stockholders to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to IPO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  It seems like it, doesn't it?  I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have any insider knowledge.  Nobody wants to IPO until they get repeal Sarbanes-Oxley.  But in the meantime, there's all this privatization stuff going on.  There's these big come.  I mean, it's just that what difference does it make?  You can IPO for the $700 million or you can have a.  But you don't have the crash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have the crash if you don't IPO.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you're not public.  There's no stock to crash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As long as your parent company has deep pockets or you have enough VC money.  You just go out of business, but there's no crash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no crash.  The crash wasn't just a bunch of dot com companies.  The whole market crashed and is what is going to happen again.  And what exacerbates it is the following scenario.  Not necessarily these dot com companies being bought up by Disney, but by the fact that  these big privatization companies, the KKRs and all these other guys are buying up all  this stock and they're taking millions and millions and millions of shares of stock off  the market.  And since everything is supply and demand, the whole market is just going to go up just  naturally and it's going to make it just kind of a weirder bubble.  And then these all these privatization companies are going to start dumping these once they  can figure out how to do it.  They're going to start dumping all these little companies that they bought up back on the  market.  There's going to be too many IPOs.  It's going to go nuts for a while.  This will be in a couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you say there will be IPOs.  Yeah, eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's no liquidity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no liquidity without a market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Until the Sarbanes-Oxley thing is straightened out.  I have another column that you probably didn't read, which is called repeal Sarbanes-Oxley,  which I read in MarketWatch, which is really the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you quickly re-explain Sarbanes-Oxley?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Sarbanes-Oxley, which is also known by me as the Public Accountants and Auditors  Protection Act of 2002, is a system that is put in place to protect not the public, but  big auditing and accounting firms from the debacle that took place when MCI and Enron  and all these companies went out of business.  All these bean counters who were supposed to monitor all this stuff were going, ah,  well, you didn't know.  We got fooled.  And so now this law was placed to make it so that it essentially takes those guys out  of the picture.  It's not really their responsibility anymore to actually audit or keep track of a company.  The company has to do all this extra bookkeeping.  And the overhead is believed to be about 4% of the profits of any American company.  Any American public company loses 4% off the bottom line because of all the requirements  of this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So nobody wants to go public as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And you're responsible for all kinds of weird stuff.  You can't talk anymore.  This is why it's kind of ruining the business.  People can't say anything to anyone.  I mean, it was always somewhat restrictive, but now it's unbelievable.  So it's just a mess.  So most of these companies doing IPOs, they're doing them in the London Stock Exchange or  they're going up to Canada or they're going anyplace because it's just the American system  is not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are in a boom.  I mean, there's no question we're in a boom.  And maybe there is even irrational exuberance.  I mean, when you see Disney, 350 million, no, 300 million down and another 350 million  over the next two years if they meet user targets for this penguin.  What is it?  Happy Penguin.  Club Penguin.  Club Penguin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually I went and checked it out.  It's actually a really nice site.  It's very sticky.  They've got a few of a kid who's they got some games on there you can play.  But if you're a kid or you have if you're a parent with a 12 year old or 10 year old  or a nine year old, you can put them on the sites and not worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of talk about the goof phone this week.  Wall Street Journal saying that Google has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to develop  a phone platform that they've been pitching T-Mobile and Verizon and other wireless companies  in the US and Europe trying to set it up.  They want a wireless service and they say it'll be ad based.  A little bit of credence lent to this by Eric Schmidt talking at the D conference saying  that he expected that there would be twice as much to make an advertising on phones than  there is on regular online, at least.  That makes sense because if they have GPS in there, they know where you are, they know  what you're doing.  They could now they've got to be subtle about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to be really annoying.  People are going to hate this.  That's they got to solve that.  I mean, you're walking past the store and the thing comes up.  Hey, would you like to buy a thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're next door.  We're right here.  I see you.  Come on.  Hey, where are you going?  Come back here.  Hey.  It could be really annoying.  But Google's good at subtlety, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they?  Are they really?  Are they really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's very interesting.  I just love watching Google.  I love watching the strategic way they're developing their business.  So far, they've done a good job, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's no denying that.  But how long can this go on?  How come nobody can copy what they're doing?  I mean, it's not rocket science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think they have, you know what I think?  One of their keys to their success, they have a very clear vision of what their business  is.  Everything they've done up to this point, even though it seems initially far afield,  things like the spreadsheet and the office is really all about their core business, which  is frankly advertising.  And they got a handle on it.  I think they're building eyeballs and they're building a great ad platform and they're just  pulling ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pulling ahead of who?  You and me.  Pulling ahead of Microsoft.  Microsoft.  Well, they're pulling ahead of us, that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, look what Microsoft's doing.  They're thinking about doing an ad-supported version of Microsoft Works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I don't get why Microsoft feels that it has to, you know, Google, you know,  Microsoft's one of those companies.  Because Google did it.  Oh, Google did it.  We don't have to do it.  Google did it.  We have to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All Apple did it.  We have to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guarantee you that's the thinking.  I think Google documents are really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It works.  I use Google spreadsheet all the time.  In fact, it's a great way to share spreadsheets.  You know, we use it all the time for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe I may have been the first person to write about Google documents when it was  called Rightly.  Rightly was very cool.  It was the same thing.  It's what they bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in a way though, I mean, they Google-ized it so it doesn't look as cool as it used to,  but it's still the same underlying technology.  Did you get an invitation for Apple's event on Tuesday?  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't get one.  I was actually...  They don't like...  Apple doesn't like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm blackballed.  Where is it?  A Moscone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a mini event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a town hall.  It's going to be nuts.  And they're going to roll out some new, thinner iMacs and that's going to be the end of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be new iMacs.  They say...  This was interesting because usually they email it.  In fact, I was doing Mac Break Weekly and I kept looking for the email because the rumors  are flying and Gadget was saying, yeah, we just got our invite.  And I said, where's my invite?  Turns out I had the phone off.  They called during the taping.  You can never reach me because I'm always recording something.  But they were very clear.  The person who called me from Apple said, this is not iPhone and it's not iPod.  It's a Mac-based announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't think...  Is it new processor chips inside of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a new design for the iMac is what everybody seems to think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's supposed to be thinner and lighter and they may have a big giant screen version.  Brushed metal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, brushed metal.  Wouldn't it be nice?  Something like the 30 inch monitor, if that were an iMac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  I heard that that's a possibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be a pretty amazing product.  They need to do something because that really, frankly, the Mac crowd, and I include myself  in this, is a little worried because of Apple's focus on the consumer marketplace with the  iPod and the iPhone that Apple may be kind of getting out of the computer business.  They dropped a computer from their name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it's...  The days are numbered for you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But where...  You mean I have to buy Windows?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vista?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  My first iPhone update came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I just got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had to do it because at Black Hat, these hackers were going to tell the world how to  hack the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I just grabbed this little GUI application that lets you hack it.  It's called iFuntastic.  I don't know if you've seen that.  What's it do?  What it lets you do is it lets you quote unquote, unjail the phone.  It lets you transfer MP3 files over to it to use as ringtones.  Oh, I want to do that.  It lets you reorganize what the homepage looks like, remove the icons, reorder them, icons  in any order you want, and then it lets you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, will you do this to your phone and let me know if it works?  Because I don't want to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did stick it on my phone.  It lets you...  You might see on the upper left, it says AT&T next to how good signal you have.  You can modify that logo to be anything you want as long as it conforms within the size.  Signal sucks.  No, well, no.  Instead of saying AT&T, you could make it say Twitter.  You could make it say anything you want.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  I want a Twitch phone.  Yeah, you could easily do that.  I did just that.  Nothing outrageous doesn't let do anything outrageous either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it didn't break your phone.  That's all I'm concerned about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's fun and it's easier than what was released before, I think, before you had to go through  a significant amount of additional command line operations.  Major stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  iTunes store, 3 billionth song sold.  Six months to 3 billion.  That's pretty fast.  It took them two years to get to the first billion, a year to get the second billion,  six months just to get to the third billion.  Now the number three music retailer online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The number three?  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Number three in the world, including brick and mortar.  Walmart, Best Buy, Apple.  Walmart, Best Buy, Apple, then Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think the music industry is still selling far, far, far fewer music.  They still don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The music industry is so clueless.  It's so sad.  Yeah, they're suing everybody left and right.  M&M's suing Apple.  Why would M&M's sue Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think in this case this is legit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For copyright infringement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says because they used them in an ad.  Isn't that the reason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It's because he says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's often an ad.  You can't start just using anybody's images in an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's not it.  No, I'm sure they paid him for the ad.  He's saying it's copyright infringement because they're selling his music online.  He said...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it was because it was in an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  M&M's music publishers have not given Apple permission to offer the artist's music for  downloads.  See now normally the label is who's responsible.  The label distributes.  The label makes the deal.  But apparently what's happening is Apple is paying its revenue, shared universal music  group which publishes M&M's music, but not to the music publishers and the people who  own the rights to the sheet music.  So 8 Mile Style and Martin Affiliated, the companies representing M&M demand that Apple  stop offering downloads of his music.  I guess it's reasonable for them to say we want some of this money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're probably not getting it then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're right.  You know what?  I'm reading more of the article.  He did sue them over using Lose Yourself in an Apple commercial.  Whoa, they used it and didn't pay him?  I would just say it was a great commercial.  Remember that great commercial?  The guy walking down the street and...  You got to lose yourself in the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's a great song I think, but I'm just blown away that they didn't think about it.  They settled out of court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we don't know, but obviously Apple said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's what started the feud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?  When we were putting together the Giga Ohm show, I originally wanted the theme song of  the show to be the biggie small song Mo Money Mo Problems.  Good, I like it.  And it's been sampled by a couple.  I thought that'd be really funny and kind of cool.  How much do they want?  So what they wanted...  I had a friend of mine in New York who does music licensing and she spent a lot of time  trying to figure out all the different owners of the different stuff because some of it  was sampled.  Long story short, they wanted upwards of $2,000 an episode.  An episode to license it.  And so say we put out anywhere near 50 episodes a year if we did it most every week, that's  It's like 100 grand just for the opening music.  So I was like, no way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's more than Audible pays us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I was surprised especially for, you know, it's an online show, but you know, online  shows are getting closer.  They don't have a clue that there's a difference here.  And then apparently also you got to tell them, you know, this stuff, once you put it out  on the internet, it's kind of out there.  You can't use it for a three week window and then make it go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got 13 weeks rights, then you have to pull all the cops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we're doing a deal with, I think we're about to do a deal with APM so we can use  some of their music in some of our productions.  And so they're actually forward thinking and saying, OK, we understand that these things  we're not going to be able to give you a window of time to use a specific track, because  once you release the episode, it's kind of out there.  Yeah. As you know, video on demand, which means on demand could be a year from now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So how do you like this guy suing Apple saying,  you didn't tell me that the iPhone battery couldn't be replaced.  That's stupid. That's stupid is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't the why don't the courts throw things like that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, isn't there what isn't there that slap thing?  Maybe it's only in California where you can if you file a frivolous lawsuit,  you may be forced to pay illegal expenses for defending it.  But they ought to have if it's not apparently it's in California only,  they sure ought to have it everywhere. It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Didn't the iPhone is going to have problems, I think, with their battery  eventually pretty darn soon.  I mean, I'm I've got one. I'm already I have to charge every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do. I've been I've been having a great battery.  I mean, really better than most of my other phones. Yeah.  I mean, maybe.  But every smartphone you charge every day.  But this thing, I could go a couple of days. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I'm already I make sure that I turn the Wi-Fi off on it  if I'm not in range of anything, because I keep thinking maybe it's searching for  and it keeps eating up. Yes, I turn off turn the turn off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I turn off. I turn all kinds of crap.  No, I leave the Bluetooth on, but I would turn off the look for Wi-Fi networks.  Turn that off. Absolutely.  I think that does kill the battery.  But I leave the Wi-Fi on just just the thing where it says  look for networks.  Mm hmm.  Modchipper's Bluetooth.  Modchipper's busted in nationwide raids.  16 states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Operation is a ridiculous story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Operation tangled web. Why, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the point of wasting government resources on a bunch of jerkoffs  that have little mod chips in their video game consoles?  You know, but they're going to 32 states and they all I think they have.  They got like 50 people.  I don't even know how they found them.  I guess they were on a mailing list somewhere and they go  cracking into the house and OK, hands behind your head.  You got a mod chip.  Give me a break.  Is this a good use of the government taxpayer money?  Or what are we talking about here?  Fascist America?  I love this ridiculous story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Julie Myers, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security.  Illicit devices like the ones targeted today are created  with one purpose in mind, subverting copyright protections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's that got to do with homeland security?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because if we let people steal PlayStation three games, the terrorists win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Looks like they won already with these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I think two words or in hatch.  You know, I think frankly, I got it, but  I think companies like Microsoft and Sony probably pour a lot of money  into political campaigns to make sure that the FBI and Homeland Security  keep copyright infringement on top of the top of mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just playing all these out of region DVDs has got them all pissed off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate that. I hate it when people do that.  We're losing millions.  And you're right, John, this mod ship is a tiny business.  It's a it's difficult.  No one. I mean, you know, it's a fraction of one percent of all users use this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just baffling to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John, you want to take off? It is four thirty one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll give you a couple more minutes and I'll blast off.  You're a good man.  And you shouldn't be giving the time on this show, Leo.  This is on demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could be at four thirty one and.  Three one in the morning.  We don't know what time it is.  I love this. We didn't.  I don't think we talked about it.  The secretary of state of California, Deborah Bowen,  who is actually pretty sophisticated technology wise,  I used to talk to her a lot on my radio show on KFI because she was a Southland  assemblywoman before she was secretary of state,  funded some University of California, Berkley, Berkley hackers,  gave them all the information she had about a variety of electronic voting machines.  She said, go at it.  They hacked them all, every one of them.  Every one of them was hacked.  And and it really and she's now she has to decide if she's going to certify  these for California state elections.  But the good news is.  The House of Representatives in the US was paying attention to this,  and they have now agreed on a compromise bill.  Banning paperless voting machines and requiring the one thing  that every expert recommends, a voter verified paper record for every vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't don't understand how that disappeared to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hallelujah. Hallelujah.  This is the first time I've actually had any good news to report from Congress at all.  That's that's fantastic.  I mean, I think it was this California research.  I mean, this it was all three of the top systems, too.  It wasn't just Debold. It was all of them easily hacked.  So let's hope that this bill goes through HR  811, the Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act of 2007.  And with any luck, this will become the law of the land.  We got a big election coming up. I think it's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, a non-tech story also in the political realm is  but it's tech a little bit is because everyone hated Ted Stevens back  with his tubes. Yes, Ted got his.  Tobs is not a truck.  And now he's getting now he's getting investigated  and getting his house raided in Alaska for apparently having unethical  relationships with oil contractors doing, I don't know, doing building,  building add ons to his house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, crap. Yeah.  They built onto his house and then amazingly got some law in their favor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, but I just see in all the tech circles, everyone's secretly  really excited about Ted Stevens getting in or getting closer.  Getting his comeuppance. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The FBI pulled that big truck right up to his house.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And that would be fun to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know, the thing is, everyone knew there's something weird was going on  when he was promoting that bridge to nowhere.  Right. There's always been the suspicion that he's been on the take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Suspicion, allegedly.  IBM, allegedly, I don't want to get suited.  You know, I finally, on one of our other podcasts, Scott Bourne,  who does the Mac Break Weekly said, you know, you we need to have a disclaimer  on every podcast that says, wait a minute, I got to read this disclaimer  that some or all of the participants may have stock in some or all of the  maybe I got to find this disclaimer.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to read a disclaimer.  Any or all of the contributors, any or all of the contributors to Twitnet  cast their families, agents, heirs or assigns may hold positions in securities  registered to publicly traded companies mentioned on the Twit network.  Thank you very much.  He got me so scared. I filed for an LLC.  I said, geez, Louise.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not going to help.  It's not that kind of thing.  No, not for not for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, my SEC, I don't care if I go to jail.  I just don't want to lose the house.  For SEC violations, because it would be like,  would it be like Rico Act, they could take everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so. I mean, basically, you get fined.  Take my iPhone and the profits you made from your corrupt.  Did Martha Stewart spend some time in?  No, she spent time because she lied to somebody when they asked her  a simple question.  OK, so tell the truth. Another weird law.  Now you have you can't you give the government the gendarme show up.  You have to tell them the truth no matter what.  What you should say, of course, is I'm not telling you anything.  I got a lawyer and then have the lawyer do the talking.  Remember that because they, you know, can lie for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lawyers are allowed legally to lie for you.  Just point that out. They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope they can they can perjure themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not perjury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Perjury under oath for perjury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not perjury. It's just it's just lawyer ease lawyers.  They look out for each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it because it's attorney client privilege, therefore they don't have to  disclose that they're lying?  You say, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not lying. Nobody lies.  You're not supposed to lie.  Do not lie, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell the truth or you could be like Martha Stewart, who is on the cover  of Wired magazine this month with a cake in the shape of a we, I might add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's go back to the story.  Balmer, we are hell bent on succeeding in ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are. I think we talked about this last week, but it's worth repeating.  Balmer says we are hell bent in succeeding in online advertising.  This is well, you know a little bit about this, David Prager.  I think there was a little heat  from some of the diggers that dig fired Google and went with Microsoft's  online ads, which I think I don't think it's just a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google, I think I think it was more of Dig signing a pretty  significant contract with with Microsoft.  It wasn't. It was.  We're. Yeah, I was going to.  I was going to say who was more firing.  I don't know if it was firing the federal.  They were using Google and FM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were using both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And now it's pretty much, you know, we're going to use  Microsoft for the majority of it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does Microsoft do for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I don't know the details of what they did, but I'm  I'm pretty certain that, you know, they signed a pretty hefty deal  that, you know, let Microsoft, you know, have most of the say on  advertising on there.  So I think it was a pretty positive thing for them, because  I think they went to dig and said, hey, we want to offer you a pile of money  to be able to do some of this.  And I'm sure there was a lot of negotiation went on, but I'm thinking  it was a pretty exciting thing for dig to do otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They wouldn't have done it.  I'm sure there's a lot of money involved.  That's you know, it's a profit thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And then, you know, I think  I don't know, Jay was over at that.  Jay Adelson was over at that conference in Idaho at the Allen Conference,  I think it's called. Yeah.  It's a lot of big wigs over there.  I apparently conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where you meet Rupert Murdoch and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. He said, yeah, he was hanging out in some place.  So he sat down and chatted with him for a few minutes.  And I don't know, it's interesting.  You're walking down. It's like going backstage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you go to a rock concert, you go back.  Oh, I get a backstage special. Oh, boy.  And you go back there and it's like, you don't know these people.  It's bad stage without the groupies.  You got nothing to talk to him about.  You know, I mean, what are you going to say to Rupert Murdoch  if you run into him?  Hey, good work on that Dow Jones deal.  Good, good man.  I mean, what are you going to say to him?  You don't know him from Adam.  You don't know if he likes football or baseball.  So those kinds of conferences are always just I don't understand.  People just go there so they can be amongst them, each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I got to go to a sushi restaurant with Steve Chen,  one of the co-founders at YouTube right after the whole YouTube Google.  Or no, right after they got sued by Viacom.  And he kind of just sit there and think, well, so  what do you think about this whole one billion dollar Viacom lawsuit?  Does that sound like the question of the day to you or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it reminds me of there's something that's been floating around.  I was saw last night on television that, you know, Obama auctioned off  a dinner with himself, I guess, with six people.  They won, you know, they had to sit around.  So they were showing some clips from it.  And it's like six people that don't know him from Adam.  He doesn't know them.  It's maximally uncomfortable for everybody.  And they're he's just trying to keep the conversation going.  They're asking stupid questions.  You look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Warren Warren Buffett does it every year.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And it's usually some business guy.  It's very expensive, too. It's very expensive.  If you're successful enough as a businessman to be able to bid  half a million dollars to have dinner with Warren Buffett,  do you really need to pick his mind for advice to make another half a million dollars?  I don't know. It makes no sense at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had dinner with Warren.  You know, I bought the dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you ever done that, John?  Have you ever auctioned off, you know, dinner with Dvorak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who wants dinner with Dvorak?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get it.  I mean, occasionally there's a company with something to pitch me  that wants dinner with Dvorak, and that's about it.  But I mean, what's some, you know, I've been to baseball games with  with, you know, members of the public on certain situations.  There you go.  But there's an entertainment thing going on in your secondary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true. You don't have to.  I was on a in 1989 when the Giants won the Penn and I was the  I was working at the Giants radio station.  And so I was the titular head of the Giants fan club.  And we had to go on a cruise with the Giants.  Kevin Mitchell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You had to go or got to go?  Well, I got to go.  I was wondering which one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it was fun. I enjoyed it.  But Kevin Mitchell was a bunch of Giants  and they didn't want to meet the public at all.  So they just stayed in their state room.  They literally ate their meals in the state room.  And so as the only other person there who has anything to do with this,  I had to, you know,  just cozy up to all the pan patrons and, yeah, well, so glad you're here.  Oh, it was painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I went to the this last spring training.  I was down in Phoenix and I went to or Scottsdale, wherever where the A's go.  And I went to the owner's party.  That's fun.  Which all these players, you know, and you go there and then you realize  you got the same situation as going backstage with a rock band  you don't know personally.  And it's like, yeah, hi, you know, I'm, you know,  and they're, you know, these players are there with their wives.  I was like, who's this idiot?  You know, kind of thing. It's it's pretty it's grim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It works out pretty well with like the geek cruises, doesn't it?  Like, let's go there.  They're going there to see you guys talk about. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's lectures. That's very different.  That's a lot of fun.  I actually bailed on the last geek cruise and somebody wanted his money back.  Yeah, they actually had to give somebody his money back  because I bailed on the cruise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that guy wanted he obviously had a crush on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He wanted to meet me, be with me for a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, speaking about Federated Media, the the big ad network.  Did you see Morgan Webb's new show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, hey, yes, I did.  You know, I take credit for that.  Why? I ran into Morgan at the airport about two or three months ago.  She said contract with G4 is running out.  She was talking to them, some other people.  I said, Morgan, you don't need to be on.  You should be of all people.  You should be doing internet video.  You'd be huge. You'd be very successful.  You'd make a lot of money.  Write your own ticket.  Why are you why are you still working for people?  I said, I said, come work for her.  Come work for Twitter if you want.  But I think you could do this on your own.  She has she's put it all together and it's and you know what?  It's good. She's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually better than a lot of the stuff out there.  You know, the Mike Harrington gave him a big plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but her husband's an entrepreneur,  so it shouldn't be like a big problem to think about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's advertising on it already.  There's a lot of advertising on the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They did a big long partnership before.  Or not. I don't know how long they worked it through Federated Media.  So if Federated Media can't have an ad on the first thing,  then they're obviously failing.  And luckily, they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's it's quite good.  And it's rocket boomish.  But one of the big differences, which I and I commend them on this  there, good choice was it's somewhat like what we do.  Only it's five minutes, very quick talks about the news,  but they show the sites that she's quoting.  So they give credit to the blogs and so forth.  And I think that's great.  I think that's smart because the blogs will, you know, return the favor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure. Have you invited her onto on to Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have not. I will.  And but she's going to be on the radio show on Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So well, I sent her a note and said, hey, welcome to the the online world.  And I said that we always do all these  you know, cross promotions with, you know, other people.  We go on and we go on Ask An Engine, we go on all these other things.  And she said that she's totally open to do.  Oh, she would love to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, we've been talking.  In fact, I promised to have her on Twitter.  It's Web Alert with two bees dot com.  And, you know, it's she's smart to do this.  I think it's crazy not to.  In fact, you know, she and Adam were the last people still on  G4 after from oh, and Joshua Brentano behind the scenes from the tech TV days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Adam was there from the launch days.  The only talent is still talented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Day one. That's kind of pathetic.  It's kind of sad.  You know, I got a I got an email invitation to be on Attack of the Show.  And they said, I hope there's not too much baggage.  And I said, there's way too much baggage.  There's no way I'm going to be in Attack of the Show.  What are you crazy? Attack of the Show.  That's the six.  That's the name of the G4 show that they basically renamed the screensavers to.  There's no way I'm going to be on that.  I don't watch G4 at all.  That's the other thing.  I mean, I would do it.  I suppose if we're at the today show,  you know, if there were a huge audience, but  more people would hear about it than would watch it and would say,  well, I guess Leo's supporting G4 now.  I'm not going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll there be a YouTube clip.  Everyone would see it. Yeah, I want to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I want to thank audible.com for the support that they've given the network.  It's a natural relationship.  Audible is, of course, a wonderful way to read books on your iPod or MP3 player  cell phone. They work on hundreds of devices or on your computer.  You can even burn CDs.  This week's audible book.  I don't know if you guys have read this.  We talked at the beginning of the week about  Andrew Keene, the guy who says, oh, the Internet is just ruining culture.  And I wanted to give a opposing viewpoint.  Book by Don Tapscott, who I've known for some time,  Wikinomics, how mass collaboration changes everything.  Have you guys either of you read this book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I did. It's actually quite interesting, by the way.  Elton John agrees with the other guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I got to tell you about that story in just a second.  Talk about Elton John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you listen to these books in your car ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Well, when I was commuting to tech TV,  I would I would literally get three hours of reading done every single day.  I now I put it on my iPhone and that's just everywhere I go.  I listen to books.  I have listened to hundreds of these books. Audible.com slash  twit. It's if you want to get a credit toward a book free.  I believe it's US only, although it depends on the book.  But if you go to audible.com slash twit and search for Wikinomics,  W-I-K-I-N-O-M-I-C-S, that could be your free book.  Sign up and we thank you for your support and thank Audible for their support.  It's a great I am a major Audible fan.  I've been a customer for as long as they've been around.  I think I joined in the first few years of Audible  and I still listen to a lot of books.  Wikinomics is fascinating.  Actually, it's kind of like the wisdom of crowds,  which I should recommend is another Audible book I will do on another show.  I have a feeling.  I don't know. Has Kevin ever mentioned that there was wisdom of crowds  that inspired the dig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I always thought it was him reading slash dot and wanting to see all the other  submissions submitted stories to the editors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's the ones that didn't make it.  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's that makes sense.  There's a few factors, but that makes that makes a lot of a lot of sense.  So Sir Elton John says they should shut the Internet for five years.  What's the story, John?  You probably have it under work dot org slash blog. I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we did it as soon as it came out.  I mean, it's so funny.  He came up with this notion  that and then later admitted that there's no really too much about anything.  That's tech.  But he came up with this concept that the Internet, according to him,  is is keeping people from mixing,  you know, going out of the house and they're blogging too much.  And and it also is ruining music because people are doing music in their garage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're listening to too much music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, he just had it was just like this crackpot thing,  like, you know, saying that art and the reason for shutting down for five years  is so you can because the art scene will blossom, according to his thinking.  And it's just like, OK, well, this poor guy's insane.  It's just confused. He's only 60.  I mean, it shouldn't be this old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He and Ted Stevens should go off together and then go to the inner tubes,  go to the inner tubes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got to if you get a chance, type in, go to Google and type in  Onion Internet crash.  You'll find the the onion did a mock news story about the the web  crash of 07 when the entire Internet went down.  See, John was right. Really funny.  It's really funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the onion is so well done.  It's so funny. And it's often so subtle.  The following is brought to you by T.  Oh, I just started it by accident. I shouldn't have started the video.  It's so subtle that sometimes you believe it's real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I've never had that happen, but I can see.  OK, I'm a little stupid.  Maybe you, Leo. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean they really have the Internet got crashed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. Well, you know, the funny thing about the onion is they also have a print version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, like a print print, not just a web page,  but there's actually a newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can get it.  And they have it.  They said they distribute around San Francisco for one place.  That's how it started. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's great because it's free.  You can just pick it up in all these restaurants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It's along with the Examiner and there's the San Francisco Daily News.  We have like three or four free newspapers now in the Bay Area  because, you know, the real newspapers can't make any.  They're losing millions a week.  Yeah, I don't know how that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Strange. But the free ones are making money.  Who knows?  Doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the onion is making a decent amount of money just to get the following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The onion is this.  I mean, the onion is.  Let me see if I could skip through the commercial.  It's brought to you by TLC's new series.  LA Ink. LA Ink is open for business.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  They can pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it. They do this so well.  This is done like CNN and the graphics are good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As you may know, the entire Internet has crashed.  More now on our continuing coverage.  Welcome back.  Details are still emerging tonight about this evening's top story.  The government is still dealing with the repercussions of the fatal error message  that appeared on millions of computer screens worldwide less than two hours ago.  And just moments ago, FBI officials announced that they had traced the crash  of the Internet tonight to this man, Eric Tipton of Wallingford, Connecticut.  Tipton said he had more than 35 windows open on his computer at the time of the crash.  He had been downloading the Yola Tango discography from iTunes  while streaming several YouTube videos, listening to an NPR broadcast,  instant messaging his friends, checking three email accounts,  talking on Skype and playing online poker,  all while installing the latest version of Firefox and updating his system software.  You know what? Half of us have kind of done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. That's what I love about the Onion.  This is so well done.  And if you look at it, it's perfect.  I mean, it's a perfect parody. It could absolutely...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they do good work there, I have to say.  The funny thing is, by the way, the funny thing is when you mentioned Firefox,  I'm having more trouble with Firefox. Oh, it's very crashy.  2.0. Hanging up my system, crashing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually am very disappointed with 2.0.  And they've sent me notes saying, well, Leo, what's wrong?  Some of it is just the extensions.  You got to be careful about what extensions you install.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have that many extensions, but I'll tell you this.  Every once in a while, the system goes into a funk.  I go and I hit the control, alt, delete to look at what's chewing up my cycles.  And it's Firefox. Everybody knows this.  It hooks up to some ad server or something.  And then the next thing you know, it's just basically pinging it constantly.  And it didn't do that until 2.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, they keep putting out updates.  It seems like it's getting better.  So make sure you're updating it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder how many installs  Apple Safari has on PCs since they released it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, that thing doesn't work.  No, there's no point. I don't care what anybody...  You know, you have to have the sites.  Like if anybody out there with Safari on a PC, go to the KQED Channel 9  website in San Francisco.  The site doesn't even come up because it's got whatever kind of JavaScript  they're using. It doesn't even display that.  Safari is a complete disaster.  Don't blame Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if it's Safari's problem.  I think it's also frankly, a lot of sites aren't well designed.  Google has never been able to get Google's spreadsheet to work with Safari.  But it's not that Safari's... Safari adheres to web standards.  Doesn't work with Opera either.  Web standards from the 40s?  No, that's the problem is that many, you know,  Firefox and Internet Explorer, in fact, do things differently  than the web standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They all do things differently.  And if you take enough, you look at enough CSS.  Well, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to the ACID test, try the ACID test, because that works on Opera  and it works on Safari.  And it's the only two browsers it works on.  Well, all I know is, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that it doesn't make any difference when very few people are hearing to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because nobody...  Yeah, because everybody's using either Firefox or Internet Explorer.  So it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So but the point is, is that, you know, all these things render differently.  But the Safari is the...  I mean, I like it just slightly fast.  That's OK. But Opera's fast, too.  So I don't see any better than Opera.  It just doesn't work on a lot of sites.  And what different...  What good is it to go to a...  Use a browser that works, works, and then all of a sudden  you have to go load a different browser anyway,  because this one site won't even come up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I know.  That's why I use Firefox everywhere, because it at least has enough market  share now that every site seems to work in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually, Opera's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, see, again, Google spreadsheet will not work in Opera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, well, I agree.  Opera's a great browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I do. So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are going to...  Spend all your money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was really hoping to get Patrick on to explain where he's going,  what he's doing. He's having a baby.  That's great news. Congratulations, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought his wife was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.  That would have been a big news story.  All this time, you thought it was a little extra weight?  No, he's been pregnant.  Cat...  Oh, that's mean.  Oh, that's just that's cold.  See, if he were here, he could defend himself.  That's barrel chested.  And he's barrel.  He's what was it?  Greg Brannon said he's the he's the lunchbox crowd.  What is that dong? Is that a bell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's a wine glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say, do you have a Buddhist temple bell?  All right. That's the time.  Round two. It's time for round two.  And I must say, Dvorak does look good in a bikini.  John C. Dvorak is available on his blog at Dvorak.org slash blog.  Also writes for Market Watch, which is now a Rupert Murdoch company.  Congratulations, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Rupert. Now you're going to go shoot some hoops.  Is this the first time you've worked for Rupert?  Yep. And I'm a happy camper.  Now I've done everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He also appears in PC magazine and is a regular, really the star of Twitter.  So glad that we could get you, John, even though you have to run off.  Take that wine glass and imbibe.  That's beautiful. That's better than a Buddhist temple bell.  I feel like meditating now.  I keep it here now. I think it's beautiful.  David Prager is at revision three, which is about to rule the media world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will try to do some good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, David. It's good to talk to you both.  We thank you all for joining us as a short tweet,  but we'll be back next week with a longer one unless we're not.  Thanks for joining us. Another tweet is in the can.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should have paid attention. I don't know what I'm going to do.  Too much work. The problem is there's no limit.  My server's completely collapsed.  So here's the deal.  I'm just trying to get the thing up, but I have the hell of a time.  What what what blue screens like? Forget it.  I'm killing you.
