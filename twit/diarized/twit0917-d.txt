Transcript:  All right, literally the last it's time for our a our weekly AI segment never stops never ends  I'm I'm actually more curious rather than talking about the events in AI and there's there's a few quite a few  You know chat GPT Microsoft's AI is now available to almost everybody  I think everybody's been playing with it and discovering all new things Lawrence Abrams over a bleeping computer said he's found some hidden  celebrity modes  Chad GPT will  respond in the voice of your favorite celebrity whether it be the rock or Barack and  And it's so stupid. I can't even believe that he wrote an article about it  Yeah, everybody in the IRC is going

Transcript:  I wonder is now look you you can recuse yourself you work for Microsoft, but I'm kind of thinking  This is this is starting to look like a party trick more than an actual transformative  Technology, what's your thought Lou?

Start time: 366.01
End time: 425.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a good question  I think I see a lot of implementations of it like I look people who show it and online they through YouTube videos or whatnot  Of course, they're gonna show the parlor tricks. They're gonna show the things of stuff. That's really interesting  Generate a picture that you know from you know a mid guard and they're gonna go and or dolly and then they're gonna go  Feed it into a video so they can generate their own video and they're gonna generate text  So like it becomes a parlor trick after you see all those things  But I'll tell you I've you know  Obviously, I can't talk about a lot of the stuff that we're working on  But I can say that a lot of the things that will be coming out in the next you know  Fewer so are things that will directly impact everybody's lives whether it be business or and I'm talking about like  productivity to  you know to safety to  You know whatever you want to think about now look the things that are showing right now sure parlor tricks because it's the way  That they you know they get it out there  They get people interested or they get people thinking about it  But the reality is this stuff is is really gonna be interesting what people are gonna utilize it for

Transcript:  You agree Dan Moran I

Start time: 430.16
End time: 528.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think I think there's something to that. I mean, I think that the flash  Is gonna wear off like the novelty aspect right?  That's what comes out of the gate strong people are really interested to generate a lot of attention  But it's not the stuff that ultimately long term is really gonna be as useful when it comes to AI  I mean  I think despite all the fears that people are gonna use this to like write their papers for college or replace  Human workers, I mean I've heard of this happening on very small scales in a couple places  But I think ultimately the more  Interesting stuff that it can do just sort of generally when you throw it at a problem  I've seen a lot of like the the best sort of examples  I've seen of the utility of this is thing like honestly writing code like it just  Or being like an age or writing code because like I I work on code sometimes and I get stuck because I'm not like a program  It's not my main job  and I'm like man I need an algorithm that does X and  I am like I could bang my head and spend all my time Google searching and try to like  reconstruct it if nobody's done exactly what I've done or I could ask an AI like hey do you have an algorithm that does this and  Even if it's like 90% of the way there, that's pretty good and it saves me a lot of time  so I think there's a lot of cases like that where it's gonna be super useful for people trying to  Cut through all the noise, especially when it comes to like search  I think that's one of the reasons that  Google has felt very threatened by this is that if you can just ask a chat bot and get a pretty good answer along with  Like a source it really solves like I feel like Google these days  I type in search queries and I have to like just scroll through a lot of things and there's like  Oh, there's like 20 different sites and they all have their own opinion about the answer and like sometimes you just want to cut through  The noise and I think that's one of the things AI seems good at

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Father Robert you think Google is going oh we got to hurry up and get this barred out or going whoo  We dodged a bullet. Let's wait and see what happens

Start time: 538.70
End time: 594.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that they are taking the cautious approach which is good because hopefully somebody over there has looked at the trend and realize  This is just an advanced version  Maybe the final version of big data analytics that we had in 2013 in 2013  Data analytics came out and it was this idea of taking these huge data sets and building the tools to do predictive analysis  Based on the correlation between those data sets. That's essentially what today's AI does  It just uses these enormous data sets to be able to predict what human speech would be like or what the next bit of code  Should be like so there should be someone looking at that and saying this is useful  This will be something that we can monetize. This will be something that we can commercialize in these sectors  But it ain't AI and we got to stop calling it AI  Because we're scaring the people who are thinking that it's Skynet when really it's the next version of Siri

Start time: 597.45
End time: 681.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually think it's kind of more like autocorrect in your in your iPhones  You know, it's and it kind of fundamentally is the way it works and there was a great article we've mentioned before  By Stephen Wolfram and his Wolfram Alpha blog in which he described actually explained how these large language model works  And essentially it is, you know picking the next word  And then it ranks them and then it mixes it up a little bit  So it gives you a different result each time  But it's really kind of autocorrect on steroids on the other hand it does come up with some funny things  Thanks to our chat room for passing this tweet along from Ethan Malik  Bing write the first chapter of Genesis as a corporate memo to all employees from God CEO  Subject creation project status report dear team. I'm pleased to share with you the progress of our creation project for the past week  Here's a summary of what we've accomplished so far  On day one we initiated the light and darkness differentiation process  We branded the light as day and the night as darkness as night  This was a major milestone for our project as it established the basic framework for our work environment  And and on and on and I think it's actually a very interesting summary of Genesis  In a corporate memo  Therefore I hereby declare that tomorrow will be day seven of our project cycle  It will be a day of rest for all of us so congratulations we've just created artificially intelligent mad libs

Start time: 683.44
End time: 687.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes and I guess that's my point it's essentially it's it's it's mad libs isn't it?

Start time: 689.34
End time: 754.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's smart mad libs based on a very large corpus of of information the internet as a whole  But it's not much more than mad libs and it's certainly not intelligence  It's not thinking it's for sure not sentient as Blake Lamoyne thought it was  Thanks to Matt Ryder in our discourse or discord rather who asked chat GPT to write Leo Laporte podcast about the latest news in AI  How AI is changing the world from chat GPT to meta in this episode Leo Laporte shares some of the reason to be  How AI is changing the world from chat GPT to meta in this episode Leo Laporte shares some of the recent developments and trends in artificial intelligence that are shaping our future  He talks to experts and researchers about the hype and controversy surrounding chat GPT and AI system that could generate realistic text  Well that's a really telling phrase a realistic text on almost any topic  How is chat GPT being used for good and evil? What are the ethical and social implications of such a powerful technology?

Transcript:  This really steals the punchline from the wait did an AI write this?  No wait it did. Dang it. Dang it. It's not even a good joke anymore.

Start time: 761.84
End time: 787.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you watch so last Sunday this came to mind because last Sunday John Oliver on his this week tonight the main segment was AI  And he mocked first of all he mocked all the news reporters who are doing exactly that reading their you know their piece and then saying and by the way this was written by chat GPT haha  I did not do that you notice Dan I did I flipped

Start time: 787.58
End time: 796.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean the joke is on them everyone fell for that because we are expecting them not to have good copy  We know that what we get on social media is bad copy

Start time: 796.36
End time: 818.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah that's exactly what we expected from local news  But I was and Lisa will testify because we're we're watching this together and I was kind of yelling at the TV  Because he he made some fundamental errors one was confusing algorithms with AI  Lou you probably know more than anything as a programmer  That's the two different things aren't they?

Start time: 819.94
End time: 828.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean you get to use you know linear math and particular algorithms and formulas within that to be able to produce the models and train the models that you're actually using

Start time: 828.44
End time: 847.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you write a program fundamental algorithm right you write a program algorithmically to create these models  But what the computer is doing once it's it's running is not algorithmic or is it?  I've stumped him  Let's ask chat GPT

Start time: 850.23
End time: 863.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the sense that it's math it's algorithmic  But what we think of when we hear algorithmic is we think of the one that Google is using to rank search or Twitter is using to remove trollish content  That's much more linear

Start time: 865.18
End time: 933.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even as a coder I think yeah linear algebra that's algorithms you know  Dykstra's pathfinding algorithm you know two plus two algorithmic if then else algorithmic  I always I think of AI is something kind of beyond algorithms in this and this is another thing John Oliver brought up  Oh my god people don't know what the what the chat why the AI does what it does right it's a black box isn't it  It's not exactly algorithmic  Who to who though I mean it's recursive to the consumer it's a black box but even to the coder it's a black box you can't look at if you look at AlphaGo  The machine that learned to play chess better than humans by teach by the way all they did was teach it the rules of chess and then it played billions of games against itself over a period of four hours  Then became really good at chess better than any human at chess we don't we can't look inside of that model and and understand what the we can't  We can't in a way that humans can understand state what the rules are right I mean that is a black box from that point of view isn't it

Start time: 933.60
End time: 951.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It trained essentially trained itself so it fed its own training data and so I would say yeah you could go in and look at the training data that it's using to actually produce the the output that it's actually you know because it's running through these specific translation models  Transformation models in order to produce it so I would say yeah you could go and look inside the look at the data that it's using

Start time: 951.34
End time: 972.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right well you're the coder here so I'll I'll I'll defer to your expertise I always and I guess Oliver did get this part wrong I assumed that once you come up with these models you can't I mean you don't you can't look at them and say oh yeah I can see what it's doing here or can you I guess you can you're saying you can

Start time: 974.20
End time: 997.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean you can you can't you can't in real time but you can in like as as a as it builds it out you can look inside and look at all these things are I mean you said it's algorithmic yeah I mean it's machine learning in general is these large deep learning models that are algorithmic in nature and so they are definitive they're they're not they're not they're not redefining themselves as they move along there's the same it's unless you go somebody goes and redefine the model for themselves they're deterministic right deterministic correct

Start time: 999.64
End time: 1022.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah although in order to produce different results every time they've they add a little fuzzing right they add little probabilities to it right right but yeah okay have you have you done some of this coding this large language model stuff for me yeah yeah I think the really the interesting thing about this is that it's a very interesting thing

Start time: 1052.32
End time: 1081.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really it's actually really exciting even for somebody who hasn't you know done that stuff before and I've learned a lot like in a very short time so now okay you are our expert you are our AI congratulations I shouldn't say anything now you're our AI expert enough to be dangerous but I mean Lou this should this is right up Dynamics Alley right I mean if you're talking about a feature set that would be beneficial to a product Dynamics is one of those where it would be great it does exactly

Start time: 1082.40
End time: 1132.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what you would expect a CRM to do yes oh yeah I mean I could see lots of applications applied to CRMs to you know to ERPs to power apps to I mean there's just an endless set of features that can happen and I can promise you there will be an endless set of features that will come out that will go those things  is that what you're working on Lou now is Dynamics no I said we're gonna still work in the office so an office Microsoft office yep but I work in the developer side of things so the extensibility side of things and there's again just like Dan was saying there's endless opportunities there as well to be able to use these things to help you kind of bridge the gap and have an easier jump start and a lower barrier for you to get in and develop stuff as a developer and of course Microsoft has said that they're going to include chat GPT capabilities in office

Start time: 1134.24
End time: 1192.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so is so and copilot which is a github's version of this also Microsoft product is aimed at developers that copilot has now a brush mode right where you understand quite how it works is like a paintbrush mode is that is that how it works I don't know I actually don't know that okay you know more than me on that one yeah they announced it I read it I don't understand it so there's so many coming out like it's hard to keep track of but the idea was in  using copilot is you know you'd start writing some login code and much like Clippy it could finish it for you you wouldn't it would not be prudent although people paste stuff in from Stack Overflow all the time but I would think it would not be prudent to just accept it and say fine and move on even if it compiles it's not necessarily correct this is one thing we're learning about these big language models is they're not

Start time: 1194.38
End time: 1248.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they're not tuned for correct they make they make stuff up I mean stuff I think I was I was telling the story I think when we talked to Mac break Leo about how I basically asked it to summarize the plot of one of my novels and it just made up stuff like it was no way related to the plot I was like was it any good or no I'm going to say no I'm going to say no  alternate ending yeah this mess on my pal Chris Breen who used to be one of my colleagues at Macworld he a friend of his asked it about him and it told his friend that he had died and they saw that link yes provided a link to an obituary on Macworld and like I was reading this and like man the title reads like if Chris had died this is what the title of his obituary be but it was like a URL they gave a URL that went nowhere but it's like that was just disturbing.

Start time: 1249.26
End time: 1291.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And weird right it was made out no he's definitely dead and he's like no he isn't that's gotta be so weird to see that and think let me see if I can find it because yeah here's the Christopher Breen who is Christopher Breen from Macworld we know Chris because he's been on our shows many times Christopher Breen was a was a longtime editor and columnist at Macworld well known figure in the Apple community wrote extensively in a wide range of topics sadly Breen passed away in 2018 but his contributions to the tech journey  journalism world and his legacy as a trusted source of information and insight live on yeah because he's still alive that is I don't know how you get there from I mean wow.

Start time: 1292.26
End time: 1306.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the next generation of trolling people are going to figure out how to poison the data wells that these these AI models are drawing on and they're going to make just little tweaks so that when you make these these very popular GPT searches you're going to come up with the information you want them to find.

Start time: 1307.22
End time: 1328.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's the same thing back to Leo talking about autocorrect you right how many of the times have you ended up with autocorrect telling you to change something that's right right it gives you like it insists on writing we you know we LL when you're trying to type the word well you know and it's just you can type something wrong enough times and it'll be like well you keep typing it so it's probably right.

Start time: 1330.72
End time: 1354.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's talking right here is Chris Chris is responding to another mastodon to from a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana in information sciences in English and this being said hello this is being I see you're interested in Ted Underwood professor blogger Twitter user studies literary imagination and machine learning unfortunately he passed away on August 28th at his home.

Start time: 1355.70
End time: 1372.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's not to have an AI tell you a machine learning expert is dead because it feels like you're being like oh no I'm going to go ask an expert like oh no that that guy's dead no you shouldn't ask him about machine learning to which Ted toots terribly sad and I have to say I'm angry that I wasn't informed.

Start time: 1376.72
End time: 1400.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like Bruce Willis in the sixth sense I'm always the last to know wow wow I by the way immediately tried to figure out if I was dead but chat GPT says I'm still alive unfortunately so but maybe if I keep keep working at it you can make these things hallucinate how to do that yeah you can make have you been okay so you have a little bit of a hacker in you father Robert I do I do have you tried to have Mr.

Start time: 1401.50
End time: 1444.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This this a little bit not tried I have that's why I'm predicting that it's going to be the next frontier for trolling I mean it's it's not that hard once you start realizing especially with obscure topics where it's finding the information and and my life my professional life is obscure topics so you know I can I can very quickly find out where they have decided to train their models and then just a couple of tweaks and you can start changing some pretty big so it's helpful to have a little bit of a  helpful if you know what they're trained on correct oh no if you know what they're trained on you you have total control you can change that data set you can completely bone a model yeah bone bone not bone that's another thing.

Start time: 1448.50
End time: 1491.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Show title just want to be clear oh there's so many questions I want to ask but I'm gonna in the interest of good taste just stop stop right there yeah and people of course this is what trolls live for is owning the libs and other people right and so this is giving them a tool  there's a lot of schools worried about students using it we had the story last week of the science fiction magazine Clark's world that had to stop accepting open submissions because so many people were trying to get in their magazine with science fiction stories written by chat GPT.

Start time: 1491.88
End time: 1537.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me say as a science fiction author that's not like a like a route to a lot of money.  You might want to recalibrate your expectations a bit so yeah the editor said the reason this happened was because a lot of people want to get published maybe not make money but they do pay well Clark's world is one of the few venues left that actually pays like a pretty good rate so like there is an option but it is.  Yeah the flooding it is really gonna cause some problems this can cause problems for a lot of people who want to like legitimately try to get their foot in the door and they cannot sift through that many submissions right that's the problem they now have to go through an extra step of like trying to figure out like okay is this written by an AI or is this legitimate so.

Start time: 1538.48

Transcript:  We one of the one of the people who moderates my our forums said that one of our users is starting to put posts in there that are auto generated by chat GPT.  Is there how do you how can you tell is there an easy Lou is there some way to tell that something is a I written versus human written.

Start time: 1567.98
End time: 1581.02

A lot of his submit his work is reading submissions from his students and he's he was panicked because when he's heard about this tool is like is there a good way for me to figure out if something is.  Written by chat GPT and about three weeks into the semester he wrote me said never mind it's super easy if suddenly I can understand what the writing.

Transcript:  There's certain degree of formulaic nest to I mean in the stuff that i've read at least in chat GPT if you start asking questions it often phrases stuff and builds its arguments in the same way, I mean not dissimilar from how you're taught to write an essay, for example, in school like.  Maker you know opening thesis and they're supporting statements and then have your like conclusion that draws all together but it's a little too pat.  Right you know it's a little to write on target every single time.

Transcript:  So a few weeks ago when CNET got in trouble because a lot of their articles in the personal finance space were written by their own.  Ai which I think they call wordsmith we had Connie Guillermo the editor in chief of CNET on the show it was kind of coincidental we planned on having her on.  But she had just written a blog post explaining and you know not apologizing CNET has not said Oh, that was a mistake they backed down on doing it, but I think they're going to do more of it this week CNET file fired.  A significant number of its reporters and Connie well the verge who's been really hard on CNET says Connie Guillermo CNET editor in chief will step down I don't think it's a step down frankly she's now.  She has a VP role in charge of machine learning strategy at Red Ventures the private equity company that owns CNET.  I feel like she's actually that's kind of a promotion and I doubt we'll ever see Connie on our show again.  She was the IC at CNET for nine years.  She wrote that blog post somewhat defending it she was defensive of it on our show she said you know it's writing the articles that reporters don't want to write they're really dumb stories explainers and stuff, so we have the the Ai write it and then we have an editor review it for accuracy.  turns out quite a few stories on CNET were Ai written.  So now Connie is moved I don't think down I think up to be in charge of she's a senior vice president of Ai content strategy and editor in law at large there's a certain degree of like.

Transcript:  Are at large there's a certain degree of like or a burros happening here right yes I feel like so many of those pieces that are written those ago these are dumb and reporters don't want to write them and they're explainers.  But the reason and I speak from this as a freelance tech writer who has written these before the reason we write this in the first place is SEO.  Which is another algorithm that's determining what is get surfaced at the top so it's like we're feeding the algorithm by right having the algorithm other algorithms right more stuff.  To surface at the top of Google which feels like basically unsustainable because there's a certain point you're just going to be like well I don't none of this is relevant to me anymore.

Start time: 1844.80

Transcript:  Well and there's some algorithms gaming algorithms because the algorithm is based on you know the data set from the Internet if if half of the stuff it's reading in is stuff it wrote.  They're going to have talk about snake eating its own tail you're going to have this vicious history essentially yeah yeah I mean I feel like we should just like enclave or.

Is an AI version of Wikipedia around the corner where it's like but then would you know right like and would you trust and you shouldn't trust no absolutely not but how would you know right like if it seemed like it's all written and it seems logical and it's look.

I mean it is just basically spam at that point right effectively it's just but we can tell we look at spam and we know it's now yeah because it's because it's saying buy something or click this link but this is this is this the motive of this is much more subterranean we don't.

Determine how correct things are we do see mental hallucination like and be able to let customers do people users and you know people like.  verify that things are not correct or correct enough, so I think like I think that and people enough people are scared enough people are worried and again the parlor tricks are also kind of driving this a little bit.  Which is like you know, making sure things are correct and so that's why you know use you being used using a I more responsibly like around very specific tasks.  You know where you can guarantee that the output that you're going to get is going to really like, for instance.  Like you know i'm going to design a new slideshow or a new video and i'm going to use some of the designs of the AI gives me or something like that.  Like those are things that you can do you have to worry about fact checking you know, but telling it how much of a medicine, I need to take or or you know what medicines, I should be taking that kind of thing i'm not sure you should be trusting that right now like I think you should be going to a doctor obviously right.

You can ask it anything or you can ask it to make anything right that's the sign stuff where I think it gets a lot riskier than like.  An AI based tool that's built into another piece of software that's going to help you do something a particular task and is therefore sort of on guard has guard rails and is kind of specified to like.  We want to do this thing, but the fact that in order to get to that point, we have to invent these like sort of technologies that are so wide open that's like it can do whatever you ask it to do it's it's really you know.  The the other part of that is you can't put the genie back in the bottle right, I mean it's it's out it's here it's a thing that people are using and at that point, the question is how do you sort of.  deal with it or at least build up structures around it, whether it's technological or just sort of cultural to be able to know that it's there and sort of understand it.

The singularity is just a few decades off he wrote a book called the singularity is near he thought it would happen by 2045 he's now saying it's a few months off.  What is maybe we should explain what the singularity is what is the singularity wants to Robert you probably can give us a good definition of that.

Start time: 2300.10
End time: 2326.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This okay so nice science fiction definition of singularity is the creation of an artificial consciousness that can then give rise to other consciousness.  The minute that you have a an entity that you have created that can change itself can be self reflective and can procreate into other self reflective beings, you have a singularity.  I think that's like the most layman dumb down version i've got.

Start time: 2327.08
End time: 2351.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think see Kurzweil said it was when we develop I think you're right Robert that that's really the real singularity but didn't he say it was when we can't we can't distinguish machines from human.  But I think you're right Robert the thing that's really scary is if those machines can design the next generation of machines, because then it accelerates at.  You know geometric or maybe even.

Transcript:  It goes back to what you're saying it goes back to what you're saying Leo is you know not being able to predict.  Is singularity is the point is that point where you can no longer predict the output of this thing and and it will just continue to grow and learn on itself and re retrain itself and redo its things over and over again, and it just never stops you can't stop it there's no going back there's no reversing it that singularity.

Transcript:  You know it was it was a very smooth it was very smooth it didn't snuck up on me but.  stay away from.  Banting around yeah yeah oh gosh yes no it's it's very fun level is this idea that the singularity is actually it's not a creation of technology it's more of a zeitgeist once you have.  Human society rewriting its own history in this ever recursive loop of what is and is not true you've you've essentially created a singularity it has become its own self aware entity that is then rewriting what we believe to be true.  And again, I could have been too much grappa but when we woke up the next morning we're like oh that's okay let's put that down on the on the worksheet that that sounds interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

The people are worried because of the politics I think that's the key is like I think Dan brought it up a bunch of times is like these those are the things that are really worrying people.  And I think you know hopefully those will probably be reigned in a little bit more as as Simon I see things probably not doing some of the things they used to do before.  Yeah yeah.  There's chat GPT user perplexed AI these are all places that are like really reigned it in so that people can't go.  I have to say though it's not reassuring because the way they reigned in Bing chat was to say you can only ask it five questions the implication being any more than that it's going to hallucinate you're going to get weird answers.

In the future and for the moment we're going to limit it so they can do that but I I agree Lou I don't think it's necessarily imminent I think that the the.  I agree Lou I don't think it's necessarily imminent I think that the the I don't know perhaps misplaced I have a lot of faith in humanity and I think that there's a lot of you know stuff that again people sees on the sort of the flashy the obvious parts of that I think there's a lot of other stuff that's similar.  That is more worrying in some ways to I mean I think about like the rise of deep fakes the right like the fact that you can fake a lot of video like the fact that technology has really allowed us to do all this stuff and this is.  High comparison I think much less something that's going to a chat bot is not going to cause the singularity sorry I don't think it's happening I mean in a way we are living in the in if you'd ask somebody 50 years ago.

I came into this show you know really believe me it was a parlor trick it's nothing big no big deal Lou you started me on this down this road of maybe it is.  Now i'm scared.  i'm worried thanks Lou yeah done our job we gotta send somebody back in time to kill the machines before they get this point.

Transcript:  Yeah.  All right well you got you got some reading to do kids meanwhile while you're reading I'm gonna tell you about collide KOL IDE.  We need now more than ever we need collide collide is a.  Well best we put it be a device trust solution so that unsecured devices cannot access your apps collide has some big news if you're an octa user and I know many of you are collide can get your entire fleet to 100% compliance collide patches one of the major holes in zero trust architecture which is device.  Compliance think about your identity provider.  If it's doing its job only let's known devices log in the apps but just because the device is known doesn't mean it's in a secure state right.  Who learned this lately what big password company learned this lately just because you know that that device doesn't mean it's secure in fact plenty of the devices in your fleet probably shouldn't be trusted.  Maybe they're running on out of date OS versions maybe they've got unencrypted credentials lying around maybe they've been compromised if a device isn't compliant.  Or isn't running the collide agent well it's easy you just it can't access the organization sass apps or other resources.  The device user can't log into your company's cloud apps until they fix the problem on their end it's that simple.  So as an example a device will be blocked if an employee doesn't have an up to date browser.  Or using end user remediation you can have them fix that right and then they can get in it drives your fleet to 100% compliance and you your it guys and gals.  Don't have to worry about it the users do the remediation.  Without collide it teams have no way to solve these compliance issues or stop insecure devices from logging in with collide you can set and enforce compliance across your entire fleet yes it's truly cross platform macro.  Windows and Linux collide is unique in that it makes device compliance part of the authentication process if a user's logging with octa collide alerts them to compliance issues and prevents unsecured devices from logging in.  It's security you can feel good about because collide puts transparency and respect for users at the center of their product to sum it up collides method.  product to sum it up collides method means fewer support tickets for you less frustration for your users and, most importantly, 100% fleet compliance collide.  visit collide.com slash twit learn more book a demo collide.com slash twit if you're using octa you need collide.  Thank you so much for supporting this week in tech you support us right back by using that special address so they know you saw it here collide.com slash.  As long as we're talking about.  Last pass we learned a little bit more about the last pass breach.  Oh my.  I mean okay you know what one takeaway not to defend them exactly, but they were clearly very specifically targeted right, this was, and it was not a naive attack.  What we found out in a more recent blog post from last pass is that there were four dev ops guys who had the keys to the s3 buckets the keys to all those data backups.  One of the guys was working from home i'm reading between the lines he had a media client I think it was plex because plex had an unflaunched plex yeah.  He had a media compliant client so they they had already hacked last passes, you know enterprise stuff and they knew who these four people were.  Then they targeted the four people they got in through plex and co-opted this dev ops machine and got the keys.  This is a highly targeted attack so to some degree, I think i'm glad last pass revealed this they also revealed.  That the backups came from last December, which was really for me because I deleted my fault before then, but is information we all needed because those are the vaults that were exfiltrated.  Robert you're you're you're good at this kind of red teaming did you did you read the post and and and understand what went on.

Start time: 3133.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did so, yes, definitely targeted, this is a lot different than some of the other breaches that we read about where someone happens across an unsecured s3 bucket.  Or someone's credentials just get swept up into a list that gets sold and it it happened to land in the hands of someone who was able to use it to further their exploit.  This was someone who was specifically looking for access to the holy of holies at last pass they knew what they want, so I mean exactly they know what they wanted the first thing that I went to as insider I mean someone with some inside information about the company.  I just grunt of employees, someone who was fired by them or a contractor that lost their contract, because I mean just the the the the the per op that you need to get past it precludes just a group on the Internet deciding to take down last pass.

Start time: 3187.80
End time: 3206.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's interesting so they say a software engineers corporate laptop was compromised.  allowing the authorized threat actor to gain access to a cloud based development environment and steal source code technical information and internal secret, so that was the first incident.  So you're thinking that first incident was actually an insider.

Start time: 3208.28
End time: 3229.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's gotta be I mean I mean on either it's an inside information type deal or someone got extremely lucky so I just spear fish the heck out of that company and if they had I think last pass would have told us.  There was an attempt to spearfish the company back in so and so and one of them was successful that's not what they wrote this is all passive voice, it was compromised.

Start time: 3230.24
End time: 3261.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we don't know exactly how, but that first compromise which I think happened in June or July.  Was then what allowed the second compromise because once they had that information the threat actor targeted a senior DevOps engineer.  Exploiting a vulnerable third party program I think plex leverage the threat actor leverage the vulnerability deliver malware onto that DevOps engineers laptop bypassing existing controls and then ultimately gaming unauthorized access to the s3 buckets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah yeah yeah yeah so in a way that's bad news because it means they were actively going after the vaults.  It wasn't that they stumbled upon the vaults and all they have this now what do we do right you only go after the vaults if you're if you prepared to do what's next to compromise them.

Transcript:  So it has it was someone who had intimate knowledge of the inner workings of last pass it has someone who had inner knowledge of their code base.  I mean honestly and that's that's proprietary so if I were last pass i'd be looking down who did we fire in the last two years.

Start time: 3306.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They got DevOps secrets restricted secrets that were used to gain access to the cloud based backup storage they they got cloud based information and configuration data API secrets.  Third party integrations third party integration secrets customer metadata backups of all customer vault data that's that's the phrase we finally we were waiting to hear they kind of.  danced around it in their last blog post they got it all they got all customer vault data.  All sensitive vault data other than URLs file paths to install last pass windows or macOS software and certain use cases involving email addresses were encrypted.  Using zero knowledge and can only be decrypted with a unique encryption key, but we know you know people don't use strong master passwords because they need to remember them.  And we also know that the key derivative function last past used was often set to a far too low number for modern attack vectors.

Transcript:  Now there's a bellwether here Leo if we start to see a lot of random incursions on millions of accounts, then it's possible that this this was someone who.  Someone who maybe they had some in for insider information, but they really intended to sell this information if we don't see that and instead this just really is the death knell for last pass.  that's a pretty good indicator of what the intent of the attack was it was.  Oh, you oh cell information or was it intact.

Start time: 3402.68
End time: 3435.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting I hadn't even thought of that yeah because we as far as we know there was only one case with somebody who's suing last pass saying their crypto keys were stolen and you know how it is with crypto.  So many other ways that can happen we haven't seen any as far as I know we've nobody said oh yeah they must have gotten my vault because i've been attacked.  So maybe that lets credence to your second scenario that it wasn't about getting the vaults it was about putting last pass out of this drawing trust in the company yeah holy cow.  A competitor.

If it were somebody who was trying to kill that company.  We because last pass was a sponsor for so long so many of our listeners and our last pass customers we still use last pass enterprise here at twit we're trying to move trying to move off to bit warden but it's a non trivial process bit warns a sponsor now.  boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really, I mean we gotta be a little bit hard on them, though I mean there's some of the things that they've published that bad choices yeah they made bad choices like letting people with devices access their their most prize secrets without.  You know locking these things down on you know I they did say work laptops or devices, but the reality is these machines that they're allowed to access this type of data should be a lot more locked down and even a work laptop right, so I think there's stuff like that that I.

Start time: 3592.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really lack security practices, I think in my eyes for a lot of things they were doing I also blame them for not encrypting things like URLs there's a lot of metadata that other companies encrypt that last past did not encrypt but.  You know I mean they were following best practices with the with the password vault as far as we know.  Wow okay you came you just you just gave us a.  Something to think about there Robert very interesting I think you might be right now that we know a little more about what happened I think you might be right.  You'll be glad to know that if you're a Xbox fan that Microsoft is a set to win approval from the EU on their merger with Activision.  Now they still have to get it through the US regulatory body, in fact, the FTC has sued them, and I think it's August before we'll see an administrative judge weigh in on this, but I think that's a good time to get into the.  Sue them and I think it's August before we'll see an administrative judge weigh in on this, but according to Reuters Microsoft is expected to secure EU trust approval.  For its acquisition of Activision with and the reason is Microsoft offered a licensing deal to rivals this you know honestly let's face it let's be honest this was Sony.  Complaining about the acquisition worried that Call of Duty would know it will become an exclusive and no longer be available on the PS5 Microsoft did everything they could to reassure Sony but Sony really.  went for the jugular.  So Microsoft is apparently I would bet, making licensing deals they already offered it to to Sony they offered them to Nintendo.  In addition to licensing deal for rivals Microsoft it's ready says may also have to offer other behavioral remedies to lay concerns of other parties and Sony.  Their sources said such remedies typically refer to the future conduct of the merged company is it just exclusives I think it's just exclusives that Sony is worried about.

Start time: 3717.80
End time: 3733.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well okay the best part about this story is not just that they're going to this approval is going to go through it's the fact that the EU Commission has now turned around and asked Sony.  could provide some information about their exclusivity horrible about exclusives right far worse than Microsoft.

Start time: 3743.12
End time: 3771.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's also one of those tricky word like I mean it's essentially a two company market right I mean i'm going to set Nintendo aside here for a moment because Nintendo is great, but is kind of their own thing and people buying a console or not comparing a switch to a PlayStation or an Xbox really.  So you're saying it's really Xbox versus PS5 or PS and PlayStation and that's really in the high end console market absolutely because Microsoft is said wanted Activision not so much for that but before mobile.

Start time: 3772.20
End time: 3801.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That they wanted to get into mobile gaming and if you include that then you've got 10 cent you've got a bunch of other companies Microsoft is only they buy out their you know their calculations.  You've got a bunch of other companies Microsoft is only they buy out their you know their calculations this would only make them the third largest gaming company in the world.  Okay interesting well we'll see we'll see what the US does.  We are we are we rooting for this merger or not.

End time: 3837.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really want to go through no love laws for Sony I agree with you I feel like i'm generally just against most of the consolidation in all of these industries and so from a principal standpoint I feel like.  These companies just keep getting so big and I feel like despite despite the like you know behavioral remedies and the stuff oh yeah I promise that you're going to do this down the road those things always end up getting broken like that's just.  Like that's just I feel like in a lot of those cases they just get it for like five 10 years 10 years 10 years yeah yeah it's fine and then like.

Start time: 3865.86
End time: 3884.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm kind of with you against consolidation but is it maybe it's the case that gaming requires so much capital nowadays and takes so long that you have to be a big you don't see small indie.  Certainly not triple A titles from small indie companies anymore right or maybe you need a movie studio triple A studios it's like a movie studio movies yeah yeah.

Transcript:  I'm one would hope at least if nothing else Microsoft could do better by the employees I feel like that's that's the place where a lot of these.  Game companies are really running a foul and should be looked into is is the amount of the use of crunch all this stuff where it's just they work these people to the bone.  And they have really many of them really awful environments really toxic workplaces and i'd like to see you know Microsoft if they are going to end up acquiring Activision.

Although I tell you what Starbucks Amazon a lot of companies now under investigation by the NLRB for really mistreating employees in their attempts to unionize.

Transcript:  Right I mean this is the reason why unions were so you know gained in so much power in the earlier parts of this entry and stuff is to push back against that, because you need a counter balancing weight.  And then they just sort of got stomped out to a large degree, so I mean now you're seeing the pendulum swing start to swing a little bit back in that direction, which I hope so it needs to and honestly Amazon illegally fired a union organizer in New York City, according to the NLRB.

That by the time we pay whatever fine, it is that we have to pay it's going to have killed that movement to unionize so therefore it's worth it to us.

Actually no let's do a few more a few more stories I don't want to have too many commercials back to back here.  I do want to celebrate though a 50th anniversary 50 years ago.  The Xerox Alto this story from my triple spectrum we're still living in the Altos world it said the Alto transformed computer.  Listen to the lead I'm sitting in front of a computer looking at its graphical user interface with overlapping windows on a high resolution screen.  I interact with the computer by pointing and clicking with a mouse typing on a keyboard.  I'm using a word processor with the core features and functions of Word or Google Docs or Libra Office's writer along with an email client that could be mistaken for a simplified version of Apple Mail or Outlook or Thunderbird.  This computer runs other software written using object oriented programming.  Its networking capabilities can link me to other computers and high quality laser printers.  You're thinking so what my computer has all that too but the computer he's sitting in front of is a 50 year old meticulously restored Xerox Alto at the Computer History Museum.  It actually is running.  That's pretty awesome.

I read in either computer currents or the San Francisco Examiner there was an article by Dvorak and he was describing the first Macintosh and I remember there was some history about the word you know came from Xerox and so and so forth but there was a quote from Dvorak where he said I don't see these taking off because it uses this thing they call a mouse.  And I don't see anyone ever wanting to use a mouse.

Yeah there's a famous book you should probably read maybe do you still have those shares fumbling the future how Xerox invented then ignored the first personal computer.

Transcript:  The Alto I think was the thing that Steve Jobs saw saw in a tour of Xerox Park.  He certainly saw you know all of the concepts the overlapping windows the mice and stuff and went back.  He actually it's according to folklore.org which is Andy Hertzfeld's wonderful site about the early days of Apple.  Steve misinterpreted something he saw he thought he saw overlapping windows and he went back to the Macintosh team or I guess it was the Lisa team at the time and said they can do it.  We should be we should be doing this and it turned out that he misunderstood what he was seeing.  In fact they weren't they weren't doing it but weirdly enough.  The amazing talented team Andy Hertzfeld Bill Atkinson did create overlapping windows even though Xerox didn't do it at the time they did tiled windows.  So sometimes misinterpreting the future maybe even better.

Mac Adam I guess it was a Mac store Mac Adam had a van with a laser writer and would drive around and do portable desktop publishing.  He would come to you and you say I want my newsletter to have three fonts.  He could do it all.

Transcript:  Very slow.  Yeah.  Yeah it was.  Yeah.  I think the thing that's interesting is Apple was doing something that wasn't in the mainstream of computing at the time.  And so as a result a lot of the things Apple were doing it wasn't so much like this is the future.  It was like this is a society.  This is like the Amiga.  This is over in a corner somewhere because because you know the PC came out that was mainstream computing.  But I think over time Apple has kind of I mean shifted the Overton window.

These things always inform each other right.  Like they go back and forth.  Everybody sort of learns from what everybody else is doing and they drive the state.  Today I mean if you look at the stuff today despite you know I'm a Mac user I've been a Mac user for 35 years.  I've used Windows I've supported Windows in my previous career as an idea.  When you get down to it the details between the two are pretty small in terms of like yeah I could go use a Windows computer.  I'm not going to have a problem with it.

But I think it's now understood that they licensed it right.  It was OK.  They didn't steal it but they had some good ideas and thank goodness because Xerox never did capitalize on the Alto.  But here we are 50 years later on the 50th anniversary of the of the machine that changed everything.

Transcript:  Hello.  Say hi from the Holy Father.  Great to have all three of you on the show today.  Our show today brought to you by Decisions Decisions is a software platform a no code low code platform.  That's awesome.  It gives IT and business experts the tools they need to automate anything in the company within one no code platform.  You can you can take your business rules and make them into an app.  It could fix any business process prepare you to withstand economic uncertainty.  Everybody needs decisions in their tool belt.  Recession around the corner perhaps recession resilience requires some thought of deliberate management of resources and the flexibility to adapt at a moment's notice.  The decisions no code environment makes it easy for your team to collaborate to build and adjust workflows dynamic forms and decisioning processes that fit your unique and ever changing business needs.  This is especially important because you know the Lou mm's of the world are few and far between.  There's a real shortage of IT talent but decisions means even the decision makers can create their own software decisions.  I actually got a tour of this and I was blown away.  It's so cool decisions process automation software is a complete toolkit.  So if you're a developer you'll love it but even business users will love it without development experience because they can build applications and automations and there's no coding required the no code platform.  So powerful it includes robust rules and workflow engines a host of pre built integrations that connect to any legacy system via their API.  So you can actually talk to all the parts of your enterprise and it's easy to set this up with a simple drag and drop visual interface design decisions can be deployed in the cloud but you can also deploy it on prem.  You know I'll give you an example you may remember at the beginning of the pandemic the government said all right we're going to fund these PPP loans right and it was very quick it was almost overnight.  One of the country's largest private banks was able to jump on this they built an entire PPP loan application process for small businesses in two days and because they were first to market this all happened so quick they issued a billion dollars in loans even before the competitors could get started.  That's what no code can do for you decisions let you customize workflows to automate the small decisions producing faster results with greater accuracy.  Scale your business to better serve your customers reduce operational costs save your team valuable time another example.  One decisions customers Otis elevator you know Otis every time you get an elevator you see the words Otis right they actually have 2 million elevators and here's the problem they're all over the world.  And they often have different software systems running each of them Otis elevator took decisions and they implemented a single code base to do daily pulse checks on every single one of those elevators all over the world every day.  All over the world every day in seconds by finding potential problems before they occur you know that's important in the elevator business you avoid downtime you don't have people stuck in your elevators you can manage your service technicians effectively.  it's actually really good news if you're right in the notice elevator you're safe because they are keeping an eye on it, but only because decisions allowed them to write a tool that could cross all of those platforms all over the world and get those pulse checks in.  Every single day.  The durability of your businesses foundation will directly impact your performance your ability to survive you need to be nimble you need to be able to.  Make sure your business processes operate accurately you need to be able to encode what's in your brain those business rules and get them out there.  into software you need a foundation you need decisions the decisions automation platform provides a solution to any business challenge automating anything.  Changing everything to improve your company's speed to market to improve your financial growth your operational success just to survive in today's business climate you need to be smarter than the other guys.  Decisions is your tool they help industry leaders alleviate bottlenecks and automate pain points in their business, so you can do what you do best change the world make your business sing.  While decisions can run in the background and getting all that's busy work done to learn more about decisions no code automation platform.  You scope your free proof of concept go to decisions.com slash twit deci si o n s decisions like a decision this make the decision go to decisions.com.  slash twit we thank you so much for their support of this week in tech this when I got the demo is blown away it's amazing what they can do a whole app like that drag and drop decisions.com slash twit.  I don't know if this is a story or a press release biden's national cybersecurity strategy advocates tech regulation and software liability reform yeah good idea.  I mean, is it just an idea, or is it going to happen was released on Thursday, this is a.  Was released on Thursday, this is a.  Apparently been long awaited the White House's strategy for improving the security of computer systems yeah.  According to cyber scoop this represents a shift in how Washington approaches cybersecurity.  veering from the government's long standing emphasis on information sharing and collaboration.  Towards a more strictly regulated approach I guess so remember under Obama that was all about openness and getting the agencies to talk with one another and i'm not against that is it is it mutually exclusive security and information sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unfortunately, in the way that it's set up because so the way.  rewind back to the Obama administration and there was this big push and there was a lot of excitement that they were trying to get software companies to consider security during the development process and not as an add on afterwards right sound I remember that yep.  Which was a great it's a great idea I mean that's that's what they should aim for that's a philosophy that every developer should have in the back of their mind as they're starting a new project, unfortunately, the way that they did that was by compliance.  So they created a lot of regulations that said, well, if you don't do this and you don't do this and you don't do this we're going to find you or you won't be able to develop your project.  That would work, except for the fact that a lot of these companies still put out products that didn't work and then if it didn't work out they just went bankrupt.  So what they're trying to do now they're trying to say okay stop with the compliance we're going to make it easier for you to develop.  But we want to be in partnership, so we can share with you the best practices, these are the things that other manufacturers and other vendors that have created solutions for us have run into you should be considering them so.  In that sense, I like it because it's not just saying build a secure project it's build a secure project oh and here are 10 things that you really should be designing in at the start.  So better maybe I think you get more with the carrot than the stick in this particular circumstance.  Yeah and certainly we know our infrastructure, well we just talked about LastPass, I mean that's a private business but our infrastructure is in many cases not very well defended and secured.

Start time: 5020.36
End time: 5029.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see you nodding, Lou.  Yeah, I think the biggest thing is the fact that you have a lot of infrastructure that's not very well protected and secured.

Start time: 5029.36
End time: 5095.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The fact that you have a lot of infrastructure being run on the big four or five cloud service companies that are out there today.  And I think one thing this will definitely do and it did back in 2021 with the executive orders that came out was it pushes these companies to think more about security and they want to be compliant just like Audrey said they want to be compliant, they want to keep their contracts, they want to keep getting new ones and they want to keep maintaining that.  And then of course that also trickles down to the you know to enterprise, it's a small business as well.  And so I would say they're going to they're going to want to be compliant, they're going to follow the rules and they're going to try to do what's best.  And you know but the interesting thing is you don't hear a lot about you know you hear a lot about a little bit of Google, Microsoft, you don't hear a lot about Amazon doing these things.  You don't hear a lot about them following the executive order rules or whatever.  They don't really publicize themselves as being like the super cyber secure infrastructure.  But the reality is my guess is they're definitely doing it under the covers and I think it will definitely everyone will follow suit I think at this point.  Now will everyone do it like the last passes of the world?  That's the that's the question and maybe if they don't if they have regulation they might if they have fines they might.

Start time: 5095.32
End time: 5161.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well here's how here's how the Biden administration seems to want to implement this.  They said companies that make software must have the freedom to innovate.  But this is this is a cyber scoop calls us the third rail of cyber security.  But they must also be held liable when they fail to live up to the duty of care they owe consumers businesses or critical infrastructure providers.  They want software. It's kind of amazing that they haven't been liable.  But but but they want to make software makers liable for failures in cyber security which opens them up of course to lawsuits and fines.  And the industry is not too happy about that.  But you take one look at LastPass the potential danger of what happened in LastPass.  If I'm sure it's used in government I mean I don't know what what government uses for password managers but I wouldn't be surprised to hear last passes in there.  Certainly somebody is being used. Are they liable if they screw up like that.  By coming up. Sometimes it's not a screw up. Yeah that's true too. That's true too.

Start time: 5161.44
End time: 5194.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a scenario. I'm running a startup and I've got a service that a lot of people really enjoy using.  It gets very popular but I find that it's unsustainable.  The amount of money that I have to put into the infrastructure will never never be recovered.  And so I have to start shutting down the business.  At first I start laying off people maybe security gets a bit less.  I start having a couple of breaches. I lose trust. And now my company is dead.  It's worthless except for the customer information that I have.  And I can sell that. That's not so good. How do you find me if my company no longer exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brian Harrell former assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at DHS says exactly this.  It's not possible to eliminate all defects.  But right now there's little incentive beyond just general market reputation to invest in a dramatic reduction of cyber vulnerabilities.  Companies aren't being incented to keep their stuff secure.

Start time: 5220.32
End time: 5252.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's overall a risk too because there's so much more stuff. There's so much more data.  There's so much more things. There's so many more things we keep in our digital life.  Right. Like our phones contain our banking information and our pictures and all this stuff.  That's just so irreplaceable or damaging if it gets breached.  And what is the incentive if you just like leave it up to the market to decide and you'll pick the most secure solution.  Well that hasn't necessarily panned out.  Because you don't even know if it's secure too.  No. How do you know? Until it gets breached. No.  Everything is secure until it isn't.

Start time: 5253.78

Transcript:  So apparently this document basically says it's up to Congress.  And of course this is a very hot potato in Congress.  Among the challenges according to Cyberscoop, how to define the circumstances in which a company be held liable for vulnerable code.  And of course House of Representatives control rare Republicans who are historically against any regulatory regime.  So this might not be this may be an frankly a political non-starter but it is.  I don't know. Lou where do you sit? Should companies be liable for the security of their software?

Start time: 5292.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think one of the biggest things that I've really seen a shift in the enterprise and in all the different markets is GDPR.  This has been something that has really been a huge if you're a global company you've shifted your processes and your you know and how you handle data.  And of course the European Data Protection Board is also part of this as well as how they regulate stuff.  These have really pushed things in the right direction I think.  And I think you need some set of regulation and some to be able to be fined and feel like you're going to hit rock bottom unless you go and follow these rules.  I think there needs to be some regulation there that helps manage that.

Start time: 5328.30
End time: 5399.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I mean it's a shame that we sometimes and it seems more and more have to rely on Europe to make those rules because we don't have the will the political will to do so.  Michael Daniels CEO of Cyber Threat Alliance said I don't think we should just sort of throw up our hands and say Congress is dysfunctional and therefore we can't do anything.  There are things where you need Congress to act.  He says do I have any illusions that it'll be simple or easy or fast? Of course not.  But at least the White House is pushing for this right.  Historically the software industry has not been a fan of liability reform.  Victoria Espinal President and CEO of the Business Software Alliance, our good friends at the BSA, said the document is thoughtful but and oh and makers of enterprise software take seriously their responsibilities to customers and the public.  But we look forward to working with the administration to advance shared priorities that will produce the greatest benefit.  I don't think the BSA is really all full behind this. I'm sure their member companies are saying that's a burden. We don't want to be on the hook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean start with small steps. Something that the EU did back in 2018 was they gave this grace period for the reporting of breaches.  If you report a breach within 72 hours of you being acknowledging knowing that there's a breach then you're basically covered.  I mean that's something that we desperately need to be the norm, not this outlier that you do when you're dealing with EU companies.  I want Google to know that it's got three days maximum to disclose that there was a breach and start talking about what they're doing to remediate it.  Not asking the person who found the exploit or found the breach to hold off until they can fix it and maybe they'll get back to you in six months.  It's little things like that that I think can actually make a difference versus letting Congress sit there and say tech is good, tech is bad.

The problem is if you actually look at the text of the bill, specifically look at what they mean by compensation.  So they put it in quotations, compensation.  And the definition out of memory here is anything.  So if you get anything of value for what you write, you are now a paid blogger.

They're unconstitutional.  They're obviously unconstitutional.  But until it gets all the way to the Supreme Court, it can still be in action.  Unless there's an injunction against it.  So this is supreme chilling effect.  Again, this is like corporations not caring that they know they're going to get sued for anti-union behavior.  Do you think that's the point of this?

Transcript:  You're gay because you drink water.  It's amazing.  I mean, all right, just a mind boggling.  Let's take a little break.  Then we're going to talk about, speaking of mind boggling,  banning TikTok because that seems to be getting closer and closer bit by bit,  inch by inch.  Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN.  Maybe that someday you'll have to use a VPN to use TikTok.  Wow.  Wow.  There's three reasons people use a virtual private network.  Security is one.  You're an open access hotspot or a hotel or a cruise ship.  Everybody, you're on the same network as everybody else.  A VPN is really the only way to make sure that nobody is snooping on your traffic.  You can't, that nobody can see you there.  They can't run a Wi-Fi pineapple to attempt to attack your machine.  So that's one, security.  Number two is privacy because every internet service provider,  every carrier, every open Wi-Fi hotspot sees everything you do and they can sell that.  It's completely legal for them to collect it and sell it.  So it's a complete, I mean, privacy wise, this is a nightmare.  Then there's a third reason that maybe you want to be coming out.  Maybe you're a Florida blogger, but you'd like to be writing in Milan, Italy.  Maybe you're living in California, but you want to watch anime on Netflix Japan.  Well, that's another thing a VPN can do.  It can put you anywhere in the world that the VPN has servers.  Now, having said all that, it's very important that you choose the right VPN  because you're in a way just kicking those security and privacy concerns down the road.  The VPN provider has to protect your privacy.  That's why I only use and I only recommend ExpressVPN.  When you're using the internet, your public IP address is out there, right?  And it can be matched to your other visits.  They can do all sorts of stuff with that.  They can associate it to the sites you visit.  If you're using ExpressVPN, your IP address isn't yours.  It's ExpressVPN's.  It hides your IP address.  It gives you the secure IP from whatever country you want to be in.  It also encrypts all your data so it's protected in transit from hackers and anyone else  trying to see what you're up to.  The beauty of ExpressVPN is they really care about your privacy.  ExpressVPN's trusted server technology, they invented it, runs in RAM, sandboxed,  so it cannot keep track of your visit.  As soon as you close the VPN server, it's gone with no trace of your visit.  We know this because there are countries where they have no knock warrants.  They don't even have warrants in some cases.  They just burst in, take the server, and every time that's happened to ExpressVPN,  there's nothing on that server.  ExpressVPN doesn't keep track of you.  They go to the extent of using a secure special distribution of Debian  that wipes the drive every time, every day.  It starts fresh.  It's pretty amazing.  They go the extra mile.  You read the privacy policy, you read about trusted server,  and you can believe it because they undergo independent third-party security audits  on a regular basis that say, yep, they do what they say they're going to do.  That works the way they say it does.  I'll tell you, I love ExpressVPN.  You will too.  ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  Put it on your Mac, your PC, your Linux box, on your Android or iOS.  You can even sell routers.  You put it on the routers or runs on a variety of routers,  one that you might have already.  ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  Protect your data with the number one rated VPN provider today.  By the way, it's so easy to use.  I got on my phone and pressed the button.  Boom, I'm protected.  Visit ExpressVPN.com slash twit.

The stuff he is doing, 150 patents.  He's started more than 20 companies, but not for profit.  He's really out there to change the world.  It's a little Jurassic Park.  One of the things he wants to, and he looks like, by the way,  he looks like David Attenborough or whatever, Richard Atmer.  He's got the big beard.  One of the things he wants to do is take mammoth, woolly mammoth genes.  We've got them, I guess, Amber, I don't know.  We've got them, frozen tundra, and insert them into elephants to make cold-resistant elephants  to trample the grass and knock down the trees in Siberia to help fix global warming.

Transcript:  It turns out that these herbivores, these massive herbivores used to roam the earth  up there, but they don't anymore.  As a result, the trees have overgrown and the albedo of the Arctic is reduced.  The tundra, the permafrost is melting.  Oh, by the way, it contains far more methane than anything humans put out.  We put out, I think, nine gigatons a year of global warming gases.  There's 1,500 gigatons stored in the permafrost and it's melting.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  All that rotting material.  Yeah.  And it's melting.  So get the mammoths up there, the woolly mammoths.  Plus, they're damn good eating.  No, actually, he didn't say that.  He's a vegan.  He's a vegan.

Transcript:  You're going straight to Emacs Hell.  You're not.  No, do not pass go.  The United States House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday voted along party lines to give  President Biden the power to ban TikTok.  Ban it entirely in the United States, not just for government workers, for everybody.  24 to 16 would grant the administration new powers to ban the ByteDance-owned app  used by over 100 million Americans, including my son, who is making a living on TikTok.  Representative Michael McCall, the chair of the committee, who sponsored the bill says,  TikTok is a national security threat.  It's time to act.  Anyone with TikTok downloaded on their device has given the Chinese Communist Party a backdoor  to all their personal information.  It's a spy balloon into their phone.  Oh, Lord.  We're going timely.

Start time: 6351.18
End time: 6392.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's ironic because often the people, including the FCC commissioners at TikTok should be banned,  who say this are people who also said to the nation's telecom companies,  take all the info you want, sell it to data brokers, go right ahead.  In fact, as some have pointed out, if the Chinese really wanted to know about us,  all they'd have to do is go to those data brokers and buy the information.  It's all out there.  But no, they're not interested.  I'm going to zip it.  Obviously, I have a dog in this, and I should recuse it.  Although my son is smart, he's moved to Instagram pretty much.  Another privacy protecting group.  You might.

Start time: 6405.54
End time: 6462.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, two things can be true simultaneously.  Is this performative?  Totally.  But as Robert said, it's also true that it's a national security risk.  Both of these things are true at the same time.  It's certainly true that there are plenty of other companies, including American-based  companies, that are just as bad with our data or are willing to sell it or let it be compromised.  All of that is true.  It seems weird to single out TikTok.  That feels very much national security theater.  But perhaps, yes, the answer would be to make a more broad piece of legislation  that actually affects all of these companies and what they can do with our data.  But there clearly isn't an appetite for that because people want to gin up  publicity for we're hard on China.  We are taking China to task by making so that nobody can watch your funny videos.  That'll show them.

Start time: 6463.06
End time: 6485.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'll show them no more of this dancing thing.  No, we don't like that.  They didn't mention WeChat, which is also a Chinese company and also widely used in  the United States, mostly by Chinese expats.  But still, also, we know we're used by the Chinese government to virtually extort these.

Start time: 6485.60

Transcript:  I'm not on TikTok platforms.  I don't really care for very less.  But I would say that the fact is, I think I agree with Dan.  There's so many other things they should be targeting and worrying about.  Are they going to protect our data?  Are they going to stop things from people spreading harmful information, misinformation?  No, they're just stopping one company from operating in the States that impacts a specific  demographic and a specific type of thing.  I don't think we need to spend our time or our money on it.

There's a great use of social media for something that is actually,  it's the Thanksgiving, don't deep fry your turkey because you set your house on fire  kind of thing.  Okay, that I can see.  Yeah, I mean, that's great.  Maybe that's TikTok is how you need to reach that demographic of people.  But I don't know.

And what's interesting is that the surveys, national survey of mental health,  shows this big jump in mental health issues among young women in 2011.  I mean, like a big jump.  And more and more people I see are kind of jumping to the conclusion.  Oh, yeah.  Social media.  Do you think that's what's going on?

End time: 6742.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's certainly a big factor, if nothing else.  If it's not the only thing, it's a big chunk of it.  I have teenage cousins who are on all the social media stuff.  And I can't...  The things they're exposed to at such a formative age.  And just in terms of like, you know, peer pressure, bullying, you know, all this stuff.  It is real.  Yeah.

And I mean, it's not just the big names.  It's not just the Tates.  It's people who realize that they have power that we would probably prefer they not have.

Start time: 6780.16
End time: 6831.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's also the more insidious, less overt stuff, right?  It's the likes and the, you know, trying to see all your friends posting the perfect videos  and trying to live up to that.  And, you know, it's sort of the keeping up with the Joneses aspect of like having to constantly  present a performative outward experience.  I mean, I think those aspects are not new, but they're amplified, right?  I mean, it used to be 30 years ago, you had your cliques at school and you had the try  to impress the cool kids maybe or something, or you try to build yourself up or you had to  deal with peer pressure.  But now it's like anybody anywhere could influence you in that way or to, you know,  you're exposed to people from all over.  And it's just, it's made it that much more of a problem.

Transcript:  You know, when I step away from social media every once in a while, I do like these month-long  stepaways.  Do you?  I do.  Because you're very active on social media.  I'm super active when I'm active, but like I stepped away all of December, up to CES.  I'm probably going to do it again.  Oh my gosh, it was wonderful.  It was really, really nice.  And it gives you perspective of, wow, I'm a lot happier.  I'm less anxious.  I don't argue over stuff I really don't care about.  And I don't have to perform anything.  And when I came back, I was just looking at some old posts on the various social media sites.  The content that I used to put up is not like the content I'm putting up now,  both in frequency and in just intensity of the posting.  So I think that might be a good thing.  Turn off social media for a month and see what happens.  Yeah.
