Transcript:  So Ohm what do you. First of all interesting. Sales of the iPhone 4S despite the fact that it in many  ways is not a particularly huge upgrade to the iPhone 4 were huge. It's a record the best sales  day ever for Sprint. Sprint, Verizon and AT&T all selling the iPhone 4 on Friday. Apparently a million  sold in the first 24 hours according to Apple. That was during the pre-order period and all three  carriers have sold through their pre-order allotments although you said you were able to

End time: 298.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on Friday they'd activated a record number of iPhones in fact were on track to double their  previous record for activations in a single day. How much of this I think some of this I remember  when Michael Jackson died that his records went back to number one again. Do you think any of this  is in response to Steve Jobs death that people said I want to support him by buying a new iPhone?  No I think it's momentum. It's just the big mo? I don't know I mean why would is it Sprint in the

Start time: 298.64
End time: 306.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mix suddenly that makes the difference? Well that adds to the you know number of people that already  have Sprint accounts or they want to continue with Sprint. Perhaps there was pent up demand

Start time: 318.72
End time: 396.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there was a lot of people looking to upgrade their iPhone 3gs and that's what you're  seeing is the big big demand from those people and and new buyers I think people still like  buying the iPhone because it just has still has that you know appeal and and and has a certain  you know cache which hasn't gone away even though many millions have been sold and I think that's  what you're seeing and people you know a lot of times we get caught up you know in in the in the  gadget talk but what really is happening is that when you're when you see someone holding an iPhone  or an iPad I think what what you're seeing is an advertisement for that product so all your friends  see you using an iPhone or an iPad and you and that creates a cascading effect and I think that's  exactly what is happening right now if you remember like during the early 1990s suddenly Honda Civic  became the car to own amongst you know certain kind of people and then the sales just took off  for that thing and I think that's the same kind of you know cycle you're beginning to see for the  iPhone as well I think there's a lot of people who want to buy. Om do you think do you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  beating the iPhone right? I think again you know we'd like to see everything in black and white and  it's not like that I think what these two companies are seeing is massive growth at the expense of  Nokia at the expense of BlackBerry more importantly at the expense of feature phones which are  essentially coming to end of life right I think that whole business look at LG Sony Ericsson these  are the companies which are actually falling apart. Yeah in fact Sony's buying out its

Start time: 447.14
End time: 471.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  steak in Ericsson you're seeing a rim struggle obviously the BlackBerry outage this week just  added fuel to the fire Nokia well the jury's still out it's possible that Nokia can pull it  out with a with a C-Ray phone this new Windows mobile phone 7 that will come out sometime soon  yeah but right now it's it's Apple versus Google isn't it I mean those are that's really what it is

Start time: 471.72
End time: 532.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's not Apple versus Google it's Apple and Google versus everybody else I think this lets not get  confused because these guys are they have developed internet centric mobile platforms whereas the other  platforms are still very traditional smartphone platforms and very traditional feature phone  platform so that's the movement is towards internet enabled mobile platform I think if you look at  what's happening with Samsung's BadaOS platform you know they're doing spectacularly well in certain  parts of the world because it was built you know from from the from the scratch for for a mobile  internet environment and I think you're seeing that behavior people want that like people want  their their you know for their four square and their Facebook and you know their QQ or whatever  it is on on their mobile phones and I think a lot of the older platforms cannot keep up with the app

Start time: 532.84
End time: 547.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  momentum yeah and of course in in less affluent nations the cost of a data plan and a smartphone  is so high that do you think this Bada phone is aimed at that market I think so I think Bada is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  doing really well in you know some of the new telecom economies but you know like a friend of  mine just came back from India and he was in a little town in west of India and he basically saw  almost everybody had an iPhone there even though yeah and it cost like a thousand dollars which is  a lot of money you know and and people were buying those and I think there is the just like you know  it's an aspirational quality to a to owning a Samsung or an iPhone or you know because it just  is one of those things it's like owning a Gucci bag you know doesn't matter you know if you don't  have the money you just want to own it and I think that's what has happened with these two

Start time: 589.28
End time: 594.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  India that all are using Android phones well there's a lot of lower and Android phones which  are manufactured by local Indian manufacturers or local Chinese manufacturers which are doing  spectacularly well and it's doing very well in China isn't it and it's doing pretty well in  India and Indonesia and other these places where they have you know the lower cost devices I think  there is a company in in Taiwan called MediaTek and they make a mobile chip platform which is  aimed squarely at low-end consumers and low-end Android smartphones and they're doing really  well I mean you know those I mean you're gonna see more of that like more of innovation on the  low end of the spectrum from Android and again it's it's the same thing we saw with the with  the Microsoft you know Windows we saw a lot of you know smaller lesser-known brands were able to  establish themselves because of Windows and I think we're gonna see the same thing with Android

Start time: 655.04
End time: 686.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  too. I don't know if I can agree though that it's not Google versus Apple I mean it's sure  Google and Apple are certainly acting as if it's it's a zero-sum game you're saying it's not a  zero-sum game that both of them are gonna win in this okay so I'm gonna take a poll this is go  poll go you asked this question Robert Scoble will your next phone be an iOS based one or an  Android based one or I think my next phone is actually gonna be believe it or not the  C-Ray the Nokia we don't know what it's gonna be called but Android 59% compared to 30% for

Start time: 689.08
End time: 726.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple and this shows what the the markets up against when when Ohm says it's an Android and  Apple thing against everybody else this is what's going on very few people want anything other than  an Android or an Apple phone Windows is hanging in there with 9% everybody else is chasing 2% out of  my now this is was asked this is your audience but Facebook Twitter and Google Plus 3,000 people  have answered this so this is the early adopter audience you know if we asked USA Today probably  they would have a different answer but this shows what they're up against really interesting now I'd

Start time: 726.32
End time: 745.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like to know what percentage of fake Apple iPhones are floating around India and China there's a ton  in China because I get solicitations yeah I mean for Pakistan sells a good iPhone for like less  than $100 it looks just like an iPhone it specs out pretty much the same except doesn't have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  think there is a company in China which is trying to make cars that look like Rolls Royce but that  doesn't make them Rolls Royce so I'll just leave it no but if what you say is true and people are

Start time: 774.96
End time: 779.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  just buying these things because they're Gucci bags then I don't think anybody cares whether it

Start time: 779.70
End time: 867.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  really operates exactly like an iPhone or not yeah but like I don't know what what your point is  John because if you looked at the latest quarterly numbers or last six quarters of Apple's sales  they've been growing internationally not just in the US so I don't have a point my it was a question  I wonder how many phones are fake who knows like you know it's like it's pretty hard to tell at  this point whether they're fake or for real but the thing is what you're seeing is people want to  own that product right so much so that they will buy a fake one so much so that they will set up a  fake store in China to sell real Apple products so that kind of tells you the momentum with that  so I don't want to be the guy talking Apple story here but I'm just saying is we have two different  you know camps on on on the mobile web one is on the mobile industry one is the internet neighbor  you know camp which is Apple and Google and then there is the other guys and I think what you're  seeing is Apple and Google are winning out this war I think that's a pretty big challenge for  everybody else including Microsoft and Nokia I have not I will not put a lot in that in those  two companies just yet because by the time they gather any kind of momentum in the market both  Android and Apple iOS would have had another six to eight months or more to consolidate their position

Start time: 867.38
End time: 943.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right yeah Microsoft really is the lag horse you know that the starting gate opened two years  three years ago Microsoft's finally up at the starting line I have to say you know the the new  features in the 4s are not compelling first of all I think Apple missed a bet because it looks  exactly like the iPhone 4 so if that Gucci bag if that status thing is what you're all about there's  a 4 and there's a 4s tell the difference the one's white yeah it's because it's white but but it really  it's exactly the same or at least appears to be exactly the same there are some differences the  antenna has been changed not that there was anything wrong with the old one but there but  it's been changed you had to hold it differently yeah and and but mostly it's internal there's a  double speed processor which is under clocked according to a non-tech it's only running at 800  megahertz not even as fast as the iPad 2 is used iPad 2 that we now know from the teardowns 512  megabytes of RAM there was some thought maybe they'd have more no it's the same as in fact the  iPad 2 the big difference it feels faster in fact it's the fastest browser I would say and  Anand even said that in their tests it's I think the word they used was smoked all the other phones  but it did you feel like the iPhone 4 is slow no no but when I got my my when my son and I were

Start time: 943.48
End time: 963.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  playing with it you could tell some people have put videos up side by side and you can tell it's  different he said we switched him over to Verizon from AT&T we finally are getting that may be a  difference no actually Verizon is supposed to be is supposedly slower than AT&T but he said his  downloads sped up which might be because Verizon's a better network but yeah it might be because

Start time: 964.16
End time: 983.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  other people are using AT&T you know AT&T's HSPA plus is now supported by the phone so that is a  difference but neither those are geeky facts and most people don't care about the thing they're  going to really notice of course iOS 5 but you can upgrade your old phone to iOS 5 and get the  new notifications which are very cool things like that I do like the notifications although

Start time: 983.48
End time: 994.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this is ripped straight off of Android yeah I have those on my iPhone 4 a lot of the iOS 5  the only real differences are the speed the camera and Siri the camera is good I've been taking a lot

Start time: 994.54
End time: 1032.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of pictures of the camera I think it now absolutely replaces a point and shoot especially because  you can press the top volume button boy I feel bad for Lisa Bettany you know her camera plus  application made it possible to take a picture by pressing the volume button and Apple pulled it  from the Apple store and then of course what do they do they put it in but it's how it should be  this is now like a point and shoot camera eight megapixels it does very well in relatively low  light they've got their HDR now takes three images not two they said but the biggest difference is  Siri absolutely so let's talk a little bit about you don't like Siri it's a gimmick watch this I

Start time: 1102.86
End time: 1140.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pinpointed the big problem with speech recognition which is John keeps talking right and unfortunately  Siri still thinks I'm giving it a message so not only is he going to get my message but because I  didn't press stop it's going to have everything I'm saying John's saying and I have kids or whatever  yeah whenever when I watch I'll stop when I have kids whenever I uh I start doing this kind of thing  look at this wow it's gonna check what all of this set an alarm for 20 minutes from now so I can wake  up after John there's a number of the systems that you know we have concluded the big problem  with speech recognition which John keeps talking right that's one drawback John's actually gonna

Start time: 1140.64
End time: 1171.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  get close to something I don't like about Siri Siri is really great if you um if it works it's  when it works well if it works when it works I'm gonna plug the problem is it has a lot of edges  and those edges when you go off the edges is a very bad fall for instance you can ask it how  many people are checked in here at the twit brick house on four square they won't know there is an  answer for that there is an api for that but they don't support it it's not hooked up to Siri and it  fails badly it takes you off to Google and Google doesn't have an answer to that so here's my

Start time: 1171.46
End time: 1206.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  supposition two things I think will happen first of all people are complaining because Siri did not  come out on for instance the iPad 2 and they killed the Siri app so you can't use that or the iPhone  4 second problem is that there is no apparent API yet the you know if you were four squares you'd  sure love to hook into that right I suspect Apple will do that one of the things we noted right away  is that Siri servers were just slammed you know you have half the time when it you know the first  24 hours it'd say I'm sorry my server's down but that will calm down as well and I think Apple  wisely is rolling this out slowly I suspect they will put it on the iPhone 4 and the iPad 2 the two

Start time: 1206.98
End time: 1227.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  guys who built it came out to my house two years ago the stuff that is on the iPhone is completely  rewritten from then so it's clear it's not the old Siri yeah and and it's missing some of the  features that the old one used to have the old one used to work with open table I can make a  reservation you could do that you could also ask make a flight for me right and it would go

Start time: 1227.64
End time: 1237.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  off and these are all things Apple needs to include and I'll tell you what if Apple doesn't  guess who's going to Google I mean Android's already halfway there it has very similar voice

Start time: 1237.62
End time: 1365.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  commands yeah go ahead so I will say two things I'm just looking at this headline by Scobel which  says why if you miss Siri you'll miss the future of the web and absolutely so I think to kind of  say that you know they they can't get a lot of things on the edges is is like kind of you know  you're basically negating yourself Robert second of all when Siri did what they did in the previous  life as an independent company they really didn't roll it out at scale okay they didn't have  tens of millions of people looking to use this service almost instantaneously all the time so I  think Apple has taken a step approach to it and you know this involves a lot more you know  processing power a lot more cloud effort I mean you know oomf on the back end to make all this  thing happen so it's not as easy as it seems that said you know and I will I will actually argue with  you on this uh uh Leo the name's Leo Leo are you kidding me um this season yo um is that you know  Google has had this Google voice commands for a very long time almost a year or so since I wrote  about it and they haven't really done anything with it they're just haven't pushed it to the  app developers whereas Apple is taking a step approach and then they want to put this into  their OS layer and then integrate it into various different applications so it's an issue of scale  you know we would love to see all these things happen in like one day but it takes a little bit  of time so but look at what it does as a service right now it is pretty cool right it's not I'm not  saying this is the end but this is the beginning of something really much bigger and much more  profound and I think we have to think about it in that term like how we can take this technology

Start time: 1365.70
End time: 1382.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and go forward with it not rather than what and I think you're absolutely right um that two guys  they came out to my house you know and showed me this that's why I fell in love with it it's the  vision of it that I fell in love with not what you said is not inconsistent it I think both of us

Start time: 1383.80
End time: 1437.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  maybe except John agree that this is a breakthrough it's the future this is this is how things are  going to be going forward and it's the first iteration it's got to serve many more people  than Siri itself had to and so there are edge cases it doesn't do everything it should do  I bet but that's but that's quibbling because it will right that's my point is that Apple will  roll it out on all platforms Apple will roll it out on the desktop I think you're right go home and  I think that they will provide any I hope now Apple's not notorious for this but I hope that  they will provide an API and the reason they will own is because if they don't Google will  Google has the transportation information Google has the restaurant information they know a lot  more about me than Apple this is what Mike Elgin was saying on Google Plus earlier this week that  this is the beginning but Google's the one to watch out for because they have so much data  what if this becomes the front end for Facebook and let's talk about data who has who has more

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right so that's who that's frankly who's going to ever you know Facebook Apple Google all three of  them I think you're going to are well positioned oh maybe Google hasn't done anything because  nobody put any pressure on them but now that Apple's doing Siri don't you think and I mean  isn't it conceivable that ice cream sandwich will have similar features keep in mind the

Transcript:  Google voice team has been doing this for a while and they have a lot of data they both  both companies have been in a fight for a while you're going to see them roll out versions over  the next couple months that are pretty interesting right the when you see companies come out with  technology it took two years to ship right just the rewrite of this we're so impatient

Transcript:  way of making money i think that's always the issue right so we talked about amazon amazon's  businesses to make money by selling us things so anything they do around it is is part of growing  their core business right that's the first thing they think about is like this is our business and  this is what we need to do to protect it apple's businesses hardware and and great user interface  experiences for their customers so they think along those lines google's businesses search and  basically search-based advertising and they always think from that lens and i think everything they do  is influenced by their dna and i think that is an issue which keeps showing up because if you really  peel the onion on on amazon and their api play is that they were at that point they were saying  okay if this is an api they need to get various different parts of the the amazon the company  talking to each other similarly they will have partners whether there's you know target or other  book sellers or jewelry sellers talking to their system in order to go sell things through the  amazon platform so i think that was part of a conscious thinking process and and that's that's  an issue you know google has and they need to figure this one out i think company or google has  two things going for it one is they still are dominant in search so they need to think about  search not in the context of a search box and 10 blue links right so they need to think of search  like how different it can be and i'm pretty sure they're doing a lot of work on that you know it's  a smart group of people and there are other big advantages they know how to use scale so they need  to use scale or the infrastructure scale to their advantage so you know so the api may not be the  way to think about it right now they may they should be thinking about how do we build platforms  which are massive for other people to innovate on and i think that's that's how i see of google  google should see itself as a platform company yeah i mean it should be i am really surprised
