Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? You're getting sick of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're the guy.  No, I'm not. No, I don't mind doing it.  It's just that, you know, it would be nice if we actually made some money.  Oh, I think I've been complaining about this with with Adam, too.  And he says, you know, because Adam doesn't need any money, so it doesn't make any difference to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I have some very good news.  Advertising is starting to come in on a regular basis.  In fact, I just had the conversation, which I would actually open up to the floor  about how many ads we could have in the longer shows.  The this show and Mac Break Weekly, which both go over an hour.  And I have said two commercials per show.  And Podtrack is saying we can sell three.  Can you do three?  And I'm thinking three, three.  It's not bad. We'll keep them one minute long.  That's not bad. Three minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that wouldn't be bad, except for one simple fact.  What's that?  One minute long.  Is that possible with Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You watch you watch the new you watch the new Leo,  the new fast talking Leo is going to tell you everything about is to know about our advertisers today.  Without pausing for a breath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Leo, that's just with one.  That's what's just with Podtrack.  There's just two or three others I could probably, you know, put more in.  I know that we're getting, you know, my show is now finally booked up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I think Andrew talks actually Andrew talks faster than you naturally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think ad sales are going to be I'm done.  Nobody cares about that.  But I do. But just if you care to the extent that you care that you that your favorite shows are going to stick around,  I think things are going things are kind of despite the economic downturn, things are kind of turning up.  Now, John, you said that we're going to have a depression by 2010.  Is that still on? Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And no change. Well, that's the beginning of the depression.  Depression actually is a long term thing and it hits rock bottom in 2013.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, Andrew, you're actually an investment adviser.  Do you agree with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think that it's interesting because John and I have talked about this many times.  And I question always if, in fact, all the stars are aligning and everything looks like 2009, 2010,  or, you know, give a few days or so here and there that everything is going to just fall apart.  Wouldn't we kind of be smart enough to get out in advance?  And then the question is, isn't that what maybe is happening right now?  Are we kind of going through the process of lightening up on stocks and various other investment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I've mentioned this to Andrew before, which is that my crackpot theories don't doesn't mean everyone's going to start bailing out for one reason or another.  I'm sure other people have. But let's let's go back to 1987 when we had this out of the blue stock market crash,  which took place on an 80 year cycle and best reflected in recent memory with the 1907 depression.  And there were a number of people who had spotted this 80 year cycle and were out.  And there were a lot of investment counselors that were talking about getting out and, you know, don't be in the market in 1987.  And there was no real reason for it. The market was pretty fresh. It was happening.  You know, we're in the upturn overall because, you know, we started a new era.  And but they were out and the thing did have this weird crash, which a lot of people completely panicked over.  And it was just out of the blue. And I'm convinced that there's everybody there's a number of old timers that already know about the cycle as it exists.  And they're in and out all the time because of it. It's not a norm. It happens. It has a bunch of legs to it.  It's not like, you know, I mean, there's a there's a number of it's a 40 year.  You take a 40 year Eon and there's a number of moments within those 40 years where you have the market go make these kind of semi crashes and then you have the depression at the end of it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But aren't I mean, clearly we're going through something right now. I don't know if it's the harbinger of something bigger, but it does seem like tech companies are surviving and in some cases doing OK, even very well.  And in some cases, is that are they just laggards or are we going to see a downturn in tech as well in the next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we're going to see a boom before we see this crash I'm talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, so this isn't the beginning of the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the end. Andrew thinks it isn't everybody in the market does because they're, you know, they're very clued into the day to day.  You know, I don't think that's what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that there's a problem. You're more a long term thinker, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're planning for the future. No, no, I'm not even that.  I have I'm a cyclist or whatever you want to call it.  A cyclist.  Not a cyclist, because that's a guy on a bicycle.  But whatever the case is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought with you like the helmet like Obama bicycling down the street was a good image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, so talk about a perfunctory.  You can't have a crash without it without a boom.  So, I mean, I'm expecting a boom.  Here's what I'd like to see to make it clear to everybody.  Dow Jones, thirty thousand.  Nuff said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And when it hits thirty thousand sell like a crazy man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think John's over there putting in putting in the buy orders.  What do you think, Will Harris?  You're in Britain.  You don't have a stock market.  Yeah, right.  You have the East India Company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I reckon that's Jerry Yang's justification.  We can't crash guys, but we haven't boomed yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem is Jerry Yang is driving with the rearview mirror.  He's the guy steering the car with the rearview mirror saying, we're on track.  No problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd go so far as saying his blindfolds on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he's wearing gloves.  So let's talk about that's the big story of the week, of course.  In fact, we did some live breaking coverage of it.  Jason Calacanis on Mike Harrington kind of broke this and tanked the Yahoo stock  earlier this week when he said Yahoo and Google are about to do an ad deal.  In fact, Harrington even implied there might be a search deal involved.  Reuters picked the story up and Yahoo stock.  I don't even know if it's come back yet, but it turned out somewhat was true that in fact,  Yahoo and Google did do a deal.  I guess somewhat similar, Andrew, to the trial that they had done a few weeks earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like an AdSense deal.  I mean, it's so lame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Placing Google ads on Yahoo search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, isn't that AdSense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yahoo's buying AdSense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's not even buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're using AdSense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They signed up with a publisher.  Yeah.  You can't forget the poker in the world.  Isn't that kind of an admission that it's not going so well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm thinking, oh, it's not good.  They're going to put on a few of their blogs.  You know, they'll get a couple of the plugins.  But you know, it's interesting because if you really think about it for a second,  if Yahoo is doing this and Yahoo was so against opening up any discussions with  Microsoft, don't you want to scratch your head and just say, what was it that Yahoo  didn't want to show?  And is it so bad that they're doing this amateurish kind of AdSense deal to try to just get results  for some income any way they can, which again infers that they have nothing going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think Andrew also touched on something else.  I mean, there's always the issue, you know, you see this every so often,  where a company actually may have had some offer that's pretty cool.  But in the process of due diligence in the execution of the deal, something may be,  there may be a skeleton in the closet.  And so you don't want to do these deals because there may be something lurking that could  be, you know, result in lawsuits or I mean, who knows?  Let's speculate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What would it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  But I do know the one thing where they were, Microsoft offered them, you know, even more  money in January of 2007, which if, you know, if Yahoo doesn't do something pretty soon  with somebody, that's going to come out, show up as a massive shareholder lawsuit and all  the board members.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean they made an offer to them in excess of the $31 they offered most recently a year  and a half ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In January of 2007, they offered them $40 a share.  Why wasn't that?  Didn't that come out in public?  It did.  It was all over the news.  You missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They offered $40 a share for, I don't know, I thought it was like 30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, it was $40 and T. Boone Pickens came out and made the comment that he would  not want to be on the Yahoo board of directors if any of this is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, apparently it was true.  And now they've essentially fought off Microsoft again.  And Microsoft came to the, apparently last weekend had meetings with the Yahoo board  of directors, which ended up with Microsoft saying, we withdraw the offer at any price.  We're not interested.  Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what's interesting about that $40 January 2007 thing?  That is the year we were doing the show then and for a few months afterwards.  And that's when the first rumors of the Microsoft Yahoo, you know, Microsoft's going to buy.  You remember that?  But I thought it was a rumor.  I didn't know that that was actually an offer.  It was a rumor and only the offers come out to light recently because they were somebody  was digging around and they, or somebody at Microsoft let it slip.  Who knows what, but that's apparently that rumor was based on this particular deal that  never happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This doesn't say Mr. Icon is going to be very unhappy with Mr. Yang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well now, now, okay, let's talk about Carl Icon.  Where is he in all this?  He's been, of course, saber rattling, going to the shareholders saying,  let's vote out the board.  Let's, let's get a new board and let's make this happen.  Well, that's over, right?  Because Microsoft, isn't it as Microsoft?  Oh, you never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If, if Carl Icon came and replaced the entire Yahoo board, which let's face it with the  amount of sort of shareholder feeling at the moment is not entirely implausible.  He could quite easily just walk back across to Microsoft and say, you know what,  30 bucks, 35 bucks, let's, let's go for it.  Hey, 25 bucks at this point.  Because, you know, Yahoo stock is not, you know, I think most people would say that it's not going  to go anywhere in the next six months.  You know, what have they got?  Unless this Google deal turns out to add absolutely tons to their revenue.  But even then, you know, it's such a short term deal.  It's not, you know, the Google AdSense deal for want of a better term is,  is not really sustainable for Yahoo's business, is it?  Because it's just admitting that their core business is no business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're, they're making, it's not as though the company is going broker.  They don't have any income or revenue.  The thing about the icon thing, I wrote about this, by the way, in MarketWatch.  I specifically went over all the board members of that currently exist and all the board members  suggested by Carl Icon and it was apparent to me that it was very risky for the shareholders  to vote these icon people in because if some deal doesn't happen, even with them in there,  you know, maybe Microsoft decides this changes their mind.  I mean, there's no guarantee these guys cannot run a high tech company.  That's the problem.  And then the company will just deteriorate rapidly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In this latest action, Yahoo's price fell now it's down to 23 bucks and 47 cents.  That's after that's after the, you know, action this week.  I mean, I have to say at some point, I mean, it's not the low for the year, but it was a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  lower before the offer was made.  But by the way, this is the Yahoo is estimating that this deal with Google, this AdSense deal  is going to increase their revenue by about 800 million.  800 million.  Is that a lot?  Well, compared to 45 billion, I'll take the 45 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  800 million seems like a small amount compared to what they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course, the interesting thing about that deal is, is Mike Harrington  wrote pretty insightfully on TechCrunch was that there are so many penalties to getting out of it  and so many clauses and ways in which the deal can sort of be nixed.  It's like Yahoo doesn't have to put the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're talking about the Micro Who deal or the Google Who deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Google, the Google Who deal or the, the, the you whoog.  I like Google who better.  You whoog.  And you know, Yahoo doesn't have to place the ads, but if it doesn't generate something like,  you know, 90 million a quarter or something, then Google can terminate the deal.  If as little as 30% of Yahoo gets sold off to any third party, Google can terminate and  Yahoo will have to pay them a quarter of a billion dollars.  And everyone in the sort of commentary was that this is basically, there's almost nothing in it  for Google beyond maybe a perfunctory, you know, quarter of a billion here or there.  You mean, you mean, it's basically, it's basically in favor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing in it for Google or nothing in it for Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing in it for Google really.  I mean, 80 million a quarter to them is like, you know, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, I mean, originally everybody thought that Google agreed to this first trial as a way,  a poison pill to keep Microsoft.  Google really didn't want the Micro Who deal.  They really didn't want Microsoft to buy Yahoo for whatever reason.  So that's what the thinking was that Google was in bed with Yahoo to prevent this.  But now that the Microsoft deals off the table, they're still going ahead.  There must be something in it for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're probably still worried that the deal's, I mean,  just because somebody says it's off the table doesn't mean it'll be not reintroduced.  They're still worried about it.  I would be.  I mean, if I was concerned, I personally think that if Microsoft did this deal,  it would be the end of Microsoft.  That's what I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm thinking Google should go, yeah, you guys go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You go off, mate.  But the problem is you never know and it's not worth the risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, at this point, though, it's not.  The risk has risen tremendously and risk for Google.  They have really shown their stuff here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, if you remember the end of the movie Casino, where all the mobsters are going around,  who they're going to kill at the end.  And there's this one guy that's their best pal lawyer guy.  And at the very end, the guy says, yeah, he's okay.  Don't worry about him.  Everybody except the guy at the very end says, eh, why take a chance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kill him anyway.  Geez, this is a hardcore business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But now the big question, gang, is now that Microsoft has this giant wallet,  and they are scratching and itching to spend some money, who is going to be the acquisition targets?  What is Microsoft?  Because they're going to do it.  They're going to spend.  They're going to now try to build the eyeball and the ads revenue up without the Yahoo deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My bet's on the Twitter network.  Surely the best place to buy ads on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, by the way, we are doing a survey on the website with our agency, PodTrack,  trying to find out who the hell's listening to the show.  These things are very useful for us.  And one of the things we will ask you is how many ads you think we should run and all that stuff.  But if you would do me a favor and go to TWIT.TV and just take that survey test,  take a minute or two.  It's very useful for us to know who we're talking to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought you were going to say it'd be very useful for you to go and say we should run 10 ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be useful if you would please just put in a note about how many ads you could live with.  I don't even want to do three, but I think that given all the money I've spent on these cameras  and lights and crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's the tip.  You paid for those already out of your pocket.  You have more money in your wallet than the rest of us have combined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, John.  John's being very complimentary.  You know, I have to say the TWITLIVE stuff is the video stuff's gone very well.  We had our first 10,000 viewer day on Monday when the iPhone announcement came out.  10,000 viewers.  If I could get that on a consistent basis, we'd be as profitable as CNBC.  I could sit back and relax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could buy Yahoo!  After you and I talked this week on my podcast, I opened the browser and I watched the things  that you were doing and you were talking about.  It's kind of addicting watching you just kind of in life talking just openly and explaining things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of creepy, don't you think, that people...  I think there is a natural voyeuristic tendency that we all have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's addictive unless you're really hard up for drugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I thought it was interesting.  When you got up to go upstairs, I'm thinking, does he have a camera in the bathroom or do we...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're working on it, Andrew.  Actually, we're going to come in here and when we do the final TWITLIVE page,  there will be a little spy cam page that's motion sensitive.  So as anybody, any of us...  Dane, I forgot to tell you about this.  Dane's going, what are you talking about?  As any of us move through the TWIT cottage, you will see ghostly impressions of us moving around.  Just to make it more addictive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should be able to get into People magazine with this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my goal. You know that, John. That's all I've really ever wanted.  Just one spread and I just want to be on the cover as the world's sexiest man and then I can retire.  What is it, Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we go back to the iPhone 3G announcement for one second?  Oh, yeah. Well, wait, let's finish up Ugo Hoggle. Wait a minute. I want to finish up

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Micro-Hugel-Goggle, Yoo-hoo. And then we'll go... There is that little new phone thing.  We'll talk about that.  Anything else to say about Micro-Hugel-Goggle?  Google-Goggle-Yahoo? Yahoo-Google-Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think it's funny that Icon's lost his shirt so far, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's cost him money.  Oh, yeah.  Because he bought... Go long on Yahoo? What happened? How did he lose his shirt? He tried to buy up...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys, they were all rallying around that. Remember, they're all on CNBC and they're all  talking about how they're behind Icon. This guy put in about 10 million shares and this guy  bought 10 million shares. They're all strutting their stuff because they think they're just going  to go in there and powerfully just push it. But the fact is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've lost about five bucks a share.  Or more.  Or more. 50 million out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I think the one thing that's the final thing to say on Yahoo is that if Yahoo is going to get  anywhere in the next 12 months, it really needs to define what the heck it is. I think if you saw  Yang on stage at the D conference and he can't answer the simplest question of what is Yahoo?  That was in best search engine, wasn't it?  A content engine.  It's my company.  He didn't have an answer.  That's what it is. It's my company.  Well, that's his answer is that, well, it's this thing that I built.  I own it.  But what is it? Where are you going to make money? And so I think for Yahoo, the next six months is  come up with a strategy to get a core product and make some money or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Will, let's admit it. If we were in the same shoes, we wouldn't really have much to say either.  What's your strategy for making money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just tell me, I just come on this podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Step three, profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  These guys make money. They're not making enough money. That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. No, they make plenty of money. Now, how long? Let's have a Deadpool. How long before  Jerry Yang is out on the street? John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you mean by out on the street?  Out, out, out at Yahoo. No longer...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Out of the company.  Well, maybe they give him an honorary seat on the board or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't usually do that. They usually leave the guy in as a chairman.  Chairman.  But they had other chairman in the meantime. I'm not seeing...  Unless they can find somebody to take his place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which nobody wants that job, right? You take that job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who wouldn't? I mean, it's got to be a great job.  There's an option. There's stuff you could do with Yahoo.  Well, I think Yahoo's... I think the real problem, and I hate to point the finger at any particular  person there, but I think it's Susan Decker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's the merger and acquisition woman they brought in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think the reason she was brought in was to do a deal.  She did a good job.  But she didn't do a deal. She's got to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's got to go.  She's the one that was actually coming up with a plan and the answer when Jerry Yang couldn't  answer the question of what their purpose and mission and their total plan was. At least she  had something concrete to talk about and to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She may be the smartest girl in the room. I'm not saying that's not true,  but she's not cut out for this particular job except unless they were going to do some deal  because that's what she does. And so now they're not going to do a deal. She's not a salesperson  and they need some sales guys in the front. I said a long time ago that Dan Rosenzweig  should have been in her position. She should have gotten the president's job.  I mean, he's a sales guy.  And we like Dan. Dan's a smart guy, yeah.  He's a smart guy. He's probably as smart as she is. And obviously not quite as smart since  they got rid of him and she moved up. So she's probably smarter, but that doesn't mean that she  can do what he can do, which is sell, sell, sell. And they need a guy who's like sales oriented.  It's all he thinks and breathes, although I haven't talked to him for a while. In fact,  he was supposed to return my call recently. Never did.  Hey, Dan, we're calling you, man.  Yeah, you know what? He's gotten too big for that kind of thing, for it to call the little  people anymore. His old friends.  But that's beside the point. I still believe he still thinks and breathes sales, which means  he should be in that job, but he's gone now. I don't know what he's probably. He's like working  in some, you know, like a venture capital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's another problem going on Yahoo. Major brain drain. They had three major big  executives leave this week. I mean, it's like, well, the last person in Yahoo turned out the  lights. Terry Semel, the former CEO, the guy who gave up his seat that Jerry Yang currently holds,  is probably going, God, I got out of there right in the nick of time. I think is he writing a book?  Somebody said he was going to write a book. That would be an interesting book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It probably won't be, but, you know, he's the one largely responsible for the company going  on track. Well, I mean, he came in and it looked like he was saving the company, but he was the  Hollywood guy. He was the Hollywood guy. He's going to turn into a media property and we're  going to do a lot of production of this and that. Yeah. They never over at Yahoo, they've tried to  do media stuff constantly from that finance view or whatever the heck it was back in the tech TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  days. I kind of like that. The Yahoo Finance channel and isn't Yahoo Finance. I mean, that's  what I'm looking at when I look at stock prices. Isn't that still one of the most visited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, when I go for the stationary site. Yeah. I think it's going to be.  That's what we're looking at right now. Right. And they do have some videos that are okay.  But the fact of the matter is he wanted to make it tell an IPTV play.  Well, IPTV or Hollywood or movies or short. I don't know what they were thinking, to be honest,  but I never made any sense to me. It was a search engine directory from the get go. Why are you going  to turn into some kind of a Hollywood thing? You know, it is not what CBS is now doing with its

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CNET acquisition, all the other acquisitions. It looks like it's trying to do that IPTV kind of  thing. Not sure. Not sure either. So is this an investment standpoint? Yes, it's trying to be a  search company as well. Right. Is Yahoo still a search company? Is that still important to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo's core business? I think it's the only thing they're making money on consistently. Yeah, of  course it is. There's still a lot of users of Yahoo search. I mean, even when we were at tech TV,  I used to, when I was doing the, what was the show I did? The Big Thinkers. Yeah. I would always ask  these guys, these Big Thinkers, and this is about 1999, you recall. I would ask every one of them,  and this is when Google had already really was the best thing going with Google. We all used it.  And I would always ask these guys, there were all kinds of walks of life and a lot of them very into  the tech scene. I'd always ask them at the end, what search engine do you use? And they would all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  say Yahoo. And that, my favorite part is then you would stand up, slap them and call and say phony.  I loved that, John. That was your trademark for so long. And I really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a good one. And the slap it plus the screaming phony. Phony!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but you're right. That was, but I think you're right. There's still people who use

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  MSN for their primary search tool. AOL search. Right. AOL's probably got a lot of followers.  People don't move. We amongst ourselves, we see our, we're kind of in the scene and we jump from  one thing to another. Or in your case, you jump on every single thing that shows up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah. I'm using a new search tool called FlugalHarn. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, I don't want to get into it. But the point is, is that we assume other people are this  adventurous. And the fact is very few people are adventurous. They get their routine online.  And then still most people just go online for a few hours a week. They're not online all the time  or have a camera sticking in their face like you do 24-7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a really good point. And I think we get so insular here, tech pundits, that we forget that  the vast majority of users is not clued in or even aware of the kind of stuff we're talking about.  Here's a good example. Digg or Yahoo Buzz. Yahoo Buzz is huge. It's much bigger than Digg. We all  talk about Digg like it's the second coming, but Yahoo Buzz, just because it's Yahoo and it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  destination, Yahoo's a destination, is much bigger. Well, that was the whole point. That was the whole  point. You had instant customers and you had instant eyeballs and a massive amount of people  just by going in there and teaming up. And that was the whole plan. But I will tell you-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why can't Yahoo make something out of this? I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they're obviously competing with the giant. And even though they are second,  supposedly, to them, they're competing with just a giant that everybody is Google. I mean,  they just switched. But I will tell you, just to get back to your question about the Deadpool.  How long for Jerry Yang? From an investment standpoint and from an investor standpoint,  there is going to be a tremendous amount of hesitation for anyone to be an investor and a  new investor in Yahoo as long as Yang is there from the type of immature attitude that he took  where he was doing this from a touchy-feely, it's my company, rather than a bottom line number and  taking care of the shareholders. I don't want to be a shareholder in a company when it's very  clear that the person at the top is not thinking clearly. It's my company. It's my company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about you, Will Harris? I think the other thing is that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going back to this thing about what are they going to do. I think the thing that they don't  really realize is that they think that search ads is the way they're going to make their money. But  obviously, their search is second rate to Google's. But they're doing these projects  like, you know, like you say, like Yahoo Buzz, which is massive and huge, which is really a  content play. But the way to monetize content plays is through display advertising. But they  don't seem to have anybody selling display advertising because they're all trying to sell  search advertising. So the thing they're most successful at, these content plays, they're not  trying to monetize. And the stuff they're not so good at, which is the search stuff, they're  trying to work really hard on it. It seems they're getting it the wrong way around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitt2001 in our chat room has said, there's nothing wrong with Yahoo. The only thing wrong  is that tech pundits, the press, media, us only pay attention to the top earner. We say Google,  Google, Google, but Yahoo's doing just fine. Isn't that true? I mean, if I look at the stock price,  Yahoo's low point was way back in February. They were at 19 bucks, 1858. They're still well above  that even after all the ups and downs of the micro who. Aren't they doing okay? Aren't they fine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Regarding that comment, I agree with that. In fact, that's what I've been saying here,  and I've been saying it elsewhere. That said, I still think the stock's overpriced.  They don't have the earnings growth that makes it a high multiple stock. It should probably be  selling for about 15 bucks, to be honest about it. And they should probably be giving a dividend  if they make money to the shareholders. That's why you'll never be a businessman,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John. Oh, I'm sorry. I was handling Calacanis. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, that chart I sent you on the shows, the comparison of Google and Microsoft. Remember  that one? Did you take a look at that? Yeah, let me pull that up for everybody.  What's really interesting is I was surprised myself, but over the last two years,  Microsoft and Google have been neck and neck in terms of stock price and percentages of gain. I  think if you would have thought about that, everybody thinks that Google is just this massive  beast that keeps on going up, even though it has some ups and downs here. But Microsoft has been  doing a great job. Our second largest holding next to Apple is Microsoft, and we're very pleased with  the performance and the strategic sense. It's really in fashion to beat up Microsoft for  everything, isn't it? It seems that if you want to say something positive, you almost want to know  who's listening. But Microsoft has been doing just a tremendous job at really turning this company  from the square Volvo type of company into not a race car Porsche yet, but at least they're getting  towards maybe the infinity. They're just much, much more in tune with moving forward and enhancing  value, I believe, from a different sense than they were a number of years ago. I think they're  getting the hint that they need to do something significant, and their share price reflects  all the things that they've done to be really on the right track.  This chart, by the way, made with Yahoo Finance, shows that Google and Microsoft...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did that on purpose.  Is this stock price? Is this share price you're talking about here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's share price in percentage, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In percentage over the last two years. Google and Microsoft track pretty well together, actually,  with Yahoo kind of a distant third.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of an industry thing. The industry goes up and down as a whole. I don't see too  many companies breaking out unless something weird happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you'd think with all the press that Google is breaking out, you'd think that that's...  This kind of puts it in perspective that Google is not the breakout that everybody says it is.  Or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if I was going to invest in one of the three companies, I'd probably  put my bet on Google.  I guess I would. Long term.  Because there's no company... Yeah, long term.  Although I think Microsoft has some potential, I think they have a death wish.  And I think...  I totally disagree. I totally disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I know you do.  Well, all right. The fact is I think that Microsoft is extremely well diversified right now.  They are very well positioned, I believe. Although, again, they're fighting for this  advertising space. But aside from the advertising space, take that and throw it away, they have a  whole war chest full of opportunities and income opportunities. I don't really see that as much  from the Google side. Now, that doesn't mean they're not going to make their money.  But I think Google is much more potentially a risky play in a market that may be having a finicky  advertising base. Because you have to think that if things really go to hell here,  that the advertising may cut back a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm not going to necessarily take your side, but I will mention the one thing which  is on your side of that argument, which is that we witnessed this in the year 2000 or so when the  advertisers all of a sudden jerked their money out of the internet like there was no tomorrow.  And all these companies that were startups that were going to rely on advertising and everything  was going to be because of advertising, they all went under. In fact, they went under by the  hundreds. And so the advertising people are pretty... I've been listening to nothing. Most of the  podcasts that I've been listening to over the past...  They're called MeVeos now.  Well, MeVeos...  All the MeVeos I've been listening to now.  All the MeVeos. All the pod, all the Net... Whatever you want to call them. This is a real issue,  by the way, with all these things.  All these shows, all these internet-based shows.  I've been listening to them. I've been listening mostly to stuff from AdTech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't even know what AdTech is. What is AdTech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  AdTech is a conference that's all over the world. They have it in Melbourne, New York, San Francisco,  blah, blah. And they take all those presentations that they do, where the speaker comes in and  they have a group of advertising executives and talking about this and that. They record them all  and they put them online. And so I've been listening to these things. And everyone's an  hour long. It's actually quite interesting. You can just see that there are issues that need...  That have not been fully realized in the online ad space.  Yeah, in the online ad space. And I... At MeVeo, I listen to the stuff that goes on there.  And I think that there's a... And I think... And I see what other people are doing, like at Rev3  and elsewhere, and what you're doing. And I'm not convinced that they have the formula right yet.  What would you do different? Because I'd love to do it.  Well, it's not that anything I would do different. The problem is it's on the other side of the fence.  It's the guys with all the money and all the... That control all the purse strings,  these big advertising agencies. They're not absolutely sure what... They don't necessarily  know what they're doing. And the few that do are pretty conservative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, I'm small. I don't care what I do. No, you can fly in under the wire.  I'm flying in under the wire. And all we do is we sell ads to anybody smart enough to say,  oh, let's try this. And almost invariably they come back. If I look at the... Audible was here  for one ad. They've been here a year now. Visa came for one month. They're coming back this next  month. I mean, I can go on and on and on. iStock Photo, GoToMeeting. All these people try an ad  or two and they come back. Yeah, but these are big advertising agencies.  That doesn't matter. I agree. Well, no, these are all agency buys, by the way. We don't do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  direct retail sales. They're all agency buys. What agency is doing this stuff then? Well,  they're pretty... They're more on the ball. You know what the problem is, John? It's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  interactive division that is basically used to buying banner ads. Oh, it's terrible. They don't  talk to... It's awful. They don't know what the hell a podcast or a Mevio or a Netcast is, but they  know banner ads and they think, well, it's kind of like a banner ad. And so they buy it. But the  thing is when they get results, they stick around. So all I have to do is get results for people.  We do do that and that's all we have to do. But I'm a small guy. I don't count compared to Mevio  or Revision 3. They have a lot more shows and they need a lot more revenue. They've got investors.  I don't have investors to prove anything to. You got your wife. I got my wife who's pissed as it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, Leo. Yeah. I put a new chart in there for you just to really stir the pot here a little bit.  And I added Apple to it. Oh, where did you put that? It's in the same batch I gave you. Okay,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  good. I'll go check it out. This is Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and Apple. When you add Apple to  the mix, holy cow, boys and girls. Now tell us again, just so we understand what this is.  This is a percentage change in share price over the last two years. Not share price,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's percentage change. Yeah. So just to compare, you know, apples to apples, if you will, or apples  to everybody else. It's showing that Apple is up in the same period of what about 225%  where Google, Microsoft in the 50, 40% and Yahoo's in the negative range. Yep. Holy cow. Again,  it's a different company. I mean, obviously it's a harder. They're not an online company. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Put Dell in there. Of course, Dell would be down to down where Yahoo is, right? There you go,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dell. I'll put you. I'll load it up for you. I got HP. I got to come in. While we're making graphs,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we're going to pause for a moment. We're going to come back in a second and talk about the iPhone  because frankly, that's a big story too. But first I got to mention audible.com, our great sponsor.  As I said, they started with us one show. They bought one show one year ago and it worked so well  from them in the back and they've been with us for a year. It's one of the longest relationships  in Mevio history, netcasting history, podcasting history, whatever you call these things.  We love them and I think it's just a natural relationship. It's Father's Day. We're doing  the show on Father's Day. Of course, as you know, one of the best journalists in the business  passed away this week, a dad, a very proud dad, Tim Russert. While I never met Tim, I have to say  he was a role model. He was exactly the kind of guy you want covering these stories and he will be  sorely missed in this election year and for years to come. But he wrote a book about his dad called  Big Russ and Me, Father and Son Lessons of Life. It's narrated by Tim Russert and I'll tell you  what, if you pick one book from audible.com this year, this is the one you're going to want to  listen to. It can be your free book if you go to audible.com slash twit and sign up today if you're  not already a member. But even if you are a member, it's on my next read. Let me play a little bit of  this is a Tim Russert reading from his book, Big Russ and Me, Father and Son Lessons of Life.  Any day now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Big Russ. Here we go.  About an hour later, dad came back, went to the bedroom, pulled out a sheet off his legal pad  and brought it into the living room. Billy said, I want you to show me in black and white how you're  going to support her. Keep it simple so I can understand it. Nothing complicated and nothing  phony. Just give me the real numbers. Bill went to the kitchen table and dad went back to his chair.  A few minutes later, they went over the numbers together. Dad must have liked what he saw because  the next thing I knew, he and Bill were driving over to Legion Hall to celebrate the engagement  over a couple of cold ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Big Russ and Me, Father and Son Lessons of Life. Also, Tim Russert's other book,  Wisdom of Our Fathers is also on audible.com. I'm not surprised Audible is a great source for  audiobooks. If you like to read, you like to use your time driving in the car or riding in a plane  or working out at the gym or working in the garden, if you like to use that time and get  something done, get something read, this is such a great service. A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com slash  twit. We thank them for their support and we really thank them for making it possible to  hear Tim Russert once again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, can I make an Audible request?  Yes, sir.  I was thinking this today as I was sitting waiting to buy some books. What I would really like is  a database of every audible pic that each twit host has done across all the shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got it for you. I never did this myself. I always wanted to do this. We had talked for a  long time about Audible making a twit page and they've never gotten around to it. I'm flying out  there to meet with them in Newark in a week and I'm going to continue to encourage that.  But a guy has done that. It's called willhaulmusic.com. Will Hall, I tip my hat to you.  If you go to willhaulmusic.com on the right, you see twit TV Audible book picks and it's for every  show, every pic. I mean, I don't know what this guy does for a living or how he has the time to  do this, but they're all there and I really appreciate it. Thank you, Will Hall.  Oh, that's brilliant.  With illustrations and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What would be really cool would be to actually make, maybe this is something some enterprise  encoder in the twit army can do, would be to make a social network based around this stuff.  What are the twit hosts reading this week? But also what are the people listening to twit?  So that if I want a recommendation, I can go, I can search by one of the audible tags like politics  or technology or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook has something like that.  Yeah, I quite often think like you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there are a number of sites for social sites for readers. I'm trying to remember the big one.  It's a social network for readers in which you should, we could easily set up a twit site on,  you know, a twit.  Yeah, that would be really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think which one is it?  Amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Readers bookshelf or something or let me know.  There's a couple of them.  Let me pull up this. I think this will have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Goodreads.com. Thank you chat room. Always the chat room knows. Thank you.  Red five, red leader, red leader five. You're the guy who got it first.  It is goodreads.com. So what we could do is go to goodreads.com. Oh, by the way, we've now  twitted willhaulmusic.com. You can't get there. Please guys, don't all go there at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And as this one minute commercial gets to the 10th minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a commercial anymore. The commercial's over.  It's just a conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to drop the big news that I don't think you necessarily want to talk about.  Uh oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. What could that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin Rose is now number one on Twitter.  Shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he passed me this week. He's not, you know, he's a few hundred ahead.  All I can say is, Kevin has demonstrated that the Digg Nation has more followers,  more listeners, and is more powerful than the twit army. And I just, on behalf of the  twit army, I surrender my sword. Uh, no, no, no, the game's not over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should have.  Is that that Kevin has been pushing it to an extreme and now he's going to relax.  And now's the time you can overtake him. By the way, the real before act, I need some help  because I got bumped back by the, by the Mac news or something. Some they decided to go past me.  So I dropped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Mac rumors goes up every time there's a, a keynote. Mac rumors goes up because people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  follow them on. Yeah. Now I got to go past that number again, which is a good thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And John, is there a real business and a real purpose here or is it a giant extension of an ego?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's exactly what I an extension of an ego, but this beside the point, it's actually a fun game.  I need more followers. The real Dvorak dot, you know, the real Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, let me, let me show you. This is the, um, T-shirt, you know, cause we had that race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have like 50,000. I got like 20. I should at least be able to poach at least five from

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  remember there was that race when I really got, we turned into a real weenie and started, you know,  begging for people. Cause, cause it was going to, there was a race on hub dub,  which is kind of a cool site where you can make bets and create races. And, uh, and it was,  who would be, who would be number one on Twitter by May 25th and by the skin of my nose, I maintain  it. So I've got this special hub dub twit Twitter T-shirt winter, May 2008. And on the back of it,  I love it. It says, Hey, Kevin, how's the view from back there? But I have to say, I'm packing this up.  I'm mailing it to Kevin because I'm the one behind, I'm one looking at his butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can just turn the shirt around. Leo, it'd be the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can still make it, you know, a thousand followers is peanuts. You can, you can,  you can get that back. You know, there comes a time. I feel like Hillary Clinton. In fact,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in my 1000th tweet on Twitter, I said, this isn't the party we planned, but I sure do like the company.  And then I, I offered Kevin the, uh, the chance to make me his vice president,  but he hasn't taken me up on it. He's got the committee is looking into it. He says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  not to change the subject off of this beautiful topic of,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Where are you on Twitter, Andrew Horowitz? I have like 12 people.  What is your tweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is why you're like on our case, because you never got the traction,  because you know, it fully understand the mechanism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I guess the fact is that I just don't care.  But, uh, how about another wonderful story for the weekend? And that is this,  it's really this altruistic effort by a variety of these companies to help with our horrible  email addiction. Have you seen this? What's that?  Uh, it seems that, uh, there was an article in the New York times. It talks about many of the,  many companies, Microsoft, Intel, Google, IBM found in an eight month period that some employees  were encouraging, um, we're, we're doing so many digital and having so many digital interruptions  that their productivity is down substantially. It's a big problem.  So, so, so here's what's interesting. The Google, uh, the Google introduced this something, uh,  the, the email addict feature where it automatically cuts people off after 15  minutes from their email boxes. I love that.  Okay. Uh, maybe we should have the same thing for Twitter. Now they think about it, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we should definitely Twitter's got that it's called Twitter is down right now. Please come back later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what's interesting about that is I started thinking that why would, why would Google do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, this is one of those, they really, we should just say they released from Google labs.  They released about five or six new features that are really, some of them very cool. And this is  one of them, this email addict. If they're, take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting. Yeah. If they're not on email, they're back on the web. Right.  Cause most of the time your email is not giving you ads. So they'll serve you up the ads back

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on the web as you'll get more of you. Oh, you are such a cynic, Andrew Horowitz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been actually studying under the John Dvorak school of cynicism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is very cynical. I don't think Google cares that they know they're going to get you anyway.  They don't, they don't need to force you off your email. Besides, I like this theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't they put ads in it? I think he's absolutely correct. This is a scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent. Oh, this was, oh good. So did I pass the final?  Guess so. Yeah, you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Leo, who usually, you know, I play the Paul McCartney character in this band of Beatles.  Oh, it's everything's good. Don't worry. It's going to be fine. But Google's not doing that.  They're good people. Actually, did you see Eric Schmidt saying, well, don't, don't be evil.  It doesn't mean exactly don't be evil. That's the famous Google slogan. Don't be evil.  And in a speech this week, Eric Schmidt said, we don't have an ethic meter, an ethical meter.  It's just food for thought. Don't be evil. We don't really mean don't be evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is he thinking when he even comes up with this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He must have been smoking something. No, we don't really mean don't be evil.  We mean just think about it before you're evil. Maybe, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the other thing Schmidt did this week, which was borderline dumb,  was the comment that he made that he was shocked, stunned, and dismayed. He was flabbergasted.  He was surprised and befuddled by the fact that there would be deep packet sniffing and there'd be  ISP level censorship as if he doesn't follow this at all. What is he doing with this time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's like the inspector in Casablanca who says, Rick, I'm shocked to learn that gambling's been  going on here. He collects his winnings and sticks them in his pocket. I am shocked,  shocked that there's packet inspection. Let's, we're going to talk about the iPhone.  I do really want to talk about Comcast finally saying, and Time Warner's doing this too, yeah,  you know what, and you wrote a good article, I think, John, on this. We're going to have to  charge you. We're going to have to meter your bits. It's the only way to go forward. I completely  disagree with you, John C. Dvorak. We'll talk about that in a second, but let's get to the iPhone real  quickly. On Monday, Steve Jobs takes the stage and announces what we all knew would happen. A 3G  iPhone came out. It pretty much had all the features we expected. GPS. What we didn't expect is a very  low price, $200. That's because according to Ars Technica, AT&T's rewritten its deal with Apple,  no longer gives them any portion of the monthly fee, so it can subsidize the phone price down  to 200 bucks for the 8 gigs, 300 bucks for the 16 gigs. The GPS, you know, once you hear all the  good things, you know, much, much better battery life, lower price, GPS, 3G, then come the yes  spots. For instance, yes, but 3G, HSDPA is only available in a very limited area for AT&T. Many  people won't be able to get it. I won't be able to get it up here. Yes, but 200 bucks, but you have  to pay more money for the data plan. Now 30 bucks for the high speed and you get zero SMS messages,  which is a major scam since SMS is just data now and they're charging you like 10 cents  for 140 bytes of data. That's ridiculous. They also, you know, the GPS, Tom Tom, you know,  jumped in and said, great, there's GPS. We're going to write turn by turn direction program  for the iPhone only to be held back by the sudden realization that Apple's new iPhone SDK  agreement says you may not write under any circumstances any turn by turn applications  for the iPhone. So as usual, the reality distortion field set by Steve Jobs is kind of  a little bit taken on by the actual facts, but it takes a day or two for the press to realize that.  John, your take on the 3G iPhone. Do you care? I thought your summary right there was better

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  than half the reviews I've read of the iPhone, especially the ones in the press, as you stated.  That was good. It's a lot of yes, buts. Yeah, no, I was outstanding and I think you're dead on  on every one of those points and you know, I think the iPhone's becoming a big deal or a bigger deal  than it was and it's going to, you know, eventually they're going to work it out. So people are a  little more cut loose a little more, but it, but I think it is heading toward becoming a platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in it and of itself. Well, that's what's exciting about it. It may not be, you know, it's still not  there. No cut and paste, you know, third party applications limited. Yeah, you can get super  monkey ball, but, but there's, you can't get GPS. But I think as you say, it's kind of a  groundbreaker. It's what everybody's trying to copy Samsung's new instinct, which looks to be the  closest thing now has visual voicemail has actual turn by turn directions on it. That's coming out  soon. I think you're seeing other companies and what they're doing is they're saying, well,  people want this. We're going to make it something somewhat like that. Will Harris, you're an iPhone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  junkie. Were you excited by the announcement? Well, yeah, I'm, I'm psyched for it because I  guess over here we get a lot less screwed with the, with the data plans and with the, with the  general plans. I mean, over here, O2 is the sole carrier. They're still doing all inclusive plans  with the data, still getting, you get tons of SMS messages. You get a free upgrade from your current  iPhone to the new 3G iPhone. If you're prepared to extend your contract. Yeah, we get that to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  software upgrade basically, right? Or do you get the new phone? And what they're, and what they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  letting you do is take the, take your old iPhone and then basically give it to someone else to  activate on the network for, on a prepaid card or something for somebody else. So we don't even

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have prepaid cards. They eliminated the go option, go phone option in the States. So you can now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  basically, you can now, you know, take that and give that to your Mrs. Or whatever. The price plans  are all really good and they're going to give you a free one on certain price plans. Now, if you're  a new customer and you sign up, they'll just give you the iPhone. You don't even have to pay anything  for the iPhone. Wow. Which is a really chunky, that's a big subsidy, but it's obviously because  previously Apple's business model was to make money off the ongoing subscriptions.  Obviously they want to, a net, what they want their model now is shifting to getting as many  of these things as possible and making money off the app store. I think that's pretty clear what  they're going to do now if they're taking, what is it like 25% of every transaction on the app store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I like mobile me. I like the idea. They call it exchange like features for home users,  which is essentially the ability to sync your calendar and address book. You get 20 gigs of  storage, but you have to pay a hundred bucks a year for it, which is, the Samsung will do that  for free. Most phones will do that. Syncing by my Blackberry syncs with Google calendar for free.  So I'm not sure that's such a great feature. Andrew, are you an iPhone guy or are you a?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love my iPhone. I think it's great. As a matter of fact, I would go so far to say that  with some limitations, like you said, the cut and paste and a few of the other things that are a  little bit, you know, a little wonky, you know, you have the problem with some of the,  the keyboard issues and, but I would love just to have 3G on my current iPhone. Forget about all the  rest of the things. I mean, you know, that would be great so that we don't have to go through this,  this whole issue of, you know, signing up again. And, you know, the big issue in the beginning was  nobody wanted to be with the AT&T to begin with. Not that there's anybody else really here that  we want to be with, but the big talk in the investment community last week, I don't know  if you noticed the stock went down after that was not so much, you know, of course, some of  the financials, but you know what it was? Steve Jobs health. Steve Jobs health is looking a little  thin. Thanks to Matt Drudge for that bogus story. Oh, you saw him. He looked a little bit thinner.  I'm not saying that necessarily. He's a freaking vegan. Yeah. He looks like he's living on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  grass, wheatgrass or something. What's amazing is that if you look at as a really good story on  of all places, Valley Wag, we had a pictorial of Jobs over the last 10 years and it's amazing to  see him. Skinnier and skinnier, isn't he? Yeah. Absolutely. Now, the part of the reason that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wall Street is afraid is because of course he had cancer, he had pancreatic cancer and has been in  remission for some time for that. Andrew, it's a publicly held company. Don't they have to disclose  if he's sick? They said, oh no, he's just got a bug. He's on antibiotics. He's already feeling

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  better. I don't necessarily think personal health is a disclosure. As a matter of fact,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's not a disposable issue. It's not a material. We did a, Teresa Pelletti did a story in Market  Watch on this with a lot of reporting and no, you don't have to report that. You could be  two minutes from dropping dead. It doesn't have to go, you know, it doesn't have to be reported.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is a case where you should have to, cause nobody can run Apple. Well, you know,  he, well, that is an issue. This is the problem. Well, there's a couple of things I want to point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  out about this, this situation. I talked to John Markoff about it, who saw Steve and asked him  specifically about this, how he was feeling. Steve says he's fine. I feel good. What are you  talking about? But there was this picture that ran that Reuters had. You look terrible. Yeah.  Well, apparently according to some posters there, there's two things I learned. One,  it looks like that picture was doctored. Oh. They made him, not that he's not gaunt, but he's not  green. And, and, uh, green. You say they made him green. If you look at the Reuters picture,  their random market watch, which was, came from Reuters. It's a picture of the two of them side  by side and on this newer picture, he's got a green gray tint to his complexion. If they  Photoshop that sucker, Randy Smith, Randy Smith, that's so anyway, so according to John, he looks,  his pallor is fine. So there's that, whatever that is. But the thing that somebody pointed out  in the comments, and this is one of the real interesting things about comments and these  blogs and publications, apparently he had what was called the Whipple procedure for his W-H-I-P-P-L-E-4.  Did they squeeze his Charmin again? So they, which is a six hour operation where they essentially  rewire your entire digestive system. And, uh, and I, yeah, like bariatric surgery then.  It was a bad, it was, yeah, it was a massive, massive, and I mentioned this to Markov and he  says, well, that matches the fact that he knew it was a six hour operation. And the, one of the  things that tends to show up is, uh, malabsorption, uh, not necessarily as a return of cancer, but you  just don't have, your digestive system just doesn't do the job it once did.  You can't, the wheatgrass doesn't go down.  And so basically you, so you just start, you know, you start losing a lot of weight and you get this  gaunt look. Now, um, if he had like the flu or combined with a cold or something, I guess he'd  look pretty crappy. I don't think he has cancer. I don't, I mean, from what I can surmise from all  this, but I think he's like, has long-term, he's going to have this issue. Uh, and being a vegan,  vegetarian for the last X number of years, including leading up to the pancreatic cancer,  which makes you wonder, um, I don't think helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just wish I were that thin. I don't,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think a lot of the problem people have with this is it's not so, you know, a case of Steve  jobs is entitled to his private health, et cetera, but that if Steve jobs were to drop dead tomorrow,  what would happen to Apple?  I mean, it appears to be such a one man show. I mean, it is all about the jobs.  So you really think that you really think that one can show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is a total one man show and he's got nobody groomed to take over that. That's on his level  at the, you know, in terms of having a kind of a meta view of things. And it's, we've seen it  before. If Apple loses Steve jobs, you might as well just kiss the company goodbye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the problem is he's weakened Apple. He's basically turned it into a codependent organization.  He's by making himself the only guy who can make any decisions there. He's completely gutted it.  And there's nobody there who could say Phil Schiller is not going to step up and say,  yeah, I could run this place like Steve because he's been kept from making any  decisions for so long. Is that the case? I think so. I think he looks good. I would  love to be that thin. What's that surgery? I don't think you want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The whipple procedure.  Yes. That's our whipple procedure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please don't squeeze my prostate. I say that every time I go to the doctors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't need to know this sort of thing.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Believe me.  Really going down a hill here on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So anyway, no, I think Apple would have, I think it would be a slow slide,  but it would be just like it was happening before. I mean, when, you know, they went through the  series of CEOs, none of which had any, you know, pizzazz. They just, just not, it's a single-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think that's why the stock went down, Andrew Horowitz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, listen, there's always-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just you sell on the rumor. I mean, you sell on the news. You buy on the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially with Apple. Yeah, especially with Apple. There was nothing, I don't think,  at the point that they got, I mean, there's so many, I don't think I've ever seen any company  have so many rumor sites and people that are dedicated to the rumors and the goings on with,  you know, with anybody but Apple. I mean, it's really quite a cottage industry in itself.  But, you know, I think they pretty much hit it right on. I don't think there's any surprises  here at all. And that being the case, which most people are looking for a surprise, you know,  and hoping for a surprise, it was a bit of a letdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think it's, they did what they had to do. They came out with the 3G phone. That's why  AT&T had already said they were going to do that. You think they should have come out with a new

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  air or update? I think that maybe there could have been, you know, possibly, you know, something more  in the iPhone. I don't think the iPhone had that much of a buzz around. I mean, there was some good  things that they announced, but, you know, the buzz really wasn't, I don't think, there after  the announcement. It kind of just, you know, dropped right off. I mean, they talk about,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what about the, you know, I like mobile. I think mobile me, they finally do something good with  dot Mac. But you know what? It's the Apple aficionados who really care about all this stuff.  Most people are going, okay, it's a new phone. Move on. Not much different. Speaking of which,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  are we going to have our internet cut by the way? I'm kind of curious what we think about,  you know, these companies, you know, really charging us more or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Let's talk about it. Cause John wrote a very interesting article.  Was that in Market Watch that you wrote that? No, PC Magazine.  PC Magazine. He wrote the article. I do that to you, John. I actually wait until you get up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was the code word we were going to use? Yeah, that was when I was going to leave. But now,  I mean, I'm just up here. I'm trying to move some computers around so I get away from the mic. Just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  when I do, you say something. Of course I do. I have a sixth sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your wife? Yeah. My wife does the same thing. I'll be doing a podcast and she always,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the grilled cheese is ready. Come on down. So, I guess what was I asking? Okay. So in the PC

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Magazine, you wrote an article, a column. Which is a reprise of something I wrote six years ago.  And you were wrong then. No, I wasn't wrong. How can you be wrong when you recommend something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay. I thought you said it's like going to happen. Eight reasons your web connection  should be metered. Okay. Everybody in the chat room now, all together, boo, yes, John, ooh.  Why should my, okay. I'm going to let you state your case. Why Comcast and everybody else should  meter what is now an unlimited bandwidth connection. And I'll tell you why you're wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, actually, I should go through the eight reasons that you mentioned it. Let's do the eight  reasons. What are the eight reasons? Well, I have not had to bring the card. I have it in front of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  me. I'll read it to you and you tell me. Number one, elimination of bandwidth caps, restrictions,  and throttling. People make agreements with ISPs that state they have limits on usage  and might be capped if they go over. This is a problem associated with any all you can eat  scheme. It's dumb. Don't we don't want, you're saying we don't want bandwidth caps. I agree with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you on that. All right. That's number one. Okay. Well, you agree. So there's no point of debate

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there. Metering, he says, metering would allow people to use their local machines as web servers  without worrying about some license violation. It happened to Dave Weiner. You know, these are,  maybe they're written or maybe they're written in such fine print nobody sees them or maybe they're  unwritten, but he got to 50 gigabytes in one month on his Comcast and they knocked him off. They  didn't even gate him. They just knocked him off and he acquired and they said, well, yeah, you're  a bandwidth hog. They don't even tell you ahead of time. Number two, promotion of higher speeds.  Everyone knows the faster your connection, the more pleasant the experience, the more pleasant  the experience, the more someone was likely someone is to be online longer and use it.  So because speeds are going up anyway, you say meter it, then they'll make more money.  They will make a little more money. We'll all be at 100 megabits in no time. I think we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  get to 100 megabits anyway because. Yeah, but you're still going to be capped. Go on to number

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  three. Moderate users would pay less than they pay now. I always feel bad for the guy who goes  online for 10 minutes, pays the same flat fee as dedicated users. That's a ripoff. You should be  paying only for what he's using. I think you're right. If there were like a, and I think, you know,  this many companies do offer kind of like a, you know, a low use plan, right? A cheap low use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they? I don't know. I don't see it. It's like 45 bucks for Comcast. I don't know if it's cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Usually the tiering that's going on right now is not by amount of data. It's by speed.  So you can get a cheap DSL plan, but you're, you know, you're limited in the amount of speed you  have, you know, 768 kilobits or whatever. But I'll tell you, the guy goes on 10 minutes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wouldn't know the difference. Right? Yeah, that's true. But if a guy going on 10 minutes, why is it?  Okay. So we have two guys that have the $40 slow speed connection. One guy's downloading movies  and one guy goes on 10 minutes. Why is he paying so much? I'll tell you why. But first number four,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  download junkies would pay for their habit. So what you're saying essentially is the hog should  pay for all of their use and the guys who are light users shouldn't have to pay as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My belief is that if the internet was metered, you, I, and the rest of us who use the thing a lot,  but normally would still be paying about the same amount, maybe less. And these, and these guys who  are just downloading day and night constantly and screwing up the little local loops and everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in between, they would be paying more. Spammers will pay more for junking up the web. I, the problem  I have with this is I don't think spammers are paying now because they're using other people's  connections. Right. Which brings me to the next point. Okay. That was clever. That was nicely done.  So you can see the 0.5 is completely BS. No, it's at least 0.6. Elimination of the net neutrality

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  issues. If web, oh no, I'm sorry, not negative. I'm sorry. I was out of order. This like down for  the seven or eight. The fact is that the spammers won't be paying much, but I guarantee that the  fact that they put people's, you know, put people at risk by putting Trojans on their machines and  the, and like some part of that whole thing. Yeah. Then some guys, a dentist someplace or,  or some housewife has got, she wakes up in the morning and she's, it has spammed the entire  world unbeknownst to her. So she's going to get a big bill and that'll stop her. That will make her

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  think about what the heck's wrong with her. What's wrong with me? Why is my bill so big Comcast?  We don't know. Just shut up and pay it. Number six, elimination of the net neutrality issues.  If web usage is metered, nearly all the net neutrality issues go away. Number seven,  development of IPTV mechanisms. Once it's metered, then there's a business model for the growth of  IPTV, which is of course going to require a lot of bandwidth. Jim Latterback quoted in today's  New York Times saying, Hey, my business revision three relies on this expanded bandwidth.  Number eight, energy savings, AKA green. If you're paying by the bit, you'll want to turn off your  machine and the web connection at right at night, right? I'm sure, I sure will. What? What do you  think you want your machine is in the middle of the night? I'm going to sneak some bits.  Why did you shut your machine down to save bandwidth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because somebody might be, you know, approaching your, your connection. The whole thing is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  McGuffin. It's all set up by the, by the big ISPs. They don't pay anything for bandwidth.  Bandwidth is essentially free right now. It's very cheap. At some point, every one of these guys still

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have to pay for a, for a loop through May East and May West and that costs money. Not well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but most of their bandwidth, all the, all the, it's peering relationships. They're not. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah, that's true. They're not paying. But there's an overhead involved here with all those,  all those servers and all the connections and all the wires. You don't think that that counts for  something? Yeah. And they're getting more than enough already. Well, that's like saying, well,  why would we, why should we be paying for water? It rains every year. Water is a much more scarce  resource. It comes in. No, it's not scarce around here. It's in the Bay area or in some other areas.  There's not scarce at all. There's a lot of places where there's plenty of water, especially in the  Northern States. And why are we paying at all then? Well, because it comes, it rains into the pool  and it goes into a pipe and we get it. Why should we be paying? We should just have a flat fee of  five bucks and that'll be the end of it. That's the same argument. My argument is you should pay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what something's worth. I think that in fact, you're right. Water is worth a lot more than bits.  Bits are virtually free. These guys are just using this just as they did net neutrality as a way  to extort money out of people. It's pure and simple. It doesn't, there's all this dark fiber  under the country. This stuff is cheap and getting cheaper. They're acting like it's getting to be  more scarce. They're acting like it's oil, like it's water. It's not. I'm not taking the side of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the lies. I'm just saying it would make more sense. But it's based on lies. No, it's not.  I don't have one of my eight arguments. There's not one lie in there. I don't talk about the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  shortage of bits. No, but it's ridiculous to say, oh well, what we should do is charge people through  the nose and then that way spammers will have to shut down because- Where do I say charge through  the nose? Well, because you're saying if you're me, you're certainly- I'm saying that it should

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  cost you less than you're paying now and those guys who are hogging all the bandwidth should be  paying more. They should be paying more than you're paying. I will grant you there's an essential

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  element of fairness that people who are hogs should pay more than people who use a dribble  at a time. And that's fine if you want to have tiered based on speed because the dribble at a  time, people don't need the speed and I'll pay more for speed, which I'm doing right now. But I  don't think it makes sense to charge people for the bite because the bite costs nothing. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like the idea of having this tiered speeds either because it slows down the implementation of IPTV,  which is crucial to the growth of this country's telecommunication system. But to meter it would

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  too because nobody's going to download IPTV if it's going to cost them tons of money per-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why do you guys assume it's going to cost tons of money? Just because somebody says they're going  to meter the internet- This is all about making tons of money. Let me ask something, John. If I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  watch more TV than you do and I have every single TV in my house going like 24-7- You should pay  more. I should pay more. You should pay more. Just because I'm consuming more. Yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. I think we're talking about a few different things here. I think the main point is that  radio waves are not a resource. There's very little physical overhead to a radio wave.  Water, there's an overhead, so you meter it. Now the question is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute, stop. What is the overhead for water? I've got the pipes in place. I've got a  big reservoir. It rains into the reservoir. The water goes through the pipes into my house.  What's the overhead? It's all fixed costs. It's capitalized. It's exactly the same cost as the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ISPs. There's no difference. I can see that and visualize that. Isn't the internet pipes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  any weird? The thing with the internet is that the bits are free, the pipes are not.  And so the question just becomes then how do you-  That's why you tier by rate. You tier by rate. Then that person who really wants to watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boodoo Bit Torrents or watch IPTV, let them pay for a better rate. But you cannot cap it because  I'll tell you what, these numbers are going to go up and up and up. There's Hulu, there's iTunes,  there's Revision 3, there's Twit. Everything is moving in the direction of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  grotesque increases in consumption. I stand by my argument A and B, you guys are all living in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  70s. And we're going to continue living in the 70s. Damn it. It didn't work six years ago, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It ain't going to work now. John, is this potentially because it's like telephones in your  home are going to be eventually replaced, it seems, by some other device, particularly your  cell phone, obviously. Who needs to be strapped down to a phone in the house if you can use cell  phones? But if WiMAX comes, and WiMAX will be and could be ubiquitous, just there and it's like air,  it's just there. Are these guys getting nervous about that somehow and trying to make a play to  maybe bring in money now? Is that any way related?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The way WiMAX is structured, there's no way they can roll that thing out and get any kind of  penetration until about 2017 anyway. So that can't be it. At some point WiMAX also has to go back to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a fixed pipe as well. So they're still going to make some money. Do you talk to anybody in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  big ISPs who say, John, we're losing our shirts. These guys aren't paying enough. We got to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  more money. No, I don't hear that. But I do hear a lot of people complaining about the bandwidth hogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That I do hear. I think what's happening is they're too cheap to buy enough bandwidth.  They're going to have to face this anyway. Regardless, bandwidth hogs or not, they're  going to have to buy more bandwidth. They have to because we're all using more bandwidth, all of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's already in the scheme of things. It's not the point. I think it'd be great if we  had just infinite bandwidth and an infinite cap that we didn't have to ever worry about.  Everything was instantaneous, which would be very nice. It didn't cost anything. It should be free  if we're going to take that approach. Why don't we just make the whole thing free and let the  government pay for it? That's crazy. They deserve a profit. How is that any more crazy than your

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  perspective? Because they're asking us to pay more for something that costs them nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no way it costs them nothing. There's a lot of capitalization. There's a lot of expense  that goes into the maintenance itself on these wires, which fall off the poles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't think we're paying for that? Yeah. What does that have to do with how much? Are you saying  that if I download more, I'm wearing out the tubes? No, you're not. But should I have the same water  bill as standard oil? If the water's free and you're paying for the pipes, yes. It's not like the bits

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are wearing out the pipes. That's all I wanted to hear. If you take the position that I and standard  oil should pay the exact same amount for water. Only if the water were free. That's my point.  I'm using the word paying. That means it's not free. It's the other side that should be paying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  not the consumer. Now you're talking about net neutrality. That's what AT&T is trying to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, AT&T wants to have it both ways. They want to charge Google more as well as us more.  They're rubbing their hands in glee. They're saying, look at this. This is great. We're going  to get Google. We're going to get everybody. We're going to make them pay more. And we're  going to give them these caps that seem ample. Right now they say 95% of all consumers use less  than 40 gigabytes. So what's the big deal? Nobody's going to want more than 40 gigabytes. We'll charge  you a buck a gigabyte. Big deal. They totally know that people will be eating gigabytes a day  in five years. They're setting up to take us for a ride. That's why metering the internet and having

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a public utilities commission like environment where people can protest these sorts of things.  It says right in there, I believe it has to be done by government edict.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're saying that we can somehow weigh in on the price we pay, that might change matters.  All I see here is AT&T saying, we're going to charge you 85 bucks for 40 gigabytes or more and  a buck a gigabyte more and just leave it at that. What do you say? The FCC is going to say, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're charging too much. The FCC's problem is right now we have a bunch of num nuts that are  running all these government agencies that just let these corporations run roughshod over us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's one of the things I'm against. I think this is how they're doing it. They're saying we  should charge more for bits because bits are just like water or oil. They're not infinite.  They're a limited resource, but they're not. They're an essentially free resource. I admit  the physical plant costs money. We're paying for that now. If you keep making that argument,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I keep bringing water back into the picture. Because water's not free. Water is free. It  rains. It rains water and the water goes into a pool and then it goes into a pipe. It doesn't  necessarily have to process. Well, you have to process the bits too. You got to put packet  headers on it. You got to do a lot of work on those bits. You have to process the crap out of  them off of a server or off of a router. Water is a scarce resource. Bits are not. I'm sorry.  They're not a scarce resource in all parts of the world. And it's not really a scarce resource  source around here either. It's a scarce resource in Saudi Arabia. It's priced like a scarce resource.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bits are not in any, by any sense of the imagination, a scarce resource. They should not be priced  as if somehow if you use 40 gigabytes, that costs AT&T more than if you use 10 gigabytes.  Because it doesn't. Now, I admit I'm speculating here because I haven't seen their spreadsheets.  I would love them to come to us and say, look, let's show you how much it costs. But it's my  contention from everything I know about peering arrangements and the way these guys do business  and the amount of dark fiber under the ground that bandwidth is not getting more expensive,  it's getting less expensive. It's a lot less expensive. In some cases with peering arrangements,  it's absolutely free. And that's all I'm saying is why are they saying it's getting more expensive?  It's not a scarce resource. It's going the other direction. Prices should be going down, not up,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John. Now, they were smart enough, by the way. Where am I advocating prices going up in this  entire debate? Well, is that the impact? You make this crazy logical illusion that somehow  my argument is talking about jacking up prices. Is that the impact of this? No, the opposite is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cost is higher. No, I'll tell you why it's going up. Because you're right that right now, 95% of  the Americans, as AT&T says, or I think Comcast says, are using fewer than 40 gigabytes a month.  That's the MacGuffin. They're saying, well, right now, only bandwidth hogs use more than 40 gigs.  But all of the usage patterns are going in the opposite direction. We're going to all be using  that much. We'll all be pairing that top tier in for a few years. This is a way for them to  charge more money. No, it's not. It is if you let them. I can't stop them. Now, I'm hoping that  there'll be competition. So the problem is, and this is really the problem, and Andrew, you might  want to weigh on this, it isn't really a perfect market because most areas don't have real  competition. They have two or three providers who collude in effect. Or one. Or one. If this,  I wouldn't worry about what you're saying at all if there were true competition because  some guy come along and say, well, frankly, those bits don't cost me anything, so I'm not going to  do it. And guess who would get all the business? I look at a country like Australia where they have  outrageously low bandwidth caps. Really low. And I think it holds a country like that back.  Now, the problem is that Telstra, which was a government run monopoly, still is government  owned in part, I think 40%. And Telstra has these bandwidth caps. Now, the good news is in Australia,  they're starting to get some smaller ISPs who are eliminating the bandwidth caps. I think for the  economy, I think for the people of Australia, that's really important. And I can tell you  something, I have a dog in this hunt. I care too because I'm putting out high bandwidth content.  And I want to see this be available to everybody. I don't want anybody to have these kinds of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  limitations. That's all. The other thing is, if Comcast, whose stock has been just blah at best  for many, many years, if Comcast was smart enough to do an Amazon-style or the Planet-style  server base where they could have utilized their incoming bandwidth and then had other people  repackaging, if you will, to sell it. In other words, people provision a server, they sell the  server, they could have made a killing on this, but they didn't do so. And now they're looking  to just scrape up any money they can from the wrong side, in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  S1 I'd like to point out that the reason John wrote this column is the same reason he wrote  it six years ago, because it stimulates this kind of conversation. And I think it's a valuable  conversation to have. So thank you, John. We appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John Ligato I'm not insincere with these columns. I mean,  once in a while I do just a pure think piece that is about just designed to get people worked up.  Sometimes I'll do pieces that just to get my, so I can bring myself up to speed, I'll say something  you know, not necessarily stupid, but something that's a little naive, let's say. And I'll get a  lot of feedback and I'll bring myself up to speed. That's not the case with this column.  S1 You firmly believe this?  John Ligato Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  S1 Well, all right. I just disagree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John Ligato Oh, yeah. Well, I can tell that. But I can see now that you just mentioned your own

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  conflict of interest. I can see why. S1 I do have a conflict of interest, but I think it's not  merely my interest. I think it's the interest of not just content producers, but everybody.  I'll tell you, it hurts people. I think they can't participate in this new media revolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John Ligato And a more important thing right now is the fact that they're trying to ramrod  a bunch of tax bills through to charge people for buying online for every little Tom, Dick, and Harry  little city and municipality that has their own 0.5%. You know, they want this all paid out to  these guys because they can't get revenues any other way, even though they do everything in their  power to set up speed traps into these places and scam people in parking meters. Like in San  Francisco, it's 50 bucks if you're on a meter and the meter goes bad for two seconds.  S1 They need a lot of money on that too. That's a real windfall.  John Ligato And it's all outsourced to screwy companies, so you can't even go to court to fight  it. This kind of thing seems more important to me than the denial of my absolutely perfect logic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  S1 I'll tell you why I think I am really defensive about the internet because I think the internet  is a vehicle of absolute huge change societally. And I think that there should be really as few  limits on it as possible. That's why net neutrality is so important because it's transformative. And  I think it's more than just me making a little stupid little show that you can download. It's  really transformative. And you have to agree on that. And one of the reasons they want to tax  Amazon is because if you're a mom and pop brick and mortar store, you're losing business like crazy  to these online guys, partly because there's no sales tax. Admit it, you shop there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  S1 I'm not buying that at all. I don't think it's true. I don't see any of that.  John Ligato I shop there because there's no sales tax.  S1 You shop there because you're lazy.  John Ligato Well, that too.  The fact of the matter is, is that there's little bookstores you go into and you speak,  you don't go into a bookstore, which is which has the ability to do merchandising that they  can't do at Amazon because it's not, you can't walk in and touch product.  S1 I love going to a bookstore. You're right.  John Ligato So you go to the bookstore, you see this cool book. Do you ever say,  well, this is interesting. I bet you I can get it for two bucks cheaper at Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  S1 Maybe not a book, maybe not a book, but I guarantee you it happens on electronics, on cameras,  on big ticket items.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  S2 I don't think, I don't think the difference is just sales tax though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I don't think the difference can be just that. I mean, over here, we have to pay sales tax.  John Ligato You have a huge sales tax. You have a VAT.  S1 Well, ours is almost 18%, but you have to pay that on Amazon purchases as well,  but Amazon is still cheaper.  John Ligato Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  S1 I don't think it's just that. There's also the selection. A lot of these little stores,  they don't have any selection anymore. And it's not because of online, it's because they don't  bother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Ligato But if you're going to, I have, we had a sponsor, it was a camera store,  small mom and pop camera store, been around for 50 years, really focused on service.  Customers would come in, they'd say, well, show me the different Canon cameras or Kodak,  and they'd do a little, spend an hour with them. Customers say, thanks a lot. They go out and they  buy it on Amazon because it's cheaper and there's no sales tax. And when you're buying a thousand

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  dollar item, it's not only online, it's also look at what could happen to the hardware stores in  America. You never used to walk in and you know, your friendly neighborhood hardware store, the  pharmacies for that matter. I mean, what, you know, these things have been consolidated because  of the fact that it's just a much greater level of overall abilities to do pricing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  S1 Well, that's why Walmart succeeded. But why does online succeed? Is it the same reason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  S2 I don't, is online killing, what stores specifically is online killing Walmart?  S1 Would you want to be in the bookstore business right now?  S2 You've never wanted to be in the bookstore business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  S1 Would you want to be in the video store business right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  S2 I mean, the bookstore business isn't killed by Amazon. It was killed by these big chains.  S1 That's true.  S2 I mean, the same with the publishing business. You know, these people start consolidating. Once  consolidation starts taking place, competition gets screwed over. It's got nothing to do with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  online. Just blaming online for everything. S1 So you're saying it's not the sales tax,  it's convenience, it's variety. It's a lot of other, it's poor merchandising, the parts of small  mom and pop stores. So you think the sales tax, and I guess you're right, Will, if it doesn't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  S2 Well, now, wait, let's wait, let's back up. Everybody out there has bought online. It goes  like this. Oh, this is interesting. Here's a photo filter I want to buy from these guys,  because I can't get it anyplace else. No photo stores around carry it. And it's like $2, which  is about half the price I'd be paying anyplace else. And golly, I don't have to even pay sales  tax on this $2. Okay, let me go order it. $2 plus $6 shipping and handling. I end up paying more  online half the time. If I could get the product, I could walk into a store, if I could walk into a  Target and get it, I would get a better deal than having to pay these ridiculous shipping  and handling prices where they make all their money. S1 You know what, the guys that I feel

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sorry for are really all those adult stores. Man, who walks into a store and actually buys adult DVDs  now? All about the online. S2 I don't even understand that. S1 What a shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  S2 You know, it was such a great experience going behind the beaded curtain in the back of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  video store. S1 You want to check out this buying shoes online. Have you done that?  S2 Zappos, baby. S1 Oh, yeah, I shoe buy. I get like seven or eight different shoes and sizes and  things. They ship them to you. There's no cost for the shipping. And then they give you the  receipts back to ship them all back when you're... S2 I'm going to give you an example. The catalogs

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  probably have done that too. S1 How could they even be making money?  S2 I don't know. I'll give you an example. So I need running shoes. So I go to our full service  running shoe store, where they watch your gait. They look at you. They do the whole thing. It  took an hour. She chose the perfect shoes for me. I noted down the model number. And when I needed  a replacement, did I go back to that store? No, I went to Zappos. I guiltily admit that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm the problem. S1 This, no, this is going... What is the difference between doing that and  the following? You go to some high end Lexus dealer and you go there and you find the car you want.  Lexus, Honda, I don't care what it is. And you find the car you want and you say, this is pretty  cool. And then you go over to your credit union, which has special deals for you employees that  work for the city of such and such. And you order the car through them. What's it got to do with  online? This kind of practice has been going on forever in one way, shape or form. S2 You're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right. Because there's always going to be somebody who has lower overhead who's going to give you a  deal. Okay, I'm going to buy it now because it's not the sales tax in that case either. It's just,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  again, a better deal. Period. S1 On the other hand, it does make sense that online should be  collecting sales tax because in fact, that law was obviously on the books for the  statewide sales or out of state sales. And you've got to wonder when they're going to finally

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  crack that. S2 It's horrible to think about. I mean, there are... If it was one sales tax that  you could collect, countrywide, it would be fine. But it's like every city's now got their own little  piece of the pie. And it's like a nightmare for some... S2 Computers can figure that out.  S1 Yeah, the computers can figure it out. I agree with that. But then who's going to write all these  checks? And who's going to find the place to send the checks to? And what happens when a check is  late? It's like an overhead nightmare to send out the checks to 50 different states and probably  another 150 cities. And God knows what else in between municipalities, counties, who knows what  other kind of taxes are out there. S2 I have to point out though. S1 You're sending thousands of  checks out a year to these guys, which sometimes with 10 cents on it. S2 I have to point out that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there is a fundamental underlying consideration you have to know about John C. Dvorak. He doesn't  like taxes because he thinks he's giving money to morons. S2 I don't like taxes. S2 All taxes are bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to you, John. S1 I'm personally getting worried about John. He's a little bit worked up. John,  you get to take your blood pressure? S2 I love getting John worked up. S2 Checking it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  S2 You know what we used to do? We used to do the radio show in the early 90s. And we were catered  by Mel's Diner and they would bring like pastrami. S2 Oh God, it's killing us. It's trying to kill us.  S2 It was really, we were trying to kill him. And then I'd get them all worked up, get him the  pastrami with a Russian dressing and get them all worked up. It was great. You see him turn bright  red. But you were too young then, John. I could really get you now. S2 Yeah, I got too much Polish

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in me. S2 That's right. It's your natural food. S1 You know what, Leo? S2 What, Mel? S2 Somebody  actually told me on a similar note, and you trend amongst his male video gaming friends,  because obviously, you know, the more time you spend in front of a computer, the less thin and  fit you get. And they've started this process of fat bombing each other. Where instead of  challenging each other to like go to the gym and get fit, what they do is when they go around to  each other's house, they sneak like a massive box of chocolates or a massive like box of donuts  and hide them under the sofa. Because they know that as soon as you sit down to play GTA 4 or  something, and you suddenly spot there's a massive box of donuts under the sofa, you're not going to  move until you finish those donuts in that game of GTA 4. So they all progressively get fatter  rather than trying to get each other thinner. I think that's brilliant. S2 You would. S2 It

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  reminds me, John. It reminds me actually, I have a box of chocolates here for you, John. S2 I think  you need them more than I do, Leo. S2 This is no, I already ate mine. They sent us two. This is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mono artisan chocolates. S2 Oh, you know, those artisan chocolates sometimes can be quite good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  S2 John, this is like wine. This is like they've got a varietal on it, you know, where it came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  S2 Oh, you know, I've seen this. Yeah, that's like, actually, isn't one of our isn't one of the guys  we know some high tech guy. S2 Louis Rosetto is doing Cho. S2 Rosetto, right. Rosetto is doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  varietal chocolate. S2 It's very good TCHO. And I was talking about it because Amy, Amy Crittenden  S2 sent me a box of it because she's doing the PR for it and I loved it and I ate it on  S2 twit live. And so our mono, who is also a tech guy, the guy who started this said, well, you know,  S2 Cho is fine, but there's another bean to bar roaster that is very good. It's my company, a mono.  S2 They make them in Colorado. He listens to twit while he makes the chocolate. And you know what?  S2 Send them to me. S2 I have, I have this box. I have shown such restraints. S2 You can play,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, Leo, put it right next to that microphone. S2 All right, wait a minute. Just so you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's going on on camera right now. Microphone chocolates right there. That's for John C.  S2 Put it in a box there with a lock on it. S2 You come by, I won't eat this. I've been so good,  John. I've known this. These are $7 a bar. They're like 20 bars in here. I've been so good.  S2 Have you had any? S2 No, I had my own box and I ate them all. But, but that, but I haven't  touched yours and I've known it's been in here. S2 Well, I would admire that because if it was that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  great, I probably would have. I actually, I don't know, you know, I try, I'm trying to minimize

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  eating candy. S2 I know I didn't want to fat bomb you. So I'm just saving it until you,  I know it should, we should, neither of us should be eating that. You're in much better shape than  I am. I feel like somebody like Tim Russert and you know that 50 year old guys, guys in our 50s  with a little extra weight, all of us gasped a little bit to think. S2 No, every time somebody,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  why, you know, every time somebody dies in their third, especially if they die in their 30s or 40s,  well, then you think there's something else involved. S2 Right. If they die, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  late 50s heart disease, asymptomatic, you go, oh, oh, and I just kind of patted my heart and said,  I hope you're okay in there. Just be good. Be good for a few more years. I just, just kind of get

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  S2 Well, probably Tim Russert. I now thank him kind of in wherever he is for saving my chocolate,  because apparently I think that's what did it. S2 That's exactly what happened. I wouldn't eat it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because of Tim. Hey, we got it. We're gonna run. This has been a great show and I want to do another  hour with you and I probably could, but we really should run. We didn't get to all the stories. I do  want to mention that Firefox three comes out on Tuesday, the 17th. They are trying to set a Guinness  book of world records for the most south software downloaded in 24 hours. You could participate  by going to spreadfirefox.com and making a pledge that you will download on. I don't know why I've  never heard of a company saying everybody download this program now. Talk about crazy and with  problems. S2 Yeah, they should be paying. S2 No, it underscores my point, John, the bandwidth is free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  S2 Well, here we go. Wait till they get their money. Yeah, it's freely like that bill you got

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that one time. S2 That wasn't free. But but you know, he was able to waive that bill without  bankrupting himself because it really didn't have any real cost. 1.2 actually almost 1.3 million  pledges so far. Let's let's help him with that record. We could add a few hundred thousand from  the twit army. If you just go there, spreadfirefox.com and you know, I've been using firefox three and  every beta is now released Canada three and I think it's really it's it's the best firefox ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I hated Firefox two by the way. S2 I did too. I think you should send the twit army to sign up

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for the real Dvorak on Twitter. 1.2 Please do make john you know what I don't care. I've given up.  I know Kevin Rose is a better man. I know the Dignation is better than the twit army. That's  okay. I can live with that. But I can't live with my poor friend john c Dvorak below Mac rumors that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

S2 And so I'm  thinking I wanted to be under Veronica for a while and then maybe I could pass her up and  be on top of her as it were. S2 Excellent. Excellent. Now I'm going to I'm going to actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  come on to Twitter now. 1.2 What's your you're not on Twitter yet? S2 Oh, I am don't don't don't please  tell them to go. S2 By the way, why do we keep calling her Victoria? 1.2 And to me,
