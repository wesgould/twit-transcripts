People I haven't seen in years and years and years.  Actually people I wish I hadn't seen in years and years and years.  And somebody I haven't seen in years and years and years.  Starting with John C. Dvorak on my left.  He's actually in studio drinking a fine 2001 Bordeaux today.  The Leoville Barton, which he says is pronounced Barton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Barton.  Irish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leoville Barton.  It's from Maine.  And he popped the cork on this thing.  He said we got to drink it now.  That's what he always does when he gets in here.  He says, oh no, you got to drink this right now.  He always finds a wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no, you got to drink this right now.  It's a fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel that way about all wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so glad to see Becky Worley, who I haven't seen in ages.  It's nice to see you again.  Since I saw you last, you had a baby.  Two.  Two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Twins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The same time.  And a show on the Travel Channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that still on the Travel Channel?  No, it is.  But they have a new host.  I realize that motherhood and pregnancy genes don't go well with treasure hunting.  So what are you doing these days?  I'm working for ABC News.  Pretty much full time for Good Morning America.  Full time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you go out there how often?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Two, three times a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's a lot.  Full time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  And starting some web elements for them.  I basically consume tech media all week long and try and figure out how to spit it out.  Is important for the masses of people here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are you their sole arbiter of what's hot in tech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's someone who does business and helps us figure that out.  And then I've also gotten this strange beat of weird consumer gadgets.  So I review infomercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so glad I don't have to do that.  Oh, you like Miss Snuggie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I actually had an editorial moment where I said the Snuggie is so overrated.  It's an airplane blanket with sleeves.  It's so stupid.  We're not reviewing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was my tough one.  Oh, you said, oh, we're not going to cover it.  How about the Slanket?  Did you cover the Slanket?  Slanket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You keep up with this crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a bathroom robe you wear backwards.  I have strong opinions.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Becky was the first producer of the screensavers and Call for Help, later host on Call for  Help.  We go way, way back.  Yeah, we do.  Yeah.  It's so nice to see her.  It's really good to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are the twins names?  Finn and Emilia.  Boy and a girl.  Not Finn and Huck?  No.  Decided against the girls.  Finn and what?  Emilia.  Oh, that's beautiful.  That's a Hawaiian name.  And she has had many people call her Amalia.  So when Obama was elected president, I was thrilled.  Because he's the first Hawaiian president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's really focus on the important part.  That's what's historic there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And secondly, his daughter's name is Malia.  So people now start pronouncing my kid's name right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Malia is a Hawaiian name.  Mary.  Oh, I'll be darned.  And Amalia.  Emalia.  Emalia is just Mary.  Em-a-lia.  Em-a-ry.  Something like that.  Close enough.  I didn't know that.  That's really cool.  Well, it's great to have you both on.  There's actually nothing to talk about, so it's good we have some good wine.  We have a little cheese a little later on.  We can have some bread.  We can talk about Twitter.  No!  OK, now I'm with two people and everybody who's listening is going to be so glad who  hate Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't hate Twitter at all.  You hate Twitter Talk.  I hate Twitter Talk, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, you made that abundantly clear two weeks ago.  I got more hate mail from people who agree with you and say Twitter's, Twit's turning

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to Twitter.  And then the first thing that you do is you bump me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You say, that's it.  I'm never having him back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My big beef, and I think this is where Dvorak and I actually agree, is that Twitter is like  a fraternity where everybody's just talking about what's happening in the house and hey,  who's you and what's going on and I've got friends and you've got friends and what's  new.  But wait a minute.  It just gets so laborious.  Yeah, I agree with you.  There's a lot of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree with you.  But if you were following Lance Armstrong, for instance, you knew that he broke his collarbone  before any news organization told you.  In fact, I was talking to somebody, well, it was last week on NBC, who works for, was  it NBC or ABC, who said, yeah, we were way behind on the story.  We're trying to break this thing an hour later.  And it turns out an hour ago, Lance has Twittered that he broke his collarbone, right?  And that's not news, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, but here's the point.  Is if you are an assignment desk editor at a major network, you need Twitter.  But the signal to noise ratio for the average person is so high that we need to minimize,  not maximize.  And getting higher.  It's overwhelming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Curry was telling me how he was using it.  He's got a little specialized feed to follow the riots in London.  He says all the Twitterers are out there Twittering that the police are coming around the corner

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and all that's actually very useful if there's something breaking news.  And I think it's going to be more and more that case.  You use a search tool in a lot of ways.  Tweet deck will do it.  Twirl will do it.  Even Twitter has its own search dot Twitter dot com.  Mumbai was a big one.  But at the same time, there was controversy over Mumbai because it seemed like some of  the news was too fast, was rumor, was not speculation or was on was blatantly untrue.  People were using it.  How long before we start seeing spam and junk and people misusing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In my opinion, it's already jumped the shark that it's it's it's going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's my favorite phrase.  Jumping the shark.  And there's another one that goes along with jumping the shark.  I can't remember what it is now.  Christopher Walken fake.  See Walken fake.  They bumped him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's Calcannus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Calcannus.  He does the best impression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So get ready for this.  The University of Virginia, UVA, which was very technical, is a really technical school.  In fact, I have watched that from Virginia Tech, but it's a good school for technology,  has decided to close its computer labs.  Because everybody's already got a computer, probably ghost town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's too bad.  And I say that because there's no other place to anonymously post the porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where are you going to spam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Only four freshmen showed up at the University of Virginia in 2007 without a computer of  their own. Only four.  So the school says, why are we running campus computer labs when everybody who comes here

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  comes with their own computer so that somebody can install BitTorrent and use that  processing power?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  72 percent running Windows, 26 percent running Mac OS 10.  That's kind of a surprise.  I thought more Macs were in schools, but apparently not.  And six out of the 3013 matriculating freshmen had Linux.  Six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are the boys. Those are our guys.  They're our men. They're the ones listening right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that tells me that it can't be that heavy of a CS program if there are only six dudes  there with Linux. If you went to Stanford or you went to Berkeley, it'd be.  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, in 97, 10 years earlier, still a lot of computers came in with computers.  74 percent of incoming freshmen owned computers, but only 16 percent of those were  laptops. There were desktops.  People brought desktops to school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I am young enough, but old enough to have had a computer in college.  You had a computer. Oh, you are young.  Dad, my father's here.  Five grand, four grand.  Jim Worley, ladies and gentlemen.  Four grand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Four thousand dollars.  He remembers because he wrote the check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was four grand and Apple II.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You had it. You brought an Apple II to college for four grand.  What? To play Choplifter?  What did you bring an Apple II to college for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What? I made fake IDs.  I made fake IDs.  I used to print out word process.  I had this little graphics program that I did.  And that's how I got my start in sort of computer geekery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a great pie chart on ours,  Technica of incoming students who own computers at University of Virginia.  It's all blue. It's just big blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a big blue pie chart.  So do you remember the old show SCTV with Rick Moran?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know I'm Jerry Todd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hilarious to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, reference for those of us who aren't that old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not that old a show. Watch this.  I've got to you know, when you're watching the Jerry Todd show, it's very important.  We've got our own lower third graphics.  We call those lower third graphics.  And I like to change the shade just a little bit every once in a while  just to show you that I can do it here.  Let me use the fader and whoa.  Heart, please. Heart, why?  I can do any kind of wipe you want.  Really need a heart.  I don't know if I have a heart white, but I do have the star white.  That's always always a popular one with.  Yeah, we've got the technology here.  The ladies love it.  There you go. There's the round hole wipe.  I don't know what that is.  Wow. Leo.  Are you excited? I know it's pretty pretty darn exciting.  I even have thanks to the miracle of modern digital technology,  little robots I can run across the screen anytime I want.  There he is. He's kind of a I'm sorry.  This is the thing. The other people.  The other thing people actually become that person.  I am that person.  You know, actually, when I when I first started doing this,  I put a video up from SCTV on the blog saying I've turned into Jerry Todd  and it was pulled.  They did a DMCA takedown notice shortly after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think so.  They're losing their what do they care?  That show hasn't been on in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, I got one more thing to say about this computer situation at UVA.  Yes. Which is when I was doing comedy, it's funnier when I was doing  Computer Science 106, which was basic programming in C.  Yes. In grad school, mind you.  Yes. Sure. I was getting my handed to me.  And the only way I got through it was just throwing myself on  the people sitting next to me in the computer lab and asking for help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Where do you go now?  You threw that. What did you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I threw myself through herself at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know. And my father's in the room.  No, I mean, really, I I that the camaraderie that you get in those environments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think that's a shame in a way.  I mean, after all, it's like saying, oh, everybody who comes to school  has their own books. What do we need a library for? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good point.  It's like Starbucks has there is a thing that's at some level,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  especially if you're going to be like a Linux user or just in the early days  when you're a CPM user, you had to have somebody next to you half the time.  How do you do this? How do you do that? Right.  And people would show each other how it was a lot of folklore involved with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's still that way in all learning.  And I think it's a mistake to get rid of these central locations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Corporations have figured out that if you lower the walls  in the cube farms, productivity goes up because people talk to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't know if I like that.  Well, I don't really want to talk to learning environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know no talking to you.  They talking. God forbid you'd have to speak.  But you know that there is something for those communal spaces.  It doesn't necessarily have to be around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's a really I think it's an excellent point, actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  especially when you're programming, because everybody hits that roadblock  and you just run out of ideas and you need lateral thinking.  And for that, you need help. Yeah.  So all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you bring back the computer center, bring back the lab, ditch the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's a good food instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Have to have little beanbag chairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have everybody hooked to a network with machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think it's in any way significant?  So sorry I brought this up.  I'm going to do it anyway.  The Britney Spears has passed Barack Obama on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But he stopped Twittering.  No, he Twittered again last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't I the one who years ago said something about Britney Spears?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were the one who said it'll this is when it will jump the shark.  Well, you didn't use those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I said that's when it would become extremely actually Ashton Kutcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, that's really the end of the world.  Ashton Kutcher has passed Barack Obama on Twitter again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like, do you read the guys' Twitters?  They're so idiotic, annoying and egomaniacal.  It's like, let's do a thing that shows Mrs.  Kutcher how much the world loves her.  Oh, God. And let's all tweet how much we love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, for a person who hates Twitter, you follow these things.  I don't even have him listed.  I just wrote your CG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did. For some reason, I just wrote your CG out as Demi Moore.  I don't know. I don't know what that.  I don't know why I did that.  I had a dire hair.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ooh.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Take a visual of that thing in Charlie's Angels, the surfboard.  Just run with that for a while.  Is it BeckyWerley.com?  BeckyWerley.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What will we find there?  Everything but her Twitter name.  Yeah, old stuff.  What is your Twitter name? Becky Werley?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's BWerley. I don't.  I really just lurk.  I totally lurk. I have no interest in tweeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm kind of losing my interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've said that since the first day of this thing.  I know, and I can't.  And you went from one to another, every alternative.  And then you get real jealous when everybody passes your numbers,  and you say you lost interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, get this. This is another Twitter story.  As long as we're going to do it, I'm just going to get out of my system,  and then we're going to stop, and we're going to move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, as we look back in history, it's going to be Stephanopoulos.  That was the point when it crossed the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When George Stephanopoulos went on Twitter? Why?  The McCain interview was the dumbest.  Oh, that was the stupidest thing ever.  John said it was a stunt, pure stunt, stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, in some senses, it gained enough notoriety amongst a certain level of viewer.  But I mean, when we look back, really, I think that might be the point  where we all go, all right, that was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the question. And Twitter has announced it's going to start charging businesses  for an enhanced version of Twitter.  Freemiums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a gun around here?  Yeah, we'll find one for you.  I think there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There probably is. I got everything else.  You know, you could brain me with Miami.  The thing is sharp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was just noticing that.  I think if I die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Camera shot.  Oh, yeah, I keep it in the shot, you bet.  If I die, I want to be, you know, I want the detective to say,  hmm, those puncture wounds, they look just like the wings on an Emmy award.  Is there one around here anywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God, it's on the mantle.  And then he would say, ah, but it's the small Emmy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, break my heart.  I'm already dead and you're going to break my heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Doesn't that just mean that has the plastic base?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got a real base.  It's just that the big round.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, quick freeform.  What would you pay for?  Twitter. I pay for followers if I was a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's what Jason Callahan said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why are we even talking about it?  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My job is to keep us on the news.  I don't want to talk about it.  When Jason comes back on, he'll talk about it to extremes.  And so we don't need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't need to raise this in any way, shape or form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Each person's probably worth a dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mark Cuban screaming at referees on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, what is Twitter?  What's a referee supposed to be getting?  Two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, one of the I can't remember which team it was.  They had a player who's Twittering at halftime.  Yeah. Yeah. He got a little bit of a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do we know he's not I aming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the difference?  Here's the here's the tweet.  I mean, he said he said, no, the player said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sneaking off to tweet during halftime.  And he got in big trouble.  Mark Cuban, how do they not call a tech on J.R.  Smith for coming off the bench to talk our player on the ground?  Scary part of that same play.  This is all on his. You're right.  I'm sick of it. I want to throw up.  I want to throw up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who gives a rip?  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable. It's unbelievable.  You know, it's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's secretly sponsored. Steve.  Yeah, they're paying.  The name of the show is no accident, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perry, you're paying me.  Steve Wozniak survived dancing with the stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you see Denise Richards?  She. Yeah.  And that other woman. Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Belinda Carlisle was pretty bad.  Oh, you mean the big boobed woman.  How could that happen?  Holly go lightly.  What about it? It's network television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was what happened. That's your network.  What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is your network that you're condemning.  You thought it was too sexy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What did you think it was?  She you know, she was half former girlfriend.  Oh, my God. She's who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I've never seen someone with such big boobs be so unsexy in my whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly right. You're exactly right.  Oh, my God. There was no there was no sex appeal, no sensuality, nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, for those of you who didn't see it, we're talking about a woman with double D boobs  who was less sexy than the Woz.  I just want you to like you're actually right.  Naked of the Woz on a segue with lasers.  More attractive, more attractive, more attractive.  Bimbo. Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was that's kind of a sad statement, but you're absolutely right.  Now, how do Woz survive? It must have been the Internet votes, right?  Well, it's because he's the worst.  You've got to admit he's got people vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is this effect.  I voted for him.  But I voted for him 13 times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They know he's got a following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's going to two theories, one mind, one someone else's someone else's.  He was so it's fixed, absolutely destroyed by the judges who said it was the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they call him a Teletubby, the dancing Teletubby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The natural effect for the voter is to sympathize underdog.  Second thing, there's some sort of a botnet out there.  It's possible that Conficker is actually  vote. Woz.org.  Yes, that's what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is he knows how to do this stuff.  He's probably voting for himself.  But Woz.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you know, I had we had Woz on and did a little interview with him.  And he said it would be wrong.  That means he did it.  Remember that he and Steve Jobs got their start making blue boxes.  He said it would be wrong for people to stuff the ballot box for me.  But he was upset.  He was actually upset. The judge, he retracted it later, but he was upset at the judges.  He said after week number one, I can't I can't decide which is worse.  Talking about Twitter or dancing with the stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're trying to top yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That nothing happened this week.  Yes. OK. Apple sued over various infringements regarding the iPhone.  Oh, that always happens.  Apple sued every three weeks.  Did anybody turn their lights off at 830 last night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eiffel Tower did, but only for five minutes.  Did you? I forgot about it.  I didn't forget. I saw I was eight twenty two.  I thought, do I really want to see?  Nobody will notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanted to go to my porch and look at San Francisco because I could see the whole city.  I thought that'd be cool. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm today. You forgot. I forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love Chris Kosatch put on Facebook later that evening.  I was sitting in the dark with the baby. Does that count?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Accidentally, Earth Hours.  AT&T ISPs are like there's a cop for the RIAA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not 100 percent true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, give us the facts.  We're getting ladies and gentlemen,  we're trying to get back to an actual real old fashioned drink.  My wine. Well, the point is, the drink is blues away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You'll have the wine.  Well, the question is whether they're just sending the letters,  threatening letters saying, hey, the RIAA has said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they they asked them, would you disconnect somebody?  And they said it violates the terms of service.  They didn't say yes or no.  They said it violates the terms of service.  They're not going to. This is BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  80 20 80 percent of people get that letter.  They're freaking out. People already get that letter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody, every ISP is already passed.  Most of the time what they do, they get this.  The John Doe subpoena from the RIAA, the John Doe subpoena.  The RIAA only knows an IP address. Would you like some more?  Oh, God, did I kill you guys on?  You've kind of powered right through that.  The RIAA already only has the address, doesn't have the name.  They go to the ISP. The ISP knows the name.  They say somebody's  somebody's streaming Pirates of the Caribbean three, you know, endlessly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They already said what these guys do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're just streaming.  So they are they are already the ISP will send a note.  That started again.  They'll say it's come to our attention.  You're streaming Pirates of the Caribbean.  Would you please stop?  And they've been doing that all along.  I don't think they really let's ask the chairman.  Has anybody in the chat room?  Been kicked off.  I mean, these guys, of course, they're all online.  But has anybody had trouble?  Has anybody received one of these letters?  Have they ever been kicked off? Did they stop?  Most people are going to get that note and they're going to stop.  They're going to steal the neighbor's Wi-Fi and do it from there.  They're not going to keep doing it. No, nobody in the chat rooms.  Well, someone guy says the RIAA burned my house to the ground.  Well, I think that's not.  Yeah. You know, here's somebody who got a letter.  After the letter, did you do anything?  Kept doing it.  And then what happened?  He said another guy says typically it's three strikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, this sounds like steroids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, these guys know that they know the details.  Oh, you believe this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Twitter army, man, they know.  I know. Yeah, I did it once.  These guys single handedly kept waz and dancing with the stars.  Are you kidding me?  That's probably true. It just takes one news story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, really, this is like the single mom who's a nurse  working double shifts, whose teenage son, you know, gets sued by the RIAA  and it's going to eat all her savings.  And everybody gets all the attention.  Scares enough people. That's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The RIAA doesn't actually even have to win these cases.  No, what they don't want is to lose one of these cases  because that will get equal attention and maybe encourage the pirates. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're bailing out on this.  I think this is going to be a bad strategy.  That's why they went with the AT&T thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, I'm just going to be contrarian for a second.  And despite my tone of voice, I think that there's got to be a solution.  I really think that this if piracy is as serious as they're saying.  I mean, what do you guys think?  Is it a percentage? Is it 10 percent?  Is it eating the lunch of this industry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, there's a guy  actually, I've corresponded with them a little bit.  There's a program called World of Goo.  Twenty dollars. Great program. Mac, Windows, no copy protection at all.  Very unusual for a video game.  He says we know that people are pirating it like crazy.  In fact, you know, we see the stats.  It's the number one, you know, distributed game out there.  We don't put any DRM in it.  He said, for one reason, it doesn't stop piracy.  So we could put the copy protection in, but all it would do is annoy our users.  Our paying customers without in any way stopping the pirates.  So we feel like what are we going to do? We can't stop it.  We're selling it enough.  And that's the real point is, you know, if somebody downloads Pirates  of the Caribbean 3, does that mean they didn't buy the DVD?  I don't think that guy was going to buy the DVD.  Does it mean they don't see the movie?  I don't think that guy was, you know, I don't think they lose money to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Old argument. This is the argument I've been, you know, kind of pushing forever.  It doesn't cost them. Really.  There's some of these guys out there who who've literally collected  every song known song in the universe.  But they're not going to buy those.  We're going to buy every known song in the universe.  And in fact, they don't have the life, a long enough life to listen  to every song in the universe.  Poops tech. Nice handle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Says CD and DVD sales up 14 percent this year.  They're not losing. Oh, ops tech. Oh, PO ops tech.  Sorry, poops. I mean, pops. I mean, PO ops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, so that's this is my my beef is this is DRM sucks.  But free market solutions to the problem.  I'm just curious. I mean, I just I really don't know.  I think you just live with it.  I think you live with it. Exactly. Times have changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the way it is. That's today's lens.  What are you going to do? How much money is the R.I.A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and all of these labels?  How much money are they wasting by just pursuing this? Lots.  And is that the free market solution? They just let it go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, presumably it pays for itself because most people do settle.  I mean, it's only a few thousand dollars.  Most people settle when they get that letter.  They're not going to fight them in court.  So they make a few thousand bucks.  I bet you it's breaks.  You know, I have many artists say, OK, where is the money?  They don't give the money to the artists when they win, by the way.  Yeah, the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The artists always get screwed. The artist always loses.  OK, let's go to another topic.  So we keep the show moving.  I'm trying to crank. That's supposed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know it's you're not doing the job.  Can Ficker. I brought you in here.  Con Ficker down a dump.  This is an interesting story.  It was estimated.  We talked about this a few weeks ago that nine to 15 million people  have this worm on their computer right now and don't know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Three to 12 or some of the other estimates.  Three to 12 million or three to 12 people.  12 people. My mom, your mom.  That's three.  That's Rhode Island, Hawaii. Right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  April 1st, the we know that Con Ficker  Variant C, which is the most prevalent, will go out to the Internet  to download a new payload.  But we don't know what the payload is.  Nobody does. Nobody will till April 1st.  Symantec, if you go to their website, says, don't worry about it.  No big deal. We just know that it's going to, you know,  it'll just make it harder to detect.  That's all it's going to do.  I think what they're saying is, don't worry, it's not going to erase your hard drive.  Of course, it's not because they want to stay on your system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whatever happened to those good old days when they would erase your drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Years old, Melissa, 10 years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They would erase your hard.  They don't do that anymore.  These these kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the things that Con Ficker does, I love, is it prevents you from going  to any of the antivirus sites where you can get a removal tool.  It removes. I mean, these guys are smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But OK, so this reporting for two domain names on April 1st,  it has the power to do that right now. Right.  It's just that there's code written into the virus that says April 1st.  April 1st is a magic day.  That seems to me like a marketing stunt.  That says to me, I agree 100 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am because this is the April Fool's joke is that there's nothing going to happen.  Nothing's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I disagree. I think.  No, I think I was bringing money down.  Nothing's going to happen. There is an auction happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  An auction. Oh, it's a marketing stunt.  Not for us. An underground auction.  It's for the bad guys.  What would you like Con Ficker to do today?  Brilliant. That's right. Could be.  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because it has a lot of malice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need to send out some spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It has a good storyline for the media to pick up on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's going to get a lot of publicity as it has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes. And I think that if I were.  That's brilliant. You're absolutely right.  That's exactly it. This would be the way to market to someone who's nefarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how do we find it?  We like can you Google Con Ficker auction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got to go black Google dot com or or whatever Google is.  The dark Google. Dark Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dark Google dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just kidding.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's actually not a bad idea for a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man, that is brilliant.  Dark Google.  Where all the stuff that Google won't.  If you've been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that says all the ones that have the little no robots,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, although you ignore.  I ignore robots dot text and search those places.  Only only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I mean, the thing is, is do you think that the economy is actually going to take  viruses and botnets and turn them from the sort of petty vandalism  that they've been in the past into actual economic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it has. That's happened a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But to what extent that huge average Joe is aware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seven to ten. Well, I don't know about the average Joe.  Seven to ten cents per computer co-opted.  That's the average going price.  Actually, the BBC got a little trouble because they bought a botnet,  the 20,000 computer botnet for a documentary.  They didn't say, but they said it was surprisingly affordable.  So it's a couple of grand.  It's a small botnet.  Twenty thousand, you know, relatively small.  Ten cents a piece. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twenty grand. Twenty grand.  And then 10 to 2000 for 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was told there'd be no math.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two thousand two hundred bucks.  No, no, if they have 20,000 bots and you're going for 10 cents, it would be two thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Two thousand dollars. Not doing the math, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Math is hard.  So the point being they put so then they bought it and then they showed it.  They did a documentary. They showed it.  And then they made a little mistake.  They they they sent a notice.  They put a change the screen saver of everybody who was on the botnet to say,  Hello, this is the BBC.  You know, your computer has been taken over by bad guys.  We suggest you clean it.  And they're going to get they're being sued already.  They're getting big trouble because they used the botnet.  They used it to change somebody's computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're crazy. Stupid thing to do.  That's got to have something to do with like the Samaritan Clause of law  that if you're trying to do the right.  No, no, no. In fact, we're trying to do it.  It happened before trying to get people to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a Samaritan clause?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think when you're trying to give someone you can't get sued.  Right. Yeah. Yeah.  You're not liable if you break their rib. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, whether that has that's interesting, that might be.  We've got to get Denise Howell on this.  That might that might have that might get them off the hook.  Maybe in Britain, nothing Britain Britain's different.  Britain's different in many, many ways.  There are no Samaritans.  There are more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are. There are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a it's a fascist state.  Let's face it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, I'm playing Dvorak before he can even get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Communists isn't fascist.  Let's not confuse it to.  It doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It had as much forethought on my side as it did on his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Becky doing the best she can.  So here's another story that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, my favorite thing about you is that you seem misogynistic,  but you're actually he's a pussycat even remotely.  He's a pussycat.  I don't know why you even think that it's just your tone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is it about my tone?  So my wife, your wife on the air, my wife listened to the No Agenda show.  Yeah, once that was her mistake.  One time she says, I'm rude.  She says, you know, now I understand that you're rude with everybody,  not just with the family.  I think what do you mean? I'm rude.  I don't know why.  I don't why is it pain in the ass?  Not rude, though. I don't get I'm not getting this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They always have to be telling the truth and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I guess I'm rude. I'm just constantly rude.  You're not rude.  So here we go. The open cloud movement.  I want to talk about this.  You must have some thoughts on the cloud.  I know you love the cloud stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't know about the cloud manifest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What just came out of some manifest?  It's a group that's demanding open cloud west of the Mississippi.  Yes. Open cloud, meaning it has to be followed.  Any cloud in any has to be open.  Any cloud initiative has to follow these rules and guidelines.  And Microsoft, of course, is like just blowing its top over.  You know, who's leading this is IBM.  So it's IBM is probably behind most of this.  It's not they've been waiting to give the needle to Microsoft for decades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  IBM, I don't know if this is a rumor or it's going to happen.  Of course, they've been rumored that they're going to buy Sun,  which would make a lot of sense if they are going to be supporting cloud computing.  What open cloud means is not Microsoft or if Microsoft does it, we have to.  Yeah, it's clearly anti Microsoft.  According to the IBM,  Ruben Cohen, who's the founder and chief technologist for E-Nomaly,  a Toronto based startup and one of the manifesto authors.  The cloud open cloud manifesto is basically a pledge to develop standards  that would make it possible to easily what you want this move applications from  cloud to cloud.  So if you're on Google Docs, there should be some standards to say,  I can go use Zoho without having to copy and paste or something  so that you're not tied to this single provider.  I think that's right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this purely software based or are we talking about hardware requirements?  What do you mean? How do you be software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The whole point of the open cloud is I'm sitting here with my browser  and I'm using software on a server.  And the problem is, and this is the same problem you have with all of these things.  You know, you sign up for, you know, Twitter and you want to use Jaiku  and there's no portability.  There needs to be portability when you.  I've always thought this when you put stuff on a cloud.  If we're going to happen.  Well, yeah, see, completely against every economic interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I don't like the cloud.  I don't. And the other thing is I don't like about the cloud is the fact that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  can. You don't like it because it's closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's one thing.  And being closed, that means if I'm, for example, a Google user  and using Google Docs and I've got my Google account, I'm doing all this  Googling and all of a sudden somebody at Google takes a dislike to me  and just cuts off my account.  You're screwed.  What am I going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, in fact, Google is not a signatory to this, nor is Microsoft,  nor is Amazon, which is the biggest cloud provider.  One person who reviewed I'm quoting from an article in the Wall Street Journal,  one person who reviewed the manifesto and declined to participate, they won't say  who said that companies weren't given an opportunity to edit the document,  just say yes or no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess my only question is at what how prohibitive is this?  Because if you think of some, eventually, if this goes down to the level  where it's mom and pops trying to create their own.  I got a cloud. Yeah.  You basically have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I just it was there.  I just like a softball coming over and I just couldn't pull the trigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, you get off of my cloud.  No, I got a bunch of servers and I got an IRC.  This is a cloud, the IRC.  I got the Twitter army. That's a cloud application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Alameda recycling who has like 500 computers.  Have you seen this guy right off of 80?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is he doing? He's got a cluster in an old recycling bin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he's trying to create a supercomputer in his own mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Alameda supercomputer is on mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a supercomputer in my mind.  But my point is, don't look at me like that.  Would you like some more wine?  I need some more water, actually.  Water and wine for Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dvorak. Talk about the Google AdSense kicking people off and stealing their money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a funny article.  I found that on Hacker News.  I don't know. I don't know how, you know, basically thinking of us.  It's a pretty funny.  It says you're out of here.  It's from slash seven dot com slash seven is Amy Hoy.  Her title is Google is evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Worse than PayPal.  Don't use Google. Check out for your business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess they had.  I guess that's the way she sounds.  Well, look at the description of her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look at her and you tell me.  She sounds like a hillbilly who's living in Austria.  That's just weird. Google is evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's wearing a little straw cowboy hat.  So that softens her a little bit.  She lives in Vienna, Austria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's more like Google is evil.  Worse than PayPal.  Do not use Google. Check out for your business.  So she's dying to do his terminated.  Going into a Schwarzenegger with your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he's from Austria. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So that's the only Austrian I know.  So apparently she had a merchant account that was closed.  They won't tell her why they kept 2000 over dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Big deal. Oh, I'm sorry.  Two hundred dollars. That's still too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's more interesting was this story about the guy.  What's his name? Oh, Scriptaculous, which lost two thousand dollars to AdSense  and took him to small claims court in Santa Clara.  What happened? He won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course. Nobody goes.  Nobody follows up on small claims court is one of the most underutilized  resources in the United States. Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Under seven thousand dollars, I think is the limit.  Is that right? Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Different places. Yeah, changes from place to place.  But the point is that you can the other party usually never shows up  and the judgment is always against them and you can then attack them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're Google sent a paralegal because you can't actually send a lawyer  to small claims court. Right.  And the paralegal basically just read the EULA and it was.  This is the EULA. They lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the judge said, screw EULA.  And that was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the thing about small claims court is all they can do is force them to pay  the money. They can't actually offer a judgment that changes or offers any type of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so if you've if you've been taken for less than seven grand, go, go, go.  And you're not allowed to bring a lawyer.  You just do it. You have to do it yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you go in there, you go beg for the, you know, you just beg a logical argument.  And they ask the other. Is it like on TV kind of?  It's like Judge Judy. Exactly.  Yeah. And they have the people screaming at him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what? That would be a great web show.  Is people wronged on the Internet?  And we have Judge Leo and Judge Devorah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll do that. I've got the desk.  I have a wig somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I wear a wig? That wig you wear on Fridays.  I want to wear the wig.  Like a flame wore adjudicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, good. We could sit him right there.  Well, this is made for doing that.  It's so. Oh, that's a great idea.  It could be a big show for you or for you, Becky.  If you want to come here, you could sit on the ball.  You can do it. You can't be mean enough.  Judge Becky. Shut up, Devorah.  See, you'd be good at this. I can't be mean enough.  I feel bad now. Yeah, see, she feels bad.  Shut up. I can't do it.  No, John, I think you're the one who has to do this.  I could totally do it.  So you are full of it.  Get out of my sight.  Go ahead. Let's hear it. How would John see Devorah?  What would be the flame wore?  We got to come up with a flame wore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'd go like, what, are you kidding me?  You have your nerve even coming in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think this is it.  You paid him in sim dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I think we've come up with it.  It's great.  A great discovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, you know, in the motherhood, an ABC show,  just to be completely only talking about ABC shows,  from a web series.  That was the original genesis of that.  Now Primetime Show was a web series.  I never heard of this show.  It's just launched.  It's one of those just launching after sweeps.  And it has like Megan Mullally and some other funny chicky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not the, yeah, yeah, I saw it.  It's, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like, I think it's a dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It may not live, but I think it's interesting  that it's the genesis on the lid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just sounds like a bad idea for a show.  So you just, the stream.  I'm watching some TV.  Did you watch the Streamies last night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Streamies?  What?  The Streamy Awards.  Come on now.  This is the big award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything has to have an E thing in it.  The big award show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Streamies is the big award show.  Although I have to say, if you go to Streamy.  Did you win?  No, I didn't.  You're Mr. Stream.  Well, the kind of the irony of it is  none of the shows were streamed.  They were all like Tiki Bar or Dr. Horrible.  They were all downloaded.  So it was mislamed.  They didn't want to call it the downloadies.  But look, if you go to the website right now,  Streamies.org, you get AT&T broadcast operations.  You get, what do you get?  What is that?  They're putting a color card up.  Have you guys ever, what is that?  It's the stream is down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tom Merritt was there and he was tweeting from there.  It was sort of, they need Molly was basically his,  which I don't know what that meant.  Have you guys ever done any  LA based web video productions?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Web based video productions.  What does that mean?  I don't even know what that means.  She's gonna explain it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's San Francisco people  trying to make web video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, like Dr. Tiki, like you.  Seen that?  No, no, no, I'm not doing shows.  Revision three.  Revision three.  You're doing a show right now.  But we don't, but it's streaming.  It's only streaming.  Yeah.  We're gonna do downloads actually.  That's next.  This is the video.  Yeah, yeah, this is it.  The video associated with the show.  Then there's New York stuff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  which is a little bit more newsy, flashy.  Slicker, New Yorky.  New Yorky.  We're talking about rocket boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  LA is more like Ask a Ninja  or Dr. Horrible's musical blog,  which is kind of more celebrity oriented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, so let's look at it from purely cost  of production value.  Look at this room.  The cost was like the bottle of wine.  Okay?  It's not that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The bottle of wine, by the way,  is probably about 250 bucks.  Really?  Was it that expensive?  No, no, not when it was,  now you'd have to pay that.  I mean, when it came out,  it was probably about $4.  It should have sold it,  I could have made some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not too late.  Then you go to New York  and people are using existing studios  and they're creating web productions.  It's moderately priced because talent's expensive  and they might bring in a producer.  Then you go down to LA.  Web productions, 50 grand.  It's expensive?  Really?  50 grand.  Is it really?  I worked on a web production,  early days of Yahoo, 70 grand.  Forget it.  It was criminal.  Forget it.  I mean, so that's where,  and they think it's fascinating,  this Dr. Horrible's musical blog.  They think it's just the greatest thing ever.  I don't even know what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what you're talking about.  I never heard of this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dr. Horrible's?  It's the, Michael Patrick Harris, what's his name?  Yeah, Neil Patrick Harris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Felicity was in it.  Felicia, what's her name?  Felicia McGowan.  What is it?  I'm sorry, Felicia Day.  I love Felicia.  I'm sorry, Felicia Day.  Do you watch this?  Do you watch this?  Yeah, it's very good.  I haven't seen it.  Doogie Howser's in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doogie Howser was done during,  Well, that's cost money right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was done during the writer's strike,  so they had all this extra capacity to use  of all these people.  And it still cost 70 grand during the writer's strike?  It cost 70 grand?  It was well done.  I'm sure it cost more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm guessing it cost more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's my point.  It's never gonna pay out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now you don't do it to pay out.  They don't do it to pay out.  They do it.  They do it just to squander some poor investor's money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is the only reason I can think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Proof of concept, we're on the cutting edge.  We have the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We want it streaming.  Being on the cutting edge  does not entail spending that much money.  So this just in.  Being on the cutting edge is doing the whole thing  for 500 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And my point is that's a marathon that you can win,  not a sprint you're gonna lose.  Wait a minute, I have to figure that out.  I don't know what she said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That involves math.  She just does this.  That involves math.  That's a, I can't figure that out.  I had too much Leoville button.  So this just in, Mark Cuban has been fined $25,000  by the NBA for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Criticizing raps via Twitter.  For Twittering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, the first Twitter fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And is, the first Twitter fine and he just Twittered,  can't say no one makes money from Twitter now,  the NBA does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The guy's a genius.  That is a brilliant question.  He has monetized Twitter.  Thank you.  He has monetized Twitter for the NBA.  Good work, Mark. He's a genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How much in fines has he paid in the past already?  I mean, he's paid a ton.  Oh yeah, he loves paying fines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He can afford it.  He doesn't care.  He loves paying fines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was the stunt he did with the Dairy Queen thing?  Was it pay out of a fine?  Do you remember that?  No.  He said something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To a Dairy Queen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a long, it's a long ways back,  but I remember he offended someone.  He ended up having to work at a Dairy Queen for the day  in lieu of paying a fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, Judge Dvorak would have come up with that.  Oh yeah.  You're gonna work at a Dairy Queen, buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're gonna work at a Dairy Queen  for the next 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, this is the title of the show.  What is it?  Judge Dvorak.  Judge Dvorak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  Then to get the reaction would be, I'll judge him.  He sucks.  He sucks at it.  I never met the man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He sucks.  Video game play may improve eyesight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't believe this.  I think it doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Study says this is in the Nature Neuroscience.  I mean, Nature Neuroscience is a very high end journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My eyesight has been improving  since I got away from the monitor.  Oh, you have to have amblyopia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you have amblyopia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's another one.  What is wrong with me today?  Do you have amblyopia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a lazy eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I thought that was something else.  They said nambloopia.  Namblyopia is another thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I can see it improving that.  And?  If you gotta exercise, you know.  You gotta like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And for people who have trouble seeing  while driving at night.  Oh, really?  Researchers study two groups playing video games  50 hours during a nine week course.  That's not that much.  That's an hour a day less.  One group played action games like Call of Duty 2  and Unreal Tournament 2004.  Another group played non action games like Sims 2,  which doesn't require precise,  visually guided aiming actions.  People who played the action game  shown improvements in contrast sensitivity  from 43 to 58%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And no measurable improvement  to people who are playing the Sims.  But they slept better.  No, that doesn't sound.  I think carrot juice does the trick.  You know where that came from, by the way?  With carrot juice?  It's a common misconception that carrots  in any way improve your eyesight.  It was a propaganda, misleading propaganda  distributed by the British government.  I'm not buying this.  So here's what happened.  In World War II, the Enigma machine was cracked  by Bletchley Park, Alan Turing.  And they knew where bombers would come in and so forth.  They invented, oh no, I'm sorry.  It wasn't the Enigma machine, it was radar.  They had invented radar.  They didn't want the Germans to know that radar existed.  But this was during the Battle of Britain.  Bombers were sent from Germany  and were intercepted every time.  And the Germans couldn't figure out  how are they figuring out  where our bombers are coming from.  So the British planted newspaper stories saying,  this is, I sound like Adam Curry, don't I?  They've planted newspaper stories saying,  it's because we eat a lot of carrots,  we can see really, really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Misinformation.  Although their carrots are all boiled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's no carotene left.  But that's apparently where the common misapprehension  that carrots can in any way help your eyesight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let me give you my anecdotal evidence.  For one thing I don't say is the carrots,  it's the carrot juice,  which a big giant quart of carrot juice  or a half gallon of carrot juice  will have about 50 carrots in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, Jack LaLanne.  So I had to do,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to work for the air pollution control district.  And we had a thing called,  you had to read Ringelman.  In other words. Ringelman.  Ringelman is the density of smoke  coming off of a smoke stack.  And you had to be able to. Wow.  You had to be able to identify within one.  They had air pollution when you were young?  Exactly, back, you used coal, yes.  And we had to stoke it a lot.  Anyway, so you have to be able to identify Ringelman  in kind of a blind test within a half of a Ringelman.  But once a year they make you do it at night.  So you have to look at smoke coming off of a smoke stack at night.  That doesn't sound easy.  That isn't.  So you look because you can't see anything.  Hey, wait a minute. It's dark.  There's no Ringelman. They don't see nothing.  It's dark out.  So I flunked.  And so I went and had like,  I must have drunk two gallons of carrot juice.  And the next day I went out to do the same test  because they had to come back.  I swear to God, I could see through the smoke stack.  It was noticeable.  Really?  Noticable.  I had no trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That proves it to me. I'm satisfied.  This is one of those random Dvorak testimonials  that just scares me.  I believe every word he said there.  You can take it or leave it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just telling people out there who want to see,  you know, who have night vision issues,  to just drink a big, huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me ask you a question.  Did the carrot juice replace, say, something in a wine glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wasn't that you were drinking less of anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was drinking carrot juice on top of everything else.  It wasn't like I substituted it.  You weren't any less drunk, is what you're saying.  Drunk? You can't go read Ringelman when you're drunk.  It's impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't read Ringelman when you're drunk.  What, are you insane?  Get out of my court.  Judge Judy knows that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He comes up with these ideas.  I'm telling you, you hit on a great show.  Oh my God, it's going to be so good.  It'd be brilliant.  Judge Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's a producer.  She can like put the thing together.  She is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's the queen of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're in the courtroom right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's do an audible ad just in case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a real question for you about audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell me your question.  I can answer any question about audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have not used audible for quite some time.  So you did use it at one time.  When I had an iPod that was about the size of a shoe box  and I downloaded some audible books onto it from my mother  and she had a problem with it.  And I'm wondering if they've reconciled it.  And I thought maybe you could talk a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about the tech.  Anything like that.  It looked a lot like that.  That's the original iPod, five gigabytes.  What a clunker.  It is massive.  Can you believe how big that is?  Look at the fire.  And the big fire wire poured on it.  They don't even put that on their home.  They're in computers anymore.  It's too big.  I know it's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the problem was bookmarking  and going back to bookmarks and moving around.  Works great now.  Tell me about it.  Cause I have not been on audible  on an 83 player and iPod since then.  So tell me about the audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Audible's audio format is essentially MP3  but it has a wrapper around it.  And they're very, they really,  I asked him about this.  He said, we really believe this wrapper is critical  because you have to be able to get back  to the where you were, where you left off.  It has to bookmark it automatically.  Now they don't do any,  you don't need to bookmark anymore.  It just remembers where you left off.  Oh man, we have a lot of commercials to do.  We can do it.  Just do them all at once.  Yeah.  Can we rewind this show for half an hour?  So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we have one really good story to get to too.  Oh good.  Very excited about it.  Oh good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually have several stories left.  Computer security stuff.  Well, I've been waiting for John Markoff  to call from the New York Times.  I don't think he's going to call, so we'll get to it.  We'll get to it.  He wrote the story in the New York Times yesterday  is what we're going to talk about.  They wrap it around with a wrapper that's really great.  Now you can, they've just added a new enhanced format  that is CD quality audio.  It's incredible.  I think it's 128 kilobits,  but around it, they wrap a wrapper  and this works on any device you use,  even if you use, for instance, a lot of people,  I was surprised to hear like the number three device  that people use is a GPS, like a TomTom or a Magellan  that can play back audio files.  If they support audible,  you'll get that bookmarking automatically.  Works very well.  It's transparent.  So you always go back to where you left off.  That's what you're asking is, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's not a problem.  Not a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In the beginning of days, I remember it was really tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no, it works great.  Oh no, it works really well.  You don't even, it's kind of so transparent,  you don't even think about it.  So I do want people to try it audible.com.  In fact, you can tell your mom this audible.com slash twit two.  That's the website.  If you go there, that's where you could sign up  for not a gold account.  That's twit.  Twit two is the platinum account.  Now that's, I think most people are gonna want that.  That's two books a month.  And when you do this,  you're gonna get the first two books free,  first two credits free.  So you basically get two books.  Some books are more than one credit,  but most books are one credit.  And there is a huge selection.  51,000 titles.  John Updike just passed away.  They've got a great selection of John Updike titles.  If you wanna go back and read what many consider  one of the greatest, well,  formerly living American novelists.  I guess you can't say that anymore.  Run, rabbit, run.  Run.  Rabbit remembered, rabbit at rest,  rabbit is rich, they're all on there.  They specialize, in fact,  there's a John Updike audio collection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does that angst speak to this generation?  No.  Okay, just checking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I loved it though.  Doesn't speak to me at all.  It is, it's Madman, it's from that era.  You don't have those problems.  No, isn't that interesting?  I just downloaded a 40 hour book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Cryptonomicon's great though.  Highly recommend that.  Yeah, highly recommend that.  No, I just downloaded something called Shantaram,  which is 40 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm feeling your enlightenment from here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is one, two, three, four, five files,  each eight hours and 30 minutes long.  They divide it up so that you don't have  too much of a giant file you could put  if you have a smaller device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now that your commute's like 12 minutes,  when do you listen to this?  It's pretty hard to listen, I know, I hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Audible.com slash twit two,  I still have the platinum count,  I still listen to two books a month  and I just love it.  You know, that whole story from The Carrots  came from a book that I've been reading  called Electric Universe,  highly recommend Electric Universe.  It is this story of electricity,  the history of electricity and absolutely fascinating.  I've mentioned it before, but another great pick.  There's a lot to choose from, that's the point.  Audible.com slash twit two,  go over there, give it a try, sign up today.  We know you're gonna love it  and we thank Audible so much for their support  of this week in tech.  And actually, they're a great supporter  of podcasting in general.  They advertise on many, many podcasts.  They might be the number one podcast advertiser now.  They deserve your support.  Iwas, that'd be a good one.  Iwas, celebrate Was' victory, his survival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's underrated  the podcasting advertisement opportunity.  I don't think these guys take advantage of it.  Well, Audible does, Audible gets it.  They're like one of the few.  It's like in radio, I think,  has always been an underrated vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is better even because-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because you can stop.  No, I mean, you can stop and listen to it commercial twice.  I mean, I-  Great save, Devorak, Judge Devorak.  I listen on the radio and I go,  oh, what was that again?  What was that?  I wanna hear that number again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't go back.  No, I think people are being more engaged  in podcast listening.  It's so hard to listen to a podcast.  You gotta make the effort to listen to it  and I think it works very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the fact that podcasting revenue is undervalued  has to do with the fact that it's for people who drive  and commuters.  I agree with you.  And the middle of the bell curve.  I agree with you.  The middle of the bell curve gets no love  and that just doesn't seem right to me  because we buy a lot of dish soap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We had, wait a minute, I gotta show you.  We had an advertiser.  I'm gonna give this to you.  You got a one-year-old.  Two.  I got two one-year-olds.  I'd give you two if I had them.  Here, have some of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it diaper rash cream, please?  Oh, booty goo.  It's called booty goo.  You know what?  I got a wicked case of this going on at my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're gonna like this.  This is the best smell it.  Go ahead, just smell it.  Wow, booty goo.  The way that you smell this, it's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When we get a case of diaper rash in our house,  it's like Ebola hits.  No, you're gonna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ooh.  Yeah, they were an advertiser.  Booty goo.  It's a pharmacist in, I think, Louisville.  And he makes this thing up.  And it's got Egyptian camp,  it's got some amazing stuff in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We use Boudreaux's butt paste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, this is better.  Booty goo is better than Boudreaux.  I think there's something in the South.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let me ask you a question.  They must have more problems with this  because of the humidity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, why do you have that stuff behind the desk though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo gets a wicked case of chafe in between shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You sit on a ball all day long.  I didn't know, look at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know why?  Because Leo has something called MPAL.  What's that?  It's a terrible something that we diagnosed years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She was the first to discover that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's called male pattern ass loss.  And it's like, it falls off a shelf.  No, you're sticking it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't, I've been working out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think your ball shows that you've got some glutes now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been working out, baby.  I got, because she's so.  Working out on the ball.  She so humiliated me with my MPAL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your MPAL was bad.  It used to be bad.  It happens to guys when they stop.  It's like concave.  When they're desk dudes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It goes concave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It comes right off the end of your spine and it goes.  Boom, there's nothing there.  But I've.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I've been doing the,  oh, I've been doing the lifts and the.  Your MPAL is better.  MPAL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I gotta get that coin.  I'm so embarrassed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is this great story you were gonna tell us about?  Have we paid off?  I really wanted to sit here talking about Leo's butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Leo, you found this story and sent it to me  and I just found it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  New York Times, John Markoff, our friend John Markoff,  who someday will be on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Two separate research papers done.  One from Cambridge University and the other from a college  in Toronto, Trinity University.  And these researchers were given access to the OHHDL offices,  the office of his holiness, the Dalai Lama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, that was a fake Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh.  I had to bring Twitter in.  And the point being is that these pro-Tibetan groups  felt that the Chinese government had compromised  their email and was intercepting email  and confidential and top secret documents.  And what they had some impetus where a diplomat was called,  told not to participate in a meeting  with pro-Tibetan groups.  And the only way he, that the Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They had transcripts of his phone calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And also a woman who was working for this group  was stopped at a border and they had transcripts  of her emails.  That's it, yeah.  And the point being is that they found actual malware  on the computers in the Dalai Lama's offices.  And not just any OHHM malware.  This would be China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not just any OHHM malware.  It could turn on the camera.  Yeah.  It could turn on the audio.  They had complete control of the system.  But here's the thing.  They said, well, and then we looked a little farther  and this is everywhere.  They found 1,395 computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They figured to get it to work here.  You might as well check it over here.  You probably have it on yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mostly Southeast Asia and Asia, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, embassies, NGOs.  That's their sphere of influence, yeah.  You don't think, and of course the CIA, the NSA,  we don't do anything like that.  No, I'm sure this is happening in widespread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I wanted to get Markoff on  because he's done a lot of reporting on this.  He says that analysts say the Russians are doing it,  the US is doing it and China's doing it.  Those are the big three.  We're all engaged in this cyber spying basically, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Reading the white paper,  I think the interesting thing here is that  the reason it's coming to light is that  the Dalai Lama's group has a policy of openness  and they are making this known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Most governments wouldn't say anything.  Would never say anything.  We've been compromised, let's shut down.  Most NGOs, most corporations.  It would be shareholder issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It would be a donor issue.  It would be an embarrassment.  And so the only reason this is coming to light  is because it's their policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just think it's fascinating  because they're calling it whaling, not phishing.  Big targets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a term called spear phishing,  which was kind of the same thing  where it was targeted phishing.  This is a whaling because it's aimed at the biggest, right?  Not just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not a new term, that's an older term?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, spear phishing is an older term.  I'd never heard whaling before.  Me neither.  But spear phishing, same idea.  So let's send an email targeted  instead of the kind of mass email  that a phishing email would go after millions of people  that targeted saying something like,  His Holiness the Dalai Lama wanted you  to see these pictures of Anna Kornikova.  And that way, you would open it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this is where they even reference Mitnick in here  because the way that they initially infected a monk  was the initial target.  They've actually done the forensics and gone back.  And what they did is they participated in a message board  and then found a monk who had the right email address,  sent him a document that was logical  based on the conversations he was participating in,  embedded in PDFs and Word files, was this root kit.  And then they went, and as the documents were transferred,  once they infected that computer,  They spread.  They intercepted docs he was actually sending to people.  And would resend.  And embed in the attachments and resend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The point being, if you are willing to be targeted enough,  you can absolutely do this.  It's very hard to fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, do we know what the software is?  And is it this, say the Dalai Lama was using a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would have been less vulnerable.  Or, let's take it to the next level,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what if he was on a Linux box running Ubuntu 8.1?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think if they're targeting you,  then they can target a, we know the Mac  is completely attackable because of this recent  Pwn to Own contest where a guy wins the MacBook Air  for $10,000 with one click of the mouse,  because he knew of a Safari exploit  that was previously unpublished,  that he was able to take advantage of.  So there are holes in it.  It's hubris.  Well, I don't think it's completely hubris.  There are fewer holes, but there are holes.  There are lots of them.  And there's lots of holes in Linux too,  if you know where to look.  And you know, the main point is you need to know  which distribution they're running.  You need to know more about the target  than you would know to spread it wide.  They already had the Intel.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what, they know by then,  well, what computer does the Dalai Lama run?  And so they can write something that's very specific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about running a little VMware program  that rotates you through various operating systems.  There you go.  That's a good idea.  And you never use the same one in the same day,  you know, and you just keep jumping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These guys go into great detail about how to  Very interesting story.  Be defensive.  What do they say?  And to advise NGOs and such.  And they've said basically, it's all social engineering.  Right.  And that at a certain point, you know your vulnerabilities  from a technical perspective,  and you can only do what you can afford to do defensively  from a technical perspective.  Right.  But the one place where you have an opportunity  to make a big difference is teaching people  about the social aspects of this kind of hacking.  And I think that's a really good point,  especially corporations who are trying  to please their customers, trying to give them information.  It's the whole Mitnick thing all over again,  but actually put into practice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very interesting.  We shall see, no?  We shall see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other thing that's interesting is what's the recourse?  We need Judge Dvorak on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm gonna ask Judge Dvorak in a second about a Japanese game  that some are saying we should ban.  It's a rape simulator.  Oh boy.  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those crazy Japanese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But see, this really puts it on, you know,  do we, okay, how bad does it have to be before we ban it?  Is free speech protected for everything?  Even the most rep...  Anyway, this is for Article and Slate.  We're gonna talk about that in just a second.  And a whole lot more, but first I want to tell you  about my friends at Carbonite.  This is actually probably an apropos time  to talk about Carbonite.  Carbonite is online backup for Mac now, as well as Windows.  And it's important, and we all know it's important to backup,  but the thing about backup is backing it up  to an external hard drive right next to your computer  is useless.  You gotta back it up somewhere offsite.  Back it up.  Get it back, beep beep, back it up.  You gotta, you know, Steve Gibson sends CDs to his mom.  That's one way, get it offsite.  I like Carbonite, I use Carbonite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?  I can't play these CDs.  Why does he keep sending them to me?  There's no music on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not even in the car.  What are you doing?  I threw them all out.  I didn't think there was anything on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  13% of hard drives crash in their first year.  43% of people lose files they consider irreplaceable  every year.  This is the one that gets me.  10,000 laptops a week are reported lost or stolen  in US airports alone.  Ouch.  10,000 left on the belt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where's those TSA guys?  Aren't they helping us here?  eBay.  Oh, yeah, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This could get some great deals on laptops  from that TSA site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I bet you can.  TSEbay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, only about 3% of them are ever recovered.  So this is the time to backup.  Here's what you do with Carbonite.  I used to just call mine.  You call your laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and then when it rings and I know where it is,  I can go get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, duh, Best Buy shouldn't be running out  to stock the shelves,  but isn't this another free market issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course you can get it online.

Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pirated online.  Google it, you can find a fully functioning  English language version of the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know I'm being casual,  but I think you draw the line when it's child porn.  I think that's pretty awful.  But this is horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, okay, so we can drop that topic  since she brought child pornography.  What about the 14-year-old girl  who got busted for sexting?  This is old school.  Yes, she got thrown out of school, right?  No, no, the latest thing she was arrested.  She was arrested by the cops.  So what did she sext?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A naked picture of herself.  It wasn't, I don't think it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so it's child porn because she's a child.  But it's her own picture.  This has been going on for the last six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because she texted, she said a naked-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's a threat to society and a pornographer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, Judge Judy, you're late to the game.  So here's the deal.  The DAs are drawing charges on a lot of these cases  because they wanna make an example  and they're trying to teach the kids  not to do the sexting.  The most recent development-  Yeah, but this is kind of a strong example.  But what are you gonna do?  You gotta teach the kids not to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She wasn't naked, by the way.  She was in her underwear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think she was in the bra even, I think.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A group of parents has just come back  and sued, counter-sued the DA, saying this is too extreme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That came, no, that was stage two of the story.  Stage three is when she just got arrested  by the cops like a couple days ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, this is all the same story?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.  This guy in Pennsylvania.  Oh.  Or Jersey, one of the two.  I got the story here somewhere, let me look it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This just goes back to my thing about,  it started with shoe mirrors.  And then it was people photocopying their asses  on the Xerox machine. Did anybody ever really

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  do a shoe mirror or is that just a-  Oh, a shoe mirror. Apocryphal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a technology that's being used  in an inappropriate manner. It's apocryphal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the guy throws all the pennies on the stage.  Yeah, yeah, pick it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then it gets old, like the Xerox thing.  Who's Xerox is their ass anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've learned.  Assjet 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We had to get a whole new Xerox machine.  Those things are not cheap.  Speaking of hamsters, hamsters get nanotechnology now  but we could be waiting for 10 years.  Story in Wired magazine.  A nano wire attached to the back of a hamster  hooked up to a oscilloscope.  The rodent scurried around.  It generated 70 millivolts.  When it stopped to lick itself, the power levels decreased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where are you getting this story?  Wired magazine!  And the point being-  So we can power the universe with rats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can have these nano wires, these zinc oxide nano wires  which when you bend or shake them or stretch them,  generate power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is all part of the smart grid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, more like you could use this for devices.  In a human being, you could put a device in.  Self-powered devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It would have to be some low voltage device,  let me tell ya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could be your cell phone, be a little charger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The best part of this article is there's a graph  that shows how much power generated  by running versus scratching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whatever happened to those power generators  that we're gonna be in subway stations  and take the footprints of people  who are coming off the trains and translate that power.  Really, somebody was gonna do that?  Yeah, I heard that.  There have been all these sorts of-  Some of these crackpot ideas.  We're gonna take kinetic energy  and turn it into real energy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or wearing corduroy or, you know.  I mean-  Why do you have a ukulele?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really good.  Why don't I have a harmonica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Since my baby left me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh-huh.  In fact, a little known fact,  Elvis actually originally did the song with a ukulele.  Absolutely.  He's from Hawaii.  He got some.  He flew to Hawaii.  Got some advice and went to a guitar.  I was learning free ride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's tough.  Yeah, it's hard.  Wow.  It's not the fingering, it's the picking, I find.  Don't you find?  The fingering's not so bad,  but the picking, because you, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, stairway to heaven, hit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, she's, what is she, listen,  she's playing something beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to just start with the fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at that though, see what she's doing, the picking.  See, that's what I found hard.  Okay.  See, you can learn the chords or the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just have to practice more, Leo.  I think so.  She obviously spent some time doing this.  Did you learn that in school?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Fifth grade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what you should have said,  I just picked it up, I've never played it before.  Never seen this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Learn what, what is that?  That's the smallest guitar I ever saw.  What do you do with that?  You only got four strings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's really cute, my dad is here in studio  and I have my uke at home and you can see he took his pen  and he wrote my name in it when I went to fifth grade class  so nobody would steal it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Did they have, because you grew up in Hawaii  and you went to school in Hawaii, did they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Willie, that's right, Willie Nelson has his name  on his guitar.

Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lucille, his guitar, I held his guitar, it's quite worn,  remember that?  Oh, it's amazing.  It's quite worn, I don't, you know, I felt,  and I asked him to hold it and then I realized after the fact  that was kind of probably intimate.  Yeah, you don't ask to hold somebody's guitar  but he was very kind, he let me, he's probably high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you didn't just grab it.  No, I didn't just grab it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Give me that thing.  I said, may I hold Lucille?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First concert I ever went to, Willie Nelson concert.  It's funny, B.B. King's guitar is named Lucille.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not Lucille, what is it?  What is the name of his guitar?  Willie, he says it right on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My mom had to put me in the car halfway through the concert  because I was getting a contact high and I was only seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did go see him that night after he came to visit us  in Honeysuckle Rose 2, the bus,  and it was very smoky in that show.  I can understand why your mom was concerned.  It was extremely, okay, so Microsoft says,  there's one very simple reason  you shouldn't buy a Macintosh.  No.  Just 500 bucks.  Just one?  They're boiling it down to cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.  Bomber goes off the end.  That's astonishing they'd come up with this.  Well, wait a minute though.  How did that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you think they might sell Windows on  better functionality?  I mean, there's a lot of you.  To choose cost seems like, almost like you're giving up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not almost like you're giving up.  No, I think they're.  It's giving up.  It's giving up.  What are they gonna say about Linux?  You guys are delusional.  Why don't they say that about Linux?  You live in a bubble where real people

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  with real incomes, you don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The worst part, to quiet her for a second,  the worst part is the argument plays against them  when it comes to Linux.  Which is even cheaper.  Yes, which is even cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's a good point.  So they're crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're crazy to make this assertion.  Oh my God, you guys are delusional.  Can I play this ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to play this ad.  Why, what are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because the average person can't manage a Linux box.  The average person can't afford a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no, the new Linux, Ubuntu, anyone can run.  I'm telling you, you could even, even you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I've got something in my hand.  I can reach right across to it, Judy.  But that's a very valuable instrument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what they did is they actually offered people money.  They said, this was kind of mean.  They said, if you can find,  what are you looking for in a laptop?  If you can find a laptop for under a thousand bucks  that has everything you want, we'll buy it for you.  And so they went out and they, here's the ad.  This is Laura.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She told us she wanted a laptop with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speed, comfortable keyboard, and a 17 inch screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For under a thousand dollars.  We told her, you find it, you keep it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here we go guys.  Now we're on a mission.  We're looking at the Mac store.  Okay. For a thousand dollars.  They only have one computer available  and that's a 13 inch screen.  I would have to double my budget, which isn't feasible.  We're just not cool enough to be a Mac person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There it is right there.  I'm just not cool enough to be a Mac person.  That's Microsoft's selling point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that's a counter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love these guys.  They can't come up with anything.  I'm just not cool enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Wow.  250 gigabyte hard drive, four gigabytes of memory.  Getting good work done here guys.  This is like a phone.  16.4 inch screen.  What's over there?  We have the HP over here.  We have that one.  They both have the 17 inch display.  But the look of that one is drawing me.  Oh, okay.  This one has all of my qualifications.  I'm gonna buy this computer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's cheap.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Congrats Lauren.  It's a PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you plan on paying?  Cash.  I got everything for under a thousand dollars.  I'm PC and I got just what I wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure you did.  So what, you buy a d*** too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know what I'm gonna do with this show.  This show is the rudest show we have ever aired.  Really?  I don't know what to do.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's you Becky.  Is it really?  Yeah, you caused the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well why'd you serve the wine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it was the wine.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Can I have some more by the way?  Did we finish it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  You know, your staff is getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm never gonna get ass back.  This is the first good marketing strategy  that Microsoft has taken on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think it's right on.  You think focusing on price is exactly what Microsoft.  Only this economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're gonna make the mistake of thinking  this is generally a good strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you know that nine out of 10 computers sold  on Amazon in the last six months have been netbooks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well that's true.  Netbooks are huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that goes to show.  That's a very good point.  They're cheap.  Sumer is all about thrift right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just a slurp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Apple is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll just have a little slurp there John.  That was a bar tiff.  All right, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You said that it was mean.  What about the 300.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Talking to the microphone dear.  It's much better if you talk to the microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know the way I see it.  It is.  I was at the show the other day.  Oh sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not a microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello mom.  So anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so here's my point.  I think actually John makes an excellent point  that they're gonna have a problem with Linux.  But my point is I don't think people are so price conscious  that the sole reason they would buy a computer  is because it's cheaper.  Is that the sole reason you buy a car?  Because it's cheaper?  Nobody's buying cars.  Well that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well there's an answer to do a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good.  So you think in this economy  all people care about is how cheap it is.  And you realize that's a stupid thing to do  if you're buying a computer.  I think it's a major consideration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's all they're selling.  At no point did they say it's more powerful.  It's got more.  There's a lot of things you could sell Windows with.  We've got more programs to choose from.  It's got churros.  There's a lot you could do.  But all they said was you can't,  I'm not cool enough to own a Mac.  There's basically, it's not even price they're selling.  They're saying something about,  there's something, it's class warfare.  It's classism.  That's classism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's really well put.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even listening to Rush Limbaugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Listen people, let me tell you something about class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that the tech industry as a whole  is gonna suffer more from this economic downturn  as we recover than most other industries.  Because we have benefited from the fact  that people think technology is cool.  They think it's a must have item.  But when the dollars hit the fan,  they're gonna realize, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First thing they drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Seven megapixel, 10 megapixel camera.  What do I care?  I'm gonna use the old one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or you could say conversely  that the entire tech bubble has been fueled  by cheap credit, this kind of phony credit.  And that people were buying all this crap  and now they're gonna stop and they'll never come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I mean that goes all the way down.  They always come back.  I wrote a column this last Friday in Market Watch  discussing the Best Buy numbers  because Best Buy seems to be some sort of a leading.  Are they surviving?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Interesting.  and I think this proves out,  is that the tech scene is the first to suffer in a downturn  and the last to recover.  Because it takes people a little while  to like get their feet wet again.  But they pull out immediately.  And then they stop buying stuff they don't need.  Junk.  Because it is junk.  It's shiny junk.  Most of it's junk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cell phone numbers, big for them  because what I've seen is smartphone sales pretty good.  And that that would be a place where.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well Best Buy's not making, I mean they're losing.  Less.  I mean their growth has gone way down  and it's gonna continue to go down throughout 2010  according to the analysts.  Don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a margin on DTV converter boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, not so high.  By the way, I use my converter box all the time.  Is it working?  The little.  Which one did you get?  I got the channel master.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Channel master?  Yeah.  The channel master 9000 or the 4000?  7000, isn't it?  The 7000?  Or the 9000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just teasing you, I don't know.  What is your antenna?  Because I installed one for someone in Richmond  and I powered one and it gets terrible reception  and it's not that far from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't even put a special antenna up.  I just used a little stub of the antenna that I had.  I just pushed it down so it gets to be a small antenna  because you're talking about you and Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Welcome back to the analog TV show with Becky and John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Many of us are out there installing these boxes  for our friends, our grandparents.  I've been doing a fair amount of.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got a lot of older people in your life with analog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And people who can't afford cable and satellite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to, just try, first start off with a bow tie.  The old fashioned UHF.  I did, it was horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then I had to go to Howard and it's still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get a Yagi.  Well, if you want to go outside with it,  get a UHF fringe antenna, they're only about 25 bucks  and you can get Sacramento from the Bay Area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I ain't going to buy anybody's roof for free.  I'll help, but I ain't getting them on a roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You seem like the kind of a roofie girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No roofies, no roofies allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just because I have man hands to boy.  Oh boy.  Cut more wood than you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So anyway, I just think this is a mistake for Microsoft  to go this down this route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cut more wood than me?  What do you do cutting wood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's good exercise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Are you, do you really, is that what you do out in the back?  It's a great exercise.  Do you like have logs brought in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I go down and there's a place where PG&E  drops their logs down in town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you burn these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I give them away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you give away the creosote soaked PG&E thing  so you can put it in your friends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you don't want to burn those  because they'll ruin your fireplace.  Oh, you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not the actual, what you call it.  It's not railroad ties.  It's trees that they cut to clean out the lines.  Okay.  But it's great exercise.  I do it purely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you do this instead of the gym, you go and chop wood?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really good exercise.  Do you play rugby anymore?  I quit when I had the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the two knee replacements.  And the nose job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I ain't messing that up.  I broke my nose three times in one year  and had to get it fixed when I was little.  It's a good looking nose though.  Thanks.  It's a nice nose.  I didn't just get it fixed.  I got fixed.  I'm not stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very slim down the middle  and it's got a nice flare at the bottom.  She didn't overdo it.  No, it looks normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I busted in my cheekbone for a while.  And then remember when we came back on the air,  I was talking to camera from the side.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just thought you were a little stiff.  I didn't realize it was a bad injury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, she was showing off the photos to everybody.  Don't you remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I must have blanked that out.  She used to have, look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, I'm a wreck.  Take a look at this.  And you go, oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's actually an interesting strategy  for Microsoft to reach out to the part of the population  that's been disenfranchised by the hoity toity  black turtleneck wearing Mac users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the same agency I'm gonna point out  that put Bill Gates and Jerry Seinfeld  in a normal person's house  to find out how normal people lived.  I mean, this agency I think is all over the map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently they've learned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or they're just terrible.  Who is it?  They're terrible.  They did something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had a history of some pretty creative advertisements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the I'm a PC thing is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I like the I'm a PC thing.  I don't like it at all.  I think that strikes the right note,  which is to say normal people, not class,  but just normal people who use PCs.  Apple thinks that, oh, the hip people use,  this is kind of along the same lines.  The hip people use PCs.  But actually a lot of people in a lot of areas,  including hip and not, are using PCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When's the last time we saw an I'm a Mac, I'm a PC ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they're still doing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't seen one for months on end.  No, you're right, I haven't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nothing, I don't know.  You know who did the I'm a PC thing is Rob Enderle.  He submitted I'm a PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was on a TV show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, he just submitted that,  you know, like all these people would just submit  and they'd run it in Times Square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The guy who will do anything.  Anything to get on camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shameless.  I was for a while recording people saying I'm a twit.  I was gonna do a whole I'm a twit campaign.  And then Shira Lazar is doing I'm a geek.  You know, remember the Molsens ad where I'm a Canadian.  She's got a great script.  In fact, maybe I'll get you guys to do something from it.  It's a really cute script.  And she's getting geeks all over the place to say.  They say I'm a geek?  Well, there's a whole script.  It's really good. I'm a geek.  That's it? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You need a script for that?  Saying, you know, like hashtag is not a graffiti.  You know, you say.  Skateboarding is not a crime.  Right, kind of the whole thing.  You kind of go along with it.  What do you think?  Did you ever see that Molsens ad?  You never saw the Molsens ad or you'd know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I never have actually.  What I'm talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a great ad.  I am a Canadian.  Should I play that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really, this show is that below the line, Leo?  I don't think so.  Yeah, it's gotten bad.  I apologize for my participation in that.  I know exactly where I've lost it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not gonna say a thing.  We're just gonna keep on going.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Don't be silly.  I'm having a.  I've redeemed myself with the ukulele.  You did, that was wonderful.  That was beautiful.  Another story I thought was, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was thinking, you know,  one of the stories is kind of slowly breaking,  is that I guess Sprint WiMAX is working here and there,  the ClearWire.  Really?  Well, they got it in Portland  and they announced 10 more cities, none in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's all second cities.  It's weird, like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Portland, well, Seattle's gonna be one of them  and there's Dallas and Fort Worth.  But anyway, the point is, is that I, I, I, I Twittered.  I said it.  I Twittered a bunch of people and to start,  just, I just gened my audience and asked anybody in Portland,  send me some reports and they, they're,  I'm getting reports back into the,  apparently it's a very good coverage.  You get six or seven.  This is 4G essentially, right?  Well, WiMAX. Six or seven megabits?  WiMAX. It's a little different.  And, cause it's not going through the phone company.  And so, you know, so yeah, he's getting six and seven  megabits and it's, and it says it's cheaper than the AT&T,  DSL and all the rest of the services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're not gonna do it for phones.  They're doing it for home users or laptops.  They're doing it for laptops.  Like EVDO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think a lot of it has to do,  I think there's a fixed wireless receiver that you can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're saying by year end, Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago.  That's a big city.  Dallas, Fort Worth.  They kind of get two for one on that one.  Honolulu. Did I say that right?  Honolulu. Nice, you did the Honolulu.  Honolulu? Honolulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not Hanna-lu-lu. Hanna-lu-lu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Honolulu. Honolulu.  Las Vegas.  Philadelphia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now what, are you a Puerto Rican?  Or Cuban? Is this the Cuban?  Portland and Seattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next year, Boston, Houston, New York, San Francisco,  and Washington, D.C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Emeryville has some sort of WiMAX reach out right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there's a couple of WiMAX systems actually in the Bay Area,  but they're commercial and they're extremely expensive.  So, do we like WiMAX?  We're excited about WiMAX? Is it going to be great?  As a backup.  I mean, I don't like the idea of having, I've got the one service.  I'm using Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I like EVDO and I actually carry that little USB thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't do that because I think it's too expensive.  It's very expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you don't have the, you have a big, the cap is five gigs.  It's easy to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got boom, you hit that.  Yeah, you hit that very quickly.  But I'd like to have some backup system other than the nothing I've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is again, the Dvorak bubble.  The average person just wants to have wireless.  That's as fast as DSL.  Yes. And they don't have to have a router that they have to manage  as well as a cable modem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you mean they want it in the house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They want it in the house and out of the house everywhere.  And they don't want to have to manage another box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's a huge market.  I think people don't know they want it.  But but once they get it, they will be paying lots for it,  which is just high speed internet everywhere.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is Dvorak crying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You didn't make him cry.  You didn't make him cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think you're missing the point.  Everybody wants, no matter what you think,  everybody wants to have a home network running 10 gigabit.  And and then they want to just pump their their internet connection  into that home network and just have availability every place else.  But if they're floating around in their car, they would love to have mobile.  Anything. Yeah, they just want to have internet.  Whatever it goes on. I disagree that ubiquitous internet is the key.  But you do also need networking.  You have to have networking within the house because you got somebody  in the back room or you got some kids and they wanted a copy of something  or that you want to move some files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you think you need a file storage file sharing that kind of thing?  A network storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You might need a printer network, but I think that the dream is that  you don't have to manage anything when it comes to the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that you're going to end up with.  In my opinion, you're going to end up with lost stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's how it is.  My right. It's all we got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't pay any attention to the fact that you need to back up.  Ladies and gentlemen, back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think you have another commercial to get to, but I'll get to it in a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you know why, Max, by the way, is my understanding is that it's based  on the same microwave technology that they used to do all these live shots  for local TV. It's just microwave.  Yeah. And it has about the same radius was my understanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's very line of sight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When when Intel was originally testing it, remember, they did it at up  in Park City at Sundance four years ago.  And that's basically how they did their whole demo with straight microwave.  And it's the same technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Yeah, I think it's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll go do my homework.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a real it's a real problem because it's very line of sight.  If it is microwave, I mean, that, you know, that's.  Yeah, no, the way Max is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's penetrating and it's all over the place.  I mean, the reason that Sprint took out their broadband connect  in the Bay Area was because they were going to put in something better  that was going to be not line of sight, because I used to use the Sprint  broadband connect for my Internet connection.  And I got just a little less than a megabit per second.  But it was because my I have an antenna, you know, they gave me a dish  outside the house that was aimed right at Mount Sutro, where they had the,  I guess all the transmitters and you had to hit that thing.  If you couldn't eyeball it, you couldn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you believe Dell forgot to buy a demo dot com before they released the laptop?  No, you're kidding. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This whole Adama thing is so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, there's an example of saying  that's the exact opposite of what Microsoft's ad was, which is,  oh, you can buy a Mac from us.  It's just called Adama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Molly, Molly, but at best, she said, this screams out,  I'm going to go take my bonus and buy the Dell Adama.  I mean, she just hit it right on the head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, yeah, ouch.  Yeah, they forgot to buy a demo dot com and and just back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the MacBook Air competitor from Dell.  That's 2000, 2000 starts at 2000.  It's beautiful. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll be very interested to see  if there's a market for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It just doesn't feel like the right timing.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So according to Lauren, the woman we just saw,  she didn't actually really go into the Apple  store. They didn't let us shoot there.  Scandal, scandal.  They're no joke.  I'm sure they did.  Nine to five Mac, which is an Apple rumor site, said that if you notice  there's a bald guy with a jacket and striped shirt walking by,  he's still walking by when she leaves the store.  He walks by again.  Maybe he's going back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's the back and forth guy in front of all Apple stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She is.  Well, it turns out she's a professional actress.  Oh, scandal.  That's never happened before in a commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, well. Well, there's there's I mean, it's an ad.  It's an ad. It's an ad.  Yeah, but they lied.  Hey, total sidebar.  The research in motion.  Blackberry App Store. Yeah.  This week. Have you tried it?  Oh, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's just another me, too.  It's like the Adama.  Everybody wants to do the Apple store.  But the problem is you've been able to buy a Blackberry applications on Handango  and a lot of other sites for a long time.  I don't know if this changes the landscape at all.  And it isn't it's never going to be as seamless as the Apple store.  I mean, I think it's the real problem.  I mean, I love the bold and the what is the eighty nine hundred is very nice.  But it ain't an iPhone.  Are you what do you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm an iPhone, but I was I was a late convert because I didn't want to leave  Verizon. Yeah, that's a problem.  And I mean, you still a 71.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, or did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I actually I have the 71 normally.  What do you have today?  I got it. Yeah.  But but but three days.  I said Nokia, beautiful Nokia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like something you put lipstick on with.  Turn it around. It's this compact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? There is it.  Isn't it doesn't somebody advertise that you can use your phone as a mirror?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, the pre has that.  The pre is so chick focused, you would not believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think the tree is aimed at chicks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Number one, it has the hockey puck.  So you just don't have any wires.  You put the down on the hockey puck and it charges.  That's a static.  Hate wires. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chicks hate wires.  You should look under my desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know there's no chicks here.  And they never been under there.  And so secondly, there's the issue of the mirror.  The mirror. There's a mirror.  Is there a mirror in the back?  Yes, that is for women.  Slide the pre down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that a market? Is that is there a market?  I mean, that's that's that's kind of there's they know from research  that women want a mirror phone so they can look at themselves in the mirror  when they do their lipstick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What the research is number three, it works with fingernails.  The iPhone does not.  It needs an electrostatic charge.  You're right. It only works with your finger.  So if you are a claw chick, you can't use the iPhone properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're a claw chick, you can't use the iPhone.  He tries to get used to this.  I don't know.  Oh, well, you can't tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what this is great, but the pre is very chick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, I was going to say half the other time I'm using a G phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You like the G phone? Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of a clunky phone, but I like some of its features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are we talking about?  The G one. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you what do you like about it?  I like this. You love it.  I like the barcode. I like the keyboard.  I like the glowing. It's sluggish.  Yeah, well, that can be fixed.  It is sluggish. It's sluggish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's bad hardware.  I know I'm not complaining about Android.  I think Android might actually have a future,  but the hardware is too slow for Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's from T1.  If you're a T1 person, this kicks the sidekicks.  But T1, I mean, from T-Mobile, sorry.  So if you're T-Mobile person and I always look at phones, I get that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, the process, Android process has stopped responding.  I don't have this. I get this all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Android process has stopped responding.  You want to wait or cancel.  I didn't even do anything. I opened the phone and closed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's something wrong with your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's nothing wrong with it. It's just a piece of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What else I love about that phone is the UPC scanner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is cool.  There's like four different applications because you can take pictures of barcodes  and then say, where can I get this cheaper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I take that thing shopping.  Do you really use that? They must hate you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you ever been thrown out of store doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I've never seen it.  I haven't done it enough for it to actually be an issue.  But my point about T-Mobile is that most people think about phones  based on what's available within their carry.  Yes, absolutely. People don't want to shift.  The iPhone has changed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, one third of iPhone buyers are new to AT&T.  The iPhone is the first phone people have actually changed for carriers,  which is a brilliant move for AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, you got a confirmation for the meeting tonight with Bambi Love.  I've been waiting for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This this OK, see, I like there's some things I like about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Francisco, that's a real person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know you could slide this down, right?  I know it doesn't work.  You're supposed to be able to slide this notification thing down.  Yeah. Well, how many times did I stroke it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what we've all been asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had a stroke in four times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I cannot believe this.  Oh, on a Sunday, no less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You find innuendo in everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that the G1 is going to evolve.  And the bottom line is I can't wait for there to be competition for the iPhone.  That's serious. And I think it's the only one that's.  Talking about the iPhone,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  talking about Dell and their anomalous thing, don't forget, they made this  a few days ago.  Michael Dell comes out and says that Dell is going to kill the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, great. With their phone.  Yeah, that's good.  That's a classic.  Well, I'm glad he feels strong.  You know, he really he believes in his company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It seems like they're throwing everything at the wall right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's trouble. They're troubled.  They're a little bit troubled, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, who knows? Maybe it's time to go big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And maybe Verizon Wireless has confirmed that it's ready to enter the netbook  market for Verizon. What are you looking for, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I noticed that my power thing is out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you better plug that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a whole point here that you don't have to have an add in video card.  I mean, I don't get what their point is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're wanting exactly.  It's a netbook that will be sold with 3G built in  instead of having that card or the card sticks out a little bit.  I guess if you really like the idea of a really light notebook.  Remember, the AT&T sells these notebooks for 99 bucks at RadioShack,  but you have to sign up for two years service.  It's the same model as the as the cell phone economics.  We, you know, we give you a subsidized notebook,  but you're going to we're going to get you for two years.  I think it's an interesting.  Who does support?  Ah, that's a good question.  If it's Verizon, you're in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, their customer service is OK.  But I'm just curious if they're going to build out a whole tech support wing  to help you with this or if they're going to default to whomever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's from Acer. It's going to be made by Acer.  So I presume they could go to Acer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that sounds like one of those. It makes sense, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, in a way, a netbook costs less than a handset does.  I mean, you know, there are three or four hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's less radios in them. That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you got Bluetooth, you got Wi-Fi.  And if you have three G, the only thing you're missing is the phone.  The GPS. Oh, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no GPS. So Sony, you know, they have this.  It has GPS built into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The P the P 90.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Their netbook that they they won't call it a netbook.  The one they announced at CES, the wide one, the weird wide one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like a purse. Yeah.  It's red and it's bad. It's not good.  Ninety nine. Yeah, no, it's not a netbook.  It's just a piece of junk. Wow.  It's way overpriced.  That is aimed at that some yacht market, the AIG executive market.  That's another chick product.  But playing on. But it's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't work. Just buy something that's pretty and candy apple red.  That bugs me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently, I have to go long enough on this show so that we can  eliminate all the profanity and still have a 15 or 20 minute show left.  So let's keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was references. It's her fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All the innuendo.  We just have to go long enough to eliminate the innuendo and still have a show.  She's on network.  I'm taking that's why.  That's why she's doing this, because she can't bottled water sexes up snails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, who comes up with this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is Leo throwing a dart at like Google News.  That's exactly what I'm doing at this point.  All right. OK, explain the story.  And then let's move on to something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A German study of commercially available bottled water in German.  Come on. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But say they're found contamination by chemicals that mimic natural sex  hormones when the researchers race snails in the water.  They're bred with extreme rapidity of warning signs that chemicals for active.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So shocker bottled water has stuff in it other than water.  Yeah. Drugs. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but the the xenohormone  that they find in this stuff actually has been shown to reduced virility in boys  and early onset of puberty in girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Discovery did.  That's why we have all the sexting that explains it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What they should do is sue the bottles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Discovery did a documentary about this 12 years ago showing that there was a  it's bad stuff, just a proliferation of confused gender frogs  as a result of water being contaminated.  Is that true? Really?  They did the they did the doc and said that we're going to have a bunch of hermaphrodites.  And, well, just just look around you.  A multigender society that has its gender.  So blame it on the water out of tolerance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the water bottled water in particular.  It's the water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you guys think about this bill granting nonprofit status to newspapers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the newspapers are going for the bailout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think this is genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, this genius.  But can they still operate even?  I mean, look at for profit.  The San Francisco Chronicle is losing a million dollars a week.  Will making the nonprofit save them?  I can't see. I don't see how.  How much is their tax? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've already got a loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're losing. Yeah, they're already a nonprofit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you make money?  Because maybe the issue is if they change their status, they can seek donations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Donations without being a nonprofit.  That's what I do.  But you're not a see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't. But I pay my taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think the people who are donating to you don't get a tax write off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they don't.  And we don't.  You know, actually, my accountant said you really shouldn't call it a donation  in case people think they're going to get a write off.  So now I say, you know, just money for the booze and women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's amazing that you've made this work.  It's just my invisible hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not anymore. This is going to be the show.  This is going to be the show that ends the network.  It'll it'll just be all over.  You it'll be. I'm blaming you, Worley.  I'm blaming you, Worley.  It all was going great until we brought Worley on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man. You've been putting it off for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have been.  And now I know why, because she's just a dirty girl.  She's a dirty little girl.  I'm here with my father.  I adore it. I adore Beckley.  And I'm I put it off because she was busy being a mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice, even though you think she's a misogynist.  But in fact, she's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You reverse the compliment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's a cis-modulus. Oh.  So now that I know she's a lumberjack, I'm going to have her back more.  She's a homogenous.  I got some wood in the back if you know, I shouldn't have said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here we go again.  You know, in the back, how did you accomplish that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Almost anything can be interpreted wrongly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to talk about the.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to talk about the game developers conference  just a little bit went on and actually a very interesting announcement  from Steve Perlman, the guy who created QuickTime and Web TV.  He's got a new product that could change everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is your new sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could be. This is really interesting.  On live, I think this is very interesting.  But first, I want to talk about GoToMeeting, and then we'll get onto that.  GoToMeeting from the folks at Citrix.  We love Citrix.  They do those great remote access things, you know, that go to meeting,  go to go to my go to assist and go to my PC.  Go to meeting is so that you don't have to have these meetings in person anymore.  No more travel.  You just you just you go to go to meeting dot com.  Download it right now.  It's free for the next 30 days.  You go to meeting dot com slash twit.  Set it up on your computer and then and by the way, Mac or PC.  And then, you know, next time you're on the phone with somebody  and and you're going crazy because you're trying to do a conference call  and they're either falling asleep, they're not paying attention.  Maybe they're just not getting what you're saying because it's just not very visual.  And you're saying, well, it would look like this and they can't they can't visualize.  You say, look, I'm sorry.  What was I thinking? Go to go to meeting dot com.  Here's the meeting ID. Nine numbers.  Suddenly, within a minute, they're seeing what's on your desktops.  They're seeing your computer screen.  They're seeing the PowerPoint or the keynote presentation.  They're seeing the web pages, the drawings.  You can work together. You can collaborate.  We just did a go to meet a great go to meeting to plan our new audio system in here.  And it was amazing.  I mean, I could see pictures that we could do drawings.  And it's in real time. I mean, it's really there.  It's it's just phenomenal.  Go to go to meeting dot com slash to it.  I got you. I've got you've got to try this.  It is free for 30 days when you use Twitter.  And and by the way, very affordable if you decide to keep using it.  The one low monthly rate for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want,  really makes this useful.  You're in real estate. This would be great for you.  You could show houses. Incredible.  Online meetings made easy.  I'm sure some of your clients.  I'm talking to Becky's dad.  He's real estate in Hawaii.  Some of your clients are in the continental U.S.  They want to see the house.  They want to see the drawings. They want to see the plans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You go and you throw me and they're there, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got them. Go to meeting dot com slash tweet.  Give it a try today. You're going to love it.  And I thank them so much for their support.  For the show, John, I forgot we got to do these commercials a little bit longer,  give you a little more time to get up those stairs.  Are you OK now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I made it. I was kind of winded, but I think I'll be OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's some chocolate and cheese.  Did you get some chocolate? I need some water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a claw tooth claw foot bathtub up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that great?  This is an old bed and breakfast.  Before that, it was next door is a lumber magnet.  Built this beautiful  house at the turn of the century.  He was a hardwood guy.  And of course, that's where we have all this wood paneling.  And he built this for his daughter.  He had two daughters when they got married.  He built this cottage and there's a duplicate cottage a few about a mile away  and for his daughters. And it's a beautiful little cottage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you said Twit Cottage, I thought that was a euphemism for strip mall.  No, no, no, no. Like right off the one on one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why would I live so far away from the center of the universe?  San Francisco, the Silicon Valley, and try to do a technology show,  unless it was the greatest place in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's really why I'm afraid to tell any story now because it's going to have  double on time.  Wood in the back.  Last time that I was up in Petaluma was when we had  the call for help slumber party with lemon drops and hot tubbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Knob Creek, I think was the Knob Creek that did you and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the Knob Creek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So and I came downstairs the next morning.  A few of you, I guess, didn't rightly so didn't want to drive home  because it had been a big party and you were a little, you know,  happy. And so so we provided sleeping bags, we cleared out the living room.  And imagine my surprise when I came downstairs,  I stumbled over a sleeping bag with Becky Worley and there's somebody else in it, too.  How did you how did you get both of yous in that thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Both of yous.  You're the one that brought it up. You're asking for trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that was a fun party, wasn't it?  It was such a great party.  Discretion in this environment.  Foolhardy. That sounds like a throw quote to express.  Expect discretion.  In this environment would be foolhardy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think if I wanted to really do it right, I would say it's folly. Folly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. So we have anything else on our. On live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what do you think Stephen Perlman, who is really has a pretty good track record,  he created Web TV, sold it for four hundred some million to Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or they just languished where they killed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Worked on that project.  They were trying to turn Moesha into a click and buy TV show.  Really? So that you could click on Moesha's top and say,  that's a Jay Z penny for twelve dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, see, I think that's brilliant. What happened?  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Things have been. It was way before its time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the thing.  I mean, it could still be it could be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're trying to do that right now with that.  Alex. Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our friend Alex Lindsey says he does, you know, he really thinks people like REI  should be making Web TV shows, you know, camping with Joe  that are completely clickable.  Hey, I like that tent.  You click on it, you buy it. Right.  And it's content. It's called a catalog.  But it's a catalog. It's a catalog and it's content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the whole point.  Like we're just at the state where it's like the Peterman catalog,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  where they have a long lecture about the guy, right?  The jungle. And he found this.  I love that catalog. Advertorial. Pearlman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he's created a thing that if it works, we'll actually, I think,  revolutionize not only the game industry, but cloud computing in general.  This is really cloud computing. It's called on live.  The idea is that you can use cheap, old, crappy hardware  or even a small device attached to like the size of an iPhone attached  to your TV and play high end, very challenging video games like Crisis,  Far Cry on these devices, because all the work is done  not locally on your local computer, but done on the server.  They now, of course, the first thing you think is, well, OK, that makes sense.  But how are you going to get this to happen in real time  for a first person shooter? You got to  render the stuff out there on the server.  Somehow this high definition video has got to come down to my screen.  I shoot somebody. It's got to go back up. It's got all happened.  They claim they've solved that.  They have partners that make me think they maybe have something there.  Electronic Arts, Atari, Eidos, some of the biggest gaming companies,  of course, obviously missing Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft,  because this completely kills their market.  It also, by the way, and I can see why Atari and EA are interested,  it eliminates software piracy.  But here's the interesting play.  They claim that they can do this with some interesting packet compression technology.  But I think the secret sauce they haven't mentioned is  the partners on this are going to be the Internet service providers  and companies like Comcast and Verizon who are going to sell gaming packages.  So buy our Internet access.  But if you buy our special gaming package, we'll prioritize this online content  and then include the $15 a month online subscription.  You could play any game you want. High end gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they're saying standard def, one point five meg downstream.  And 720p for five megs downstream.  So that's incentive there.  But what gamer isn't going to have the highest speed  already if they're playing online multiplayer games?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't think it is aimed at the high end gamer.  I mean, the high end gamer is going to probably still have the PC  or the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 3.  What it does is it and this is why, again, why the game companies are interested,  introduces a whole new casual gamer market.  You know, there's a lot of people who don't play Madden,  even though they love it, because they don't want to go out and get an Xbox.  They want to get the disc, you know, spend the money that maybe they won't like it.  But hey, if it's on your TV already,  or you could play it on your old Mac laptop, there's a market for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe. I think casual gaming to me screams out bejeweled in the Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it does. But it won't in the long run.  Look at the Wii. Don't knock the Wii.  You know, they've sold more balance boards than Sony sold PlayStation 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was I loved one of the things I read about that.  That there was a collective sucking in of breath and sympathy for Sony  when that was announced on the Nintendo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's so sad.  So the I went to the GDC and looked around and saw that stuff.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The last show I would expect you to go to.  You don't even go to CES and you go to the GDC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I happened to be having it's like the two block walk.  So I figured I'd stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're so random.  I would. I think GDC is interesting.  Well, it was packed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, the streets were so I've been to a lot of shows in San Francisco  now and again, and the streets were so packed  that it was I've never seen anything like it.  I mean, it was on.  Yeah, it was. We're talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this around Moscone?  Yeah, it was just packed.  Because even like Macworld, no, it was packed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The streets. But anyway, so I went inside and it was a place was pretty jumping  and they had all these different things going on.  I looked at that. I don't know.  I'm not buying into a lot of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like you think this.  Well, now what's the deal?  Do you think that they're overselling?  It's not going to be as cool or I think they could do it.  Would it be a strong? Would it be a big deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The games look good, actually, and they've got the little box  they had that you showed something similar to that.  And I don't know, just something about it.  I can't tell you what it is yet, but I have a negative attitude.  Oh, that's a surprise.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think here's the deal.  I mean, if you can do this, it's not just gaming.  It's everything.  A high end video editing or anything that's too challenging for your little box.  Now you can do over a server.  I think the ISPs jump on this is who jumps on this because Comcast.  Look, there's a Comcast is dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a there's a variable in here somewhere that I suspect  that's the variable going to be involved gouging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the variable.  I'll tell you why Comcast says crikey.  Well, they don't say crikey, but they say something like crikey.  What are we going to do?  Crikey, crikey, crikey, mate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are we going to do when people can get all the TV  they want free over the Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've already talked to these guys.  They hate this idea because they don't make enough money on bits.  They want to charge you for premium services.  Here's a great solution.  Oh, yeah, we'll give you Internet service and for 15 bucks more,  we'll give you the gold service that lets you play any game you want,  lets you do any kind of high end computing.  I think this is who's really behind.  You do this on a la carte basis, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, that's the thing that's a barrier to me is the perception.  No, no, no.  Pick it up on a monthly premium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there people pay a monthly premium now for HBO.  I mean, it'll be I'll tell you Businessweek is reporting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that the number one thing people are looking to cut in their tech bills  is their cable bill.  Really?  And they are slashing.  You know why?  You know why?  Biggest hits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hulu and BitTorrent.  People are starting to realize, I don't need to pay for,  you know, the United States of Terra.  I'll just BitTorrent.  I don't have to get Showtime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't buy into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't think that's too complicated for people?  Yeah. All right. Hulu then. Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And maybe they're going to get HBO on Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can get all of the HBO series a year later.  On DVD. People are happy to get it on DVD.  DVD is a good solution.  Yeah, I mean, that's where the BitTorrent thing is maybe one percent of the pie.  And we're talking about lots of other solutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's available on iTunes, too.  I mean, maybe that's kind of the middle.  That's not the easiest, but it's the middle of the road.  People can figure out how to buy Sopranos on iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, it's ESPN 360, if you ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Huh, how do I do this?  No, you know, I never underestimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see there's a little thing there?  Impress the buy button.  How much is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just love the bubble.  That's my favorite part about being on the show.  What is the bubble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just feel like that we're out of touch with the common man doing.  Oh, I know that. I mean, of course.  All right. We're not doing the show for the common man.  No, and I'm doing it for our agreed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But your assessment about technology and its future is a little bit bubble oriented.  Like, think about we're just ahead of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I agree. We're just ahead.  It's not that what we're saying is not going to happen.  It's just we're a little bit ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that she's become an idealist.  She works for the big boy.  She works for the man.  I do. ABC.  And so she's, you know, the seat reads those memos.  And the memos are obviously put together by the brain dead executives that run the TV station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like Adam Curry now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean, anyone knows what the suit is.  And the other guys who run these networks and they make the dream stuff of this crazy.  It's like this show that you were talking about earlier.  I mean, I think it's an obvious flop before it even shows up.  Let's face reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, not Judge Judy.  He's talking about the housewives, the mothers, the mothers of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's calling me judgmental.  But the fact of the matter is, I mean, and this is when.  So this is the perspective that you've you've adopted openly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they they want to be.  Which is essentially they want to be on the cutting edge.  But the point is, the economics speak for themselves.  I think Leo's point is the middle ground for both of us, which is the technology is cool.  Leo likes everything.  We're looking at the future of the gear.  But the economics of it are such that I think.  No, I think you're right.  It's delusional to think all this stuff isn't going to fall off the edge of a cliff.  It's like the 20 percent of all VC projects succeed.  I think that's economics, not technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a high number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The economics are bad right now.  We're in a bad situation.  We're going to be in a bad situation.  I just believe that technology kind of has its own momentum that transcends economics.  I hope so. I don't think I think people are not going to buy shiny crap anymore.  Good. That's fine.  I don't think that's what propels fundamental technological revolutions.  And there is a fundamental revolution going on in media that's going to happen regardless.  In fact, in some ways, the economy fosters it.  Look what's happening in newspapers.  That wouldn't have happened for another 10 years if it weren't for the bad economy.  The bad economy is hastening the fall of newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who made the great point about computer journalism that if you look back 12 years ago,  it was computer shopper and all the ZD pubs.  Look at that. Now it's this.  But look how much more.  So much more employment, so much more driving the economy.  And I hope that the cool factor of tech stays and that we don't lose that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it will. I think these trends are fundamental.  In fact, one of the reasons I know people hate when I talk about Twitter,  but one of the reasons I talk about Twitter is it's a communications trend that is very interesting.  I don't think I couldn't care less about Twitter, but the trend is very interesting of how people are communicating in real time.  They the email is too slow for people.  They want to text. I mean, it could be text messaging.  We could be talking about they want to text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Recently, PC magazine saying the death of email.  It is there's bunches of people I sent me.  They never answer. Oh, I didn't even know.  I don't answer. I can't email.  I'm overwhelmed. You have never emailed ever.  No, the guy gets like five thousand emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's gotten worse. It's gotten worse.  It's overwhelming.  But people want more.  I think what they want is more interactive, more real time.  You know, Kevin Rose told us last week he he's doing this three sentences thing.  If he can't answer an email in three sentences, he just doesn't.  It's got to be three sentences or nothing.  And that's inspired by Twitter.  That's inspired by the whole idea of the quick, short, real time interactivity started with instant messaging.  That wasn't quite enough.  People are now moving to something more global.  And that's what I'm seeing.  But those things, my point is, those things happen regardless of the economy.  In fact, in some ways, they may happen faster because of a bad economy than they would have happened.  Well, the newspaper death, for sure.  Yeah, there's a prime example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's been did you read that article about it was really interesting.  They were looking back at a conference 14 years ago where they had the guys at Time Warner looking at how they were going to monetize the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it was just these are the people you work for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, it's the same people.  They're not gone. They ain't gone.  Who runs ABC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Disney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Eiger is still in charge?  No, he's gone.  Is Bob Eiger still there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, is he?  I don't know.  No, Eiger.  No, you should know you work there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm the contributor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  David Weston is the guy who's the head of news.  Weston signs your check.  He is all about the new technologies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And because that's a very fashionable thing to say.  And the fact that's still fashionable.  I question whether they understand it or they have any commitment to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Disagree because advertising dollars, the advertisers are scared out of their minds that they're missing the boat on the audience and they are seeking those new.  They should be giving Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are. Guess where they're going.  But I'm rich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  More money.  I thought you had that app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm rich.  No, seriously, I expected fully in the bad economy that we would lose our advertising and we would be totally based on donations for a couple of years.  I had business plans.  I have business plans set who I would fire.  Who?  Who?  No one.  No one.  It doesn't matter.  Who?  But I totally was prepared for a complete slowdown and I thought how am I going to decelerate this?  This isn't the real one.  It's gone completely opposite.  Advertisers are fleeing the expensive mainstream media and coming to more targeted, cheaper, but more effective advertising.  Measurable.  Measurable too, yeah.  And that's really true.  We have more advertisers than ever before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I'm holding the line at three a show.  That's all.  Unless it's with booze.  We could sell five a show.  We could sell six a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any bets on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I'm holding the line at three a show.  I really think one per half hour is all I can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you have me and Calacanis, you could have five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We could do more, but I don't want to...  I think that's a couple of shields.  That's the value.  No, no, that's the value proposition is you're not in a cluttered environment.  That, you know, we charge more per, you know, our cost per thousand is higher than broadcast because it's not a cluttered environment.  I don't want to have 18 minutes of spots an hour.  That's what radio does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's always been...  No, radio is horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's useless.  I was trying to watch Dancing with the Stars.  I couldn't because they do a dance.  We'll be back five minutes of spots.  Now they give the votes.  We'll be back five minutes.  It was unwatchable.  I don't watch anything.  It's not DVR.  I know you have that technique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just didn't think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I started watching the ads.  I miss them.  Occasionally, I stop and watch the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've been chopping too much wood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, this is...  She is actually by law, by contract.  I have.  I have to pay the ABC.  But you know what it is?  She has to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I test these ads, so now I've stopped to watch them to see what I can test.  You know, now I watch the infomercials nonstop.  Speaking of which, the ShamWow guy got arrested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  Yeah, big news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  ShamWow.  ShamWow arrested.  For what?  What did he do?  Apparently, he just...  A prostitute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  It was a prostitute?  The Smoking Gun reports...  She tried to wipe her prostitute off with a ShamWow.  Didn't work out.  Tried to pay with ShamWow's.  Yurt...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Smoking Gun is reporting that Vince Offer, otherwise his real name is Offer Schlome,  was arrested in Florida for punching a prostitute.  They had negotiated a deal.  And somewhere in this situation, there was a bite and there was a punch.  And that's what the Smoking Gun is reporting.  Wow.  I know. I had to break the news at the end of the show.  I think he would have snapped her with a ShamWow.  ShamWow. That guy's an interesting...  He sued the Church of Scientology once.  He sued Anna Nicole Smith for reneging on a movie deal.  He did a movie that the New York Post calls, I think the quote is,  and I'm roughly recalling this,  the most sophomoric and adolescent movie ever made.  He's a very interesting character. Offer Schlome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I want to play the ShamWow ad now.  I'm very excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He and Vince Offer both were pitchmen at flea markets.  And Billy Mays is he says he's very discerning in the infomercial products  that he picks up.  And he's now got a show that's launching.  Only the big guys who pay the big money.  Yeah. He's got a show that's launching on Discovery called,  I believe it's called The Pitch Men.  And he goes through products with people and decides whether or not  it would be a good infomercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this mug shot. Oh.  Oh, on the smoking gun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, camera guy, you following me here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he looks like something bad happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, why? It's never good.  Wow.  But you wouldn't think that the lighting in the ShamWow commercial  would be so good that there was such a difference.  It looks like he's wearing a hospital jammies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is he wearing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He is wearing a hospital gown.  Maybe he got beat up by the girl.  That's what there was apparently some bad juju happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. That's not good when a prostitute  makes you really look bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you guys ever seen the Extends commercials?  No, what's that? It must be at East Coast.  You really are the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi, it's Vince with ShamWow.  You'll be saying wow every time you use this towel.  It's like a shammy.  Ow!  It's like a towel. It's like a sponge.  A regular towel doesn't work wet.  This works wet or dry.  This is for the house, the car, the bus.  The boat. The RV.  ShamWow holds 20 times its weight in liquid.  Look at this. It just does the work.  Why do you want to work twice as hard?  Doesn't drip. Doesn't make a mess.  You wring it out.  You wash it in the washing machine.  Made in Germany.  You know the Germans always make good stuff.  You can cut it in half.  Use one as a bath mat.  Bring your dishes with the other one.  Use one as a towel.  Olympic divers, they use it as a towel.  Look at that. Completely dry.  Put a wet sweater. Roll it up. It dries your sweaters.  Here's some cola.  Wine, coffee, cola, pet stains.  Not only is the damage going to be on top.  There's your mildew.  That is going to smell. See that?  The most of the time. We're going to do this in real time.  Look at this. Put it on the spill.  Turn it over. Without even putting any pressure.  50% of the cola right there.  You following me, camera guy?  The other 50%.  The color starts to come up.  No other towel is going to do that.  It acts like a vacuum.  And look at this.  Virtually drawing the bottom.  See what I'm telling you?  ShamWow, you'll be saying wow every time.

Transcript:  So here's what I don't get about the commercial.  I've always thought about this.  If the thing soaks up so much water,  why would you put it in the washing machine?  It's just going to soak up all the water.  Dry washing.  What happened?  My wash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, I did that thing with the pie pan  and soaking up 20 times water.  Towel does the same thing.  Really?  Terry cloth.  Space age technology.  Did you do that on ABC on Good Morning America?  I have like 12 packages of ShamWow.  I've been giving them away. I should have brought them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I could use one.  I'll bring them next time.  The boat, the RV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you contact the ShamWow?  Hi, it's Fitz with Slap Chomp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to be in a great mood all day  because you're going to be slapping your troubles away  with the Slap Chomp.  Now look, here's a potato.  One slap, you got big chunks for stews.  Two slaps, home fries in a second.  Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You add a mushroom.  I would buy anything he sells.  This is better than Billy Mays.  You're walking down the Jersey Shore

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and this guy's hawking something.  You got your wallet out before you can even turn a step.  This guy's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is actually what Malcolm Gladwell was saying  in Outliers, that if you have 10,000 hours of experience,  that's what it takes to become an expert.  These guys sold this crap for 20 years, day in, day out.  They got so good, they can't lose now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  CNBC says that ShamWow commercial  is the best infomercial ever  and that he is the best pitchman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.  The old days with Barry Becher  when he used to do those commercials for the Ginsu knife.  Those are good.  I thought he really set the,  I think even Becher was better than that  because the Ginsu knife came out when they,  they always had these spectacular,  like, you know, they cut into a fish, you know,  and smashing tomatoes.  No, no, it was, you could do all the cutting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and then you would have razor thin on the tomato.  The tomato was the ultimate test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But no, they always show an old,  if you didn't have this knife, you use a regular knife,  you push it down, the tomato just explodes.  I love the voiceover thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh no, have you ever had a situation  where you're trying to dry the dog  but the towel's sopping wet?  Oh no!  That's my favorite part.  I've made like a friend, this is my business now.  Infomercials have become my business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is a good angle for you, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's fine.  Hi, Billy Mays here for Mighty Putty.  The easy way to fix fill and seal virtually anything fast.  This is more for, this is early Billy Mays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He didn't really shout quite as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He warms up, wait till he gets to the part where he's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he gets shouting at the end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to the older commercials  where they used to use this, some sort of these,  I think they started off selling car wax or something.  Remember those?  Yeah.  And they'd throw a lighter fluid on a Bentley  and then light it up and then wax it down.  So I ran into one of the guys who leased his Bentley  to the infomercial company and he had to sue him  because apparently it ruined the paint  no matter what they showed you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.  Here we, flying spur polished with new, let's see.  Billy Mays has become such a cult that there are dub overs

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of, I mean just on YouTube, just tons and tons.  It's like Optimus Brick and Prime couldn't pull this apart.  So great.  And it is fun, I get a lot of the products,  I get to test them all.  There's some that I love.  That's a good gig.  There's some that I, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sweater balls?  No, not sweater balls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the sweater shaver?  The sweater hanger.  Remember that?  I used that.  I like.  I like the thing where it squeezes the air out.  Get me one of those.  Oh, those are good.  Oh, those are good.  But you hook up a vacuum cleaner, yeah.  That's really space bags.  But there's also, you just roll it  and then you push it in.  Yeah, space bags.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, space bags are the best.  That's the one with the vacuum cleaner.  I like the H2O mop, that's a good one.  The swivel sweeper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The H2O mop, does it use water?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Shocker.  They're not real, just sort of subtle in the advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The H2O mop uses water.  It's a steamer.  But it works, you say it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We all know how our floors get dirty.  The spills, the food, the dirt, the pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I went to Telebrands Incorporated  in Bergen County, New Jersey,  to speak with the folks who make a lot of these.  And they do pitch meetings where they look  at all the products that are available  and they try to determine what will make a good infomercial.  And when I was there that day,  they were really interested in the man groomer,  which is a shaver, an electric shaver on an elbow,  such that a guy can shave his own back hair.  And they thought that would be a great infomercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this another product out of Germany?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know the Germans, they make good stuff.  They got the hairy backs.  And they thought that could be.  And I'm actually working on my own,  which is Muffin Top Girdle.  And I own muffintopgirdle.com,  anyone who's a cyber squad out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, that's his style,  Muffin Top. It's too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Muffin Top Girdle, is it designed to give you a muffin top  or to secure the muffin top?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it locks it down and it smooths  as it transitions from your area to your genes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
