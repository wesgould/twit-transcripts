It's just she's so talented and it really warms my heart to  have someone send that to me. And I want to apologize for  my voice for the listeners, because as you said, I'm a Tiger  fan and I actually go to the games and I yell. So I'm going  to sound a little bit like Barry White. Actually, I will  try to soothe it with some whiskey. Oh, good thinking.

Transcript:  People don't know Ant is actually a tenor.  So I have to start. I'm sorry to say on a sad note, and I  think people are starting to just learn the news. One of our  longtime friends, a man who's been on Twitter 20 times, we  did two triangulations with him. The great science fiction  author Jerry Pornell passed away on Friday. Jerry went to  Atlanta, had a great time. His son Alex wrote on the Chaos  Manor blog that Jerry, you know, had a wonderful time at  DragonCon. He felt a little ill, maybe the flu or a cold, and  came home. And on Friday, he passed away quietly and without  pain. And so we're very sorry to lose Jerry Pornell, an  inspiration for my career with his Chaos Manor column and  Byte magazine. The first, as best we can tell, first guy ever  to write a novel on a computer. He wrote many great science  fiction novels, including some with Larry Niven that are  absolute classics like The Moten God's Eye and Lucifer's  Hammer. And I want to thank our team who jumped on this and  pulled some clips from Jerry's many appearances on our shows.  And we made a little kind of tribute reel to Jerry Pornell.  Our guest today is somebody that I have been a fan of,  literally for years, ever since his column and Byte magazine.  And he certainly influenced my career. Let's welcome Jerry  Pornell.

Transcript:  A lot of people couldn't figure out why in the world it was I  better known than anybody else in the computer business, except  maybe Devorah. I wrote the Field and Stream column. Me and  Joe went hunting. Well, me and old Zeke went computing. And  that was the great secret I never told anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great many, if not most, scientists were heavily influenced  by sci-fi and focused their research on areas that science  fiction inspired them to study, which is why in so many ways  modern scientific advances parallel what you guys are writing

Transcript:  about. When you get around to listening to The Moten God's  Eye, pay attention to the pocket computer. I wrote that  in 1972 and an iPhone does most of what it says in there.  But of course we had to set it a long way away because even  in 1972, nobody thought that I would live to see. Isn't it  amazing? Most of the people in this world accept fruits of  technology in about the same way as a kitten accepts milk when  you pour it into a bowl for it. There was a common phrase in  the robot industry. You never understand how smart a moron is  until you try to program a robot. It towards the end of the  Soviet Union and Pinovich, which was doing the handwriting  recognition software for Microsoft. She said my biggest  problem is I don't have enough technical handwriting. Then  I got my logbook out, you know, that's the technical handwriting  that was the standards and that engine has been in every  edition of a Microsoft handwriting recognition program  since 1990. How is your handwriting Jerry? Are you? It's  God awful. Okay, great. It's gonna be terrible. X projects are  this. Go out to some place like Edwards or some awful place  where nobody wants to be. Go out there and you tell them I  want you to build the best whatever it is you can build  with technology as of this afternoon. You build three copies  of it. We test one to the edge of it and we probably prang it.  With the second one we fly and cause we learned from the  first until we get all the information out of it. The third  one ends up in the Smithsonian. Yeah, Jerry's the wordy one.  Larry has told a perfectly good story. It would be publishable  now, but when I'm finished with it, it will be probably half  again, maybe twice as long and then he goes over it and find  some scene that would everybody will remember and they'll  forget that I ever had any part in it. What the hell? I've  always been an operation research guy, you know, I that's  a guy who knows less and less about more and more until he  knows nothing at all about everything. One last question.

They weren't going to  do it the day after Labor Day and I think maybe the Wall  Street Journal leaked it. So I bought my ticket and I rented  my car and I arranged a place to stay and then the invitations  came out and I didn't get one. Oh, so I spent like I spent  I don't know 12 hours first of all feeling horrible and  forgotten and unloved and then I started composing my mind  the story about trying to guess which Apple exec I had so  pissed off that they had dropped me off the list and then  I thought rather than do that. Why don't I just reach out to  my friend who's the head of PR and see if you know and I  wrote him I said, you know, maybe it was an oversight and  he said, yeah, maybe it was and he sent me an invite so I have

Renee Richie who was one of our hosts on Macbreak Weekly will  be there. I think a couple of people from the his publication  mymore.com will be there but it's you know, I think  increasingly Apple wants to save those seats for Apple staff

Start time: 762.90
End time: 783.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because they need a certain volume because there are these  applause lines. Exactly. And if it's just a room full of  journalists, they'll be silenced because you know, the  tradition is you're not you're not you're not there to cheer  lead you're there to type. Yeah. So so they need a certain  amount of them and then there's the Al Gore's of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't try this year and it must be stuck in the mail but I  I've been in years past and it's it's been it's it's just it's  a weird event and I have to say this might be a little  controversial but I have to say like even with the new  theater, which I think is really exciting and this revolving  door and all this stuff.  I feel like 10 years on it's like it's getting a little  tired. Maybe I don't know. See I would say that but people

Start time: 830.40
End time: 864.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  would say oh Leo that's just sour grapes. You've got your  nose pressed against the glass and you don't want it to be  inside interesting but I kind of agree with you when it was  Steve.  I mean, Steve was a master showman and I was always grateful  for the chance just to see him work in the same way.  Same way. I'd be grateful for a chance to see Frank Sinatra  sing. It's you're watching the best at work, right?  But Tim Cook's not exactly Mr. Inspiration Phil Schiller  Craig Federighi at EQ.  These are these are definitely second maybe Jimmy Ivy maybe

Start time: 865.18
End time: 891.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and also I think like you know this the other thing is that  the Steve note right like this is it's become a trope, right?  Right. And and I just think that that's I don't know.  I mean, I'm looking I'm going to watch obviously but you know,  I just 10 years on I'm looking for something exciting and  different and I I guess probably a lot of people are.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

End time: 940.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We will hold on a second.  We will stream it.  I just want to mention for people who do want to watch you  can watch of course Apple will stream it but you have to have  an Apple device to watch it.  Actually you have to watch it on Safari or an Apple device  or weirdly Microsoft Edge browser will work if you have  Windows 10.  Who do they pay for that?  I don't know.  It's I guess it has to do with the HLS stream but we will also  stream it.  You can watch it on any device our stream, but the only bad  thing about that is I Megan Moroney and Alex Lindsay will  be, you know, commenting behind it.  We're doing our Mystery Science Theater 3000 little silhouette  commenting on that.  That's always fun, but it's sometimes annoys people.  They go stop talking.  I want to hear what Tim has to say so you can watch Tim or  you can watch us.  I'll go ahead.  Phil.  I'm sorry.

End time: 972.04

Transcript:  There's no question that the quality fell down when after  Steve Jobs died, you know, Tim Cook is no Steve Jobs and we  could talk about that for quite a while.  And some of the guys feel like they're kind of phoning it in  Jimmy.  Ivan was a disaster as it turns out.  He was a very magnetic personality, but he wandered you  didn't know where it was going.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, what a terrible introduction of Apple music and then I  do think Federica Federici.  How do you pronounce it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Craig at least has also the gravitas.  He's in charge of iOS and software.  Where as you feel like a little bit Phil Schiller, the marketing  guy, Eddie Q the music guy and you know, they're really chills  and and even though obviously Steve Jobs is a product chill.  He just was so good at it.  You forgot that he was selling that he was marketing to you  use, you know, and that was the famous reality distortion  field that feels thing.

End time: 1043.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I look forward to these events and I'm not the biggest fan  of the Apple devices or anything like that, but their  presentations are probably the most polished that you'll see  out there, you know, even though I did have an issue with  Steve Jobs and the magical corn that he put on every single  was magic, you know, and I'm like, okay, you're pushing it  a little far.

Start time: 1066.62
End time: 1097.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Samsung was notoriously bad for a while.  Remember the Broadway show which was kind was like what am  I watching?  But the last Samsung event the no date event actually I  thought was pretty well done, but the star of that was not  the presenters who were awful, but the really interesting  stage they had a stage that was a screen and then side  screens and the graphics flowed to the point where it looked  like it was a little tiny person in a giant field or whatever.  I thought that was kind of neat.

Start time: 1097.82
End time: 1109.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was beautiful, you know, but I feel bad in those Samsung  events because it's almost like they're begging for applause  and the crowd there.  They're just like whatever that's why you have to do what

There is now another leak this coming from the iOS 11 source  code which apparently has a leaked out and Thomas Stoughton  British name has analyzed it and and interestingly it looks  like the name of the new iPhones will be not 7s, although  it really will be a 7s but iPhone 8, iPhone 8 plus and iPhone  10 for the 10th anniversary iPhone and the 10 being an X  which I think is wrong.  I'm gonna go I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that's  mistake.  That's not what they're gonna call it.  They don't even call Mac OS Mac OS 10 anymore.  It's just Mac OS.

Start time: 1172.10
End time: 1267.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Philip come on iPhone X a couple things for the you've  conflated two leaks.  There was one leak that came out for the airpod and then there  was the other leak that came out Thursday from Mac rumors and  nine to five Mac which which has really pissed Apple off.  Oh interesting to take a step back.  You know that the reason they put a lot of effort into these  releases the reason they're so slick is because they they the  jobs used to treat them like Broadway shows and he would  rehearse and rehearse and rehearse and everything is  scripted down to the last minute and the the the what they  count on the the drama of these things is the big reveal where  they show something and it's a surprise and they this the the  new iPhone whatever they're going to call it has been so  thoroughly picked over and it's it's spoil at least yeah,  leaks all around but they had a few things that they'd held  back and then what happened was they released the gold master  of iOS 11 and I'm on that list.  I get the I get the gold master, but I don't know what to  do with it.  You know, I can't find any secrets in it and according to  John Gruber who I assume is basically Phil Schiller speaking  to us through through the blog, right?  Said this is the the most damaging rumor in the history of  Apple the most damaging leave more than the release it more

End time: 1311.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I know come on.  This is what he's saying and the and the reason they're upset  about it is, you know, that was an accident leaving the bar  this what they're what seems to have happened is somebody  there's all this stuff in the gold master, but you have to be  a total geek and you have to know where to look to find it  and the suspicion is that some disgruntled employee sent out  the the URLs to tell people where where do I find the the  the the new?  Airpod thing that has the light on the outside and there's a  little video that shows that and the you know, where is the  name of the yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't buy it.  It can't be the iPhone X.  It makes no sense.  Yeah.  First of all half the world will call it the X which is a  terrible name for the iPhone half the world call it 10.  They don't have a 10 product anymore.  They they deprecated that with Mac OS.  It's clear.  I'm going to go out on their limb and say it's not going to  be called that's going to be the iPhone Pro.  They have a Mac Pro iMac Pro.  They have a MacBook Pro.  They have an iPad Pro.  The only thing that's not in a Pro line is the iPhone.  It's the iPhone Pro.  What is this X?  I think this is all disinformation.  X is a variable.  X is a variable.  It's meaningless.

Transcript:  This is my problem with the event in general though, like I  think the event in general.  We're at this point where we're never actually surprised.  Right.  It's too bad what comes out.  There's no big reveal these days at least for me.  Like I can't remember the last time I was like, oh yeah, I  didn't even hear about this and my mind is blown right now.  That's the issue that I have.  I think generally with with these events is they all this  stuff gets leaked over and over and I mean, I do think that  the the augmented reality look there.  There's an area that I think Apple isn't necessarily last  on or doesn't have to be last on because this is something  that there nobody has built a killer app for this right  unless we're talking about Pokemon go, which in many ways  is the most mainstream version of augmented reality that  anyone has experienced.  But you know, I don't really care about food networks AR  app.  No offense to them.  Just doesn't strike me as amazing but like the Walking  Dead AR app could be smart because it combines this  entertainment brand with a new kind of app that could be  really cool.  If Apple does something really smart and inventive with  augmented reality, I think that that could could actually  be a big deal that that would at least make me sort of  like stop whatever I'm doing and pay a lot of attention  to what they are doing with AR kit for sure.

Start time: 1589.92
End time: 1621.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've seen a lot of interesting AR kit demos.  It is easier to develop for AR kit than something like  say Google's Tango.  In fact, Google was forced to respond with AR core, which  is their version of AR kit a dumbed down version of Tango.  I think that is possible though.  What do you think and that AR is the VR for for 2017 it  is another or or 3d TV for 2017 another kind of gimmicky  idea that just isn't going to get that much traction.

Start time: 1621.86
End time: 1639.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, because if it's Apple doing it, it's going to  catch on for whatever strange reason.  I don't know why I personally don't don't see AR is is  something that's going to be huge.  But you know, whenever Apple says something, you know,  like swiped a lot man.  It's that's the most magical thing in the world.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I don't actually I think there's a AR on an iPhone  feels like a minor thing.  I it's it's I've seen, you know, virtual measuring tapes  that are kind of cool and there'll be things like that.  But I don't I think this is walking up to the glasses.  I think Apple is working its way into into having a AR  inside your glasses because you're not going to walk around  with your phone all day looking to see, you know, what  what information is out there, but you might actually  just look around with your glasses.

They said it's not coming out to 2019 and this is the  problem Apple's going to have to.  Yeah, sure.  If we could get spectacles that looked like normal glasses  not like some sort of weird Sergey Brin Borg geek thing  like Google Glass then maybe there'd be a market but that  technology it has to have a standalone powerful computer  in a pair of spectacles.  You can walk around with enough battery life.  You know, it's going to have more than a few hours battery  life.  It has to have some sort of heads-up display in the glass  all of this.  I don't think we're that close.  Yeah, I don't think so either.  It's going to be terribly expensive and price right?  It's got to cost something you can afford.

Start time: 1807.94
End time: 1839.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but but you know, you say that about every technology  coming down the pike.  What Apple brings to it is they've got a huge crowd of  developers who are eager to be early on whatever the next  thing is going to be because the first the first to arrive  make all the money.  So they're they're working on ARKit stuff and the other  thing Apple brings to the party is they've got whatever  five or six or seven or eight hundred million devices that  can run this stuff or they will by the time, you know,

Start time: 1839.56
End time: 1849.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

I want to talk about the other major technology that will  apparently be revealed in the new iPhone that Apple was  forced to include because they couldn't figure out how to  make touch ID work through the screen and that's face ID  or face recognition our guest and Pruitt who's joining us  from Tech Republic contributing right of their photographer  droner podcaster and a Clemson fan.

There's some if you look at the plans, there's something underneath  there's escalators down.  It's the world's largest carbon fiber roof on top of it.  But you the theater is underground.  Very doctor evil and so you take the escalators to the underground  theater.  If that's the demo area somebody said that there are walls automated  walls that can come up and hide the demo area.  So when you enter it'll be blacked out and then you'll go in and  go down and then after the event the walls will come down and  the whole world will be able to see through the glass.

If you're going to be an evil genius, make sure your mic is  clear our show today brought to you by koalcom.  It'll be interesting to see one of the things be interesting  to see if Apple continues to use the best LTE radios out  there the Qualcomm LTE radios remember in the last iPhone  they did 5050 and the Intel radios they put in were not so  fast.  So they slow down Qualcomm radios so that nobody feel bad.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Don't want you to feel bad.  Look if you're going to get a new phone get an Android phone  with a Qualcomm Snapdragon gigabit LTE radio in it with  additional lanes for data to flow on 4x4 MIMO 256 quam.  These are it's got carrier bonding.  These are the fastest LTE phones ever made the note 8 the  s8 the s8 active the Z Force the HTC u11 because they've  got this amazing LTE radio designed to deliver the fastest  mobile connectivity and help speed things up even in crowded  places.  You could turbocharge all your connected app stream 360 degree  videos and YouTube VR and 4k resolution with minimal  buffering minimal stuttering and lest you feel guilty.  It's better for everybody because it makes everybody's  connection faster even in congested networks.  If you if you don't have to feel bad because everybody's  getting better performance gigabit LTE as much as seven  times faster than your home Wi-Fi carrier aggregation 4x4  MIMO you can read all about this 256 quam if you go to the  website snapdragon.com slash gigabit make the most of your  unlimited data plan to learn more about faster network  connections and crowded places snapdragon.com slash gigabit  and we thank Qualcomm so much really happy to have Qualcomm  as an advertiser for their support of this week in tech.  So let's either way.  I was just reading John Gruber's.  Wow, you're right.  He was scathing a John Gruber's Daring Fireball article about  this Apple leak.  He can he says the BBC is confirmed, but he already knew  that the leak was sent by an Apple employee Gruber says I  could state with nearly a hundred percent certainty that  it was I think there's a good chance Apple is going to find  out who it was.  He says these URLs these URLs that were hidden in the gold  master were not discovered by guessing but because they were  published at obvious URLs prematurely somebody works at  Apple emailed these URLs to nine to five Mac and Mac rumors  possibly without even knowing just how much information could  be gleaned from them.  He says, let me clarify that sentence.  Whoever leaked these URLs knew it would be an incredibly  damaged damaging leak.  And he says this person should be ashamed of themselves and  should be very worried when their phone next rings.

Start time: 2362.14
End time: 2400.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they should be worried because because Apple famously  hired former CIA and NSA.  Leak busters to chase these guys down and I wouldn't I wouldn't  want and they you know, there was Mark Gurman was the guy who  was doing most of the leaking when he was still at nine to  five Mac before he went to Bloomberg and it was clearly  coming from the inside.  It wasn't stuff coming from Taiwan.  You know, it was the was inside the software.  Leaks and a couple guys got fired shortly after.

Start time: 2401.50
End time: 2464.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'll get fired but Steve Jobs was famous for he would hire  new people and put them on bogus projects for a few for a  you know, a hundred-day trial period to see if they leaked  anything about the bogus project and he would know it was them  because no one else was working on it or he would give people  selective information and wait to see what leaked Jobs was  notoriously paranoid.  It was funny because the leak anti-leak training that Apple  gives to its new employees was leaked.  And Apple right quite rightly said in this anti-leak training  it spoils it spoils it for us.  It spoils it for everybody your colleagues are working hard on  new products and a big part of the new product is the launch  the release the unveiling our fans our customers love it.  It's important for us in a marketing terms and you can really  spoil it.  So yeah, I agree with you Gruber obviously got a call from his  buddy Phil who said we're going to get this guy and what's

Start time: 2465.46
End time: 2490.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  left out of that though is I mean, okay.  I feel bad for the guys at Apple who work so hard and we're  hoping that they could keep it a surprise but you know the look  at it from the journalist point of view.  There's a lot of people who are trying to make a living retailing  whatever information they can get about Apple.  There's thousands of investors who who love this stuff and you  know, the journalists are working hard and so our job.

There's a I mean look you want to get a link, you know your  articles your blog posts read you want to get your podcast  listen to you talk about Apple rumors, but also I think there's  a very legitimate need to know on the part of consumers because  they're right now you can buy an essential phone and note 8 you  can maybe hold off for the pixel you're wondering what's what  Apple's going to do should I wait or not and this is consumer  information.  I think it's absolutely appropriate to tell us tell everything  we know and it's not totally not our job to protect Apple's

You know, is it money is just an axe to grind or what because  you're working at Apple.  I would presume you have it pretty good as a staffer in there  and not someone that's in one of the factories, but yet you  still want to potentially leak out some information to the  press and I apologize for Kyle O'Fann back here barking at  the rabbits in the window.

She gets a lot of information.  Why do people talk to you and she's there are a lot of  reasons some of it is disaffected employees and as good  as it is working at Apple.  There's got to be some people who are unhappy right working  at the fruit Factory and then it some of it is the glory.  Right.  I know something no one knows.  I'm going to you know, I like I like being able to be the  first person to tell you Mary Jo about this thing.

Transcript:  But at this point, I feel like a lot of these rumors are you  know, there's a convergence as you get closer and closer to  these events.  A lot of them at this point have to be true, right?

Start time: 2702.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I am of the of the very probably wrong  opinion that that this most recent leak is disinformation  that Apple knew that they prepared this information and  it will not be the iPhone 8 and 8 plus or iPhone X.  It is going to be something else and it's disinformation  and and and then they'll be then I mean wouldn't doesn't  it is not unreasonable to think that Apple might do that be  that sophisticated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a certain point they have to write at a certain  point.  This has happened enough times now and it's a regular enough  thing that we basically know what's going to be happening  with the new device before we actually see the new device  that a certain point you have to imagine that a company  like Apple has to say well, we need to we need to figure out  a way to fight back against this.  So I don't think that's an unreasonable conspiracy theory  at all.

Transcript:  One of the stories came out of the Wall Street Journal actually  a story we've been hearing for months, but they can they  repeated it this week that Apple had you know in order to  increase the bezel on the new iPhone and everybody's doing  that if you're going to get a flagship phone this year,  you're going to get a flagship phone that has a bigger  screen without a bigger phone.  That's the Holy Grail and no chin no forehead does does  it by eliminating both the side frames the bezels but also  the forehead at the top of the chin at the bottom.  But of course you do that on an iPhone you eliminate the  the home button which does two things.  It's it's a very important navigation button on the iPhone  because a lot of apps it's the only way to get out of the app  I haven't seen a quit in any app in years on the iPhone.  You're supposed to press the home button.  So that's the quit button as much as anything else the back  button, but also it's touch ID Apple didn't do it.  Others have done put the touch ID on the back Apple according  to the Journal tried to make the touch ID work through the  screen if the screens the whole front of the phone you put  your finger somewhere on that front and it would read your  finger.  They couldn't get it working.  They thought they would and they went to plan B late in the  production cycle.  So the Journal says that means these phones will be in very  short supply until next year is new phones.

Transcript:  I really love the edge to edge.  I mean the edge to edge.  It's just like as an Android user, you know, I think it's  it's me is the only way that I want to look at my phone.  I want that screen space.  I'm a little bit I have to say I'm a little bit on the fence  about the home button.  You know, I it's been a while since I used an iPhone but like  I mean on the one hand the physical button seems pointless  these days, right?  I mean set the biometrics aside for a second.  The physical button seems pointless in some ways because  everything else you do is on the screen itself.  But on the other hand, you know, on the other hand when my  Android phone geeks out and I hit the home button and it  doesn't work, you know, I want to throw my phone out the  window and I feel like the physical button somehow like  helps mitigate the helplessness that you feel.  Yeah, exactly.

Transcript:  So, you know, I have many years when people ask about phone  recommendations, you know, I have to consider what type of  person is asking me this and if it's someone that's not going  to understand rooting and rhyming and things like that,  I would always tell them go get the iPhone because the second  you screw something up just hit that home button.  You're good.

Start time: 2904.30
End time: 2934.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a really good point.  It's the it's the it's the panic button pretty much.  Yeah, the some of the rumors are that the the on-off switch  or really what the screen on our switch will now become the  new home button or at least assume some of that functionality.  There'll be it'll be overloaded.  There'll be multiple things that that button can do that's  going to be difficult to discover difficult to use and then  because they lost the fingerprint reader, they're going  to do face recognition.  They're going to apparently go to a rumor call it face ID  raises a lot of questions.

Start time: 2935.84
End time: 3023.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not sure I buy that journal story.  I tried to trace I tried to address the question.  Are they really going to kill the touch ID is the fingerprint  recognition really going away and it it there's only a handful  of original sources on that story.  It goes back to the the Taiwanese guy whose name I always forget  Ming Chi Kuo in Chi Kuo that digitimes.  Yeah, and he said definitively in February.  I think it was that it was that they definitely were going to  kill it for the reason that the Wall Street Journal gave is  that they couldn't get it to work.  Samsung couldn't get it to work under the glass screen and  neither could Apple after that people kind of I read Mark  Kerman very carefully.  He it was sort of maybe it was he didn't know for sure and  neither did the guys that I more I think it would be crazy to  get rid of the fingerprint recognition system that millions  of people have learned how to use to pay use Apple pay and  to unlock their phone.  Even if the face ID thing is better and works perfectly.  You don't want to take stuff away.  It's like you don't want to take away Social Security when  they've got it.  So I'm skeptical.  I'm waiting to see this is one of the surprises did they what  is the name?  What is the price and did they really kill Facebook recognition?  I'm going to see touch ID.

Start time: 3024.50
End time: 3038.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah touch ID.  You know, there's a lot of questions face recognition raises  of course how it can't be always looking for your face.  So yeah, it's got it.  You got to trigger it somehow with a gesture of a button  press or a noise or something.

Transcript:  I mean, this is a really interesting.  This is a really interesting point, right?  Because this is this is like this is this thing.  This is part of the whole like Apple versus FBI thing.  What we one of the things we learned from that battle was  this distinction between what you are and what you know,  right and in the case of what you are in the courts, the  courts essentially can't you can be forced to give up your  fingerprint have something look at your face give up your  blood I suppose but in terms of what you know in terms of an  alphanumeric code that unlocks your phone the authorities  can't actually make you provide that or at least not as easily  and I think that's really interesting to think about.  I mean look, I'm not worried necessarily about the  authorities coming to bang kicking down my door and saying,  you know, we need whatever is in your phone.  Look, look, look at your phone so that we can get into it.  But I do think it's something that at least I think about  when I think about biometrics more generally is like if I  have an alphanumeric code like nobody can force me to give  that over or at least it's very hard comparatively to biometrics  and I think biometrics is a little bit could there's a little  bit of an ick factor there for me just the fact that that  that the authorities can much more easily get you to provide

Start time: 3135.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that I should point out though that this even that putative  protection against something, you know, you have or something,  you know, we know that, you know, you can be compelled to  give a fingerprint a hair for DNA analysis and all that  courts have upheld that that's that doesn't violate your right  against self-incrimination.  But you know, there's a guy former Philadelphia police officer  has been in jail now for two years not because they convicted  him of a crime because he would not reveal the password to  decrypt his hard drives.  Yeah, so sad.  And he's appealed and the courts have upheld the you know,  and he will you know, he is on an indefinite.  Jail term because he's not going to give it up.  Crazy.  So don't don't I only reason bring that up is don't assume  that you know, just because you only you know, the password  that that they can't punish you.

Transcript:  get it.  I look at the pricing and I tried to think back over the  last several years and I remember the whole conspiracy  theory of planned obsolescence or whatever and I don't think  it's like the kind of digital redlining years.

Start time: 3235.30
End time: 3242.22

Transcript:  That's what it sounds like, you know, and I don't think that's  fair because it's a phone.  It's just the phone even if it's something like that and I  love my pixel because it's not only a phone, but it actually  helps me with content creation too, you know, but it's still  dadgum and expensive man.  Good grief.

Start time: 3263.76
End time: 3293.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't know how expensive coming out but and traditionally  the rumors about pricing have not been right.  Apple's very good at kind of telegraphing a higher price  and then surprising everybody making everybody feel good about  $950 when they're expecting $1,200 and that may be what  happens, but that is the rumor 1200 bucks starting price than  $1,300 for 256 gigs of RAM and $1,400 for 512 gigs of RAM.  So crazy.

Transcript:  Well, we paid $500 for phones, you know, it seemed like it  was a decent value because you knew you were going to get at  least two years out of that for those $500 in my opinion and  sometimes even longer.  I know I've had a few phones that I kept longer than the  particular site upgrade cycle came around but now just that's  just too much.  I mean I cringe when I got this pixel, but I've been waiting  for maybe three years or so.  So I'm like, okay, I'm due and I will hold on to this pixel  for probably another two more years, but I just don't know  if every consumer feels that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a disappointment.  I remember when Google announced the price on the pixel though  because they had made less expensive Nexus phones for several  generations and all of a sudden the pixel was priced at the  same flagship phone prices other competing phones.  Hasn't the iPhone always been considered a luxury device though

Start time: 3349.70
End time: 3374.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in fairness?  I mean like I take your point and that you had a longer  relationship with that phone in the beginning, right?  And it felt like you were getting a lot of bang for your  buck, but I also feel like I mean it seems to me like the  iPhone has always been considered to a certain degree a  luxury device or a device that's like sort of top of line,  right?

Transcript:  The newest iPhone.  Here's what I would say.

Start time: 3377.76
End time: 3465.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what if Apple offers as they do now and like the iPhone  SE relatively lower cost phone medium prices with an iPhone  8 and 8 plus or 7s and 7s plus and then this is I feel like  I understand they're going to get hit just as they got hit  for the $12,000 $17,000 Apple Watch and perhaps rightly so,  but on the other hand, I wouldn't mind if Apple said look,  what if we designed a phone and we just put everything in  it that we could we made it as good as we could without  regard to price and then we're going to charge what we have  to charge for it, but we thought there are some of you who  are less price sensitive who want to see the state of the  state of the art.  I think I could accept that the real problem I have is I don't  know if it will be state of the state of the art.  I don't know.  I mean look at we've had OLED screens on phones for years.  They're not the first to do a bezel this full full screen  design.  They're dropping they've already dropped the headphone Jack  which I frankly consider a necessity in a smart phone.  I hate that.  I hate that crazy and they're about to drop Touch ID which  they made to be the be all and end all of authentication on  a phone.  I don't know if this phone is going to be worth 1200 bucks,  but I wouldn't be against a company saying look we're going  to make the best thing we can regardless of price, but I  don't know if this will be that there's a little piece of

Start time: 3465.78
End time: 3519.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  economic data when they introduced the seven plus they  broke the rule that every increment was $100 more than the  one underneath it and they went to 130 and then they watched  to see what economists called the price in it in elasticity.  Yeah, and what they discovered is that they sold more of them  not less so that raising the price didn't hurt them.  It in fact for a lot of different reasons it went up not  necessarily because of the price.  My guess is 999 is probably the the entry point for this and  my guess is that price in elasticity will still take effect  and they will sell as many of these things as fast as they  can make them into next year.  It'll be a long it'll be a long time till you can buy one  of these things just because it won't be available right and  and that for Apple that's a that's a good problem to have.

Start time: 3521.06
End time: 3540.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember because they want to remember when Apple made a  MacBook and they made it in the traditional silver and then  they offered a black version of it for a hundred bucks more  you were paying a hundred bucks for paint and it and it out  sold all the other models apples known for a long time this  lesson.

Start time: 3542.68
End time: 3573.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so the other thing is that Apple has decided that the  way they're going to offer cheaper phones is to keep selling  the older versions at a discount and you know that they're  saying if you want the premium phone, you're going to have to  pay for it.  If you want the iPhone experience, you can get a pretty  good one for is pretty much the price of the competition a  little bit more and it is interesting that Google has responded

Transcript:  to this with something they call Android one.  This is there's a couple of features of Android one one is  that it will be as close to pure Android as possible even though  it won't be made by Google and it will be guaranteed security  patches and updates.  The first Android one phone is out.  It's from Motorola the X4 and it is fairly I have to look at  the pricing, but I think it's under $400 and so so Google I  think understands first of all, they understand two things one  that low-priced phones Android most of the reason Android has  so many models out there is most of the Android friends are  low-priced but also that there's an issue with these low-priced  phones.  They're not getting updates.  So this is Evan blasts of leaks has leaked this Motorola X4  which is and on the back it says powered by Android one.  I think this is still a leak.  I don't think this has become official so I don't know what  the price will be but that would make a lot of sense.  There's Evans Lake.  If you click on that image, I think it Carson you'll see the  full site full phone at the bottom and says Android one.  Yeah, there you go.

Start time: 3640.96

Start time: 3644.78
End time: 3701.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean for yeah, G5 the new one the E these are good phones  and there is a market so I kind of honor Google and its partners  like and like Motorola for making phones normal people can  afford that you don't give up every flagship feature.  But as long as those things exist or an iPhone SE exists, I  do like the idea that there is there is a phone where we're  going to spare no expense to make the best thing we can make  how how do you like it and who else but an Apple Apple's got  the audience for it.  So I'm not I don't know.  I understand.  I understand your point at I agree, you know, and and there  and somebody in the chat room said, you know, there are people  have to buy an iPhone for security reasons journalists in  in tough nations where you know security is paramount.  They don't buy and true true and the US government a bunch

I like the customizability and so I'm generally speaking.  I'm okay with dealing with some of the security challenges  or at least being you know, I'm okay with taking that risk,  but generally speaking, you know, I sent of the security

So I do think like as you said before and I think you were  you were saying that you recommend people depending on  their how serious of a user they are, you know, an iPhone  is a really good option in some ways and plenty of serious  users use iPhones too.  But I think that you know, generally speaking it does seem  fair to say that that iPhones are more secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have been accused of stealing signs.  This is a in baseball, you know, this happens in football too  in baseball.  The catcher sends signs to the the pitcher what pitch to throw  coaches will send signs to base runners and and hitters as to  what to do in the next play and if the opposing team could  figure out what the plans were it be a lot easier to get guys  out.  Apparently the Red Sox were sent.  I don't know how Phillip you talk about this in your blog.  What were they doing?  Were they texting each?  I mean it really didn't require an Apple Watch to do this,

Start time: 3851.48
End time: 3881.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right?  Well, I think my my assumption because if you're texting you  might as well use hand signals.  Why get fancy?  Right.  My assumption was that they were sending video to the Apple  Watch and what was what I love is that Tim Cook had visited  the the Red Sox dugout.  I don't know how much how much earlier but they'd given him  a he was wearing a whole Red Sox uniform and a Red Sox hat  and he posed with them and I can just see Cook saying look  look what you can do with this watch.  You can actually send video through it.

Transcript:  There's no camera on the watch.  The video can't be taken by the watch.  You could you could show it.  Right you can you can send it.  So this is what the New York Times said the Yankees who had  long been suspicious of the Red Sox stealing catcher's  signs in Fenway Park said that they there was video of the  from the broadcast.  I believe showing a member of the Red Sox training staff  looking at his Apple Watch in the dugout and then relaying  a message to other players in the dugout who would signal  teammates in the field about the kind of pitch he was going

I don't think the Apple Watch really is a big part of this  story, but I thought it was funny that the Apple Watch even  made the tabloids dirty socks Apple caught red-handed using  Apple Watch to cheat versus Yanks.  This must be the daily news, Phillip or the Post.  It's all of them.  All the New York Dailys.  How do you like them apples?  Red Sox fess up.

We spend so much time talking about privacy and how Google  knows everything or Facebook does everything at least with  Google and Facebook.  You're you know what you're giving them this information  and you know what they're doing with it.  But who knew there were three actually four I found out now  there's a fourth company in this country whose sole job it  is is to collect every possible bit of information about you  and you and you and all of us and then sell it to other  companies.  That's what the credit reporting agencies do Equifax is  just one of them.  There's TransUnion Experian Equifax trench.  Oh and this new one that I never heard of but I found out  in the New York Times is it a novice so there they I understand  why we have to it's a necessary evil because if you're going  to go try to buy a car or a house or rent a car rent a house  get a job.  Sometimes they'll do a credit report on you even to get hired  companies need to find out.  Are you credit worthy?  Are you a worthwhile risk?  So that's what these agencies do.  They collect all that information and then companies come  to them and say tell me all about Leo.  Can I lend him money?  They also have a side business pretty lucrative side business.  I'm told selling your information to companies that want  to give you free credit card offers you ever get a free  credit card offer in the mail.  Well, where do they get your information from Experian Equifax  TransUnion?  That's that's their business.  All right.  I understand necessary evil capitalist economy.  We got to have these guys but you're if you're going to be  do this kind of skeezy business you have a very high  responsibility to protect that data.

Transcript:  institutions in the US question apparently not Equifax told  us all this week that 143 million customer records had  been stolen by hackers.  I bet you that numbers low.  I bet you that number goes up over time.  We've seen that before apparently this is this love this  is Dan Gooden's article in Ars Technica with a guy trying  to stem the flow from a pipe not very effectively apparently  the Equifax knew about it July 29th shortly thereafter three  Equifax employees including their chief financial officer  sold stock worth millions of dollars and then they revealed  it publicly and the course of stock price tumbled.  I think that sounds like insider trading Equifax said.  Oh no, those guys didn't know your CFO really your CFO did  not know.  Okay.  All right.  I'm sure the SEC will have something to say about that  later.  Five weeks.  They knew about this.  They didn't tell us right there.  That's a problem because the minute that stuff goes out into  the dark net and is being traded by hackers you're at risk.  We're all at risk mother's maiden name Social Security  number in some cases credit card numbers phone numbers addresses  Equifax has not been very upfront about what information  was leaked how this information was retrieved why it took them  so long to respond.  They really haven't said much at all.  In fact, the only thing Equifax did is set up a website which  I'm not going to give you because you shouldn't go there  that you can enter in the last six.  There's only nine in your Social Security number last six  digits.  No, there's 10 right all but the first three digits of your  social and your last name and then they would say oh you were  affected or no you weren't except that Brian Krebs entered  a random number and Donald Trump's name and it said oh yeah,  you've been affected.  It's random apparently it either it doesn't work or it has  nothing to do with anything and then they immediately send you  to a site where they offer you a year of free credit monitoring  a year which will well, I'm sure in a year in a day they're  going to say and by the way, that's 39.95 from now on and  they'll they're trying to make money on this.

However, they said in the if you sign up for trusted ID,  which you should not absolutely should not do you should not  give in the last six of your social you shouldn't have anything  to do with Equifax at all.  If you can help it what they what they said is well, you  can't sue us.  You can only there's no you can't have a class-action lawsuit  against us is only arbitration but I think a experts agree  that's not binding.  You can still sue the hell out of them and should and the it  doesn't Equifax says doesn't apply the breach only applies  to trusted ID don't deal with Equifax don't make any  agreements at all with Equifax period.

Transcript:  A great example of just how a company even still I mean it  seems like when are we going to get to the point where companies  of this size understand how to deal with stuff like this.  I think we're still it still feels like we're in the days  where I can't remember a large company that's been affected  and so many of them have that nailed their response to this  kind of thing right and I think the other thing that's scary  to me is the like over time.  There's a profile that gets built up about each individual  user depending on different hacks that happen right.  Maybe there's a part of your profile gets stolen over here  and it's just your mother's maiden name and your telephone  number and then another pack over here get your Social  Security number and eventually there's there's an incremental  thing that's happening here to users all over the place that  I think is really scary and at the same time so many users  are becoming less and less they're becoming desensitized  to these stories because it seems like there's one every  month and I think both of those things like every week.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, both of those things freak me out.

Transcript:  Well, I don't think it's a it's a state secret how to secure  data.  Excuse me, but I think that we know how to do this.  Have you ever heard of a breach of your data from Google or  Facebook?  I feel like we know how to encrypt data how to secure it.  We don't know how the hackers got in the one of the stories  I saw said that Equifax said they got in through their website  which is of which bodes very poorly.  This special site they set up has security flaws of its own  and the JavaScript is the login name for the site.  I mean these guys are obviously inept.  They I agree with you aunt there should be there should be  some some require some federal requirements for privacy and  security for these companies.  But maybe one of the reasons they haven't is that Equifax  along with all the others is a big contributor to Republican  congressmen to lawmakers.  They've since the creation of the CFPB the consumer Financial  Protection Bureau Equifax has donated more than half a million  dollars in campaign cash trying to get Republicans to put the  CFPB out of business.  The CFPB was created after the you know, the deplorable financial  crisis of 2008 to protect Americans to force disclosures.  They Equifax has been lobbying for instance to repeal the rule  that requires them to be suable.  They they want to repeal the rule the agency entirely.

They've been talking about data privacy for a long time and  and the problem is just like the FCC in the net neutrality  debate.  This this stuff is really hard to do through the agency.

Look at this bill HR 2359 Barry Lauder milk of Georgia  introduced this May 4th the to amend civil liability requirements  under the Fair Credit Reporting Act to limit class action  lawsuit payments to $500,000 with no punitive amounts.  I mean this is this is clearly something written by companies  like Equifax and put through with their tame members of Congress  to protect them against this kind of event by the way good  news is a massive class action lawsuit that's been filed  against Equifax.  I was at 70 billion dollars.  I have to have come members of Congress of course have asked  them to come in and testify.  I just don't feel like Equifax has did the right thing in the  first place protecting us is done the right thing in the  response to it and is being forthright in any way about what  what information was leaked.

Transcript:  Yeah, who does who does Equifax answer to you with with regards  to this and secondly, why did they wait so long to release  the information and I know you have to have some type of  investigation before you tell the press, you know, we had a  breach because you want all of the facts to be there but it  took them a month to get the fact straight.

Oh, no, this was an X this was an Equifax.  This was Experian in 2015 Experian was hacked 15 million  customer records were exfiltrated 143 million pretty  much as every adult in the US as close as could be which  tells me that they lost the entire database, right?  So why are they saying oh don't worry only 222,000 people  lost their credit card numbers were lost.  I want to know a little bit more about that.  They probably have a backup either.

Start time: 5094.26
End time: 5110.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry.  In some ways to your credit card number is in some ways  like the least valuable part right at least to me like I  can call my credit card company and say these charges are  BS.  Good luck in a new social.  Right exactly.

Start time: 5111.82
End time: 5206.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  So there's a couple of ways you can really socket to them.  My suggestion is you can you can do a fraud put a fraud  alert on your account that you have to renew every few  months rules very state to state on this but that you usually  have to renew every three months and that means they have  to notify you when anybody pulls a credit report on you  even better credit freeze in some states you have to pay  for this as much as $10 to freeze your credit per reporting  company.  So that'd be $30 for the big three and then to unfreeze it  and what you need to do if you want to get a loan is another  $10 each.  So it's not cheap.  Although again in some states it's free.  It depends on how the state legislature ruled on this but a  credit freeze means they can't use your can't give anybody  your credit information and would completely eliminate  their ability to make money which is why they make this a  very hard thing to do but might be worthwhile.  Well, you know if you go to the state of California has a  great page on credit freezing and fraud alerts and they have  links to all three to the credit freeze pages.  You should be aware though that if you're going to get a  credit freeze the way you get it is by giving them all your  information because they don't have to know it's you right?  Right.  Yeah, New York Times says three hacks of Equifax were  disclosed by Equifax this year.  Yeah, I don't even know where to begin.  It's just it's appalling.

The last few they had the one and they kind of went downhill  after that and the last few phones I've used of HTC is very  unimpressive not great.  Yeah, the rumor is they are making the small pixel to LG  will make the big pixel to I don't it's not enough to save  the company and maybe that would be why Google would be  interested in buying them.

Transcript:  Remember in 2012 Google was making the Nexus phones and  they weren't making they were as they do today.  They were getting other companies to make them and brand  them.  Those were inexpensive phones.  It really looked like they were a developer platform like,  you know, this is the this is the reference platform for Android.  We don't expect anybody to really use it.  But then the pixel phones come along and it really looks like  Google has ambitions to be a flagship phone manufacturer,  but they're not making them still so who made the who made  the original pixels I forget.  But it wasn't made by Google was made to Google specifications.  So it would make sense original Nexus.  Well, the Nexus was made by a bunch of people.  In fact HTC HTC had one made one of them made the first one.  I think Samsung made some the Nexus one I think was a Samsung  phone, but I can't remember who made these pixels.  But anyway, it would make sense for Google if they say well,  we we're going to now make a business out of Android devices  and they could reasonably do so because as you pointed out  these are these are Huawei.  That's the Huawei.  Thank you Burke in the chat room and then I hey congratulations  for going to the chat room.  Most people are not brave enough to to go into the chair during  the show.  You're a brave fellow.  They haven't said anything bad about you.  So that's very ignorant.  Very very ignorant one of the other.  So no the chat room is fine.  They're not going to bite you.  I can't I can kind of see if this is an okay.  Now it's a business for Google.  Maybe we should own a manufacturer.  I don't know.

Maybe Samsung so they weren't able to get the chips that  the big guys who could negotiate and that that happens,  right?  It's kind of like speaking of chips poker when you are the  chip leader and poker you have a huge advantage just because  you're big when you're the big when you're selling 80 million  phones you have a huge advantage and it just kind of it's  a vicious circle.  The big the rich get richer and the little companies kind of  fade away and I think HTC that's just what's happening to  him.

They'll buy up all the capacity and really squeeze everybody  else.  I got to say I feel bad for the Android phone makers because  because they all use the same operating system.  They they end up competing on price which is a race to the  bottom and there's a reason that Apple, you know, it's got  what 16% of the global market but it takes home 85 90% of the  profit in cell phones.  So they're all struggling and I'm not surprised that Motorola  gets sold in H2H in you know, and they end up with Google  that's got the money to yeah to keep them alive.

Transcript:  It'll be it'll have a little nuclear reactor in it or something  like that.  So ever since November Facebook's been denying that Russians  bought political ads on Facebook on Wednesday.  They admitted it more than a hundred thousand dollars worth  of ads on hot button social issues targeting voters.  Many of the ads didn't refer to political candidates, but the  purchases were starting to learn were aimed at people who are  Clinton voters Facebook official says that these ads were  purchased by a multitude of fake accounts created by the  Internet Research Agency, which is a well-known kind of troll  factory out of Russia.  I almost said the Soviet Union it kind of feels like it  doesn't it's a far part of their very broad disinformation  efforts.  It does really raise the issue.  You know Facebook after the election said oh wait in Mark's  like why didn't have anything to do with that Mark said no,  you know,  but I think we're learning more and more that Facebook wields  immense power.  Because of its ad platform because of its vast usership in  the United States and around the world and this is concerning  it is now we talked about this on Wednesday and this week in  Google and we thought at the time that it wasn't illegal,  but I do believe now having looked into it that it is illegal  for a foreign government to try to influence elections by  buying ads.  That's not legal.  So Facebook did violate federal law by selling those ads.  They probably didn't know.  They say Facebook is cooperating now with members of Congress  staff members briefed Senate and House Intelligence Committees  on Wednesday.  Facebook's also cooperating with Robert Mueller the special  counsel.  They wrote we have shared our findings with US authorities  investigating these issues will continue to work with them as  necessary.  What is Facebook's responsibility and did they know all along  that they why didn't they only now find out that these ads  were sold?

What are the questions that are being asked from the Facebook  form?  To give you access to have ad placement on there, you know,  Dale, I know he was in the chat.  He said, you know, they shouldn't have any any anyone doing  ads for political reasons.  But does Facebook even know when someone signs up?  I mean, I could just go in there and say I want to do ant  Pruitt ads and they probably don't even care what the ads  are is just says ant Pruitt.  I don't know anybody ever done this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there is a they they ask you how much you want to spend  you submit the ad and then they have to approve it.  And I don't know what their criterion on but but there is a  step where some algorithm or some human approves the ad  because you can't just put anything.  I think it's humans.

What's interesting about the Facebook thing is that we've  known that the Russians hacked Podesta's emails and got all  this anti Hillary stuff.  Well, what we don't know is how they knew to direct it to  the right precincts and to weaponize it is the jargon they  use and one of the the theories is and what Mueller is trying  to find out is did the Trump campaign operation which had  great research feed it to the Russians and help them weaponize  the thing that they did they knew what can't what precincts

They have a big problem with this in India for instance of  you know folks impersonating other people to get Facebook  accounts and then say bad things about them.  This is like a you know, I've talked to some people who are  dealing with this.  I think Facebook at a basic level is reactive whether that's  whatever it is that violates their terms and conditions  whether it's violent video.  What are you going to do right?

Maybe and and that's why we see this tough after after the  fact, you know in this point in the New York Times story about  you know, the the company said it also found another 2,2,200  ads that were you know, but in America and we're sort of more  vaguely related to politics than the more direct advertising  stuff and they hadn't really figured out yet whether or not  those were part of this larger effort, you know, they're just  I think they're trying to figure it out and and you know,  maybe maybe that's that's normal but that's part of what  we're seeing right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  night and I thought I lost my keys at the bar next door.  Or I couldn't I was patting my pockets.  I can't find my keys.  So I went to the bar next door to you finding keys.  They didn't they know the good news is my keys have it a  tracker pixel attached and I was looking on the tracker and  I said well, it's around here somewhere and then I remembered  oh, yeah, I could press I could tap the button on my phone  and the alarm on the tracker will go off.  I press the button.  I'm in the bar.  I'm thinking oh, they're here somewhere and then I realized  oh, they're in they're in the hidden pocket in my scottie  vest shirt.  Never mind.  But even if you lose your keys in your shirt, you can find  them again with the tracker.  It's a coin size tracking device pairs with your phone and  keeps you from losing your most valued possessions.  You check the couch check the kitchen you check the pockets  on average.  All of us spend as much as 50.  What is it 50 minutes a day according to Newsweek searching  for stuff.  We know we own we know we have we just can't find it.  You look in the in the fridge ever look in the fridge for  your glasses and stuff.  Yeah, because I know I must have absentmindedly you look in  the peanut butter jar.  Well, you don't have to look anywhere.  You can use the tracker eight years ago tracker changed  everything with their first tracking device and they've done  it again.  The new tracker pixel is out.  That's what I have on my keys.  It has a LED all around it that will light up makes it easy  to find stuff that's you know, fallen under the bed or  whatever.  It's the lightest Bluetooth tracking device in the market,  but even though it's light it still has a replaceable battery.  I love them for that because unlike other trackers when the  tracker battery dies after a year you can replace it not  throw it away.  I put trackers on everything in my keys on my briefcase in  my car and my luggage on my bike.  I don't want to lose anything you can pair up to 10 trackers  to your smartphone.  You can share with other people's smartphones.  You can have family family find things time you get a 90  decibel alert.  That's what I got that helped me find my tracker.  If you lose your phone you press the button on the tracker  and your phone rings even if it's silenced.

It's not very big.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's my size with dime.  Maybe a nickel.  How long does the battery last that depends.  So it's Bluetooth le so it's low energy so it can  last as long as a year but I turn on all the two-way  separation stuff.  So like if you leave your keys behind your phone honks if  you leave your phone behind your keys honk and that uses  up more juice.  But the thing is it's just one of those CR like at this one  of the things CR 2030 battery.  I've got a dozen of them.  So maybe every three to six months.  I'll replace.  Oh, you can replace.

I'm sad to say silently and without notice without fanfare  Oracle laid off its entire Solaris tech staff last week.  Really the end of life of Solaris and the last pretty much  the last of Sun's products at Oracle.  Oracle really bought Sun for one reason only they wanted  the Java Java rights so they could sue Google for billions.  That was it.  That was the real reason.  I don't you know, I guess it's important to mention it because  Solaris was so but I don't think it may had a huge impact  these days.  Amazon's looking for a second headquarters and this is a  bonanza for somebody it will invest five billion dollars  plus hire 50,000 employees.  So they've gone around the country asking cities to bid for  HQ 2 and you can bet a lot of cities are into us into it  and interested Amazon told Seattle.  They're going to have 12 million square feet by 2022.  It pretty much owns downtown Seattle 8 more than 8 million  square feet with 33 billion.  I'm sorry 33 buildings.  So yeah, there was a really interesting graphic in the I  think was the times where they said forget it Amazon will  tell you exactly where you should go and they narrowed it  down to Denver.  I'm sure Denver was happy to hear that.  I would like Amazon to move to Petaluma.  You have instant access to the Twitter network.  Power hardly ever goes out.

They said these vulnerabilities are so severe and Eris has  such a terrible history of repairing vulnerabilities like  this.  They released it immediately.  They said, you know what we're going to tell everybody now  because this is such a horrific threat and we believe that  bad guys already know so we think users better know right  away.

Mike had the temerity to call out a guy who says I invented  email when I was a teenager in 1979.  Mike said that's not true.  He was immediately sued by Shiva Ayudhara.  He says he ate he invented email in the late 70s even though  I think many of us were using email before then.  Tech Dirt called him a liar and a charlatan.  Ayudhara sued him in January 2017 for libel on Wednesday  US District Judge F Dennis Saylor said because it's impossible  to define precisely and specifically what email is.  I do rise claim that is incapable of being proven true  or false.  And furthermore one person may consider a claim to be fake  if any element of it is not true or if it involves a slight  twisting of the facts.  So there's no libel here.  The case has been thrown out.  We don't know if he will appeal.  Oh, we do know he will appeal.  Here's a update to a Gooden's article false speech is not  protected by the Constitution says Ayudhara's attorney Charles  Harder.  You may have heard his name before in context in another  context Tech Dirt's false and malicious speech about Ayudhara  should receive no legal protection and we will appeal.

The judge did deny a separate motion to counter sue under  California's anti slap law, which allows him to recover his  extensive legal fees to defend himself.  So Mike is out of pocket.  There was you know, I don't know how much of it is his money.  How much of it was from a legal defense fund.  There was a legal defense fund for him.  I support journalism.com.  It's not too late to help Mike Maznik out even though he's won  this case.  The costs are huge.  And by the way, just like to let everybody know I invented  email last night in my jammies.  And if you say otherwise, you're in trouble boy.  Fake speech.  Fake speech.  Thanks, Beach.
