Transcript:  On your big day off.  Yeah.  Well, thanks for being here.  And finally, last but certainly not least from GadgetGDGT.com, Ryan Block is here.  And the reason I wanted to have you on, Ryan, actually, there's so much I could talk to you about the launch of the Google TV and so forth.  But you did a fairly I would say a fairly big deal article this week.  You're calling it Glassgate about the iPhone 4.

Start time: 259.44
End time: 269.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's I certainly did use that as kind of tongue in cheek.  Too late.  Too late.  That's certainly the shorthand.  I think that's going to stick.  So if not.

Start time: 270.18
End time: 323.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me recap.  You know, Apple sells actually at this time in their stores, but one iPhone case is their own bumper case, which doesn't in any way cover the front or the back.  It's just a plastic rim that goes around the case.  Right.  It has one chief merit, which is that it fixes the antenna problem.  And I guess if you dropped it on the edge, it might protect it.  But it's really it's it's about as minimalist as a case as you can get.  I use in fact, I'll show you what I've been using up till I read your article for a case that I bought from the AT&T store from a company called iFrogs with a Z.  It's a slip on case that covers the back.  And I kind of like the idea because it protects the back.  Well, apparently that's not what's happening.  Tell us what's what's going on, right?

Start time: 324.18
End time: 371.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, how far back in time do you want me to go?  I mean, is it worth kind of getting into how Apple's whole system of selling stuff works?  Yeah, sure.  So this some people have been in the industry, have kind of seen this system for a very long time and not very many other companies that outside of the gaming world tend to do this.  But but Apple does way back in the day.  Back in the day, I think it was 2003, 2002, when the iPod was first starting to take off, they created a made for iPod program.  And what that meant was they would license third party iPod accessories and a licensed accessory meant that you got access to Apple's CAD schematics for for the devices, sometimes in advance of launch.  So you could have the accessories ready.  And you get logos.

Start time: 371.91
End time: 374.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft does this with mates made for Windows to with software.

Start time: 374.16
End time: 432.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they do. They do that.  It's it's something you see a lot more in like the gaming world, right?  Like licensed accessories.  Right.  But but Apple started doing this.  And and so they had made for iPod.  And then when the iPhone came out and the iPad came out, they did made for for iPhone and made for iPad.  And now the program is called MFI made for I whatever.  And it's actually a really cool program for them because, you know, they don't have to go through the work of creating a whole line of accessories.  But they get to take basically a chunk of profit from anybody who creates an Apple accessory and gets the license, you know, gets the Apple license.  And then if Apple really likes your accessory, they're going to carry it in the store.  And that is, you know, then then they're taking both the license fee for the accessory as well as some of the margin off of the actual cost of the sale.  So Apple kind of double dips on it.  But most accessories companies really like this because they make less money, but they sell more units.  Yeah.

Start time: 433.24
End time: 436.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Getting in the Apple Store is a huge retail opportunity.

Start time: 436.59
End time: 480.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  It is if you make Apple accessories, you there's nothing you want more than to be in the Apple Store, even despite the fact that Apple is double dipping on your profits.  And so where, you know, my whole story with with the the iPhone cases comes in is if you look at what cases have become available on the on the Apple Store this week, and there were no cases available for the last couple of months.  And now cases are just starting to become available right around the same time I published this story.  You'll notice that there are no slide on cases.  And actually, I might have an example.  I don't I don't have one handy right now, but it's any kind of case where, you know, you you put the the iPhone into it and it slides in.  And basically what I'd heard.

Start time: 480.38
End time: 501.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the this is an example of such a case.  This is the and I bought this at the at the AT&T store.  This is the iFrogs.  So it slides on here and then the bottom slides on there.  And, you know, frankly, this is what I've been using.  It does the same thing as a bumper case, but it also protects the back.  Right.  And there's I also have a Mophie juice pack air does the same thing slides on.

Start time: 501.08
End time: 571.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So there are a lot of cases that do this and some of them are actually licensed like the juice pack air I think is licensed in.  I think the the Duracell one is is a licensed accessory.  But Apple is not selling them.  And Apple does sell the juice pack air for other products as well.  And and and they sell slide on cases for their other iPhones for the 3G and the 3G.  Yes, not for the for but not for the for.  And and there's a reason why.  But before I get to that, I mean, when you look at the other cases, you see that they they don't have the other ones don't have this mechanism where it slides onto the phone.  They have, you know, some kind of mechanism where it snaps on or in the case of the bumper, it goes on the edge of the phone.  And kind of flips onto place.  And the reason being what I'm what I what I heard from a source who's given me very reliable information from Apple for many years and then which I also confirmed from a very large third party accessories manufacturer independently was that Apple has kind of gone into lockdown.  And right after Antenna Gate, they were basically looking for issues.  They were trying to find anything else that could blow up in their face.

Start time: 571.26
End time: 578.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't need another hit on this platform, in other words.  Right.  We don't want to give consumer reports anymore ammunition.  Absolutely. Absolutely.

Start time: 579.46
End time: 594.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what they discovered was the slide on cases, if there's grit or any kind of matter in between the back of the case and the case as it's sliding on the back of the phone and the case as it's sliding on, it can scratch and score the glass, which can turn into a fracture or a crack.

Start time: 595.06
End time: 614.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this this one, this I frogs case has some velveteen in there that I mean, you could still get some gravel in there.  I mean, I don't know how you would, but you could.  So what you're saying is really more than just the case is that if this so-called Gorilla Glass back is scored, that might be sufficient to turn into a fracture on the back.

Start time: 614.93
End time: 632.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I mean, it's glass.  It's you know, it's it's it's actually tough.  It is. It's a tough and it's a tough and glass is not Gorilla Glass Gorilla Glass made by Corning.  Right.  Yeah, but it is it is a strengthened composite glass, very similar to Gorilla Glass, but it's stronger than the front, though, isn't it?

Start time: 633.08
End time: 633.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The back?

Start time: 634.14
End time: 644.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I believe they're actually the same the same material, the same kind of interesting.  But they you know, it's glass and it scores and it cracks and it shatters.  And you know what's interesting to me about this?

Start time: 645.08
End time: 649.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  I've never heard of such a thing as scratches on any of these devices.

Start time: 651.40
End time: 666.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're being facetious.  In fact, this is a big problem.  Apple got sued because of us because the iPod was so easy to scratch one of the iPod models.  But this is more important than just a scratch.  This is not merely cosmetic because if it fractures, you could have a break.  Is that what you're talking about, Ryan?

Start time: 667.08
End time: 725.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, when they do fracture, it's not like the all the glass comes apart.  I mean, it's it's kind of like the safety glass in a car.  Right. Where if it if it sustains like an acute impact, it's not all just going to fall out.  Right. I mean, it does hold together.  But you will wind up with well, you will not necessarily wind up with with a fractured back.  But if you do wind up with a fractured back, it's going to be you know, it's going to look like a piece of shattered glass on the back.  And so what Apple is concerned about is basically that you would buy a case and Apple had licensed some slide on third party cases that you would buy a slide on case.  You would put it on.  And you know, you're a diligent customer.  You want to take care of your phone.  You want to put it in a case.  So you buy the Apple license case from, you know, potentially the Apple Store could be somewhere else.  And then, you know, maybe a month later, you take it off and you find that your phone, which you've taken great care of, has a big crack on the back.  So what Apple did was they kind of went into lockdown on this.

Start time: 726.11
End time: 728.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does that mean when you say went into lockdown?

Start time: 728.56
End time: 742.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they they started a test lab specifically for testing this.  They started investigating this very thoroughly.  And then they also basically completely wiped the store clear of any slide on cases.

Start time: 742.48
End time: 748.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's the proof of this is that you couldn't buy a slide on.  You still to this day, you cannot buy a slide on case.

Start time: 748.08
End time: 758.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't buy a slide on case just for the phone.  Not from Apple.  You can buy them and they're out there.  Right.  And I'm sure that this concerns them.  But you cannot buy a slide on case right now from Apple.

Start time: 759.10
End time: 762.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I guess the online store is selling.  Is the online store selling some?

Start time: 763.42
End time: 854.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The online store just this week, I think actually the day before I published this story,  just put their their cases back online.  And, you know, the funny thing about this story is that I've been I had the story.  I've been sitting on it for a couple of weeks and I've been talking to people and trying to build the evidence.  I thought that was that was necessary to publish this with with, you know,  the requisite credibility because Apple stories are obviously subject to a lot of scrutiny.  And I reached out to Apple and asked for a comment.  And again, you know, their store had had zero cases, no iPhone cases for weeks.  And then in the time that I did that, and about 36 hours later when I published the story,  a bunch of iPhone cases went back up on the site.  You think this is a response to you?  I don't I don't necessarily think that it's in response, but it was pretty funny timing because, you know,  I happen to have reached out and granted, I reached out in early October.  I mean, I had expected them to put some of these cases back online anyway because the case the free case program ended on September 30th.  But it was just very, very bizarre timing.  And it actually, I think, kind of worked in my favor because, you know, like you said,  you go to look at the accessories that they sell, there's no side on cases.  And there are slight on cases for the iPhone 3G and 3GS.  And there are all kinds of slide on accessories for those for those phones.  And we also know, of course, that you can buy slide on accessories for the iPhone 4.  But Apple is not selling any of them. They're completely off the site.

Start time: 854.44
End time: 861.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, why would they put it back on the website?  Is it I mean, if they're dangerous, why are they selling this spec case?

Start time: 863.12
End time: 880.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so the cases that they are selling on the site right now are not slide ons.  They're the sample. OK. So the the the the core of the issue is that you still can't buy a slide on case anywhere from Apple.  Exactly. The core of the issue is if there's like some grit on the back of the phone or inside the case, which definitely happens.  It's the sliding motion that scratches it and begins the fracture.

Start time: 882.16
End time: 895.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. So you published this in GDGT a few days ago.  What was what's the response been from your readers?  Have they confirmed this or is this not seem not very likely?

Start time: 895.90
End time: 955.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, one of the things that I put out there and I tried to be really clear about this is that it's preemptive.  I don't think that this is a massive epidemic issue right now.  And and I think that most people probably agree with that.  And I think that that's in large part to Apple trying to contain this as quickly and as early as possible.  I think that if everybody out there was getting and you also notice that in the free case program, there were no slide on cases.  They were all snap on cases.  I think that if there if there were tens or hundreds of thousands of slide on cases out there, that this might be a bigger deal.  But Apple, I think, is doing everything they can to prevent that from happening.  So, you know, I think they're doing their job.  I mean, they're doing a good job at at containing this.  And, you know, my goal here was not to to, you know, try to scare people into buying cases or something like that or not buying cases,  but really just to inform people as to what's going on behind the scenes.

Start time: 956.06
End time: 961.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very interesting. So if you have a slide on case, which I do, is your recommendation to retire it?

Start time: 963.08
End time: 980.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what I actually did? I have a slide on case that I've been using for a little while.  I haven't had any problems with it yet.  Yeah. What I would recommend is if you have a screen protector, put the screen protector on the back of the phone in between the phone and the slide on case.  And that should help. OK. That would be my first recommendation.

Start time: 980.08
End time: 1109.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  GDGT.com, if you want to read more on this story.  And there's about 84 comments in there. Some people have had this problem.  Some have not. The fact that anybody has seems like you're right.  You put a case on it to protect it. If it's going to scratch it, that's not such a good thing.  And if it's going to fracture it, that's really not a good thing.  Thank you, Ryan. Thanks.  Ryan Block, GDGT.com. We're going to take a little break.  Come back with more John C. Dvorak.  John C. Dvorak is here. Tom Merritt and John Graham coming.  We're going to talk a little bit about the analytic engine of Charles Babbage.  A big anniversary today.  Before we do that, though, I'd like to mention our friends at Citrix who do the fabulous GoToMeeting.  GoToMeeting reduces costs, improves efficiencies, makes your meetings come alive.  It's the best web conferencing solution by far.  And if you haven't tried it yet, I want to give you a free 30 days to try it at GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  It's the easiest to use, easiest to install. Your attendees don't even have to have it installed ahead of time.  This is one of the things Citrix does so well. You send them a link in an email or you can even be on a conference call and say, hey, you know, this is ridiculous.  Why don't I just show you what I'm talking about?  You tell your conferees to go to GoToMeeting.com. You give them the meeting ID. They enter that.  There's a little download, a little stub of a download. It takes about 30 seconds.  And boom, they are now seeing your computer screen on their computer.  They can share their screen with you. You can have up to 15 attendees.  It's great for product reviews, for sales presentations, training sessions, collaboration.  Just taking a conference call from a boring old phone call to something exciting and visual.  We use it all the time here at the Twitter. We have several accounts constantly using this.  I want you to try it for 30 days. GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  We thank the folks at Citrix for their support of this week in tech.  John, John, John, I don't know why John does that, but he likes to cover up the screen when we're doing a commercial.  Is it are you embarrassed to be associated with a money making enterprise? Is that it?

Start time: 1144.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I did. We invited him to stay before the show and he said he couldn't.  And I said, can you please come on for five minutes and at least talk about this? Because it was a big story.  So he agreed to take some time. It's Sunday. He's probably watching the ballgame.

And it will not only find Hawaii 5.0 on your program guide, on the Internet, if you can watch it on the Internet, on various stores,  but it will also, if you have DVR recordings of Hawaii 5.0, it will find it there as well.

Anybody have anything to say about this iPhone case thing?  Well, I was in the chat room and the chat room was going crazy about how this was not a story.

Start time: 1255.12
End time: 1280.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting?  I think the blogosphere has echoed it a little stronger than it probably deserves,  but I think it's worth paying attention to if you have one of these cases like you do, Leo.  You should know, like, hey, there's a risk of breaking in there.  I do agree that I don't think it's a big controversy that Apple is going to have to come out with another press conference  and it's going to kill iPhone sales or anything like that.  I think it's just kind of more of a consumer awareness issue.

And if I were to see a Toyota Prius with a curious funnel like cylinder on the roof and no one at the wheel, I think I would freak out.

Start time: 1468.03
End time: 1496.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they have to put somebody at the wheel.  So that's why nobody was freaking out because I couldn't tell he wasn't driving it.  But to actually make it street legal, they did some some look at the rules of the road in California and found out that you can have automatic systems as long as there's somebody there monitoring them.  So they had an engineer who could turn off the automatic driving by hitting the brake pedal, by speaking a word and one other way.  And they said they only had to actually do that, you know, half a dozen times on this long trip.

It's a sensor on the roof that scans more than 200 feet in all directions to generate a lies for lying radar to generate a precise three dimensional map of the car.  It's a sensor that scans the car's surroundings.  It then has four automotive radar sensors, three in front and one in the back to determine the positions of distant objects.  It has a position estimator, a sensor on the left rear wheel, which measures movements made by the car.  I guess it's giving you kind of a dead reckoning.  There's also a video camera in the front windshield near the rear view mirror that's detecting traffic lights.

Transcript:  I actually have a funny story about this, which is I met the guy who ran one of the DARPA challenge projects, the Stanford Racing one that won it through the desert at Nevada.  I called Sven Stroband.  And he told me that the way they ensured software quality was when a software engineer said, my module is ready.  He said, great, we'll put you in the car.  And basically, they had to go in the car for a few hours.  And he said no one ever failed to say, you know, I could do it an extra week.  Yeah.

So this is this is, you know, look, this is not technology that's going to be on the roads of the US in the next few years.  But it's something we've been talking about for a long time.  And in the theory of autonomous vehicles is it would be they would be safer because a lot of accidents are human error.  Yes.

Start time: 1673.37
End time: 1714.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's funny.  He brought up Stanford, John, because one of the guys that oversaw Stanley, the DARPA car that did this, is one of the guys that's doing this for Google on contract.  And it's kind of a surprising leap to hear that we went from a total failure, the first DARPA Grand Challenge, to a successful yet very restricted test to somebody taking a car just out of the desert.  Taking a car just out on the public street and having a drive itself.  I mean, it's it's expensive.  It's far it's far ahead.  But this could save thousands and thousands of lives and save a bunch of time, too, if it actually works.

And he had this amazing kind of vision, not only of safety, but of efficiency.  Imagine, he said that no one owns a car, but that it's kind of like the Zipcar idea that when you need a car, one arrives and that, for instance, you order a car, car arrives, takes you to where you're going and then disappears.  And let's say you need a an RV instead of buying an RV.  You take the car to where you're going and RV is already waiting for you there.  You get in the RV, you sleep, you spend the night, whatever.  And then you go on.  In other words, it's just in time cars.  And he said this would save us a lot of fuel of time, of efficient, you know, and efficiency.

Transcript:  So this is the one hundred seventy third annual adventure anniversary of the invention of the analytical machine.  And this man knows a little bit about it because he wrote the Geek Atlas, which includes, you know, geek places to go for geeks around the world, including the Babbage's.  What is it? Has house the analytical machine itself?  What can we see?

Start time: 1877.20
End time: 1913.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let me set you right on one thing.  It's not a very wonderful anniversary today.  The real point is that no one built Babbage's computer.  There is no there is no analytical machine.  It was never made.  It was never made, although bits of it were made.  And so what I'm trying to do is build it and which is quite a large machine.  It's about the size of a small truck.  And so I started a project to do the research necessary to finish it.  And it'll have about one point seven K of memory made out of brass, essentially, and powered by a steam engine.

Start time: 1916.19
End time: 1920.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, what is the difference between the analytical engine and the difference?  Is that just two words for the same thing or are they two different things?

Start time: 1922.40
End time: 1964.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the difference engine just basically what it does is it calculates polynomials.  So it's a calculator.  It does one thing.  The analytical engine is a programmable computer.  It had memory, actually quite expandable memory.  At some points, Babbage thought he might need up to 20 K of memory.  It has a CPU, which is separate from the memory, whereas the difference engine, it's all mixed together.  And it was programmed using punch cards.  So it was very similar and even has microcode like in a modern processor.  And even actually, most amazingly, it has instruction pipelining like in a risk processor.  Just the whole thing is completely mechanical.  And Babbage laid a lot of plans.  Yeah.

Start time: 1966.22
End time: 1996.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a good kind of fascinates me, by the way, and I hope you actually do this.  But have you thought about the kind of the history as in so far as why nobody has actually tried to build one of these before?  Because we have a lot of billionaires that are techie nerds out there that have got more than enough money to finance something like this.  And they could have done it 20 years ago.  And is there been any attempts or is there a history behind this?  Because it's always baffled me that nobody's tried to or has actually built one by now.

Start time: 1997.86
End time: 2051.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I hope the billionaires are listening because I need about a million dollars.  Is that expensive?  Well, it'll be expensive for one really big reason, which is we built Babbage's difference engine.  There's a copy in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View because Babbage laid out complete plans.  So it was possible to just go get the plans out of the Science Museum in London and essentially build it.  The analytical engine, much like with any other computer, he kept improving it.  So there's a whole load of plans and every now and then he optimizes some bit of it, making multiplication faster or addition pipelining, all these things.  So there's not one definitive set.  And I think the big reason people haven't built it yet is there's actually a research project to do, which is to say, all right, look, what of these plans actually constitutes the analytical engine?  And once you do that, then you can decide to build it.  So this is the difference engine.

Start time: 2052.18
End time: 2057.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this was the source of my confusion.  I didn't realize there was a difference.  I've seen this.  This is local.  Yeah.

Start time: 2058.08
End time: 2063.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So basically in the late 80s, the Science Museum in London built the difference engine.

Start time: 2063.08
End time: 2066.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all cogs and brass wheels.  I mean, it's beautiful.  Yes.

Start time: 2067.18
End time: 2100.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's absolutely beautiful.  And the point of doing that was to show that, first of all, Babbage's machines would have worked and also that the technology available to the Victorians was good enough because they built this to the tolerances that were available in Victorian Britain  with with alloys that were available.  So the point is that took away all of the uncertainty about whether Babbage's machines could have been built.  And so now I want to do is say, OK, let's decide what the analytical engine was and let's build it and then let's program it.  So this is a big this is just a big calculator.

Start time: 2116.34
End time: 2124.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it runs on crank then same as the steam.  Yeah.  But in other words, there's no electricity in it.  It's no.

Start time: 2126.93
End time: 2235.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there's no there's no evidence actually that Babbage ever considered using electricity for any of his computers.  He was a contemporary of Faraday.  So there was work going on with electricity at the time.  But he was completely thinking about mechanical devices powered by steam.  The most fascinating thing for me is he believed in his lifetime it wouldn't be built because essentially he was working alone.  And he nevertheless wrote that one day someone's going to build one of these analytical engines,  I a computer, and it's going to shape the course of science forever.  And I think that's quite amazing.  He was sitting there in 1847 saying, you know, once this is built,  it's all going to change.  I can see it coming.  Who was Charles Babbage?  I mean, how did he get this vision?  He was a mathematician.  He was fairly wealthy because his father was a banker and he inherited a lot of money.  He was a minor aristocracy in Britain.  And so he was the case in professor of mathematics at Cambridge.  He was very good mathematician.  And he got the idea because at the time it was necessary to build to print books of tables, log tables.  Some of you are old enough to remember using log tables.  And they were full of inaccuracies because people would make mistakes.  And Babbage said all this ought to be done by steam, everything from the calculation to the printing.  So there's no room for error.  And he built that.  That machine is the difference engine, which you can see in Mountain View.  The printer even does text justification.  So, I mean, go look at it because it's stunning.  But while he was working on this, he said, actually, I think there's more I can do if I can get feedback in the system.  And the feedback is what led him to the computer.  And that's what led him to the analytical engine.

Start time: 2239.53
End time: 2299.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So she was, of course, Lord Byron's daughter.  Well, one of his children, the legitimate one at least.  And she had some mathematical training.  Babbage, because he was a member of high society in Britain, had parties at his house where he would demonstrate bits of the difference engine.  So he really was a nerd, in my opinion.  No kidding.  You imagine me inviting him around to his house with the Duke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peale, Prince Albert.  Let's turn this.  And in fact, the bit that he demonstrated is in the Science Museum in London.  And every time I go and look at it, I think this is what the guy showed at parties.  Luckily, he was wealthy enough that people came.  Ada Loveless was one of those people.  She became fascinated by the analytical engine.  And she translated a paper, the only really good paper that was published at the time, which was published in French.  She translated it into English.  That's really where we get her name associated with it, because she added to that paper pages of notes from her own thinking about the analytical engine.

Start time: 2307.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I'm trying to raise about, I'm trying to get 50,000 people to say they'll put up $10 pounds or euros, depending on what your currency is, to kick it off.  It is going to probably need more.  We know from the cost of the difference engine, the difference engine cost about 400,000 pounds.  And this has got some research behind it.  But I think that one of the goals will be actually to digitize all of Babbage's papers because they're not available on the web.  And they're in the Science Museum in London.  And so this is really an educational thing, as well as ultimately trying to build this computer and show that in 1837, Babbage had invented a general purpose digital computer with a printer, a plotter, punch cards, microcode, instruction pipe, you name it.  And it's kind of amazing that it's 100 years later, in 1937, that you had Alan Turing, who wrote his famous paper in which he laid out the Turing machine.  And so part of what I'm saying is there's 100 years here that was sort of lost.  And John?  Yeah.

I mean, that actually is a whole other interesting thing, which is the telegraph and how that operated in this era.  So the era that Babbage was working, not long after that, because the British Empire was very big and you keep the British Empire under control with the telegraph.  It was possible to telegraph a message from London to Bombay in the middle of the 1800s in eight minutes, which makes you think the internet now, I mean, it's only a little bit faster than that.  A little bit. I think it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, there's a huge distinction, right, which is that Babbage was building something practical.  He saw real use of it.  Turing was laying down the fundamentals of computer science.  So there's very, for me, Babbage is a computer pioneer and Turing a computer science pioneer.  So they're doing slightly different things.  Of course, the interesting thing is looking back, Babbage's machine was Turing complete.  It was a computer that we would recognize.  He'd already done that thinking, hadn't he?  He hadn't realized that there was only one Turing-ness, but yeah, he'd built it.

The reason I picked 50,000 is that when I did the Alan Turing apology petition last year...  Which you succeeded in.  Yes, I did. Yes.  I got 35,000 people in Britain to sign that.  So this project is worldwide.  So I'm betting that I have a good chance of getting 50,000 people to say,  yes, 10 bucks is enough to go and see a truck-sized steam-powered brass computer.

He didn't have RAM.  He had RAM, but it was only for storage of numbers, basically, not for the program.  Interesting.  And the other thing he didn't do was he didn't let the program address memory.  It was fixed memory location, so you couldn't do things like arrays.  But he had enough power in there.

Transcript:  I love it.  What a great idea.  Hey, before we go on, I do want to mention Ford.  We were talking about autonomous cars.  I had a great time driving that Ford Flex with it.  It was actually really cool.  I didn't do it right.  So you're looking for parking space.  No, it's a fairly big car because it seats like eight or something.  So you press the button that says, find me a parking space.  You're driving along, and it sees, it spots a space that's big enough.  And the little light goes on, and then it says, pull forward.  So you pull forward, pull forward, pull forward, pull forward, and it says, okay, stop.  Then it says, now, park.  And you press the button, and the wheel goes, and it parallel parks you automatically.  Now, my mistake was, I should have thought about this, that I took my hands off the wheel,  but I also took my feet off the brake.  They didn't mention to me that, well, actually, once you're parked,  you probably should put your foot on the brake because the car is idling.  It will continue to back up.  So I'm just like, oh, this is cool.  And I'm with my hands and feet in the air, and of course, the car parks perfectly  and then continues to back up into the Fiesta behind me.  Now, the good news is I was wearing a helmet, so I was uninjured,  and neither the Flex nor the Fiesta took even a ding.  I mean, they looked fantastic.  I think we were going, by the time we hit the Fiesta,  because it was a bit of a ways, we were going eight or nine miles an hour.  It jerked me, but anyway, they're working on this stuff, this bliss stuff that lets you know,  if there's a car in your blind spot, there's some really cool stuff in there.  But the technology that you know I love the best in my Ford Mustang,  they call it Ford Sync, now they call it My Ford Touch.  It's the amazing turn-by-turn directions, voice-activated, music search, traffic alerts,  audible text messages, 911 assist in the Ford Sync, My Ford Touch.  It's amazing. It's amazing.  You know, essentially Ford made a very clever decision.  They said, we're going to build this capability into the car,  but it will use the capability of the phone,  because these phones are getting upgraded all the time.  So as the phone capabilities improve, automatically, My Ford Touch gets smarter.  So for instance, I have the new Android Droid X.  Well, when a text message comes in, and you could turn this off,  but I have it set so that My Ford Touch says, bing, there's a text message.  I could say, read it to me.  It reads me the message, then gives me a set of canned responses I could send back,  all without taking my eyes off the road or my hands off the wheel.  I mean, it's just fantastic.  Of course, if you've got an iPod or an iPhone with Bluetooth,  or it's got an iPod USB connector, so you can connect to any device via USB,  it'll play the USB device, the songs, of course,  but it also, you can command a song.  You can say, play U2, and it'll play U2.  You can say, play next, play more like that.  You can say, call John, and it'll call John.  I mean, it is so fantastic.  Works with your Bluetooth-enabled phone.  On most phones, not only can you make calls, but you can also listen to music.  You get turn-by-turn directions without buying a more expensive GPS device with a big screen.  You get personalized traffic alerts.  It knows your route, and it'll send you traffic alerts as you go,  and it can reroute you with turn-by-turn directions.  It is hands-free calling at its best.  I want you to try it.  Go to any Ford, Lincoln, or Mercury dealer.  Say, I want to see the SYNC, the MyFord Touch,  or you can go to syncmyridepodcast.com to find out more.  They've got lots of videos and demos and so forth.  And next week, I think I'm going to talk about the Ford Edge,  because this is their highest tech vehicle.  This car has every wonderful feature in there.  I'm just really excited about it.  Ford is taking the state of the art to the next level.  MyFord Touch at your Ford, Lincoln, or Mercury dealer,  or visit syncmyridepodcast.com.  John Graham Cumming is here from jgc.org.  He is a computer scientist, right?

I had to go back because I couldn't cover the damn story, John.  Right?  I had to go back.  You know, when I went back, John, is when they introduced places and I said, well, I  can't talk about places because I don't have places.  And so I'm keeping my eyes on them.  So I know what they're up to.  That's all.  I admit it's kind of my tail between my legs.  I have to say praise for Facebook.  I'll be the first to praise them for one of the things they did this week, which was they  announced that you can now download all of your Facebook content as a big old zip file.  It's an HTML file with all the pictures, not only all the biggest mistake they've ever

You know, if you run type pad, you can export to WordPress.  You can do all this kind of cool things, but they essentially had a captive audience and  now they're saying, yeah, you can go wherever you want.

We have a Identica micro blog called the Twit Army, army.twit.tv, which we are going to move to Status.net.  They do hosting.  And yeah, that's the idea is it is federated so that...  In fact, it works very well.  If you want to follow some...  It doesn't work with Twitter or Facebook because they don't have...  They won't open it up.  But if you want to follow somebody on Status.net or Identica from our Twit Army, you just add their address and you're following them.  It's in your stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so yeah, for $299, you're getting a very, well, you can use your iPhone or your  Android phone as a remote.  That's kind of cool.  I ordered one just because we got to talk about it, but I don't know if I would recommend  anybody order it at this point.  What do you think, Tom?  I think it's early.

Start time: 3932.22
End time: 3979.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I think I'd probably get one just for the same reason so I can play with it in my  house and see how it works.  But I don't see this yet as the box.  If I were to recommend to somebody right now, hey, I want to get my parents something so  they can watch internet video really easily, I'd get them a Roku.  Yes, I'd agree.  Because it's small, it's simple, it's $60 for the base one, and it's really dead simple  to teach somebody how to use it.  The complications come in signing up for the service.  If you sign them up for Netflix or you sign them up for Hulu, but once they're going with  it, it just kind of works.  Google TV does a lot more and it's a smarter bet because they can use it on different platforms.  It's not locked into one box.  But right now I don't think it's so dead simple for people.

Start time: 3980.08
End time: 3997.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think it's a big deal that Hulu Plus is going to be on Roku.  That means that Roku will have most of the content you would want.  I mean, you can watch us on Roku, which is great.  You can watch Amazon, Netflix.  It won't have iTunes, but the Apple TV has that and Netflix only.  What do you use, John?  Do you do anything?

But I'm seriously thinking of going a little retro because they have new HDTV channels  that are apparently quite nice.  And I want somebody to send me some literature or some recommendations because I know some  of the listeners out there do this.  I want to go with a big C-band dish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can still catch that stuff.  Do they still do that?  I thought they started scrambling that.  I have a pad in the backyard.  I can put a big C-band dish on there.  And Leo, you're on the sticks.  You should have two of them and we can get the real deal, you know, the real big, the  bandwidth there with that big dish.  A C-band dish.

Start time: 4045.86
End time: 4091.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, in all seriousness, that is the best way to get access to all the content.  The problem with it is you can't get it on demand.  You have to wait until it gets broadcast and then DVR it.  What the box that we're waiting for should do is allow you to see what's being broadcast  right now from your C-band dish or whatever and be able to get Hulu, Netflix, essentially  every online video version of every show that's available.  Nobody's going to be able to do that unless you get licensing cleared up.  Even Google's got a great interface here, but as long as the licensing windows are so  messed up where not everything is available from everybody at every point, it's hopeless.  And you are stuck just watching it on broadcast and recording it.

I've got to fire up the boilers, honey.  That's right.  It's practically like that right now.  I mean, my wife is so mad at me because she says I just want to watch TV.  How do I watch TV?  She cannot watch TV unless I'm there because it requires the use of three separate remotes.  And I don't think I don't see it with Google TV really changing that.  In fact, now you've got a keyboard, a mouse.  I mean, oh, honey, it's no problem.  You just go to the command prompt and type CDNBC and you'll find all of the just do an L.S.  there.  You'll find all of the NBC shows listed.  And when you want to run one, it's a run dash TQ space and then the name of the show.  If you want to run it in a widescreen, then another dash WS.

So there's the Sword and Stone, the Witch in the Wood and the Ill-Made Knight, a Candle in the Wind.  That's the second book.  It's actually two combined.

Transcript:  Nullification is based on the Tenth Amendment,  which says that the state law,  unless it's specifically in the Constitution,  state law trumps federal law in all cases,  and federal laws that are either unconstitutional...  Let's say, for example,  legalized marijuana in California, Proposition 19.  I was just thinking that's what you're doing here.  That violates federal law,  but as a state law, it trumps the federal law  because it's not in the Constitution.  That's why they passed the Volstead Act for prohibition  to make it constitutional.  Right.

Transcript:  So when 19 passes, if it passes, it should,  the feds are going to probably sue the state of California  claiming that, oh, you can't do that  because we have a federal law that says marijuana is illegal.  And the whole thing is all based on the Tenth Amendment.  California is within its rights to do that.

And this is the beauty of it.  You can hear opinions, facts.  The great thing about Audible is you're learning.  In the time that you spend driving home on your commute  or doing the housework or at the gym,  I listen at the gym every single day.  That gives me an hour a day of reading.  I'm getting great reading done.  You know what I do is I alternate  because sometimes I listen to a book like this and I get all steamed.  And then I listen to a little bit of fiction like The Gunslinger  or The Sword and the Stone.  And then I feel much better.  And then I listen to another book and it gets me steamed.  And then I listen to some fiction and I go back and forth.  Believe it or not, two books a month is not enough for me.  I love Audible.  But I'm going to set you up here with the Platinum account.  That's two books a month.  It's a good way to start.  The first month is free.  That means you're going to get two books absolutely free.  They're yours to keep forever.  You can cancel at any time.  But it's a good way of getting introduced.  So why don't we give you two books?  We'll give you The Sword and the Stone.  That'll make you smile.  It'll also get you ready for The Sword and the Laser.  And Nullification by Thomas E. Woods.  I actually want to listen to this, John.  Because I'm looking forward to fighting the fence.  I'm telling you, you'll be a convert.  No, I think this is...  You know, I'm a favor of states' rights.  I think that's appropriate.  It's in the Tenth Amendment, as you said.  How to resist federal tyranny in the 21st century.  We'll find out more about that.  Four and a half stars on this one.  People like this book.  Audible.com slash twit2.  Give it a try.  I think you will like it.  All kinds of books.  Fiction, non-fiction, classic, sci-fi, self-help.  There's books for teens and young adults.  There's books for little kids, too.

We thank them so much for their support.  So Mark Zuckerberg said, I'm not going to go see the social network.  He said, I'll never see that.  Yeah, big talk.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it was a big talk.  Apparently, he shut down the Facebook offices,  bought out a theater so they wouldn't see him cry,  and took the entire Facebook story.  He took the entire Facebook staff of 400 or 500 people to see the movie.  I think that's kind of interesting.  Did they boo?  Well, we don't know because there's no spy in there,  but this is an article published by Lucy McDonald,  showbiz correspondent for Sky News.  She says, Jesse Eisenberg, who plays Mark in the film,  has a cousin who's a senior staffer at Facebook, of all things,  and is close to Mark.  Afterwards, he emailed Jesse to say Mark really liked the parts of the movie  he agreed with.  This is a quote, this is actually Aaron Sorkin talking.  So we don't know.  We don't know what he agreed with,  and I think everybody knows that there are things in the movie  that never happened.

They used both the fact that where you change the frame rate  and you keep the voices exactly the same so it sounds natural,  and then they also pull frames out to give it kind of a more hectic quality.  It's funny you should say that.  It's actually a three-hour movie.

You're not inside the bubble.  Great movie.  Well written, well shot, all that.  Very nice story.  If you were going to it,  wanting to see the story of Facebook.  Well, like many Hollywood movies,  you're not really going to see that.  There's a lot of gaping holes in it and Sorkin modified things to make a good story.  And he made a good story.  But it's not a biography.  It's not as true to the Facebook situation as, you know,  I put it on Twitter.  It's like as the lion in winter is to Henry the second,  the social network is to Mark Zuckerberg.

Transcript:  We started talking about it.  I didn't get to finish this.  I mentioned that the download thing,  but they also added Facebook groups.  We've been using groups, as I said.  But there is a flaw in groups,  which a number of people pointed out,  is that anybody can add you to a group.  Well, not anybody.  Any of your friends can add you to a group.  Somebody added Jason Calacanis to a group called NAMBLA.  Not the same NAMBLA.  Not the National Association for Man Boy Love,  but a group created specifically for the purpose of embarrassing people.  Now, this is a problem because Jason added,  I think he was like me with Facebook originally,  he added anybody who has to be a friend.  So he has the 5,000 friends, the limit.  Obviously, they're not really friends.  Facebook's point of view is, look,  if you make somebody your friend,  that means you trust them enough to not add you to groups  you shouldn't be added to.  And therein lies the rub.  Not only that, once you get added to a group,  you get a ton of email from that group.  Are you on Facebook, John?  Because I tried to find you so I could add you to a group.  Sorry, no.  Damn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only groups I've been added to were by you.  So you didn't get it.  Thanks, Leo.  No, because about a year or so ago,  I changed how I use Facebook  because I saw them starting to integrate this data into more and more places.  I said, I can't use this as an open,  like, I'll let anyone follow me, I'll follow anyone sort of situation.  It's becoming too personal, not by my own choice,  but by the way Facebook is saying, we're going to use your contact list.  We're going to make it integrated into this and that.  And I'm like, wait a minute, I don't want that.  So I went through and I purged my friend list of anyone that I didn't actually know.  And most people understood it.  A few people got their nose bent out of shape.  But after I explained like, hey, it's nothing against you.  I'm just the way Facebook is using this data now, I need to make sure I protect it.  And I'm glad I did that because now with this groups thing,  I haven't been added to any groups because I'm not like Kalkanis  where he's got everybody that he can possibly up to the 5,000 person max follow.  And so, so far, my friends have not been that funny.

Start time: 5016.75
End time: 5097.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I...  Well, that killed the show.  Well, no, I'm just thinking about this whole idea.  You know, this is, I think the reason Facebook does this is because there's a lot more.  Well, first of all, remember that Google presentation they did in Europe where it said,  here's the problem with friends is that there isn't just one monolithic group of friends.  There's different kinds of friends.  There's coworkers, there's people you went to school with,  there's people you hang out at the bars with, there's different kinds of friends.  And perhaps these groups don't really, shouldn't really overlap.  If you're a school teacher, for instance, and you have some of your students are friends  because you want to mentor them,  you may not want to have pictures of you at the bar sent to them.  So I think Facebook realizing that they needed to address this issue  because the way it is on Facebook up to now has been you're either a friend or not, right?  There's no...  So they made friends lists, but then Mark Zuckerberg quite rightly realized  nobody ever wants to make lists.  That's a pain in the ass.  So they created these groups.  And I think the groups actually do exactly what they wanted  because you don't have to do all the work.  Your friends can help add people to the groups.  The groups kind of form themselves naturally.  And now you can have a group of school chums  that sees pictures that are different from the group of bar mates.  And I think that's a good way to do it.  I just think that they have to tweak it a little bit  because it is sending a lot of email and maybe a little bit of a surprise.

Transcript:  I mean, I dealt with this a while ago.  I did a very similar thing,  which was that I deleted everybody who wasn't an actual friend or family from Facebook.  And that was most of my friends were colleagues.  And I decided I'd put people who were colleagues on LinkedIn,  make it seem to me there, and anybody who wanted to deal with me in public on Twitter.  So I just used three different services.  And on Facebook, it's totally friends and family.  Because I think this dividing into groups is just way too complicated.  Okay, I'm bound to accidentally send a picture of me completely drunk to all my coworkers.  Well, we don't have to ask what Facebook's motivation is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's all of them at once, not it's an all or nothing proposition.  Well, you can quit a group.  You can quit a group, but I think you can block and say, don't ever add me to a group.  But you can't say, allow me to approve every group before I'm added to it.  If you're added to a group by a friend, you're added.  I wish you could do that. Yeah, they really need a setting for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've been through that with email, right, with email lists.  Getting added to them or actually opting into them.  I think Facebook probably ought to make this an opt-in thing where you say,  do you want to be part of this group? And you confirm it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Already there's kind of an interesting use of this.  There is a Robert Scoble started a couple of groups, one called tech leaders and influencers,  and one called tech news bloggers.  And Facebook responded to these criticisms within the tech news bloggers.  I mean, what a great way for Facebook to go right to the people who are talking about this issue.  Were they members or were they just spying on the group?  That's a good question. I presume they were. That's a very good question.  I'm going to presume that they didn't violate any rules when they actually were asked to join the group.  Maybe they asked Robert, hey, can you add me to the group so I can respond to it?  But it was actually, they said, well, you know, here's our thinking.  Here's something we've never heard from Facebook before.  Here's why we implemented it this way.  And they said, we think it's kind of like an email list or email.  You don't ask to be added to email. You just, you know, you get an email, somebody, you know, an email thread,  and somebody adds you to the thread, you cc'd, and then you're part of that thread.  I'm not sure I agree with their logic, but what I found interesting was that they had thought about this quite a bit  and tried to figure out what's the best way to implement it.  And you can imagine how difficult it is to implement something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

It's reported that they talked about ways of partnering and then somebody somewhere speculated that maybe they talked about buying  because, well, there's one way of partnering is Microsoft buys Adobe.  And then it just all went off from there.

They've done some small acquisitions that they haven't made a big deal about, but there hasn't been anything newsworthy that they've acquired all year long.  Maybe they're saving up for Adobe. I don't know.

Start time: 5340.56
End time: 5348.00

The folks who do Angry Birds, Rovio, Rovio Mobile, which is a Finnish company,  observed in Microsoft Ad, an online ad copy, where they were showing icons for apps, the Angry Birds icon.  Rovio said, hey, they didn't ask our permission. We aren't currently developing for Windows Phone 7.  We don't know if we will develop for Windows Phone 7.  We think it's foul play to show the Angry Birds icon in an ad for Windows Phone 7.  I kind of agree. This is the hottest app on iPhone, on iPad, and now on Android.  And this is obviously Microsoft saying, hey, we got that too, but they don't.  They tweeted, they are not presently committed to bringing the game to Windows Phone.  And the icon is being used in Microsoft marketing completely without permission.

Whatever you do when you have this surfboard, you're, I don't know. Anyway.  Surfer, we call it. You mean windsurfer?  You windsurfer, world class.  So anyway, he brings up the story about Microsoft because he's getting advertisements for the first few issues.  And the Microsoft guy comes in and he says, here's the ads I want to put in. I want this ad, this ad, and this ad I want on page four.  And so the guy says, okay, well, this is going to cost. No, no, no, we're not going to pay for these ads.  And he says, what do you mean you're not going to pay for these ads?
