And are you using Uh-huh right now, Phil?  He is! Look at that!  I am, I know. Yep.  I played with it.  I was lucky enough to get an invite.  Well, I think it might have something to do with knowing you.  But I got to play with it last night.  It's so much fun.  It's a virtual backdrop, but it also gives you over-the-shoulder graphics.  You can also do weird things to yourself, like make yourself translucent and make  yourself smaller.  So you're actually not in a blue room.

I love some of the environments you have.  There's a brick wall.  There's kind of an industrial space.  There's bookshelves.  There's some really fun backgrounds.  And there's also just plain backgrounds like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Isn't that the truth?  Stacey just moved and is slowly upgrading her place.  Let's talk TikTok because that's one of the stories, Louise, you've been covering.  And it's a very interesting story.  This week, TikTok, a number of things happened.  One, because of iOS.  It was a big week for TikTok.  The first story was when iOS 14 became more widespread in its public beta.  People started noticing that TikTok was snooping on their clipboard.  And the fear was that it was actually trying to see passwords and things like that.

Start time: 457.92
End time: 492.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  So that was the fear.  And TikTok actually put out this really long technical post explaining that the reason  for that is that it was an anti-spam measure.  According to them, they are not storing that clipboard data.  And they're basically just looking to see, are you copying and pasting the same comment  basically over and over again onto a video?  Or are you just putting that comment on every single video you see, et cetera?  But I think because of all of the other stuff going on with TikTok, this particular issue  kind of raised a lot of fears for people.  And they shut it off basically immediately.

Start time: 492.86
End time: 561.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the companies doing this have got to get together on their stories, though,  because LinkedIn also got busted.  And their excuse was what?  They had a different reason.  It was due to a software bug.  But they said the same thing.  But we don't read it.  We don't store it. We don't save it.  LinkedIn is now the target of a class action lawsuit from people.  There were a total, I think, of 56 applications caught doing this.  But honestly, now, I could see, I understand why people would assume the worst with TikTok.  It's owned by a Chinese company.  There's always been a lot of concern that it might be a spy tool.  We're going to get to some more stories from other people who are worried about that.  But LinkedIn is a Microsoft company.  I don't think it seems likely that LinkedIn would take the reputational risk of doing this  if they were to get caught.  Phil, you've overseen a lot of software development.  How is it that this particular bug could get into at least 56 applications?  I'm going to guess it's many, many more that we're going to discover that are doing this.

Start time: 562.90
End time: 577.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's notable that all of these bugs that are super creepy,  potentially privacy-varying bugs, they'll go in that direction.  You rarely hear a bug where a company is like, oh, due to a bug, we're not snooping on you.

Start time: 578.68
End time: 584.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good point.  You know, we wanted to snoop on you, but we don't seem to be able to.  Yeah, it's a bug. We just can't do it.

Start time: 586.64
End time: 594.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I was on LinkedIn literally today and I saw this ad, which...

Start time: 594.74
End time: 598.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Phil, explore irrelevant opportunities with Irvin's salted egg.

Start time: 599.75
End time: 670.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  What is that?  Right. So now I'm not looking for a job right now, but this is my favorite brand.  Irvin's salted egg is my favorite brand of salted eggy fish skins.  And I literally like ate a crate of them last time I was in Singapore.  It's a real thing.  So how did they know that?  Well, exactly. So probably they bought my credit card data because I've never said anything about it.  Oh, interesting.  But they probably bought, you know, I probably bought some with a credit card in Singapore  and they probably bought my credit card data and use it to serve up this ad.  Now, look, if my company were to get acquired, I hope it gets acquired by Irvin's salted egg.  So maybe I would explore opportunities there, but it's creepy, right?  And so I'm 99% confident that the, you know, the cut and paste bug really was a bug.  But when you put it in this environment with all this other like creepy stuff that they're doing intentionally,  you know, it's hard to say for sure.  And I think it erodes trust and confidence in these companies, even, you know, even when they're innocent of any sort of intentional malfeasance.  Yeah.  Those things.  Really? But they're actually potato chips.  No, no, no. Yeah.  Chips are for the for the amateur American market.  You need the fish skins.

End time: 678.38

Start time: 687.84
End time: 704.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was ready for like one of those eggs called that are banned in the U.S.  Those chocolate eggs.  The UK. I was ready for like the Cadbury, the Cadbury cream eggs.  Yeah, exactly. We can't have them in the U.S.  because they're a choking hazard because they have like little toys inside.

Start time: 704.98
End time: 711.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the green one.  All right. Sorry. Orange and white.  What are they? I used to bring them to my kid.  Kindred.  Kindred. Yes.

Start time: 713.10
End time: 719.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Lord.  Because they have toys in them.  And of course, that does sound kind of dangerous.

Start time: 720.40
End time: 725.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  They are small toys, but most kids, I feel like you're smart enough  not to eat the Kinder egg.

Start time: 726.06
End time: 729.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you knew the Kinder egg had a toy in it.  Right.

Start time: 729.76
End time: 760.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know how like in the U.S.  and you buy like a pack of Q-tips for one of my tweet about this.  It says don't eat them. Yeah.  It says like, don't put them in your ear for the love of God.  Do not put these anywhere near your ear. Right.  But that's what you do with Q-tips.  But you go to any other country and like Q-tip packaging is like photos  of people blissfully putting them in their ears.  Yeah, because that's obviously what you're supposed to do with them.  Except like other countries are like, well, you know, when our citizens  put stuff in their ear holes and it starts to hurt, they don't push it any further.  But Americans can't trust it to do that.

Start time: 760.78
End time: 772.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it more it has to do with class action lawsuits.  And yeah, quite likely. Yeah.  Yeah. Lawyers are saying, look, if you say on the box, don't put it in your ear  and they put it in their ear.  We're off the hook. It's on them.

Start time: 774.68
End time: 775.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God.

Start time: 775.44
End time: 785.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to ask about is it the the the bugs, all of this?  Is it both is it a software reuse thing?  I mean, that's what my yes, that's yes.

Start time: 786.78
End time: 789.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's exactly what it is.  That's what I suspected. Yeah.

Start time: 789.80
End time: 792.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a Google SDK feature that I had used.

Start time: 794.06
End time: 795.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go. Oh, yeah.

Start time: 795.82
End time: 814.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, that's exactly what I really encourage.  If you want to know more about this, I thought the TikTok post, like, you know,  obviously they're trying to exonerate themselves, but I thought that the  technical explanation of like how this got into the app and what they were using  it for, like, was pretty clear and made a lot of sense.  Because when you hear like copying clipboard, it's really scary.

Start time: 815.54
End time: 866.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think this is this is why I think you one, you can't expect your engineers  to be like they're solving a problem, right?  They're like, oh, I need to do this.  Here's the easiest, fastest way to do this.  You need to have someone whose job it is.  Sure, they should think about the other thing, but someone needs to come in and say,  hey, what are all the ramifications of this?  What is the worst that could happen?  Because a lot of companies, I don't think they think that way because they're  they're optimistic. They're they're Silicon Valley tech companies.  Half of them are like trying to do good and change the world.  The other half are probably a little bit more nefarious and, you know,  working around it. But I do think companies really,  given the heightened scrutiny and the freak out and the prominence in our lives,  really need to start having  the people who are worried about class action lawsuits.  I don't want it to go that far, but that's what they need.

Start time: 866.68
End time: 871.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Louise, what what is the intent of that Google SDK?  What is it used for?

Start time: 872.26
End time: 879.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not exactly sure.  I can pull up the post and see.  I like looked at it yesterday, but we can look more at it.

Start time: 879.50
End time: 880.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tick tock. Call it out.

Start time: 882.56
End time: 885.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they did. Yeah, they like specifically called it out.

Start time: 885.62
End time: 931.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's funny because both Stacey and I had the same thought, which is actually,  I didn't think it was like a Google SDK. I thought it was something on, you know,  stack exchange that's that the developers said, how do you do this?  And found some code, which happens all the time. Why rewrite it?  And they copied it and pasted it.  And it just turned out 56 apps copy and pasted the same code with the same.  It's not a bug, the same  odd feature that was snooping on the clipboard.  There is good reason to snoop on the clipboard.  A lot of apps do that intentionally because you might leave passwords there,  Bitcoin wallet numbers there.  There's all sorts of stuff that is very likely on your clipboard.  In fact, our sponsor, LastPass, and most other password managers clear the clipboard  pretty regularly for that very reason.  They don't want to leave passwords on the clipboard.

Start time: 932.46
End time: 942.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think, yeah, so I just looked at the post and it says  the by the integration of Google ads, SDK.  Oh, it's a SDK. OK. Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 942.56
End time: 947.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, OK. So there you go. Right.  That proves it.  That's how they knew about the egg chips.

Start time: 948.52
End time: 951.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's actually a little nefarious.  Yes. I mean, they're

Start time: 952.90
End time: 975.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's a lot nefarious. Right.  Like the outrage here shouldn't be about the particular bug.  Like, yeah, this bug was innocent in the sense, probably in the sense that  they probably weren't trying to spy on your clip on your pasteboard  and do anything nefarious with it.  But the problem is all of these things happen because of ads. Right.  Because of targeted ads. It's ad tech. Yeah.  Creepy advertising is going to eat the world.

Start time: 976.12
End time: 995.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So just to kind of dot the I and cross the T here,  you were using TikTok and for some reason on your clipboard was perhaps.  Well, no, in this case, you didn't you didn't order anything online  from Irvin Salted Egg.  The only time only information they could have gotten was from a credit card.

Start time: 996.02
End time: 1004.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But perhaps from a credit card, it's possible I texted something about it,  but I don't think so, because I'm not actually going to publicly admit  to any of my friends that I ate my weight.

Start time: 1006.72
End time: 1010.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is one problem.  I don't think I told anyone one problem with fasting is that when you get off

Start time: 1010.60
End time: 1024.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the fast, you will eat anything and a lot of and honestly, it's not that  it's not that keto friendly because it's like I think there's quite a lot of sugar  in that. I'm guessing it's delicious.  Yeah, they must have gotten my credit card, which is which is creepy.  Another place they snook up selling this.

Start time: 1024.44
End time: 1026.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, another place they snook. Right.

Start time: 1026.52
End time: 1028.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is the creepiest data. Yeah.

Start time: 1029.00
End time: 1042.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's actually kind of funny and interesting that LinkedIn  would even think that there would necessarily be a correlation.  I mean, maybe there is for a lot of people, but like, I don't think necessarily  most of the stores that I frequent with my credit card purchases  are places that I want to work.

Start time: 1043.04
End time: 1076.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is exactly what's wrong with this ad tech.  And we all know this is these ad recommendations are always  hilariously inaccurate, right?  So they made a mechanical connection between the fact that you bought  a lot of Irvin Salted Eggs.  They made that connect, which are dangerously addictive.  We agree. But they made that connection.  And because LinkedIn is about job hunting, they said they put it's still an ad,  but they put that two and two together and got eight.  It's just a weird.  But that's what happens all the time.

Start time: 1077.26
End time: 1085.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you know, what else is dangerously addictive is creepy advertising.  Yeah, no kidding.  Lazy business models enabled by it, which are ultimately bad for the world.

Start time: 1085.46
End time: 1112.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So just as Google used to perhaps sniff through your Gmail,  looking for keywords so that they could advertise to you.  They stopped doing that.  But now apparently they have an SDK that's worse.  It's it's snoops on your clipboard.  And then if a brand name goes by or they're not stealing your passwords,  I'm sure your Bitcoin wallet, but as as a brand name goes by  or something like that, they'll make a note of that  and they'll show you ads for that product.

Start time: 1113.88
End time: 1132.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Phil, to your exact point, I just was looking at the TikTok post  and literally it says the ubiquitous nature of third party ad programs  helps explain why so many other apps indicated similar behavior.  Yeah. So it's like, yeah, exactly.  All these apps were just caught doing advertising.  They got caught. Yeah.

Start time: 1134.78
End time: 1145.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it do you think they're doing this knowingly, like they know that Google's  scraping the clipboard, they must, right?  Or no, maybe it's maybe it's part of being in the Google ad network  that you get this code.

Start time: 1145.70
End time: 1161.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that it's like populating in a server somewhere  where they're like collecting all of it, you know, and then storing it,  you know, indefinitely or anything like that.  So I honestly think it's potentially something that they're not particularly  aware of, actually, until like, you know, this iOS notification came out.

Start time: 1162.06
End time: 1179.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So two points to come out of this one.  Thank you, Apple.  Apple's doing more and more to surface this.  Ironically, I think Apple is only doing it because their own ads failed.  So since they couldn't make money in ad tech, they said,  don't look at it for everyone else.

Start time: 1179.44
End time: 1182.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a gift horse.  Like, yeah, here's why they're doing it.

Start time: 1182.36
End time: 1254.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're doing the right thing.  Given a lemon, let's make some lemonade.  But it is a gift horse.  There's a lot of other things Apple's going to do in iOS 14.  For instance, the permission for the Apple ad ID will pop up  when you install an app.  And you can at that point, you can turn it off now in the settings.  But it's buried deep.  But you can at that point, every time you install an app, say, yeah,  don't give that app any information.  That's advertisers are terrified because that's going to be a huge loss of data.  So you're right. This is a part of the war at between ad tech and consumers.  That's disappointing.  All of the companies that were caught have said, oh, it's a bug.  We'll fix it.  In other words, we got caught.  So we're going to fix it now.  Kudos to Apple for surfacing it.  And I suspect when iOS 14 gets widely in widespread,  use, it may be we find some other companies doing the same thing.  So that was strike one against TikTok.  I don't know if it's related, but a number of companies, Wells Fargo  just said you can't put TikTok on your company phone.  Briefly, Amazon sent out a letter saying you can't use TikTok to Amazon employees.  Then they said, no, that was a mistake.  What was that about, Louise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So my understanding is from like having talked to some sources  in the last couple of days is that this was a decision that was made  like not with the Amazon's CSOs knowledge.  So basically like top like C-suite security people didn't realize this was happening.  So they basically would crawl with their pants down and this email went out.  And it looked really dumb because Amazon is a major advertiser with TikTok.  And they have been collaborating on a feature together  that lets you like shop directly on Amazon from TikTok.  So their marketing people were really mad.  I think basically immediately they got on calls with TikTok and they were like,  hey, we're so sorry about this.  It looked really bad.  But I think it is indicative of kind of the wider,  you know, concerns that people have about TikTok.  But yeah, it was really embarrassing for Amazon.  Honestly, it was obviously, you know, another nail in the coffin for TikTok  potentially, but it was a very bizarre couple of hours on Friday for me  as someone who primarily covers TikTok and Amazon.

Transcript:  They were thinking of you when they sent out that letter.  Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state this week on Fox News said,  we are thinking  we are thinking about banning TikTok, Chinese apps in general,  but especially TikTok didn't say they're going to do it.  Then they're thinking about it.  India did.  And there are a lot of Indian influencers who are very upset.  Little lesson learned there, but they built their business.  Some people over a couple of years making money on TikTok.  Now they don't have that outlet anymore.  Is so here's the question, really, is there anything to fear from TikTok?  It's a Chinese company.  They're trying to pretend they're not, for instance,  in Hong Kong, they've withdrawn from Hong Kong  because they're afraid that they would have to give information to China.  I said there's room, there's stories going around that they're trying  to get out of China somehow.  Any company that operates in China, whether it's Huawei or TikTok,  presumably is going to have to adhere to the laws of China,  which would just as in the United States,  mean that they would give information to the Chinese authorities.  Should we should we not be using Louise?  You use it?

Start time: 1409.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do use TikTok. I have to for my job, honestly.  I think that I'm not particularly more scared of TikTok than I am  any other app that relies on advertising as a business model.  I think that my threat model might be different if I were a US diplomat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, or something like that.  I don't think that there's been specific, concrete  security concerns that have been identified about this app.  And I think that anything that comes from US officials has to be viewed  kind of in the context of China, US relations, which I would,  you know, very gently say are at an all time low.  Yeah. So I think it's important to keep that in mind.  And I think that a lot of people don't really understand ByteDance,  which is the company that owns China, owns, yes, they own China,  the company that owns TikTok and kind of the role that it plays in China.  It's kind of like the Facebook of China in a lot of ways,  and very similarly to how Facebook pisses off US authorities.  ByteDance has pissed off the CCP and gotten in trouble for things like  letting what the CCP considers to be lewd content go viral.  I think that it's best to view TikTok through the lens of capitalism  and through the lens of like another big tech giant  that primarily makes its income through targeted advertising  and is incentivized to get you to spend as much time on the app as possible,  to make its features as addicting as possible.  And that is the best way to think about the risks, I think, for the average person.  But if you know, if anyone knows any specific  security concerns related to its Chinese ownership, I'm open to that.  But I don't think we've seen that.

But I do get a large whiff of xenophobia  any time that this topic comes up.  And I think a lot of the people shouting the most about it  have the least knowledge about China.  And I think that that should be kind of indicative.  But, you know, that said, I'm open minded.  I'm not, you know, I don't think I'm not here to apologize for the CCP.  But I think that, you know, they're an advertising company  that wants as much data on you as possible to serve your advertisements.

Start time: 1551.86
End time: 1580.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and to be clear.  Now, I think now we understand that the problem with these apps  isn't what you put on these apps, the content you post, the videos kids post  on TikTok, the problem is that it's on your phone  and that because it's on your phone, it has access to all sorts of information  about your location, what you're what's on your clipboard, all sorts of things.  And any I think, honestly, Phil, you can tell me you're  you're in this business.  Any app you put on your phone is very likely collecting  as much information as you'll let it.

Start time: 1583.42
End time: 1587.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's never motivated me or any of the stuff that we've built. Right.  Just because we have a philosophy that we're going to get data  that is very clearly beneficial to the end users  and we're going to explain why we're getting it.  The philosophy here is it's called beneficent design.  So the idea behind beneficent design is you make every single decision  based solely on what's in the best interest of an informed end user.  So you just say, well, if the user understood exactly what was happening,  would they be would they want this?  Would they be OK with it?  And if the answer is ever in doubt, then you just don't do it.  But yeah, a lot of and many companies operate that way.  But none of the ad supported ones do.  And I really do think it's an issue of of the targeted ad  supported business model, which puts a fundamental conflict of interest  between what the customers want and where the money comes from.  Sorry, what the users want and where the money comes from.  And when you have that, yeah, it's all sorts of all sorts of bad behavior.  So, yeah, anything anything ad supported is, I don't know, sketchy in my book.

Start time: 1657.32

Start time: 1661.10
End time: 1717.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, of course not.  But but a lot of the stuff is like that's double dipping.  You would want for for the for the end user.  Right. There's there's there's legitimate functionality.  So, for example, if, you know, in an iMessage, if you text,  if you just if it's just in iMessage, text someone, you know, where you at,  they will get an option in the order complete to just push a button  to reply with their location. Right.  Like it's doing that.  Obviously, you have to enable that the first time it's it's looking up  iMessage on the person who phone who received it is looking at their location  so that they can push the button and in one tap, you know, reply to you where you are.  Like that is a plausible thing that you can do.  Get your location and iMessage so that you can quickly communicate it.  Again, with with an opt in.  So I think like stuff like that is fine.  Those are convenience features.  But no one wants their information to be used for weird targeted advertising.  And that becomes the root of a lot of a lot of the problems.

I think it's an extremely dangerous path to go down.  We start like we start basically excluding products and companies  based on their their their national origin.  That's just not going to end well.  And it's not going to end well for American companies.

Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say for 10 years, I've been hearing about Huawei.  Because I was in the telecom industry as a reporter.  And for 10 years, I have looked in.  Yes, there was government ownership of Huawei.  There's there are things that are questionable.  But in 10 years of hunting, there has never been any proof.  And every now and then you just bring this up again and again.  So to me, I mean, the whole issue with Tick Tock and by dance,  it's similar.  And I think we're going to have to get used to this  because I think what we're seeing is lots of companies around the world,  mostly China.  They're creating products that people in the US want to consume.  And that's actually good.

Start time: 1815.24

Transcript:  That's I mean, I am so good for all of us.  I am so torn because, of course, first of all, I love China.  I was a Chinese major college.  So I don't like the jingoistic,  vaguely racist idea of, oh, those people there, we don't like them.  We don't want any of their products.  But it is the case that China has economics.  I don't think China has military designs on the world,  but they definitely have economic designs on the world.  They aren't a democratic country.  They have a president for life.  And it is certainly Huawei's behavior in other regards has sometimes been bad.  I've heard lots of stories about them wandering the aisles at trade shows  trying to snarf up intellectual property.  China does that. Many Chinese companies do that.

Start time: 1868.06

Start time: 1871.22
End time: 1899.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. OK. Yeah.  There's bad behavior on both sides. That's probably fair.  So I don't I want to rule out the jingoistic stuff.  At the same time, if you're putting Huawei gear in all of your 5G equipment  and it's software defined radio equipment,  so an update could completely change its behavior at any time.  I don't I'm not surprised that some governments would be concerned about that.  So I don't know what the right answer is.  Is that not something we should be concerned about?

Start time: 1900.32
End time: 1936.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it is so we should be concerned about that.  But if we are concerned about that, we need to be concerned about that  throughout our entire  silicon and software stack.  Absolutely. Anything with in and we're not.  And I don't think we can be.  We don't have the economic incentives in place.  So and also, I would also say we need to think about that  with regards to the phones that people who are diplomats are.  Our leaders should maybe not be on Twitter  on actual phones that they use.

Like if we decide a 5G network is strategic, which Trump certainly has,  but we still send lots of data over 3G networks.  And, you know, those are good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good point. Yeah.  And it does feel a little bit jingoistic.  It doesn't, you know, it feels like it's more an arm of trade policy  and anti China sentiment than it does actual concern about security.  I just feel for instance, we know because of the economic climate,  countries, companies that are now using China for manufacture,  chiefly Apple, are looking at other outlets.  Foxconn is apparently looking at building an Indian factory  to help Apple start to move iPhone production out of perhaps out of China.  I mean, one of the reasons you do that is because India has very steep tariffs  against products not made in India.  Never. And same reason Foxconn has a Brazilian factory.  But the most recent story implies that that Apple is moving away from China.  This comes from the times of India.  So I don't know. I don't know how credible it is.

You have to think about how you're going to inflect it, how you pronounce it.  And it's a name that you can't say thoughtlessly like every other company  name or product name they've ever seen.  You could just say it without thinking about it.  And you can't every time you say it, it's like a little micro performance.  Since the product is for performing, we thought it was cool to like it.

It's going to be some kind was Evernote your first  first freemium.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, so it'll be freemium.  There'll be a free version  and then there'll be something that you pay for.  But we haven't figured out exactly what the plan is to spend the summer in beta.  So in beta, everything's going to be free.  And we just want to work with people to do interesting things with it.  Kind of figure that out, invite more and more people into it.  And then we'll we'll go live in early fall.  And by then we would have figured all this stuff out.

There is a threat because virtual cameras don't always work like Zoom.  It comes and goes like we've used.  Snap has a virtual camera  that we that we practically had to ban from our Zoom meetings  because people were coming in as giant fish and all sorts of sorts of things.  But it it like it would work sometimes and it wouldn't work sometimes  because it seems like the software sometimes allows virtual cameras  and sometimes doesn't.  What is you probably are very intimately familiar with this issue.  What's going on?

Start time: 2681.36
End time: 2743.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, we don't.  I guess the short answer is that you only need the virtual cameras  for one of the use cases, which is the video conference meeting use case.  And there, yeah, it works.  It works great with all of the newer versions of Zoom.  They basically reintroduced virtual cameras just like a week ago.  They were shut off for a while while they made some security improvements,  but they're back.  So it works with Zoom, with Google Meet, with Microsoft Teams,  with Blue Jeans, with just about everything.  But I think the video meetings are like one use case,  but I actually think that the streaming use case is probably here.  It's just for people who want to make content, right.  In order to make presentations.  So there's there's a lot of stuff that that isn't just video meetings  that that I think people do.  So we like I feel I feel pretty good about about the state of it.  Yeah, where it works and yes, Skype, Skype, it doesn't work with.  So I've had to like I've had to seriously abuse Skype on my Mac  because it doesn't work.  Don't recommend other people do.  So are virtual cameras a security threat?

That's not a long term concept,  but you'll be able to do this sort of thing inside of any video.  Right. Presentation, you know, permanently.  And you know, we'll we'll we'll we'll navigate through it,  just like we did with Evernote and all of all of the other companies  and figure out the best ways to do it.  And, you know, for whatever year we happen to be in, you know, in 2020,  right now, it's it's virtual cameras and Zoom.  It's, you know, something else and other platforms.

So you have ambitions beyond just the Zoom era.  We're going to call this the Zoom era that we're in.  Good. Well, we do have ambitions.  We'll play with it a little bit.  Our show today brought to you by our good friends at Casper.  As as we all know, these days, it's hard to get a good night's sleep.  Too much doom scrolling.  You got to get off the doom scrolling, Louise.  If you have a nice mattress, maybe it'd be a little easier to get to sleep.  Casper really innovated on this direct consumer model,  realized early on that the biggest problem in mattress buying is the mattress store.  That's where all the markup happens.  If if only you could sell direct to customers.  The problem is people like to sleep on their mattresses before they buy.  Casper came up with a brilliant idea.  Sure, then we'll give you a 100 night risk free trial.  If at any time in the first 100 nights you decide you don't like your Casper,  they'll come and get it, refund you every penny.  There's no risk at all.  But I got to tell you, I don't think it happens very often.  These Casper mattresses are phenomenal.  My first Casper was the original Casper.  They still sell it, combines multiple supportive memory foams  for a quality sleep surface, just the right amount of sink and bounce.  It's breathable design lets you sleep cool.  That's really important.  Hot summer night. If you can sleep cool, you're going to sleep much, much better.  The original mattress now has 20,000 reviews across Casper, Amazon and Google  and an average of 4.8 stars.  That's how much people love Casper.  It's becoming the Internet's favorite mattress.  I'm sleeping on my new Casper, the hybrid.  They actually have a number of new models, the Wave,  which features a patent-pended premium support system  to mirror the natural shape of your body.  The Essential is great for low cost.  It has a streamlined design at a price that won't keep you up at night.  Great for a guest bedroom, a student, that kind of thing.  And then I'm on the hybrid right now with my kitty cat, Sammy.  The hybrid combines the pressure relief of the award winning foam  with durable yet gentle springs.  They also have great pillows.  I love my Casper King size pillow.  They have wonderful sheets.  The Casper Glow Lamp.  You can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100 night risk free sleep on it trial.  They also offer free shipping and painless returns to the US and Canada.  And right now we're going to get you one hundred dollars off select mattresses.  If you go to Casper.com slash twit one and using the promo code  twit one at checkout Casper dot com slash twit one.  Some terms and conditions apply.  Don't forget to use the offer code twit and the number one at checkout  to get that hundred dollar credit twit and the number code one.  I love my Casper. You will too.  A good night's sleep.

I'm just looking at all of the stories we could talk about.  I love those TikTok stories.  Did you ever try fill the magic leap?  I did, yeah.  Why do I feel like we talked about this before?  What did you think of it?

Transcript:  The people who tried Magic Leap loved it.  And I remember talking to Amy Webb.  She said, you just don't get it, Steven Levy.  You just don't get it if you just could try it.  If you knew. And I'm not talking about this is the developer version  that they put out last year.  I'm not talking about that, but the actual real magic leap  apparently was something amazing.  Maybe they oversold it a little bit on their website.  Remember the school gym with a giant whale coming splashing?  They might have oversold it a little bit,  but they were apparently trying something very different.  A technology that was much more effective than other augmented reality glasses.  The problem is it just took them too long.  They raised almost two billion dollars.  They spent years developing this thing.  I think there was some problem, I suspect, in getting it portable enough  to be really useful.  Company almost went out of business earlier this year.  They were ready to lay off half their employees,  got an urgent round of additional funds,  three hundred fifty million dollars from the original investors.  Now they have a new CEO.  And, OK, I realize this is total conspiracy theory.  But the new CEO comes from Microsoft.  She was there doing biz dev at Microsoft for six years.  Maybe she just wanted a new challenge.  Magic Leap is struggling.  Maybe she just thought it'd be, you know, here's an opportunity  either to turn it around and become a hero.  And if I don't, nobody's going to blame me because it's already kind of fallen apart.  I have another theory, and this has happened once before with Microsoft.  A Microsoft executive, Stephen Elop, left Microsoft  because he didn't look like he was going to get to be CEO  and went to a company called Nokia, which Microsoft eventually acquired  for billions of dollars.  Remember, Microsoft is in the same business with their HoloLens.  Am I nuts, Stacey, thinking that this may be the first move  in an acquisition of Magic Leap?

Transcript:  Why would Microsoft need?  I mean, maybe it's if they could get it cheap.  I mean, I've I've done Magic Leap and I've done HoloLens.  Both are good. And HoloLens has actual customers and use cases  that Microsoft can charge a lot of money for.  I don't know if it needs Magic Leap.  And yeah, I think the Nokia deal was not one off, but it was certainly nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But other other people leave  biggest likes.  If you look at Cisco departures, you're going to see lots of acquisitions  from the companies that their executives went to start.  So I don't think that's like it's not conspiracy.  It's just, you know what, you know.

Transcript:  All right. Maybe I'm nuts.  I don't know.  The only way this makes sense is if Magic Leap has some secret sauce,  which many people have said they do, that is better than HoloLens.  It's certainly got to be better than that.  That Magic Leap one headset, which I have tried.  That was silly.  That wasn't it wasn't it was roughly the same as a HoloLens.  But I think HoloLens is kind of silly, too.  I don't think that's the end game.  Louise, do you have an opinion on these  AR glasses? Do you want some?

Transcript:  I just have never gotten into it.  And I feel like the pandemic would have been the perfect moment  for them to really take off.  I don't know if we're just like not ready for this tech yet,  if it's not mobile enough.  But I mean, I'm, you know, curious and would be interested  to kind of delve deeper into some of this tech as it gets, you know,  more mainstream.  But for now, it's just like, I don't know, it's not something I gravitate towards.  And I think that a lot of Americans feel the way that I do.

Start time: 3343.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I feel the way that you do.  I haven't even with virtual reality.  I have a lot of friends who are big VR fans.  Even our 17 year old spends a lot of time wearing his Vive with his buddies  playing weird, you know, Beat Saber and things like that.  But does it give him vertigo?

Start time: 3365.34
End time: 3403.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So I actually think there's a there's a different angle on this.  And this was one of one of our inspirations behind.  And is, you know, I thought  and I spent like 20 years  and I've talked to you about this a lot, Leo, like fantasizing about all  of the use cases that we're going to build when we finally have like a  headsets that are small as normal glasses and imagine  all of the amazing functionality that we can have when we're walking around  with these these ubiquitous AR glasses.  And then we just realized, you know, a few weeks ago and a few weeks  into the lockdown that like, well, now we all have giant AR glasses.  They're just our big monitors.

Start time: 3404.90
End time: 3407.52

Transcript:  True. That is our window to the world, isn't it?

Start time: 3407.72
End time: 3432.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And so we just started like implementing a bunch of the fantasy  use cases that that I was saving for 10 years from now.  Kind of thought, well, maybe now is actually a good time to do it.  Interesting. Staring at monitors.  So let's let's bring out those creative AR ideas and just stick them into monitors.  And yeah, it's actually a pretty  I think there's a lot of there's a lot of ideas to be mined in that way.  It's definitely like the first version of that.  And there's a bunch more stuff.

Start time: 3433.18
End time: 3452.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's really interesting.  I think I agree with you, Elise, if these were ready.  Anything like this, we're ready.  This would be a perfect time.  Although I think a lot of what AR as opposed to VR, what AR is going to do  is give you information as you operate in the world.

Start time: 3453.38
End time: 3493.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think one thing we've seen, which is actually really fascinating,  is that people like AR not on the outside world as much, not yet, at least.  But they actually like it on themselves. Right.  Like the biggest form of AR that everyone uses all the time is Snapchat filters,  TikTok filters.  So I think that reverse. Yeah.  There's this idea of like, oh, we want to put the glasses on, you know,  be able to like look at things and get information.  I think that actually might be really useful, especially for like something  like Google Maps, like, you know, being told, like, just make a right here.  That's so much better than just staring at your phone.  But it's interesting that so far what's been really big has been filters.  That's like the biggest AR application, I would say.  That's like the most mainstream.

Start time: 3493.30

And I have been playing like crazy because I can't shop right now  for things like I need a lamp because there are no lights in my house.  So I'm like sitting here using the AR function on a lot of the shopping sites  to see the furniture in my room, which I used to think was the stupidest thing  in the world. But now it is like, OK, it is not saving me, but it is actually quite helpful.  So I've been using that.  And then I'll just say, as someone who has played with AR in factory settings,  I think there is a huge opportunity for like home repair that people could be using right now.  Like I would love like, again, I bought a like a 50 year old house.  So I'm like sitting here. I wish there were like the AR videos I've tried for like wiring,  like airplane engines, because those are the kind of demos I get to do.  I wish I could bring that to my like fixing the leak in my sink.  And I think that would be kind of awesome.  And I think the quarantine is probably a really good time for stuff like that.  I don't know.

Transcript:  All right. If the technology were ready, I think that's a part of the problem.  One of the reasons Magic Leap ran out of runway is it's harder to do this stuff.  So one of the big stories this week comes from the information.  According to the information, Apple is working with Foxconn, their big manufacturing arm,  to develop semi-transparent lenses for AR glasses.  And they're actually in trial production.  They're literally making thousands of these.  According to the information, the lenses are one to two years away from mass production,  but they are making them for testing and so forth.  So this confirms a story that Mark Gurman had,  who's also a great Apple rumor distributor over at Bloomberg.  He said that Apple will have a VR-like pair of glasses in 2021.  And in 2022 or 2023, they will have actual spectacles that are AR spectacles.  Phil, does this match what you've been hearing?

Transcript:  I have a hard time thinking about technology advancements in the abstract.  I prefer to think of what are the actual use cases that are going to be magical?  What do we want to do?  So when we're thinking about AR, it's easy to think about, okay,  if I had this AR headset that I was on all the time, well, how would it improve meetings,  for example?  And we actually designed a bunch of storyboards and features about what we would do to make  meetings better with AR headsets. This was even back in Never Note Times.  But now all of my meetings are looking at a monitor.  I can take some of those ideas of how would we make meetings better if we had ambient,  always-on information, and we could just apply them.  We don't need AR. Our actual reality has moved into big monitors for at least the next  months or a couple of years, or at least a large part of it will be.  So I think it's really interesting to take the use cases that we've been storyboarding and designing  for AR and just see, okay, well, now that our reality has moved online so much,  how do we just introduce this? And we don't need the headset anymore.  I've got a 37-inch monitor strapped to the front of my face for 14 hours a day now.  It all just kind of works. And then once we have those use cases figured out, whether they be in  entertainment or home repair or improving meetings or productivity or how we communicate,  eventually, sure, we'll be getting out of the house more and more again. And hopefully by then  we'll have better AR headsets and hardware and we can port some of those use cases over to it.  The problem I had with Magic Leap, for example, was always that it was shockingly cool. I loved  using it, but I never heard of, well, okay, well, what are the actual use cases?  Other than a couple of ones that everyone talked about, which was training neurosurgeons. For some  reason, there was always like, well, you can use it to train brain surgeons.

Transcript:  It's like, I think, Leo, you and I are roughly the same age. I think, or maybe exactly.  When I was growing up, when personal computers first started becoming a thing,  there wasn't really a lot of commercial software yet. The computer manufacturers would always sell  you the idea that if you buy this Atari computer, you can use it to, there's always two use cases,  always balance your checkbooks and store your recipes. It was always like balance your checkbook  and store your recipes. Both categories have died by the way they know. I'm still not sure what  balancing a checkbook means. I don't think I've ever done it. But those were the two things.  For AR, it was always like, yeah, you can use it to train brain surgeons.  That is the balance your checkbook and store your recipes.

North, which made the Focal 1 glasses and was working on the Focal 2 glasses,  just got acquired, or it's more like an Aqua hire, by Google. But those were glasses that  actually were real. We had a review on Hands-on Technology. Anthony Nielsen, one of our producers,  loves them. That was just notifications. It is a heads-up display. It was just putting notifications  on. That's the most obvious use, is an adjunct to your phone.

Transcript:  There's a really cool pair of smart glasses made by Jinz in Japan. These are normal glasses,  but these are by Jinz. Jinz is just this really cool Japanese eyewear company.  They have smart glasses that don't have any display. They just have a bunch of sensors.  Including by, there's a sensor, and they look totally like normal glasses. You can't tell  there's anything. It's a new generation. It just looks like glasses. There's a sensor that goes on  the bridge of your nose. By basically measuring what's going on with the bridge of your nose,  they can detect all sorts of stress, emotion, focus, fatigue. There's a next generation of that.  This is the old generation. Maybe the next generation is an out yet. Maybe it is.  Oh, look. I see. This is the Jinz Meme ES.  This, and there's a new generation of that either out or coming out, I think.  It's really cool. Again, it's a different direction. It's not AR at all. There's actually no display,  but it can do all sorts of things about telling you about your posture, your focus,  your concentration, how fatigued you are. We've been focusing a lot on the immersive displays  because those are sexier, but honestly, the first gen, even the second gen of these wearables,  is probably the sensors are going to be more important than the display capabilities.

Transcript:  Yeah, that was too soon. I'm with Phil on this because we were testing the Echo frames,  and I don't think many of us need Madame A on their face. If you're that kind of person,  it was really helpful just to say something and there's something always on you that is  receptive to that. You look at what Apple's announcing with their AirPods and their monitors  and things like being able to adjust your hearing to what you're seeing on the monitor. I can't  remember, but basically tying your emotions to things that are happening around you. Using that  sort of sensor or sensor fusion just to say, hey, I think this is happening with this person. Let me  make their life a little bit better by tweaking something. I think that's going to be far more  exciting than superimposing the internet in front of us, in front of the real world. Because that's  kind of a crappy thing to want to do all the time. So you see them, and by the way, these are my fine

In fact, I went back in my Snapchat account and I found all  the videos I shot four years ago and then never did any more with these. I think that that's an  interesting approach. It kind of goes along with what you were saying, Louise. It's more inward  than outward. It's more about life log, what do they call it when you write all the information  down about what you're doing? Life logging? Like life logging or the quantified self, that kind of  thing. Maybe that's what we want. That's kind of what these gens do, right? They're kind of looking

Yeah,  we were hacking around on them to make some apps for them. And it's like a lot of things. The  product itself is early, but it's a really magical experience to have very high quality,  personal audio that doesn't cover your ears at all. And it's very interesting social signaling.  Like people won't see your ears covered. So they're more likely to talk to you.  You know, I know I only vaguely remember interacting with other people like in the same room.  So like none of this stuff, I think makes sense in the, in the lockdown world, but you know,  hopefully soon we'll again, we'll be out of our apartments again. And that kind of stuff will make  sense. But again, the Bose ones are very cool and no display, just sensors and speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  mean, that's, that's, I think it's just tech driven. Like, I mean, I think what it is, is we're,  thanks to really cheap sensors, right, you've got amazing ability to process, you've got,  you know, on the device, we can do it. You've got everybody carries a freaking supercomputer that  they can connect via Bluetooth to this. And you're like, wait, what can you do with this? Right. And  I don't, I mean, I'm really excited. Like you can tell, like, if you stick a  earphone out and it's talking to somebody from Bose, and they were like, you can get galvanic  skin response, you can get heart rate information that's super accurate.  We got into this whole metaphysical conversation about like how everybody's hearing is different.  And so what if you like the perception of the world that people have, you could actually  change their perspective slash perception a little bit by, you know, tweaking the way they hear the  world. And I don't I mean, if you're a researcher studying this, that's fascinating. Of course,  you're going to try to build something that takes advantage of that.

They're in pre-order mode,  where it's a tabletop game. You're wearing these spectacles, you have this, this wand,  and you can play games that on the table in front of you, that kind of come to life a little bit  like Microsoft showed with the Minecraft on the table with a HoloLens. This is kind of an interesting  slant on it as well. I feel like everybody's kind of nibbling around the edges of this,  but nobody has yet found the killer app. Maybe it'll be you, Phil.

Transcript:  That's quite likely. Yeah.  You know, what these things are is yeah, like a lot of our tech driven, a lot of our company driven,  but very few of them are user driven. Well, that's my question. Yeah.  These aren't user centric designs. This is the textbook definition of

Start time: 4296.88

What is the magical  experience for the end user? Right. And a lot of companies don't get around to that until they put  a decade of R and D work into it. And then there's just need to like shove something out the door.  Rarely is successful. Go ahead, Louise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just going to say that I think that's totally right. This is not user centric. I think that  there's a huge race to sell people the next personal tech item, right? There's kind of been all of this  fuss in the last couple of years about smart speakers, about things like that, that you  could have in your home. There was kind of the whole rush about AirPods and the next generation  of headphones. But if there's going to be another device like glasses that we're going to take  everywhere with us, that would be huge. So I think that there's a really big push for like,  let's sell you another form of hardware that you're going to need all the time.  And it seems natural, right? Like it's not very good to have a phone neck. I think we would all  love a kind of technology where you're looking straight, right? And it like actually integrates  the world because like your cell phone doesn't integrate with the world. Well, it sucks to  walk around looking down at your phone and trying to get where you're going or answer messages,  etc. But I don't know if anybody really asked for glasses. It just seems like the natural step.  And it'll be really up to these companies to see. But everyone's doing it, right? It's like even  Apple has these glasses now. I mean, Amazon has these glasses now that they're working on too.

The same thing.  And it's like, it seems like getting rid of all those weird, you know, movable arms would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would break it up just a little bit. Users love and need their screen. And but I think that's  actually a mistake. I feel like we're like, you need the screen, right, the Uber, the television,  but you can't put a screen on your glasses, which is where a lot of things have been kind  of focused, right? But when we actually try that as people were like, yes, for certain jobs. So  maybe if you're an Uber driver, but I think most of us probably, maybe I'm crazy, don't want to  walk around looking at the screen. No, that's why we want something either in spectacles or in our

I never want to but if you use Apple Maps,  the directions show up on your watch while you're driving or better yet, even while you're walking.  That's really useful.

Like it's like,  you know, you never meet anyone who doesn't have a smartphone anymore. But, you know, if you have an  Apple watch, it's like, okay, cool. You have an Apple watch. It's not like out of the ordinary,  but I can count, you know, my friends on one hand probably that use their Apple watch every day.

But yeah, that's, I mean, that's more than I would have  expected, but it's still pretty small. I mean, maybe it's failed because it's too small. It's not,

Start time: 4612.58
End time: 4664.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to product design that like that, that I've seen that I've tried to be involved with. And both of  them kind of take it to the extreme generally produce pretty crappy results. There's like,  there's the, there's a design that is very user centric. That's specifically about solving like  real problems, often problems that are actually so common that they're, they're hard to see  because everyone just kind of takes them for granted. And you just solve those problems and  you don't care if the resulting product is like ugly or anything like that. And like the ultimate  example of that is like, I don't know, like the cup phone, this thing that you see, like advertise  all the time. Yeah. The weather tech cup phone. I actually bought one. Right. First of all,  it's not a cup phone. It's a phone cup. Just let's get that straight. But second of all,  like obviously that wasn't designed because somebody was like, okay, people are looking  for something else to shove into their cup. Right. No, but it was a real problem. Like people

Start time: 4664.62
End time: 4674.80

Start time: 4676.46
End time: 4785.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this. Okay. Sorry. No, no disrespect to weather tech or whoever it's an it's the product is ugly.  It's got a stupid name. It's all of them. And I'm sure they're making totally solves like a real  problem. And this is like great user centric design. The opposite example of the, and it was like,  I'm not sure how much they spent on R and D, but I'm guessing it was like not hundred zero.  Right. And the opposite example of that is some of this like very tech driven stuff. It's the, the,  the AR headsets. It's things that are entirely driven by a company thinking, okay, we need to  capitalize on this, on this tech trend. It's not solving any problem. No one asked for it.  They're spending a lot of, of, of a lot of money on research and design. And often what's,  what's produced is like amazingly impressive and like thoughtful and sometimes beautiful,  but it's not user centric. Right. Right. And like the best products are in the Venn diagram  intersection of those two things where it's like you've identified an actual real problem,  often a problem that is so common that no one else is even talking about it because we all have it.  Therefore it's hard to even point out. And then you apply like, okay, just enough technology to  solve it in an elegant way in a way that couldn't have been solved a few years ago, but you're not  like, you're not bending over backwards to use the newest technology. Like that, that's what we try  to do. That's what we try to do with, you know, with this product with, we said like all of us  right now hate being on video meetings 14 hours a day. It's really tiresome. It's boring. Okay.  That's a real problem. That is like, that is the cup phone problem, but let's try to solve that in  a way that's like a little bit more elegant than, you know, and so like it's that Venn diagram  intersection that we're, that we're always striving for. And very often in a bunch of these other  projects like magic lead, like they were way on one side of the spectrum or that's a good point.

I'll find some more meat you can sink your teeth into in just a little bit.  But first a word from Worldwide Technology. Last trip, I'll always remember this is the last trip  I took before shelter in place. We went out to St. Louis to visit with Worldwide Technology and  I was actually blown away. This is a company that does enterprise technology for big and medium  sized companies. They help them integrate it. They help them solve problems. And they're amazing.  They're amazing. Their advanced technology center, we saw that was incredible.  WWT, that's the initials, one of the top technology solution providers in the world,  delivering business and technology outcomes to large private and public organizations all over  the globe. They're really in the business of digital transformation. One of the ways they  support organizations with this is helping them adopt a multi-cloud architecture. And this is  something a lot of people want. Everybody knows we're moving to the cloud, but multi-cloud, the  idea of multi-cloud is, well, I don't want to be dependent on any one vendor, but of course,  it's complex. So you need a partner who understands this, who can help you implement it, who can get  it working for you. And that's WWT. They stay with their customers, with their organizations,  every step of the way from the vision and the strategy to the enablement, to the migration,  to the optimization, to the management, all the way and everything in between.  Their cloud consultants will sit down with you, formulate a vision and a strategy,  because they know you've got to do that upfront. One of the things WWT is brilliant on is process.  They spend a lot of energy and time studying process and figuring out what's the best way  to do this. They know that investments in these cloud architectures only pay off if they align  to your business goals, for instance. So they'll work with you through briefings, through workshops,  they do this with some of the biggest organizations in the world to unravel the complexities  of the cloud so that you can do what you're really there to do. It's not about the cloud for you,  it's about unlocking business opportunities. And that's what WWT supports. They're experts  in cloud migrations. They do application development too. In fact, some amazing stuff.  I bet that completely surprised me. I had no idea about that part of the company.  They can create for you a secure landing zone in any cloud with on-demand labs that give  organizations access to tools for microservices and cloud native development. Once you're up in  the cloud, WWT helps with management. That's also a problem, right? Optimization, because they know  it's a continuum. You don't just put it up there and forget it. You've got to continually pay  attention to it, especially in a detailed way. Whether the strategy calls for cloud native,  hybrid cloud or on-prem resources, it doesn't matter. WWT works closely with you, their customers,  and with Intel to optimize for the latest cloud smart solutions based on Intel technology for  security, for performance, for agility. They also feature Intel Optane Persistent Memory.  I love this stuff. Really interesting technology. Other Intel technologies, Workload Optimized to  deliver affordable large capacity and data persistence for solutions supporting everything  from VDI to data analytics. Great company. They call themselves Silicon Valley and St. Louis,  but they're available anywhere in the world 24-7. If you want to know more about why organizations  across the globe, in every industry, in government and private, turn to WWT to guide them on their  cloud journey, just go to the website. There's lots of information there, including all the  incredible info in the Advanced Technology Center. That's their lab. It's incredible.  www.wwt.com. Don't forget, if you create a MyWWT account there, you can access resources  throughout WWT's ATC ecosystem. Half a billion dollars in enterprise technology in the ATC.  It's started in one little building. It's spread to four or five now. It's kind of mind-boggling.  www.wwt.com.

When you're on your Android phone, you hit the power button, and you will now see,  or in Android 11, you will see all of your Smart Home devices. You can control them really quickly  and easily from the app. That's good. They also brought local control, which is good for latency.  Things are happening faster in your home. Most of the partners are lighting-focused,  and then there's also Tile. Then they introduced Shed devices, which is  smart home entertainment devices. That's TVs, that sort of thing, bringing the AV  component into the Works with Google ecosystem. Those are the big things. I feel like there was  one thing that I missed, but maybe you'll ask me about it.

So I just got her a USB-C hub, like an Anker one, but they come in  like any normal things and she just plugs everything into it. And it carries power over too.  So you can just, when you have a setup, so when you're like kind of feeling all icky,  you can just plug right into it and you're then in an ergonomically correct place for like an hour.

I used to own a house and it had a lot of smart home stuff in it,  but I think I kind of went through that phase and now on the other side of it, I do have a bunch of  the thing that you can't say its name or else it'll wake up and start talking to.  Yeah, I guess I use that. Are you Amazon, Google or Apple?

Start time: 5716.18
End time: 5745.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am mostly Amazon. Do you worry that, there was a really good piece we talked about on this week  in Google on Wednesday in current affairs, the Bezos future, Nathan Robinson, and it really  painted a very dystopian, bleak future in which essentially Amazon rules the world.  Do you worry about Amazon's market dominance? And it's not just selling stuff. The goal is to

Start time: 5745.44
End time: 5878.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  completely control all transactions everywhere. So I worry about tons of stuff, but I think Amazon  my take and ultimately this question is above my pay grade, but I think Amazon is net positive  for the world. I think the world is better off because Amazon exists in many ways, but that's  not to say that it's not also pretty dangerous in the power that it has. But ultimately I think  the way I analyze these big companies is which ones have fundamentally aligned business models  and which ones have misaligned business models. And I think Apple as an example has a pretty  aligned business model. Like Apple wants you to desire their expensive phones and you want to  buy their expensive phones. And so it's all kind of okay. They just want you to buy phones  and other devices. So it's like, is it good or bad? It's like hard to say, but it's at least  like everyone's, everyone wants the same thing. We're all in alignment. Yeah. Amazon's model is  pretty much in alignment. You want to buy, they want to sell at a low price and they want to sell  it to you. So it's okay. Facebook's business model is fundamentally misaligned. That's a good point.  Fundamentally, like you want to be there to talk to your friends or whatever, and they want to  target you with ads. You don't want the ads. And it's like a fundamental misalignment.  Google's business model is very much aligned around their initial core business, which was  search ads. Right? Like search ads are the only ads that are aligned. Like if I'm Googling for  something, it's because I have a high intention of getting it. And so if they show me an ad for it,  that's actually not bad. That's pretty good alignment, but they're pretty misaligned in  almost every other business. And when you look at the places where they get into trouble,  it's in their misaligned business. They don't get into trouble with the search ads, even though  that's like the bulk of their revenue. They get into trouble with like YouTube, which is fundamentally  misaligned, right? Like YouTube doesn't want what YouTube viewers want. So in that sense,  I worry a lot less about Amazon because I think they're, yeah, they're a giant, very powerful  company. But I kind of, I understand the business model and it's aligned with what customers want.  I worry more about some of these other companies which have no real alignment.

Start time: 5880.12
End time: 5887.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The risk though, with that alignment is it's very effective. It's like a flywheel  and it becomes very, very powerful. Sorry, Luis, go ahead.

Start time: 5888.32
End time: 5914.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, yeah, I think your misalignment point is really interesting because I think that we also  have to think about the scale of that, right? Like, so it seems aligned for customers in the short term  to get a spatula in one day or less. However, the consequences of that for the environment,  for the workers involved, for the third party sellers whose intellectual property was ripped  off and Amazon did nothing about it, I don't think are really aligned. So I think it's like-

Start time: 5914.72

Start time: 5918.08
End time: 6031.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, I think like, you know, what happens when all of this, you know, retail innovation of  these like small companies which are basically forced to be Amazon sellers because that's the  main platform, you know, I've just seen them be treated so poorly by Amazon because they're not  really incentivized to- they are, they should be, but I think that they've gotten so big that  they're not necessarily incentivized to help these small sellers. And a lot of them have moved away  or tried to, but I think that Amazon is so big. But with that said, I do think some of the things  that are held up as like the scariest things about Amazon, for example, like the fact that they're  selling generic label products that are similar to, you know, other products for sale, that people  hold that up a lot as like, oh, well, like Amazon's trying to do everything and, you know,  they're selling all these generic products. It's like, have you been inside Sephora? Have you been  in a Walgreens? Like, I don't find that very scary, but I do think like, what is the end of like,  you know, a drone is going to bring you whatever you want in an hour or less. Like, that's kind  of what seems to be Bezos' vision. And I do worry about the consequences of that for,  and so their own employees, right? About, for the environment, for, you know, we're just going to  have houses full of cheap stuff that we mindlessly bought on Amazon. I do worry about things like  that. And their alignment is to do as much of that as possible. And that's sort of thing I  worry about. And I do worry that like, my values are not really aligned with Bezos as often. And  he has, you know, enormous only increasing power. So there are things to be worried about, but yeah,  I don't know if there's a, you know, it's like, they're giving us, Amazon's giving us what we  want, quote unquote, but is that what we're going to want in the long term? And what's good for like  the health of the planet and for ourselves? I don't know. I felt bad when I was ordering a lot of  stuff on Prime and I don't have a Prime account anymore. And I think I do a lot less like,  mindless consumption because of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting. How do you balance out though, the concerns about the, you know, I saw, I think  everything you said, it resonates with me. I wonder though, like how you weigh hypothetical future  problems, like future dangers that Amazon could pose if they, if they act in certain ways against  like actual harm being done by other companies right now in the way that they are acting.

Start time: 6054.20
End time: 6121.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that Amazon is posing a tremendous risk to the environment right now and that global warming  is happening right now. And it's not something we have to think about as hypothetical. And we know  that like, you know, their injury rate is far above the average for, you know, in similar sorts  of situations. I think that like sometimes Amazon has held up as this labor boogeyman, perhaps  because they're so big. And I think that we have to look at like, you know, labor practices across  the board. But I do think that these harms are already occurring. Like they definitely are already  happening. And I think that, you know, to Amazon's credit after they got so much pushback about the  environment, you know, I think it's phenomenal that Jeff Bezos wants to donate so much of his  wealth to this issue and that they have, you know, really strengthened their climate policies. But  for a long time, you know, Amazon just was like, it was like crickets about the environment,  whereas a lot of their, you know, competitors, which I know it's hard to compare Apple or Google  to Amazon because, you know, they're very fundamentally different businesses in some ways.  But, you know, I think we're leading the way on climate. And Amazon was just kind of silent until  their own employees started really acting up about this. I would also prefer a more heterogeneous

Start time: 6141.81
End time: 6168.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, that's a hypothetical. So maybe, right, that would make sense. But  that isn't. Yeah, I think the environmental impact, the labor impact are very real. And  I think, you know, need to be happening. Pressure needs to continue being applied to it.  A lot. But a lot of the other stuff is hypothetical, like the well, are we going to regret it when  there's no other options and they're going to jack up prices? Well, that's, you know,

Oh, I can't get my  will go with spatula because I actually had to buy one. And all the all the stores downtown are  gone. Well, they were both closed and I didn't have a place anywhere nearby that I could get one. But  I think you don't have a spatula city and in your town. I do have a kitchenware store.

Same day,  same day delivery of groceries, fuel discounts and other perks. Of course, Walmart can do the same  day because they have retail outlets in a great part of the United States. So it's in Louise,  you decided not to have a prime account. Would you consider a Walmart Plus account?

Start time: 6233.32
End time: 6307.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely not. And it's not it wasn't like, you know, this political statement. I think sometimes  when I tell people, yeah, I got rid of my prime account, it was not, you know, of course, like,  I think that it's important, you know, especially as someone who covers this company, I think it's,  you know, would be a little bit hypocritical if I was covering this company critically. And, you  know, I was ordering prime packages every single day. You know, there are reporters who do that,  and that's fine. But it wasn't like a holier than that decision. I was just like, I was buying stuff  when I thought about it, and then I would order it so quickly on the Amazon app and then get it  and be like, oh, you know, I really kind of wanted this two days ago, but I didn't really need it.  You know, like, it's just so frictionless. And I think that that's what they're encouraging,  right? That is the that's the alignment that they want for you. So I don't want anything like that.  That just makes it way too easy to buy things. It's too good. It's too good. Yeah, I think it's  like I want to be more careful and more intentional about what I buy and where from. But with that said,  I have like waited three weeks for an Amazon order when I couldn't buy when I wanted any  anywhere else. And I'm like, they're really punishing me for not having prime now,  because now I've waited like four weeks for this thing that a prime person would have gotten.

Start time: 6308.00
End time: 6317.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what I was going to say. This idea of being aligned.  They are aligned with yeah, consumers want to buy, you know, households of cheap stuff. And I don't  think that that's that's fine for businesses. But then if we go with that, then we have to say,  as a society, and this gets us into government, which I know everyone has a knee jerk reaction  against government, but that's kind of the stuff that we want to have regulations around.  So if we're going to say, hey, Amazon will deliver me the absolute cheapest,  fastest, whatever I want, they're going to do it at the expense of maybe workers, they're going to  do it at the expense of environmental policy, then we need to have more robust rules to protect the  things we value and add cost to the things that, you know, in that that stands in the way of our  consumer wants. And that's kind of the goal of that sort of thing. But we just don't think like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

And I don't I don't think that business  model alignment with the with the with the customer with the end user is sufficient to make a virtuous  company. But I think it's necessary. So I think if you don't if you don't even have the alignment,  then I can't even I won't even know where to begin trying to figure out how to have that.

Start time: 6396.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Phil, what would you say now? Like, I'm curious about what you think now, especially  that Amazon's advertising business is growing so much. Like, I do wonder about that, because like,  you know, in search results, for example, they're becoming more like Google, which is kind of  interesting, because you're getting potentially the person who paid the most to be that search  result on Amazon, not necessarily like the best product anymore. So I think that they're kind of  playing with fire there, because people do trust that alignment a lot of ways. But now they're kind  of like, we're going to mess with it a little bit by having, you know, paid search results,  paid, you know, suggested items and that sort of thing, which is kind of interesting to watch.

It's  so nice to see you Louise. And the things are going well. So smart. I just it's so fun to do  a show with people who have you know where you just go Oh, oh, that Oh, oh, I think this is a  great lineup. It is a good lineup. It is I agree with you. I'm part of it. But well, there's  certainly a third of it. So I can say that much. So our show today brought to you by molecule. Now  I am a molecule fan. I really am but molecule is not what you think it is. And I think they maybe  got some bad press from people thinking it was Oh, it's an air filtration system. Oh, it's so much  more than that. It's for sick office buildings where the indoor air is actually five times worse  than the outdoor air EPA says that's very common in office spaces. It's an air purifier. That's  it's not about filtration. It's about Pico or photo electrochemical oxidation actually destroys  harmful pollutants in the air, like viruses, bacteria, mold and chemicals, it doesn't filter  them or collect them on filters. Molecules air purifiers are designed to help protect homes,  businesses and medical spaces, destroying pollutants providing clean air, we have molecules at home,  one in our bedroom, and Lisa always knows when it's not on, we got one from Michael, we use one here  in the studio. Molecular purifiers are designed, well, they have a variety of them. There's the  big ones designed for large rooms up to 600 square feet. There's the new molecule air mini,  smaller rooms 250 square feet, the air mini plus, which helps protect small rooms with a particle  sensor and auto protect mode. So it'll adjust the fan speed based on what's in the air. And also  brand new the molecule air pro rx. It's an FDA cleared as a 510 k class two medical device.  It's intended for medical purposes to destroy bacteria and viruses in the air. It all relies  in this Pico technology. And you can go to the molecule website, read the white papers,  I just read one from Lawrence Labs, Department of Energy Labs, where they tested the molecule  collecting three really nasty chemicals that are in a lot of sick offices and other spaces with  poor ventilation. formaldehyde, it's volatile organic compounds like formaldehyde, ozone,  and I forgot what the third was. But these are things that are off gassed by carpets and drapes  and so forth. They cleared 95% of the ozone out of the air in minutes. And as soon as it came back  on, they turn it off, the ozone came back up because it's being off gassed all the time.  It really works, you will notice the difference. Clean air if you're spending more time at home  is so important. But when you go back to the office, it might even be more important. The  Pico technology meets the performance requirements in the FDA guidance for use in helping reduce the  risk of exposure to SARS COVID-2. That's the COVID-19 virus in healthcare settings. They got FDA  approval, it meets the FDA guidance. In independent testing, they reduced concentrations of MS2,  which is a proxy virus they use for testing, over 99.9% in one hour. Of course, obviously,  that's not enough to protect you. You still have to do all the other important things like masks  and social distancing and washing your hands. But it's sure nice to know that you can run  your molecule air purifier and clear the air of those aerosolized particles that quickly,  99.9% in an hour.

Really nice. Let us,  I want to, we're running, I know you guys are going to be starving any minute now.  Let me, let me do a rundown of some of the other stories, the mini stories that we can talk about.  We mentioned that when Mixer closed down, a couple of streamers were left hanging.  But they made a lot of money. Ninja, we think made more than $20 million when Microsoft  lured him away from Twitch. He's now back streaming, but he didn't go back to Twitch.  He could have, but now he's on YouTube. You got to wonder, did he get another payday?  Ninja is the king of Fortnite streamers. So Mixer was a brief flirtation, but he's now on YouTube.  I bet you, we don't know, but I'm bet you, Google offered him a little something come over.  I'm sure both Twitch and YouTube, and by the way, Facebook too, because they now have a gaming  platform, were scrambling to make him an offer he could not refuse. I kind of feel bad for him,

I think Big Sur's, you know, I mean, Ninja is a little  bit bigger than that, but I think that's a lot of money. Yeah, he probably got a big chunk of  change to go there. But I think that's like, now what? It's like, you kind of just crawl back. I  mean, he has a lot of fans, I'm sure he'll be fine, but it is kind of like, it shows that you  can't just have one anchor person, or a couple anchor people and hope that that's enough. I  think Quibi is another great example of that. You have to have like, I don't know, I think maybe  this area is just too saturated the same way that streaming was too saturated. Be like if Howard

Like  that's called like a podcast. Like there's plenty of like short daily news podcasts  that I can listen to while I like get ready for work or whatever. You know, that was in the before  times at least now it's like, well, I just brush my teeth and change into my home work pajamas  instead of my sleep ones. But yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure about Quibi. I've only seen some of  the shows. A lot of it seems like over produced, but I think it's like an interesting concept. But  I just think like, I don't know. I don't know if like having it also be like, it was really hard  to share Quibi content elsewhere. And that was one thing that TikTok did really smart is like,  you just download a TikTok video easily and you can send it to people who don't have TikTok. You  can upload it to your Instagram story. And that's something that they really didn't do very well.  Either did Mixer. Like I never saw like, you know, here's what happened on Mixer today or on Byte.  Like I think all these like new platforms have to really think about like, you know, kind of  paradoxically, how are people going to share our stuff elsewhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't identify why.  I think I have a natural animus out of Schadenfreude almost. I wanted them to fail because  what it was was Hollywood's idea of what digital content should be. And if we use the Hollywood  model, they raised one and three quarters billion dollars. We throw money, we bring in Hollywood  celebrities, and we throw money at them and have super high production values.  Then all those dumb kids watching TikTok and YouTube videos will see what real production  and real content looks like and they'll flock to us. And so I have a little bit of Schadenfreude  that no, in fact, native digital content creators actually do know their audience  and they actually are creating something their audience wants. And maybe it isn't as slick and  high production and you don't have Titus Burgess in your show, but maybe that's what people want.  Maybe they want Tyler Blevins. Maybe they want Ninja. Maybe that's what they really want. I  don't know. According to Karsten Quibi lost everybody but 72,000 subscribers this week.

But I was going to say, I feel like on the internet, even still, even as mature as it has  gotten, people like the relationship they have with people. So-  Oh, that's interesting.  And Quibi didn't, I'm just trying to even with YouTube and even with,  maybe less so with TikTok. So maybe we're just on the spectrum where  we're no longer needing that relationship. I don't know.

So like a lot,  that's a lot of what it is. Or like, you know, collecting content and stuff.  You have a perfect excuse.  That really doesn't justify it.  This is your work.  However, given that I would say to your question, no, I think that there still is a lot about like  wanting the personal relationship. A lot of TikTok celebrities just started out as normal  people sharing their lives. Like a lot of this stuff is almost just like micro vlogging. That's  a very like technical way of putting it, but just people being like, here's what I did today. Here's  like, you know, here's a funny thing my dog did or whatever. And I think it's very personal,  very low production value, yet much lower than YouTube actually. Like, you know, a lot of these  people don't even have ring lights, you know?

Is that like, it was,  yeah, maybe these household names, but they didn't really work to like have that relationship. I've  never seen like, you know, Quibi native stars, like engaging with people on Twitter or anything  like that. I think it's just really-

But some days it has to,  let me show you my, this is such a good deal. This is an iPhone SE, which I scored from Mint Mobile.  It is $15 a month. And then I got my Mint Mobile service, unlimited nationwide text talk  and three gigabytes of data, $15 a month for 30 bucks a month. A third what I'm paying for data  for internet and you know, phone calls alone from the big guys. I got a great little phone  at a great little price. That's Mint Mobile. They're selling you the same service they run  on T-Mobile that you get from the big boys. But because they have no stores, they have no  retail, there's no hidden fees. They give you an amazing deal. There's the Green Fox,  who has a surprising resemblance to Ryan Reynolds. I just noticed that maybe it's the glasses.  Mint Mobile is a no brainer, premium wireless, 15 bucks a month. By going online only,  you're eliminating the cost of retail and they pass that savings along to you.  Every plan comes with unlimited nationwide talk and text, crazy fast 4G LTE. You can bring your  own phone. They'll send you the SIM, put it in for free. They'll port your number if you want it.  Or you can get phones like I said, this iPhone SE. That's a great deal on a great phone. Switch  now to Mint Mobile. You'll get premium wireless for 15 bucks a month. If you're not 100% satisfied,  they've got you covered seven day money back guarantee. I actually ended up, they have a  variety of plans. I did the three gigs for a while. I said, this is great. But I thought,  I want more data. I got the 12 gigabytes a month, unlimited nationwide talk and text,  12 gigabytes. I never go through even half that, but it's nice to have it all.  You can get eight gigabytes. They sell it in the chunks you want. 25 bucks a month. I got it. I  paid once $300, got a whole year. That's 25 bucks a month. That is a third, less than a third,  what I'm paying the big boys for the same service. I think Mint Mobile is awesome. If you are still  overpaying for cell service, mintmobile.com slash twit. Get that three month introductory plan,  just $15 a month. Get the SIM shipped to your door, pop it in a phone or buy a phone from them.  They've got great prices. You'll be very happy. Mintmobile.com slash twit. Get your wireless bill  down to $15 a month. Mintmobile.com slash twit. We thank them so much for their support for the  show. And I have to say, when you're wearing face masks, touch ID, fingerprint, not a bad idea.  This phone is so cool. Plus it fits in my pocket. Mintmobile.com slash twit. Oh, boy, still a few  stories to go, but we're getting long. Jack Dorsey donates $3 million to basic universal income.  This is Silicon Valley's hope for the future. When Yang was running for president,  it makes even more sense now, I think. Yes.  No comment. Twitter hints at a future subscription service.  Twitter will not be doing that, by the way. But when Twitter mentioned this in a job listing,  their stock price went up 10%. People like the idea of Twitter making money. Has Twitter responded  to this? Are you covering this story, Louise?

I will say that I think they're leaning into the fact that Twitter  including myself, these power users that I think might pay for some enhanced features or whatever.  I don't know if I would necessarily, but I can see the use case for it unlike some of these other  apps where a lot of people are just more casual users. I think Twitter has rapid. I wouldn't call  them fans necessarily, but people who spend a lot of time doom scrolling on there. I could also see  some sort of news service that rounded up all the important tweets about a certain news topic or  something that would be useful to a lot of Twitter's user base, which often a lot of people use the

I would absolutely pay if they brought  back the track feature, for instance, which let you track subject matter or hashtags.  Honestly, if I could just get rid of the trolls, I'd pay money to use Twitter,  just like have the good Twitter. I don't know how that would work, but if they could do that.

They're aligned, aren't they?  I think they're really trying hard to come into alignment. I think they started in a place that  was probably similar to Facebook, but I think they've really taken it seriously. I have no  idea whether a subscription thing is real or whether it would succeed, but I think it's critical  that they try anything to introduce business models that are fundamentally aligned with  what end users want.

Transcript:  I would ask Louise, I have a story that I would like to get outside takes on because I've been  thinking about it for a while, which is the data miner story and it's related to Twitter.  Oh, I should have done a segue. Okay. The story that people were very upset that  police officers were using a service called data miner that has access to the Twitter API  to the police were using it to locate protests during the Black Lives Matter protest.  People were like, this is surveillance.  I know data miner. I sat through their presentations forever ago. I wanted access  to their API so I could build a sentiment analysis thing with a smart light bulb to  tell me when companies that I was excited about were popping on Twitter.  I looked at the way the police were using it and I didn't feel nefarious or like surveillance.  It doesn't feel great, but I would love to get a take from people who are maybe smarter

Start time: 8010.40
End time: 8052.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  or just have different opinions on this. So data miner has the famous Twitter fire  hose, which is the everything feed. By now it must be a very fat fire hose.  Do they pay Twitter for that? Very few people have access to it.  I believe they pay for it. They must because it's got to cost  Twitter a lot. Twitter says, yeah, they have it, but all people were doing with it was  monitoring news stories, just the kind of thing we would want. Of course, the police can use that  because if you're following the news, you know where protests are breaking out and so forth.  Twitter says that's all they were doing, news alerting.

Start time: 8053.54
End time: 8183.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's like where is the line between like what is news alerting and what is surveillance?  I mean, I think the line between those things is like not necessarily clear.  I think that this is intelligence gathering. I don't know if it's the same as like,  secretly asking Twitter for data about users who are tweeting about the George Floyd protests.  Is there a difference between this and let's say flying a drone over the protests for sure.  I think that Twitter's argument here is like this is public information that's being aggregated and  it's sentiment analysis. It's also something that a lot of researchers do, for example,  is collect all the tweets on a certain topic and analyze them. But I do think that the fact that  it's police kind of really changes the dynamic here, especially with the way that the police  have treated the protesters. But I do kind of, you know, I think it's hard. I don't think it's  a use that the average person tweeting about the protest understood it could be used for.  And that's sort of like where I come down on this. It's like, for example, I've had a lot of debates  about embedding tweets in news stories, right? Like, is that fair? Do you need to get the person's  consent, et cetera? And there's a lot of people who say, okay, you tweeted it out. You had to have  known that. However, I kind of fall on the side of like, you know, that's not the intended audience.  The intended audience of your tweet was not wired readers. It was your Twitter followers.  So it's not really fair to assume that that's an audience you would have expected because it's not.  I think if I quoted your tweet or something but didn't link to it, I think there are kind of shades  of gray here. But I do think that like, you know, the average person who was tweeting at a protest  didn't understand that the police might be like analyzing those tweets for intelligence purposes.  But you were tweeting publicly. So I sort of do think that there's a little bit here or there, but  it's not black and white. And I do think I understand why this was a news story and why  this was something that like, you know, some people will be upset about for sure.

Transcript:  If people are interested, they should read. It's very detailed. The story that broke in the  Intercept, it was their story. And the reason it's of interest partly is because this came up  four years ago in 2016. Data Miner, which is by the way, Data Miner is partly owned by Twitter,  as well as the CIA. The accusation four years ago was that Data Miner and other companies like it  were being used to enable domestic surveillance. Twitter said, No, no, we won't do that.  Using Twitter's public API's or data products to track or profile protesters and activists is  absolutely unacceptable and prohibited. And so this has come up again. And that's one of the

Start time: 8231.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  reasons this is a story. Oh, I didn't know that they were saying that it had been prohibited.  Yeah, four years ago. Yeah.  Is that no, I mean, I don't agree with the way it's gone down. But I've also like the  outreach here feels like it feels good in some ways, because I think people need to understand  what it means to have a digital footprint and how that can be used against them. And  yes, I mean, I would like for them to understand it without having to be arrested. But these stories  are important for that reason. But I also am kind of like, was this really a terrible thing? Or was

Transcript:  just them just using it the way it was supposed to be? Historically, Twitter has been a place for  protesters to organize the Arab Spring happened on Facebook and Twitter. So this has been a very  useful tool for protesters. But I am not surprised that the police and others would try to use it.  It is roughly public information, right? You're tweeting it publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I disagree. I think, well, with the public information thing, basically, I think there's,  I kind of have three thoughts about this. The first is it's a creepy company name. And let's  let this be a lesson. But there's no data minor creepy name. I mean, but then again, you know,  there's Palantir. That's really, really, that's super literally named after the thing in Lord  of the Rings that corrupts everyone who looks at it by giving them too much information.  Anyway, creepy names, your lesson, people. But the second thing is like the fact, I think,  and I think Luis like really, really hit this on the head. Yeah, it's public information,  but that's no longer enough. Interesting. What's the intended audience? Yeah.  Well, I would say more than that, right? So the traditional like understanding of privacy,  like the Supreme Court understanding of it is you're not entitled to privacy if you are,  you know, walking around outside, right? So like if the cops see you doing something illegal,  you know, outside, outdoors in public, and they don't have a warrant, they don't need a warrant,  they can come after you. But you know, but they're not allowed to like go inside your house,  right? That was always like the distinction. Right. But I think that distinction assumes  human level capability of observation, not superhuman capability of observation. So when we  have the ability to algorithmically and automatically see everything when we literally  are the eye of Sauron, just the fact that it's like public, I don't think that that I don't think  that's enough. I don't think that actually means anything anymore. So yeah, like maybe the police  ought to be allowed to scroll through Twitter manually looking for stuff like a person would.  But as soon as they start using technology that literally looks at everything, I don't actually  think that the public versus private makes any distinction. It's creepy and Orwellian.  To do it. And then kind of the third thing is, and I think I think we I think you said this,  this is like, well, is it terrible? Or is it like they were doing they're using it the way it was  designed? Like, I think it's terrible because they're using it in the way. Right? Like, yeah,  it's not broken. It's it's in computer terms, right? It's it's it's a lot. It's working as  designed like this is this is how they made it to do this kind of stuff with it, which makes it worse  that this isn't a bug or a problem. It's a it's a feature. So yeah, I don't think it's necessarily  illegal. But I think the outrage is is kind of well placed. I love this. I don't like it.

Transcript:  I love your distinction between what a human could do and what and then what would be superhuman.  So for a police officer to scroll through Twitter looking for Black Lives Matters protests and posts  would be okay. But to do it by sucking the firehose of Twitter and using powerful systems to  analyze it and pop up alerts, that's not okay. Is that what you're saying?

Start time: 8470.22
End time: 8509.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think I think the line is somewhere there, right? It's like, if if I tweet something,  and I tweet something that maybe is, you know, illegal, or there's a you know, there's a there's  a crime in progress, and somebody sees it and like a human being sees it and reports it or maybe like  a human police officer sees it and like that that feels like that's okay. But if there's this  super intelligent AI system that's looking at everything everybody says, and automatically  flagging and detecting things, and that's no longer, there's no longer any difference of that  when we saying it publicly versus me like saying it inside the house. It also introduces a possibility

Transcript:  ways. I think I think there was this court case recently, it was probably a few decades ago,  at this point, where I remember there was something about the police was were using infrared  cameras to detect marijuana growers back in the before times when like marijuana growing was  illegal. There was some case where the cops would like roll up in front of a suspected, you know,  house that was that was engaging in growing marijuana, and they would like point an infrared  camera and they can see because of the heat difference, the heat signature of all the grow  lamps. And I think they made some some arrests or some busts. And the controversy was like,  well, they didn't have a warrant. But the cops were saying like, no, this is this is public,  we were just looking from the outside. You know, we were just passing by in our patrols,  and we just happened to see that, you know, your house was too hot. And so we, you know, blah,  blah, blah. And of course, like the idea was like, yeah, you're looking from the outside,  but you're not looking with human eyes. You're looking with an infrared camera. And that the  whole idea of that, like, well, it's publicly visible, like those laws were created,  assuming a human level of capability, not a superhuman level of capability.  And of course, now with, you know, this firehose of data, and with AI, it's much worse than  infrared cameras, it's you can algorithmically see everything. So this whole like, hiding behind a  fig leaf where, well, you tweeted it publicly should have known that doesn't it doesn't hold

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  water for me. So the the case that you're talking about is a good one, because it exhibits like  where I think the law is going to break down on these. So that case wasn't because it wasn't  there humanized, it was actually an unreasonable search and unreasonable search without a warrant,

Start time: 8609.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So yeah, it's a case. And I think this is because what you're talking about,  and that's one of the things I wanted this to be public and talk about it, because I think it's  really important for people to understand the limits of their privacy when you have computer  vision, when you have the massive powers of today's, you know, computing infrastructure.  But as we're seeing, and I think we're going to see really interesting court cases come along,  because there are things like Google's getting the request for all phones that were in an area  at the time a crime was committed. Now that is, that is not a search and seizure issue.  So we have to have the laws we have now don't really address that. And I've been thinking  about something like computer vision, right? So if you think about it, it's the same argument  we're making with Twitter. But if you say that somebody robbed someone in a public square and you  did a search for their face and found them and maybe searched the whole country for them,  I don't know how we would think about this, but we have to, I think we do need to make a distinction  and we need to do it somehow within a legal framework that makes sense because I don't know  of search and seizure. That's where most of these get or searching, sorry, search without a  war fourth amendment. That's where most of them fall into, but I don't know if that's

Transcript:  for you or? There was a big case. I think it was, I mean, it was last summer, the summer before,  but there was like a time when there was just like a lot of movement in the fourth amendment.  And I just got, we have since hired someone who like went to law school and like is a DC reporter.  But at the time I was doing a lot of like legal reporting and it was just so fascinating in these  cases. The other big case that always comes up is they put a GPS tracker on a guy's car. And that  was also ruled unconstitutional under the fourth amendment. Those are the two like really famous  tech cases. But yeah, I love the marijuana case. It was fascinating. But yeah, I think  you guys are really smart on this and it's a good point. I'm blown away that three out of the four

Transcript:  were born in the Soviet Union? Yeah, I mean, I think, look, all of this is balancing out two  harms, right? The harm of, you know, the harm of crime, of like individual crimes against other  people and the need to reduce the harm that comes from those crimes, which is a very legitimate  thing. And then balancing that out with the harm of, you know, state surveillance and crimes  committed by, you know, by states, right? Or by large organizations. And there's always a balance  between which of those things gets like overdramatized. Yeah. Right. And very often,  at least in the US, at least right now, the individual crime is like, we're kind of over  indexing on them. It's actually not that big a deal most of the time. And the harm done by,  you know, massive surveillance at the state level has also not been that terrible yet,  but there's definitely strong potential. Yeah. Yeah. The tools are there. And I think-  Having been born and, yeah, like lived a part of my life in a place where the balance very much was,  there was a lot more harm committed by a powerful state in the Soviet Union than the harm committed  by individual crimes. Yeah. I think I generally, you know, have some more, have some trauma around  that that I usually err on the side of, yeah, let's do a little bit less surveillance. Let's  do a little bit less data mining, all of that kind of stuff. Couldn't agree more. Thank you,
