Transcript:  This is twit this week in tech episode 41 for February 5th 2006  An unusual twit because we're actually doing this during the lunch hour on Friday because I'm about to head off for the geek cruise but we did find some twits who either don't work for a living or can actually take lunch off.  John C. Dvorak. Hello. Dvorak.org slash blog. Roger Chang. Hello. Are you working at the Fisherman's Gallery yet? No. Mom and Dad's place.  Somebody asked me where, because he lives in Modesto, where I can have a good piece of fish. It's Fisherman's Gallery, Rumble McHenry on the corner.  And I'm really thrilled to have Kevin Rose here. We haven't talked to Kevin in an age. Hey Kevin, how you doing? Good, good. Hello, hello.  I really thank you for taking, I know you've been crazy busy with the dig and everything so I thank you for taking some time off. No worries.  We have to ask you about the $30 million. What happened? Yahoo was supposed to give you $30 million. Yeah right. That was just all rumors that got out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was really a strange couple of days there. It was something that was posted on dig about Yahoo, someone that was supposedly close to the negotiations or something about Yahoo buying dig.  And then all of a sudden, I just commented within the dig comments that we're focused on features, not selling the company.  And I woke up the next morning and it was on CNN Money and just all over the web. Oh it was on CNN? Oh wow, everybody picked it up. It was crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Reliability issues of the internet. Yes. Stuff just kind of gets a life of its own. Hey, David Prager is also here. Let me add him into the mix.  Another revision three employee. In fact, we have two revision three employees and no DLTV employees for change. I think Patrick is traveling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, technically because I work on the odd day for Patrick. Oh good. I could be kind of considered. Somebody representing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  David, we were just talking about the $30 million. You probably would have been rich too, huh? What $30 million?  $30 million. I was going to have a Yahoo millionaire tweet. We have Joshua Schachter and Arlo Rose, Kevin Rose, Jason Calacanis. It would have been a really cool thing.  Nice. Oh yeah. If one more person gets bought by Yahoo with the last name of Rose, we could really have a party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How much did Arlo Rose get? He did the widgets stuff. He's a confabulator guy. I doubt he got $30 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Kevin, you already denied it completely in the Digg blog, so there's no point in even belaboring it. I was rooting for you. I thought, yeah. Right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's one of those things where we stand today. Digg is a geek culture news website. Right now, we don't want to sell the company.  We really want to show what Digg is going to be here in the next few months.  We're planning on expanding into new categories and rolling out a bunch of new features that no one has really anticipated us doing.  We have some really cool stuff coming up and we don't think that now is a good time to sell. We like staying independent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell the truth. You think you're worth more than $30 million, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's not that. It's more of just wanting to really... There's so many things that I have planned for Digg that I want to see happen.  You never know what another company is going to do when they buy your company.  How about telling... Hey, Kevin, tell us at least one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's that?  One thing that you... No.  Last week we did the show, which we're going to discuss, which a lot of people moaned about.  And we had a lot of these kinds of answers. We got a guy, well, I can't tell you. I don't think people are really interested in listening to We Can't Tell You.  Right.  Now, not to be critical, but you're not a public company, so I don't see why you're being so secretive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we do have competition. There are other social news.  You got no competition. You got nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about Newsvine? Are you worried about Newsvine at all, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, Newsvine is interesting because what they do is they don't... Their actual stories, a lot of their stories are pulled in via feeds.  It's AP, yeah. I mean, AP and ESPN.  Right. So they're pulling in content, and it's really not the users that are submitting that content.  And we want to remain at this level playing field where the users actually have to submit the content to the site.  Right.  And it's not being forced or pushed in front of anyone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're probably not competition. Who is the competition? You can give us that much.  What's this competition you're afraid of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's probably someone that we really don't know is working on a project yet.  You know, if someone like Google or Yahoo or someone big like that came out with some type of similar social news service,  that would be more competition for us than a new startup because we already have kind of this critical mass of users that are on the site.  And that takes time to duplicate, but when you're a big company such as one of those guys, then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But those guys, they don't do that. They buy other people. At least they make a shot at it.  Even with Orcut, they took a shot at Friendster before they rolled out Orcut.  They only do these kinds of deals when the company, the original company, refuses to do business with them.  Right.  So I don't think they're working on anything. They're probably working on doing financials on your site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it reminds me of the software industry where everybody was afraid of what Microsoft would do should they weigh in.  Now in the web industry, everybody's afraid of Yahoo and Google. So you don't think they should be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't think they should be. Yahoo and Google are really good at buying other people up.  What has Yahoo ever developed on its own? I mean, just tell me. Give me an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did their podcast thing on their own, didn't they?  Do they have one?  Well, okay, so maybe it's not the best known. Yeah, they do.  There are, although there's rumors that maybe they'll buy Odeo.  So of course, we now know what worthlessness those rumors are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the rumors are crazy.  Do you read this?  It's funny, Josh Yachter was from Delicious. He sent me an IM. He goes, are we buying you?  He goes, because we have a lot of office space up here. You know, you could probably be on the same floor as Delicious.  That would be cute.  Yeah, that would be cool. He's a cool guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a number in your mind, Kevin, or are you really just not for sale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, if someone comes to the table and throws out some crazy, ridiculous number, I mean, I'm not going to be an idiot.  But at the same time, it's like, you know, we really want to expand into other areas and show what what Dick can do before we even entertain something like that.  So it's like we have a lot of what other areas we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John, now to play the journalist. What's the deal here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just telling you, after last week, somebody's got to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You couldn't beat up on Woz last week, so you're picking our own here?  Hey, I tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's like we want to get beyond just tech news.  You know, right now we're so locked into this geek culture news and that, you know, we don't cover world news.  We don't cover politics. We don't, you know, we want to create.  We want to really create DIG as a platform where users come to share information, no matter what that information may be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you want you essentially want to broaden out your user base to include non-traditional kind of DIG users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. Like just get outside of where we are today and allow users to kind of share information in unique ways.  You just want a matchmaking service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It all ends up that way, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's what everything deteriorates into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It always ends up. We'll talk about Friendster in a minute, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think it's going to be interesting.  I think it is kind of not a matchmaking in the way that you see with, you know, you go out on dates and find new people to to meet up that way.  But it is in that, you know, we want to add a lot of smarts behind the scenes and DIG is actually, you know, keeping track of and bookmarking every single story that you're into.  So we're building like a social profile about that individual.  And we're able to in the future make recommendations on stories that you may not even have known as they have existed, but will be recommended to you by the engine because we know the types of things that you're into.  So if you're digging stories about oolong tea and, you know, AMD microprocessors, DIG will know that and be able to make specific stories.  It's the weirdest connection ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So talking about that kind of thing, what do you think Yelp is up to?  Because they have a, you know, they're not doing what you're doing, but they have the one of the I think the most interesting reviewer site out there because it allows you to see, you know, because, you know, we talked about the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a site where it's like opinions where you can review anything, the Golden Gate Bridge, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can't do it as anonymously as you can on these other sites.  And so you can kind of see what somebody's other opinions are and then you can check them out to see if this person is really thinking.  This is what social is all about, though, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's I think part of it.  I think you're really smart, Kevin, because this is what Google has done so well.  They realized, wait, we're not a search engine company.  We can we are really a company that aggregates information about people and can use it to their advantage.  And I think that's very smart of you to see what your business really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It also comes in handy for those black helicopters.  What do you mean, John?  Well, you know, they can track every your every thought.  And then if, you know, you get out of line a little bit, you know, one can fly over the house and blow you away.  You can always move to China.  Oh, yeah, that'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's get this out of the way, because I know people want to know what happened last episode.  You missed this, Kevin, and you didn't miss anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw I saw something on it was on dig sites and yeah, everywhere.  What's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, do you want to take this?  I can summarize it and I don't want to point fingers pointed at me.  It's fine. I take full responsibility.  But you're familiar with the term gushing.  Yeah. Yes.  Well, Leo is gushing a little bit too much.  I think ultimately that's probably what the problem was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But let's just go over a couple of facts here.  One, generally speaking, I've worked with Leo's longer than anybody here.  And I can say this with some authority, which is Leo is probably as famous as anybody ever has on the show in some way.  Not as flunked.  Why is invented the personal freaking computer?  I'm not interested in an argument.  All right.  He's you know, in terms of like, you know, yeah, he didn't invent a computer 30 years ago, but he's generally a famous person.  And he has a huge following of fans who expect him to be kind of rise above it and not be a fan boy.  And when was for some unknown reason, Leo and was in Mitnick of all people who seems to be following was they're very good in the same neighborhood.  Leo falls apart.  You're right. And unfortunately, it's true.  Since he has control of the show, ladies and gentlemen, we if you had the wait a minute, I was that we have wait a minute.  He has no control of this.  You have control of the show because you could actually hang up on everybody here.  But he did with Patrick last week.  I waited.  I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what happened to Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said I didn't come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patrick said he gave up.  He was smart.  He had a good sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, first, he started the show under the car, which wasn't a good start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So anyway, so my thinking is, is that unfortunately, Leo has a subtle self-esteem issue with certain people.  And those people should never be allowed on the show.  John, I'm scared to death of you.  You know, you know, it's kind of funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I love you, man.  I love you, dude.  So, John, you're telling me that there's no one in the world that if you ever met them, you would act the same?  Yeah. Who would you gush over, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would.  I'm not saying that, but I wouldn't be doing it on the radio.  Oswald's Spengler.  I wouldn't be doing it in public.  No, you're right.  It was bad.  I think a really cool and I don't I try never to like I don't I would not.  I wouldn't be go public with with my falling all over myself in that matter.  I just don't think it's interesting to anybody but me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In my defense, I will say I was not aware of doing that.  But in retrospect, you're absolutely right.  I'll cop to that.  And now I'm going to do the same thing with Kevin Rose because he's going to be worth thirty million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is the Charlie Rose syndrome, by the way, which Leo does exhibit a little bit of.  And I think a lot of interviews do it.  Charlie Rose, if you ever listen to him do a show when he's got a rich guy on, he invariably starts talking about the guy's money.  And I saw him do a show once we went into somebody's house and he's looking at their art asking him how much it costs.  I wouldn't do that.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you but Leo's to my opinion, Leo's to been in broadcasting too long to fall apart like that.  And I was OK.  And that's that.  Anyway, I don't even want to be over critical about it, but I was told by a couple of people that I think that's accurate.  I think that's a cop to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can listen to this because I've seen you talk to Steve Wozniak and probably almost a dozen previous times.  It was a little different because it's a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a podcast.  And so I don't I don't have my journalistic armor on.  I am not a confrontational interviewer anyway.  You know that, John.  I don't I don't like to get in a confrontational thing.  I'd rather insinuate myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't have a problem with that.  You're a softballer.  I'm a softballer.  There's a lot of people that do very well doing that, but generally when they're softballing, they still maintain some, you know, they don't distance.  They try to do it a little bit less gushing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you I see since I missed a show, what was the exact word that that Leo uttered?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think when I said when I told Woz that I wanted to have his child, I think that might have gone over the line there.  Is that could be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was pretty funny.  I was listening to it.  I was actually doing a lot of work.  You're an observer.  Yeah, I tried to jump in every once in a while.  He goes back on track and talking about the news, but you know, nobody cared.  It was all Woz.  He next was talking about his toys.  I don't think anybody cares that was spent thirty five hundred bucks for a yellow laser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seriously, I think there's some interest in yellow lasers, but but you're right.  And it's not going to happen again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's I'm not counting on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, John, I know it's the only time I get on the air.  I count on you, John, to say, Leo, stop it.  Slap me around a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stop, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's move on, shall we, gang, because there is a lot of news.  Have you seen, by the way, I was going to ask Kevin about this Valley wag.  Have you seen this yet?  No, I haven't.  It's a you know, it's the it's the Gawker Media has done now what they did in Washington with Juan Cat.  I did see they're doing with Silicon Valley.  It's it's a gossip column for Silicon Valley.  You must have seen it, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. No, actually, I'm out of it, too.  Well, it's I only launched a few days ago.  Well, what's what's the I'll give you an example of their angle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are Valley wag dot com.  Oddly enough, the angle, you know, everybody's talking about I can hear everybody typing in the URL.  Let's see.  Let's see.  The angle that everybody took about Google's downturn in the stock market was, you know, what did Google do wrong?  Is the stock market wrong?  What's the future Valley wag said?  Well, but how much did Larry and Sergey lose?  And they have an Excel spreadsheet and they figured out that it cost them one point two billion dollars each.  The stock price drop.  Not that they're and I'm talking about money again, John.  And I apologize for you to the people who are interested in money, sex and money.  That's all they want to know.  By the way, that's the other thing Valley wag has been making a lot of hay about is is Larry Page's ex-girlfriend, who I guess works at Google.  And I couldn't care less about that.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He has a new girlfriend, Lucy.  Oh, he does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Looking at the site now.  It's got the Google snack rooms up there right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little insight base.  Well, it's gossip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  The question is, does anybody care about the, you know, it's not Brad and Jen.  Behind this.  Do we know who's behind?  Yeah, it's Gawker.  It's Gawker Media.  You know, it's the same people do all the other Gawker Media things.  I can't remember his name.  What's the Gawker's name?  Guy's name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess they don't like Tony Perkins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there was just a picture of the Gawker guy and his stable of bloggers in Vanity Fair.  I think it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he's good enough to get that kind of PR.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's, you know, that's that's pretty good.  Insta Pundit is one of theirs.  Wonkette.  OK, I got it.  You know, it's just it's exactly what Jason is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little too slick for my taste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I like Dvorak slash org dot blog.  I mean, Dvorak dot org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's amateurish.  It's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're doing I'm doing a new podcast with Dicty Bartolo and we decided that we don't want to have good music.  We want to have a Casio cheap Casio organ for the really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wesley Willis.  It's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I used to get a kick out of the you know, I listen to sports talk, you know, now you can condemn me for that.  But Jim Rome, when he did his first show on TV, he used to have this amateurish girl who sounded like a cheerleader or something do the voiceover announcements.  And I thought it was really funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, and now it's time for, you know, just as amateur talk about falling all over the worst people in that business are the sports guys.  I mean, they just gush like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think Jim Roe, Jim Roe doesn't know Jim Roe actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why he's good.  He's he's the hard ass.  As it were.  That's why he's good.  He's kind of mean.  Yeah, I think he's one of the best radio guys working today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think he's great, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he'll be the host of Twitter next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's the Dick DiBartolo show?  It's Daily Gizwiz.  Daily, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I thought we'd do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's a questionable name for a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Kevin Rose did it for trouble.  Oh man.  Do it every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kevin did an interview and the prompter in the prompter it says the G-I-Z-W-I-Z and Kevin pronounced it just perfectly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I said it was no I said it was the Gizwiz on national television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's what David was referring to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know it was embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I said it once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the thing people like most about the screensavers.  It wasn't really very much national television.  It wasn't not even close.  So call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I used to call it a station.  And then, you know, I'd always get reprimanded by people like Hammers.  They said you got to stop thinking of it as a station.  It's a network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I could never call it a network.  I could never call it a network either.  I had a hard time saying network.  Network you think CBS NBC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's a channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So speaking of moribund websites that are back from the dead, Friendster just got a big infusion of money from Kleiner Perkins.  What's that all about?  Really?  How much did they get?  A few million.  It's like it was.  What's the story here?  I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think I know why.  Why?  I've talked in the past with some people over there about what they're thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The CEO left like a month ago and then get all this money from KP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have I don't know this.  This is pure speculation based on some things I've been told by a venture capitalist specifically from Kleiner Perkins.  They believe that the model of social networking that that you it's used by LinkedIn and Friendster and these other things can be kind of either split off or turn into some sort of a back end.  Or you can do something with it in such a way that every corporation can use it to develop customer relationships and it can be incorporated in CRM stuff.  So I think there's an ulterior motive here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's what's just what you were talking about in a way, Kevin, with DIG, except you're not doing CRM, but the same idea, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but Friendster, I mean, unless they have something behind the scenes that they haven't shown us yet, it's effectively a dead site, right?  I mean, everyone's jumped to MySpace for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're talking about the software, Kevin, not the site itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, but I mean, how hard is that to duplicate?  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you ever talk to some of these venture capitalists?  They can be buffaloed.  Yeah, we all went crazy.  You'll find that out shortly when you get the 100 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We really went crazy when Friendster came out.  What was it? 2003, 2002?  I can't remember.  And we all joined and everything and we got sick of it pretty quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, the irony to Friendster to me is that they pulled an exact same blunder that Pointcast did, which is not take the money when they had the shot at it.  Right.  They were also...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that and they just couldn't scale well.  I mean, part of the reason why so many people left initially was that they had such a hard time, like, keeping up with the demand.  So many people were joining.  You could never get on.  You were getting kicked off.  There was airs.  And then all of a sudden, MySpace came out of nowhere, had, you know, the ability to share music.  And then just the kids latched onto it and everyone jumped ship.  Yeah, it's a fickle market.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would.  It's scary in a way.  And, you know, you're a bold, brave guy, Kevin, to doing this because it's tough.  But at the same time, it's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little bit different.  But yeah, it's fun.  I bet it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet it's very exciting.  Do you sleep at nights?  Oh, no, actually I do now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't used to.  It's going to be scary.  Well, there's people who watch the site now.  Anything is G4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Golf Channel is owned by the same people that own G4.  Is it?  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Comcast owns a Golf Channel?  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, the corporate offices of the Golf Channel in the exact same place as G4.  You can be walking between cubes between the Golf Channel and G4 people.  Weirdness.  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  David was dating.  Weren't you dating a girl from the Golf Channel?  I wasn't dating a girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I went out with a girl once.  I went out on a date, maybe not even called that, from the Golf Channel.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you want to see your soul?  Oh, come on now.  Hey, you can take it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that means I have to now go back and edit.  Wait a minute, let me write that down.  You don't have to edit anything.  Just bleep it?  I'm talking about golf balls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is a podcast.  But Kevin, you should be careful what you say because I can come right back at you with all kinds of stuff.  Speaking of which, I know you can.  You know it's kind of funny you mention that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Remember the day we were up in the Golden Gate Theater over in Corte Madera?  Was it?  It was like two weeks ago.  And one of you asked me about GameSpot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Prager did.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I did.  I heard what they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I made a comment about it.  Well, it somehow got back to my old job.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did they do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nothing, but I just heard Tom.  Were they mad at you?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, if you say what you thought about the way the operation was run, where you worked, then you're being honest and telling people what it was like.  I've got news for you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know it's kind of hard to believe, but there actually are people listening to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, David's actually...  It's kind of stunning, frankly.  It was spot.  Yeah.  Just watch what you say.  Hey, let's get under the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's an article that was posted on the Delicious slash Twit site, which is kind of interesting.  I was wondering about how it got under the ESBN.org thing.  I put that up there.  Are you a big fan?  Because you say now you're going to put everything on ESBN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me explain what it is, and then you can tell me why I'm full of it.  So you all know about ISBN, the International Standard Book Number.  Every book, every publication, in fact, print publication in the world has an ISBN number.  It's a unique number.  And libraries use it for classification.  It's easy to find books that way.  You can use it on Amazon.  Somebody, I'm not sure who, has proposed an ESBN number, an electronic standard book number.  The idea is that just as there is an ISBN for print publications, there should be a 10-digit ESBN number for all audio, video, and images on the net.  And I think this is a great idea.  I think having a...  You know, all podcasts currently have a unique identifier for each show.  Often it's the link to the show, but it can be other things.  But there's no standard for this.  So I've unilaterally, going forward, going to make an ESBN number instead as our unique identifier, a legitimate ESBN number.  It's a little cumbersome because you have to upload a copy of the work to ESBN.  That's the only drawback to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it going to be like a meta tag that's embedded in everything, or something that you just assign to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in the RSS feed, and presumably down the road there would be tools to search and categorize and classify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is going to have to be a huge number.  Are they going to have to do it like IPV search?  Yeah, I misspoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ISBNs are 10 digits.  ESBNs are 19 digits, which is plenty.  That's a lot.  19 digits, what is that?  10 to the 19th is plenty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, I don't know.  It seems to me...  I have mixed feelings about jumping on every bandwagon that comes along.  Oh, I like to, though. You know me.  No, I know you do.  Which is interesting because it brings it up to the bubbling point where you can actually discuss it.  But it seems to me that I thought search engines were at some point going to eliminate the need for this sort of thing.  Why do you need to have this secondary system of numbering, which always turns out to be ISBN is a good example.  It turns out to be some commercial enterprise.  You have to pay a lot of money now to get those ISBN numbers.  It's kind of a ripoff.  And that's what concerns me.  I don't know, maybe the idea is good and might simplify things.  But it just seems to me that maybe search engines are going to finally collapse under their own weight and it will be useless in the future.  And I guess then you'd be laughing if you're not using this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is search engines only go so far with audio content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I say with audio and video you might be on the right track here.  Because although there's some audio search engines...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's Podzinger, Podzinger is incredible.  There's actually three. TVEyes, which has been doing this for years as a service for...  Like a clipping service for people with real TV stations is doing it.  BBN, Bolt, Berenick and Newman, the folks who practically invented the internet have their own service, which is called Blitz or something.  There's three of them.  And actually they do very well.  But you know, ESBN.org if you want to learn more about it.  They will also have barcodes.  You know, you're right, it could be the flavor of the month.  There is a Firefox extension that makes it a little bit easier to do it.  It's actually a good idea I think for bloggers.  Although again, it's not as necessary for bloggers as it is for audio and video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If it was for bloggers you'd need to put it to about 25 digits.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  We're already doing it.  You know, every podcast does it.  It's part of the RSS feed with a unique identifier.  But there's no global system.  So I just think it's good to have a global system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, on the Twitter website you have it linked to plagiarismtoday.com instead of ESBN.  Yeah, that's an article about it.  I never saw the site before but I got a kick out of it.  It says the name of the site is plagiarism today, exploring the wasteland of plagiarism.  I mean these guys going on and on about plagiarism.  Where's all this plagiarism?  What's he talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's actually a blog and it's kind of a funny blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean there's kids that steal from other people's papers but since when is that new?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's a lot of plagiarism.  I think cut and paste makes it very easy to take somebody's ideas and post it.  I mean that happened to me.  You know, we have a private forum for TWIT members now.  There's another brouhaha I don't want to go into.  But I...  So...  Jeez, I had a bad week.  What can I say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're going for punishment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it was something we should have done a long time ago and it's actually really a great place if you guys go in there you'll see.  Because we can speak freely, right?  So a couple of members cut and paste things that I'd said about the future of TWIT to Newsvine.  And you know, I said, that's not in the spirit of this.  They didn't put it in dig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they pulled it from the forum and then they ripped you off in other words.  They burned you.  No, it's not that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're getting burned by our fans?  No, I'm not getting ripped off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's that if you can't speak privately in a private forum it kind of makes the private forum not very useful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's only private if you have some sort of recourse to hunt them down.  Well, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're going to get a knock on the door very soon from the FBI.  But that's another matter entirely.  No, I'm just kidding.  Plagiarism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just kidding.  Yeah, some of you will take that out of context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just kidding.  I do have friends at the Secret Service.  You should probably just edit that out to be safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got a letter from somebody the other day and I'm going to post this on my blog probably by the time this podcast is out.  What would that address be?  Dvorak.org slash blog.  Some guy has...there's a website out there and some guy has actually done every imaginable benchmark on a hot AMD motherboard using 512K, 1GB and 2GB.  Oh, I saw that.  Yeah, and apparently once you get to a gigabyte it's just like hopeless.  You might as well just...you're just wasting your money by putting two or four gigabytes on these motherboards.  We've always said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Haven't we, Kevin, in all our benchmarks in the past, I think Patrick's always said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You guys have been saying this all along?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think it's kind of been an unknown.  You know, with all these new games coming out everyone's always saying, oh, you should have two gigs of RAM, you know, this or that.  There's bigger textures, you know, but I guess that's not the case.  I read that article too. It was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that it's certainly up to...you know, has been the case all along, which is there's a...you know, it's diminishing returns and it really diminishes quite a bit past a gig.  I think that's Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, actually it doesn't even show it's diminishing.  It shows that it just...it actually in some cases goes down.  Well, that could be, sure.  Because of the overhead, I suppose.  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably because it's trying to cash it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what about...did you see this eWEEK article Larry Seltzer is saying...or Seltzer, I'm sorry, is saying with IE7, ActiveX is dead.  Which is great.  Yeah, I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that would be great, but you know, I'm not convinced of this.  I mean, I think that they're going to...you'll see ActiveX 2 or something like that.  These guys are long-term subscribers of this concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ActiveX is one of the reasons that Windows and IE are dangerous.  It essentially allows any website to execute code on your computer.  I mean, real code, not scripted code, not sandbox code, real code, Windows code.  I don't know, I think this is not a bad idea.  Now, what they're going to do is they're going to build these capabilities directly into IE7, at least according to Seltzer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but what do you need?  What does ActiveX provide today?  Right.  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it allows you...it provides you something valuable, which is to be able to run code on everybody who visits your site's computer.  But that's inherently dangerous nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm saying as an IE user, let's just say you had IE installed.  Like, I wouldn't actively go out and look for a specific ActiveX application to install, right?  Well, yes you might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The virus scanners, the spyware scanners, Windows Update, all use ActiveX, and they kind of have to.  I mean, you could...you know, they're trying to write one of the, I think, house call in Java, but I think it's difficult because Java is so sandboxed.  You need access to the hard drive, you need access to the files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you need ActiveX to do all that, though.  I mean, why would you need for a virus scanner to have ActiveX, you know, use ActiveX?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's going to be more effective if it can run on your computer, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder how right...I met with the people from Rightly.  Yeah.  They live up in Porto Valley.  That's Java, I think, isn't it?  Well, I think it's...no, I think they wrote it in C Sharp.  No, they did.  They wrote it in Sheets.  The one currently in C Sharp.  So that would be ActiveX, then?  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  But they told me that they're going to recode it in Java.  So, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if that's true because I can run it on Mac.  So, I think that it...unless it's different on Windows, I think it must use Java.  Well, that's an interesting question.  I've been wrong about that point.  For all we know, it uses Flash.  I mean, I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This thing should have been...this ActiveX thing should have been killed years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not so...it certainly won't be mourned by me.  But the real concern would be if Microsoft puts the same capabilities into IE7.  I guess you could just not use IE7.  Hey, speaking of which, Kama Sutra, what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a big duck.  Everybody's thinking about the Indian Book of Love.  I wrote the...you know, I wrote that up as a throwaway column for MarketWatch.  You know, that was a crappy week for me, too.  Go ahead.  I hadn't had a decent thought all week.  I wrote that up, and my prediction was it was going to be a big duck.  And...  It always is lately, isn't it?  Well, no, my observation is that any time a virus or a worm gets a lot of pre-publicity,  like lots of it, like this one did, they always become duds because everyone updates and they check  and they're a little more cognizant and nothing ever comes of it.  And people stop opening attachments and that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know who got bit by Kama Sutra?  People whose clocks were set three or four days ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ah, that sucks.  I like to be ahead of myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you got to figure it's probably some noob, right?  Some guy who really doesn't know what he's doing.  And of course, that's who's going to get bit by Kama Sutra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When was the last time you guys got hit by a virus?  It's been like years for me.  I mean, for most people, it doesn't even matter anymore.  You have a virus scanner, it gets the updates and you're done, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a matter of...I don't think being hit, but once in a while something will sneak  onto the system and you usually catch it pretty early on.  It doesn't do any damage and it doesn't really stay there or linger.  I found something on my system.  Oh, actually, a couple years ago, remember when that worm,  that network worm was going around and it would find it,  found a port and got onto the machine with it and it would reboot?  And blaster or not?  Yeah, that got on one of my laptops and it took me like a few days to get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, we had an issue with, well, at least call for help  because I didn't have enough time.  But yeah, when that was floating around, I think three machines got affected  and I got a host.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To this day, if you put a Windows XP Service Pack 1 machine on the internet,  you'll get Sasser within two minutes, instantly.  Really?  Yeah, because it's like herpes, it's endemic.  It's just floating...  No, it's floating around the net all the time.  And if you put an unprotected machine out there, you will get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is actually, I just finished slipstreaming all the updates into a Windows install disk.  That's a good idea.  So now when I install it has all the, or at least as of yesterday, the updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did you use to do the slipstream?  NLite.  NLite's great, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the URL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For NLite? I think it's NLite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's free software. It's kind of a weird... NLiteOS.com.  It's designed so that you can... it's actually really more than just slipstreaming,  but that's the main reason people use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you can actually set defaults and turn off certain features that you don't want installed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Create a custom Windows install.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's great. I wish I would have done it sooner, because when I build a new PC,  I won't have to go through the hassle of... even though I actually keep all the updates on a separate CD,  I don't have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it pretty easy to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it took me... I mean, the biggest hassle really was just getting all the updates off the Microsoft site  and some of the weird patches and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to tweak your Windows to get it just as you want it before you do the NLite thing.  Hey, speaking of money, Sling. $46 million investment.  Sling Media?  Slingbox, yep.  Yeah, wow.  From Hearst, EchoStar, The Dishfolks, and Mobius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't get it.  Oh, I get it. Have you played with Sling?  Yeah.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah, it is, but I don't see that it's so proprietary that somebody can't just duplicate the whole concept in software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's the fact that it's just a box that sits on your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The box is cool looking, by the way.  I think that's the world's worst industrial design. I've never seen an uglier...  It looks like a... doesn't it look like a Toblerone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can look it up on dvorak.org slash blog.  It's hideous. John, what are you thinking? That's ugly.  I think it looks cool. It looks very German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does it matter what it looks like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you, it's a silver, plastic silver about the size of... it looks like a bar of gold bullion, right?  Except that it's plastic, and it's got the weirdest writing on the top, which is done like they took the plastic mold and they poked it with a pin to spell letters.  You know, my DVR.  And by the way, the technology is super cool.  I understand where you're coming from with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, they want it to look cool, whoever asked that question, so they can sell it at Best Buy.  So when people walk by, they say, wow, this is cool looking. I'm going to buy one.  Well, you certainly see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do they have any competitors? Because right now, I don't know any other way where you can get your average Joe to be able to basically log into your home television and watch whatever the hell you want to watch from...  Explain how it works, David.  I've never used it, but basically what you do is you stick...  I've used it. You want me to explain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, Leo, you explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can explain it, you can explain.  You explain it, David, and I'll correct you if you miss that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, you correct me here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can record anything you want from your TV, from what your TV is able to access from your provider.  And if you happen to be anywhere with an internet connection around the world, you can log into that box that's on top of your TV and watch anything that you've recorded on your local stuff.  So if you decide you want to watch the Giants game that's only broadcast on Fox Sports West and you happen to be in Thailand, well, you can watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're watching your TiVo, your cable, your stuff.  Yeah, am I right?  Yes. And the one neat... A+, David.  Yeah. Gold star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gold star, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, for bonus credit, the really cool, and I think the reason you're getting investment from these guys, the really cool app is if you have a Windows Mobile enabled cell phone, you can watch it on your cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they did that though, I think only as a result. There is a competitor called, I think it's Orb Networks out of Emeryville.  It's a pay-for-service and they kind of do the same thing, only they use server somehow. I'm not even sure what their architecture is.  But they're the ones who came up with the idea of showing it on the cell phone immediately.  I think that's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, along with that, Verizon has announced that basically they're going to have their own television network on the cell phone. Did you see that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what they're thinking. I don't get that at all. There's a lot of weird television stuff going on.  The one article that got me kind of interested is CBS kicking Google videos off the island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're going to distribute the video themselves.  Which I always wondered why, you know, CBS is... These networks, why are they going through iTunes? Why are they going through Google? They can just do it themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, luckily we've got Larry Kramer working there now and he at least knows what's going on. So I think he's behind this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, what people don't want to have to do is they don't want to have to go to Google Video to watch CBS shows, then go to iTunes to watch ABC shows. I mean, I don't want to have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess. I mean, it's the idea is to have it in a centralized place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, all you need is like a centralized site that links to all the other sites, you know.  A directory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean, right now for most podcasts, you can find Twitter on audio, you can find it on iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but you have to think about the DRM that's also included in that. I don't know, iTunes, they're rolling out so many new TV shows, it's unreal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That might be why CBS is worried that they'll be lost in the shuffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just bought Series 2 of Battlestar Galactica last night on iTunes Music Store.  The whole thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  What is it?  Battlestar Galactica?  Oh, that's right. You like that show.  Joe's awesome. What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you, Roger.  You just like the blonde chick.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's two blonde chicks. There's a Canadian and then there's that one other chick that plays the evil blonde chick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think was the one who used to be the evil blonde chick on the old show in San Francisco with the guy from Miami Vice.  Nash Bridges?  Nash Bridges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, she's actually going to host a version of... who wants to be a model in Canada?  America's Top Model?  America's Top Model.  That's a good show, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  America's Top Model in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  North America's Top Model. How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you laugh, but there's things like that all the time on Canadian TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, no, I've noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Canadian TV right there.  They had Canadian Idol for a while.  They do have Canadian Idol, but they also show American Idol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Canadians are wacky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Battlestar Galactica, do you watch it, Kevin, on your iPod or do you watch it on the TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, just on the laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see. So you buy it, it's in iTunes and then you just expand it in your laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just waiting for Apple's little device that I can plug into the wall and then stream it to my TV. That'll be coming soon, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and Airport Express with TV, video as well as audio.  Hey, are you sorry now that you bought that laptop on Christmas now that they come out with the new MacBook Pro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I got lucky enough to, I went to the Macworld for a day.  I popped my head in there and one of the Apple guys came up to me and was like, hey, I heard you bought a brand new laptop.  He's like, if you want to return it, just let me know.  Really? So did you?  No, I didn't, actually, because he said the wait time was going to be like a month and a half.  Right answer. It's the right answer. You know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Adobe just announced they're not doing any of their apps for Intel until 2007.  No way.  Apple's got to be dying.  Can you still run them on the new system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Will they open another app for Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to reveal a column that's coming up in PC Magazine.  See, John will reveal things.  I have to. I know I want to give myself publicity, that's the problem.  So this is coming up probably, I think, in issue four maybe, which should be out shortly.  And I know this is, I would have brought it up in the show when it came up as a topic,  but I know it might upset Leo because he was so concerned about them switching to Intel in the first place.  Watch out, I might hang up on you, John.  I actually, like you did with Patrick, it's, somebody sent me an email with a logical argument  and I followed up on it by adding to the argument and I've actually concluded,  and I don't know if anyone is going to like this, and it may explain, actually the Adobe thing fits right into this,  the Apple people, I'm not predicting this, I'm just suggesting it's possible,  that Apple may just drop OS X and go with Windows.  What?  No.  Are you goofy?  Yep. Wait until you read the column.  Alright, if they do?  Is there an argument in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they do, the only thing to do would be to give OS X to the open source community.  If they do that, I'm all for it.  In fact, that would be the best possible scenario.  Then I can continue to use open source and use OS X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, the logic of this is in the column.  But that's crazy.  You think it's crazy.  I think it's crazy.  I thought so too.  And then I re-read this guy's letter and I said, you know, and all these other little items fell into place  and the Adobe thing is right on the roadmap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's a problem for Apple because what Adobe is saying is we're not going to do a dual binary ahead of the next release.  Now, they just released CS2 of Photoshop, so it's at least a year off before CS3 or whatever they call the next Photoshop.  That'll be the first Intel version.  Even Jobs himself at Macworld Expo said Photoshop runs, but no professional would want to use it.  So, Kevin, if you use any of the pro apps that aren't from Apple,  Apple, of course, will update it theirs, but you might have made the right choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm happy with it.  I don't want to, you know, that downtime would kill me getting off the laptop and making the move to another one.  So, plus there's always that Apple, you know, first generation of Apple products that you don't want to touch because, you know, little bugs and whatnot.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree.  Although we're not seeing, I haven't heard any bugs and I have the Intel iMac.  I've been playing with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For the exploding power supply, that's my favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we won't see the MacBook Pro until later this month, but there haven't been any hardware issues yet.  Speaking of laptops.  Did they announce the battery life of that Mac?  No, not yet.  It's still a prototype, I guess, so they haven't.  But, you know, when I interviewed the guy for Macbreak, the product manager, he said it'll be roughly the same as the PowerBook.  So, and they did put a larger battery in it, a higher capacity battery.  AMD says, or Dell says, they're going to use AMD in the next generation laptops coming out for the spring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does AMD actually have a mobile processor that has power?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing like Intel's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's an interesting choice then, isn't it?  Well, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unless they're making gaming laptops or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or maybe they know something we don't know.  Poor Dell.  If Dell, you know.  Poor Dell.  Poor Dell.  They're just making the wrong, I mean, if you're going to go AMD, go desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, why are you going with, stick with Intel on the laptop side.  It's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like, what are you doing?  It's the exact wrong thing to do, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly right.  Yeah, the desktop, the screamers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that is a strange move.  They say that this would be the first step and then to doing it in servers and PCs.  Maybe you think it's to get a better deal from Intel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  I think the honeymoon's over with those two companies.  You know, the thing is that there's been rumors in the valley that Intel was so freaked out  about the numbers that Dell were producing and they were getting to be such a big customer  that they didn't feel comfortable because you don't want one big customer, right?  Right.  So they started to put this, my understanding, and this is just a gossipy rumor,  they were putting the screws to Dell, you know, not giving them the absolute best prices,  trying to slow them down actually from continued growth so they could not be so out of control  that they dominate the whole industry.  And so Dell, I think, finally got figured this out and so they say,  okay, well their deal with you guys is over, we're going to mix our processors from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey John, I want to keep you, I know you have a big real estate deal to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I take off, I'll be on the next broadcast with you though.  Okay, that's great.  And I'm sorry about being so critical.  No, no, I appreciate it.  Badgering you is not necessarily my idea of fun, but well maybe it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody had to, John.  See you later.  Are you hanging up on him?  Oh, that felt good.  I won't tell him what people were saying about him in the thread.  So Amazon shares hammered, profit drops in the fourth quarter, which is a big quarter for them,  43% the holiday quarter.  Not very good for Amazon.  Is that a surprise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I mean, for me, it's like, I think that people are now becoming,  it was one of those things when you first were getting online and doing shopping,  Amazon was the go-to place.  They had everything under the sun.  That was the store that everyone went to.  You told your parents to go there to check them out.  But now it's really, I don't know.  Where do you shop?  You shop other places now?  Yeah, I mean, I have a list of places now.  It used to be that it was kind of this strange world of online shopping  and you only trusted a handful of sites.  And now I have 20 or 30 places that I shop at online and I trust.  And I'm happy doing business there.  I haven't been to Amazon in I don't know how long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, with sites like Google, Afrugal, and Price Watch, and Price Grabber,  you just choose the best price, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what I was going to say.  I usually know the product that I want, usually.  I don't go to, I wonder if there's a lot of retailers that expect people to do actual shopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot of big chain, like just brick and mortar stores like Best Buy and Porter's  and Barnes & Noble, what they've been doing.  You've been issuing online coupons so you get like a discount that's as cheap  or even more favorable than Amazon's.  And all you have to do is print out their receipt and physically walk to this,  or drive to the store, which you know, if you're one of those people that has to have that.  You get it right away.  Yeah, you get it right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like, I still buy most of my stuff at Amazon, although I have to say I'm a little mad at them  because they just dropped my account one day all of a sudden.  And I had to create a new account, which was kind of weird.  And when they...  They're worried about your credit card.  Well, maybe.  But when they did that, they also dropped my Amazon affiliate account.  And I have links all over my site pointing to my Amazon affiliate account.  So I think I made too much money off my affiliate program and they said,  hmm, we better kill this.  I don't know.  It was, they, no email, no call, no warning.  They just killed it.  That's kind of weird.  All right.  You're a Linux fan.  I know, Kevin, did you see that Google not only is using Ubuntu, but confirms it.  It might even be the next Google desktop OS.  They're calling it Gubuntu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chris, Chris Debono came out and said that it's just for internal use only.  Oh, remember, because he's the Google.  Yeah.  Chris is an old friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He wants to be on Twitter.  I just got to get him.  Oh, nice.  His schedule is as crazy as yours.  So, but we're going to get him on.  Yeah, that will be a good time to get him on.  Let's talk about that.  Very cool.  So you don't think that there's a Google OS in the offing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's one of those things that they better hire a good graphic designer if  that's the case, because nobody's going to use the nasty Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's why CBS got off Google, to be honest with you.  Google video is just ugly.  It doesn't work well.  You look at it compared to iTunes.  It's just the pits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, the quality, it's like ASCII characters moving around the screen.  It's nasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I've seen Ascimation that looks better.  Yeah, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's kind of funny.  A lot of people that I know that want to like just want to see videos on the web, but not  necessarily like a full-fledged show, will usually use YouTube and they'll watch like  a clip of like SNL and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody's doing YouTube now.  Yeah, YouTube is going to be the next Yahoo company.  It's the next big thing, isn't it?  They're awesome.  They're doing really cool stuff.  It's like, it's almost like what a Flickr should be doing.  You know, Flickr, they're doing a great job at photos right now, but they haven't  got any video support.  I don't know why they haven't expanded into that.  They have to be working on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it interesting how something like YouTube just appears all of a sudden.  Out of nowhere.  Out of nowhere and within a few weeks, everybody's using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's because it's so simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all about the usability.  I mean, they created a very, very simple process for people to put their videos online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's viral because as soon as you get your first YouTube or your second YouTube  email or link in the web page and you go, hmm, what is this?  And you go to the site.  And if you if you have that issue, you just start using it.  There is no friction right now.  Everybody just does what works.  Right.  Happens so quickly.  I mean, that's it's kind of what happened today.  It was overnight, wasn't it?  I mean, not from your perspective, no doubt, but everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's only been about a year, a little over a year now.  So it's been pretty crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Serious win amp bug didn't last very long.  It was an extremely critical vulnerability would allow a hacker to execute arbitrary code on anybody's player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For the 50,000 people that still use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe that's why I didn't get a lot of press.  I thought it was because they fixed it so fast, but really it's because nobody cared.  I mean, you know, no, I just went up.  You use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you use when I have to probably.  Yeah.  Three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know.  I.  Nothing after three.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is an only inversion five point one two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's like nobody uses that even after a well bottom.  It was just like it just died.  It was just garbage downhill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happened to those guys today?  The null soft guy today.  Well, they're stoked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They sold.  They sold win amp for what?  Like two hundred and some odd million dollars.  Well, you're kidding.  Yeah.  I don't think they really care what's happening.  They don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess he is a llama farmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's got his llamas after all.  That's right.  Bill Gates proclaims yet another proclamation from the richest man in the world that piracy  in Asia has 10 more years tops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Software piracy, right?  Not not like high seas piracy.  I like the Somalian coast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where it's moving on Somalia.  Yeah.  There are still high seas pirates, aren't there?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that's actually growing.  Really?  It's it's growing in this in the southeast and off the Horn of Africa.  In fact, I think David was alluding to a news story where a cruise ship was set up on by  Somalis in gunboats.  You know, I'm leaving for the East.  It's not cool anymore, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Piracy?  It's not cool pirates.  It's not like swords and, you know, it's like rocket launchers and grenades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are closing the Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland for four months for renovation.  Maybe they're going to update it.  It'll be the Somalian Pirates of the Caribbean.  Pirates of Somalia, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Arr, I've got a rocket launcher and I'm not afraid to use it.  Yo ho, yo ho.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe not.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You might want to edit that one out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'll tell you what I might want to edit out.  This World of Warcraft story.  Did you see this?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there's millions of people playing it.  I'm so sick of hearing about Warcraft, but I'm interested about the news story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, a woman, Sarah Andrews, created a guild.  You don't have guilds on World of Warcraft.  Oh, I saw this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The banning of the guilds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The guild caters to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender players, or GLBT's.  She says, so she's recruiting people, which you do in your guild.  And she says, but we're not GLBT only.  We're GLBT friendly.  They banned her and they banned, they said, weirdly enough, because the terms of service are no, you know, you can't gay bash.  But they used that to say, no, you can't recruit.  Because all the guild members would be identifiable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe that's it.  I think that was their reasoning, that it would make those people identifiable to harassment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, I mean, the guy who's going around with a rainbow triangle and, you know, queer guild, it's not, that's okay, but just don't recruit.  I think it's don't ask, don't tell all over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who knows?  I mean, guys play female characters and females play male characters.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does it mean in World of Warcraft if you're an undead priest, a gay undead priest?  I don't know.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, when you're dead, does sexuality even matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, when you're undead, it might.  I don't know.  So that Google Napster thing, was that another one of those?  We're going to call it a dig style rumor now.  Another one, because Napster says no.  Google says no.  So analysts say, are you kidding?  Napster's going down the tubes anyway.  Who would want to buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who's the current owner of Napster?  Is it that Australian company?  Who bought Napster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I forgot.  Wasn't it Roxio?  Roxio, I thought.  Yeah, I don't know if they still own it, but that's who bought it.  Yeah.  And they just bought it.  That was a weird match.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, Roxio, what are you doing?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where is Sean Fanning these days, do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's working on his Ice Age project.  Or what is he calling it?  Ice Farm?  What is it called?  What is it?  Do you know what I'm talking about?  It's like a way of a clearinghouse for file swapping, file sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He wanted to go straight, basically, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's it called?  It's Ice something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ice...  Let me look in Wikipedia, because we know we can trust Snowcap.  Snowcap, that's it.  Snowcap.  Ice Farm.  Snowcap.  I know what you're talking about.  There we go.  It keeps track of music for copyright holders.  Basically, he's trying to say to the music industry, no, no, really, I'm a good guy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm here to help you.  He turned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm here to help you, not to hurt you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any other stories you guys have on the top of your list that you want to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well...  Well?  Well?  Oh, you see, you see, Apple finally...  The only reason this story sticks out is because a friend of mine, former guy from Tech TV,  did this little piece about studying how iPod and other MP3 players, media players, have  their volumes too high and they should put warning labels on them.  Right, right.  And he put that out and he got a lot of hate mail, kind of, from people saying, hi, this  is just the same thing as people complaining when they can't...  Sony came out with a Walkman.  And now it turns out someone's actually suing Apple.  Classic.  To have a class section on lawsuit saying that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they said that what they want is Apple to limit the iPod to below 100 decibels.  I thought it was limited as it is.  In fact, I think there's a hack that you can increase the volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, there's a...  I think in the French iPods there's kind of like a governor that lets you not turn it  up a certain...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In the European, I think...  So the American ones aren't capped.  Yeah.  Which is why they were popular with a lot of enthusiasm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the whole argument is whether or not they put this governor on it or whether they stick  a warning label that says, hey, idiot, maybe if you turn it up too loud you might lose some  hearing.  What?  I think they're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really think that's just like human civilizations headed down the proverbial toilet when people  are...  I mean, come on.  I mean, why do you need...  There's a lot of warning labels that are pretty obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think...  Doesn't Apple have a label?  Maybe not.  They should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You see, not to pirate software for music.  The problem, though, is when you give one of these as a Christmas gift to your kid.  Yeah, your kid, 12-year-old, is blasting it, I enjoy this music, and then all of a sudden,  10 years later, they're deaf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, I have ringing in my ears from when I was that age, and I used to go to rock concerts  and sit next to the speakers, because I liked how I felt when my head vibrated.  Nice.  And I still don't hear very well, and I guess I never will, because I don't think that comes  back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they have aids for that, right?  Like those little ones you can't...  Caring aids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's a very cool technology.  I wonder how long before we have...  Bionic ears.  I mean, I think we have a lot of different styles of glasses for seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, they didn't work so well, if you ever remember that one episode where you can  actually see through Jordy's eyes.  Wasn't so good?  No, it looked like that first generation IR imagers.  Oh, really?  I used to see...  It looked exactly like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's better than nothing, though, right?  Well, he wasn't a navigator or anything, was he?  He was an engineer.  What did he do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was an engineer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was the engineer for the ship and he hosts reading, writing, and teaching.  Yeah, he promoted literacy among grade schoolers.  I love that show.  I grew up on it.  Well, at least...  Did you really?  Gosh, you're so young.  I actually know my junior high, like seventh and eighth grade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Roger, you're comparing the potential of having an ocular implant to what the artists for  the Star Trek show decided to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he did have an ocular implant that actually bypassed his eyeballs completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, let me send you guys some of the first items from the Twit store.  We're getting close now.  We've got a Twit pen.

And we'll have t-shirts and, of course, the Twit hoodies got to be in the store.  That's a must.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it going to look like the ones that we see?  Identical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Identical.  Chris Siglin, who has been very generous, the guy who made the original Twit hoodies,  has given me the secret formula for the Twit hoodies so we can duplicate those.  And the big request for the next item in the store, bobblehead dolls.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, you know, Twit thumb drives would be...  No, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to try to get the rubber.  You know, seeing the rubber bands, it's a USB driver, rubber band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The bracelet.  It looks like the Lance Armstrong wristband.  Yeah, but it's a USB drive.  We're going to try to get those with the Twit logo.  They had a bunch of those at CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  So there's a...  Twit merchandise is almost upon us.  We should have done it by Christmas, but it'll be Christmas 2006.  You want a Twit headband?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What should it say?  Twit underwear?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the one that the lab guys are doing in Han Choi.  Yeah, Han Choi, Andrew Han, Diane Bozoda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's great.  Every time we bring up Diane Bozoda ever.  Yes, she was the one who played Fook Me on Austin Powers.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yes.  I didn't know that.  Was she in the lab?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, she played Fook You.  She didn't play Fook You as the other girl.  There was the two.  They were twins.  It's a Korean name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How very mildly insulting.  Now I have to take the clean tag off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think about that?  Now I've been getting a lot of heat for the clean tag.  So there's an explicit tag and then there's a no tag in iTunes Music Store.  But there's also a clean tag.  And since we were clean, I put the clean tag on it.  People said, no, no, you don't understand.  That's for lyrics.  That's for a song that was explicit but is no longer explicit and is clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, we put explicit on Dignation even though sometimes some weeks we don't even really swear.  You want to err on the side of...  Yeah, it's just like if something slips out, no big deal.  It's not that we're not dropping F-bombs all over the place.  Well, I want to make this family friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have a lot of kids listening.  So obviously that's...  And we don't need to use bad words like gosh.  Just no tag.  No tag.  No tag.  All right.  Clean tag is gone because it isn't clean anymore.  So no tag.  So wait, you don't...  Well, wait, if we put the explicit tag on and then edited it, then it would be clean.  Right.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So maybe I should just do that.  Sounds like a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I'm surprised Plan Words doesn't get...  I'm blown away that they got to name a movie, Meet the Fockers, and they advertise it everywhere.  They got away with that.  And stuck it on the side of buttons.  Well, at least have that one store that...  And they're screaming it and it sounds just like it.  What's that clothing store?  That's FCUK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, FCUK.  Oh, that's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What are we going to do at the Microsoft Store?  Oh wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait.  Oh shoot.  There is a Sony Store across the street.  We could do it there.  There is.  Yeah.  That would be fun.  Sony style.  Alright.  Hey thanks guys.
