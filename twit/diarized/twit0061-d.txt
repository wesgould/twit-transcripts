Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is TWiT This Week in Tech, Episode 61 for July 9th, 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want you, Will, to do this entire show in cockney rhyming slang.  Sounds much too much too proper.  That's your assignment. We have a great cast today and let's welcome from overseas,  a guy who's staying up very late to do this, Will Harris of bit-tech.net.  Will is here to fix us up because we did such a hash of the Conroe and Merrim discussion last  week. So we're gonna get the real skinny from Mr. Harris. David Prager is here from Revision 3.  Hello, David. Hello, welcome. Thank you. You're welcoming the listeners and I think that's nice  of you. Very generous with open arms. Robert Herron from dl.tv. Hi, Robert. Hey, how are you  doing? Patrick's not here. He's at awake. Oh, I don't know what that means. I mean, I know what  it means, but I hope it's nobody near and dear of any way. Our condolences to Patrick. And from  dvorak.org slash blog, the one and only wearing his rainbow haired wig, John C. Dvorak. I do my best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have your John 16 signed today? No, I, you know, I should start carrying that around,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think. I actually thought it was kind of interesting that the head of the FIFA Medical  Committee, FIFA is the world organization that sponsors the World Cup, is named Dvorak,  Dr. Jerry Dvorak, or maybe it's Ergy. It's J R R I Dvorak. It's probably Jerry. Any relationship?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never heard of him, but you know, probably he's probably from Czechoslovakia. It's the Smith of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Czechoslovakia. Yeah, pretty much. And then it probably is Ergy if it's Smith, if it's Smith,  if it's Czechoslovakia. Ergy Dvorak. Anyway, the reason he comes up is there was a news story.  This is completely, this is our World Cup moment in this show. It has nothing to do with tech,  but one of the reasons I, you know, I know, I just can't, we've got Prager watches soccer,  Will watches soccer, or football as others will call it, but I just can't get into it. One thing  is the low scoring, but the other thing is all this fake injuries. And as it turns out, Dr. Dvorak  says that in more than half the cases when a player received treatment on the field,  medical staff reported no injuries in their post-match reports. In other words. Yeah. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the other thing that's phenomenal is called diving, which is somebody, yeah, but this is where,  you know, this has been perfected largely in the NBA. Of course, nobody really pays any attention  to it. You know, where a guy flies, his arms go flying and he makes a loud thunk when he hits,  and you can't really do it as well on grass and make it too convincing, but they do it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it. Well, congratulations to Italy on their victory in the World Cup. I don't know if they

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  even need the doctor to prove this. I mean, if they're writhing in pain on the ground and then  they get up and keep playing, then obviously they don't need the post-game diagnosis of no injury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pretty obvious. Can I make a couple of personal comments here before I get the show started?  Yes. A couple of things we've done, I want to just get them out of the way because they're  still getting email about my request for the Icelandic Reykjavik Hard Rock. Yeah, I got a  whole bunch of letters from different people, including a number of people in Iceland who  listen to the show. We have a lot of worldwide listeners. It's wonderful. Anyway, unfortunately,  the Hard Rock in Reykjavik shut down a year and a half ago, which makes it a little difficult,  but this one guy, although I haven't heard back from him for a while, he says he knew the owner,  and there may be some of these old sweaters in a warehouse someplace. He doesn't absolutely know  for sure, but I think it's unlikely I'm going to get another one of these sweaters, even though  as cool as they are. One other note, on the Cranky Geek Show, I think a week ago, I wore the  Ronaldo Brazilian jersey. Of course, they lost to France. I'm just going to throw this out to  anybody out there who's listening from France. They want to send me a Zidane jersey. I'll wear  it on the Cranky Geek Show and point to it. You don't want to wear an Italy jersey? I don't know  who's the star on Italy's team. Yeah, somebody from Italy wants to send me one. I'll do that  the following week. Whoever gets me the shirt first. Whoever your guest is, if you're wearing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a Zidane jersey, you're going to headbutt him if you get upset with him? Right in the chest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not to turn this into the soccer broadcast, but this is exactly... I didn't see the game,  but I'm seeing now that it was tied and Italy won on penalty kicks, which is... See, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they should just do penalty kicks and cut the game down to 20 minutes. It's ridiculous. That

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  happens far too often in the game. We're going to get such email for this. I understand... Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  no. I think soccer... I mean, FIFA would agree that... That's a lousy way to win a World Cup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They should either play till somebody wins, although it's such a long game as it is. I don't  know if they could do that. Or just eliminate this off-sides rule and let them score. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's not as long as American football games. It's an hour and a half of running. It is as long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, the game's over faster. I mean, they got 15-minute halftime max plus 90 minutes of running  time. But they're running for an hour and a half. I mean, that's a lot of running. But I'm saying,  like, you know, an American football game takes a good three hours. These games are over...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because of the commercials. Well, I know. That's another reason it's not popular in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They keep stopping the clock. They don't stop the clock. Right. It just keeps playing. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  were pretty exhausted though toward the end of that game. Yeah, I don't know how they do it. I  really don't. I mean, they're clearly the best-conditioned athletes. I think the panel

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is merciful. I find it hard to believe anybody's better-conditioned than a basketball player.  Yeah, but they're freaks of nature. If you want to take it to the next level,  I don't think anybody's better-conditioned than a professional heavyweight boxer.  Well, that's probably true. That's probably true. You know. All right. That's pretty rough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to thank you for joining us on This Week in Sport. Lawsuits fly over Google Founders' big  private jet. I didn't realize that they had bought a 767. This is a jet that normally carries 180  passengers. It's three times as heavy as the conventional executive jet. Sergey Brin and  Larry Page bought this. It was a used one. It's from the Qantas fleet. And they're converting it  to hold 50 passengers, including, by the way, a special executive suite for the president of  Google, Eric Schmidt, a lounge in the front with two adjoining staterooms for the co-founders  farther aft. There's a plan, if you want to look at it in the Wall Street Journal of the jet. This  thing is talk about excess. So what are the lawsuits for? Well, the company that they hired  to do the Blue City Holdings is the company that owns it. And the company that they hired to do the  redesign, Leslie Jennings, a high end aviation designer. Apparently, it's not going well in the  transformation. This is the guy who did Paul Allen's jet. He also does the Queen's jet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Paul Allen's got a 757, though, right? Is that bigger than a 767? No, no, the 767 is  big. It's pretty big. It's generally an overseas plane. So just to be a plane that these guys could,  is a little more practical. I don't want to defend the fact that these guys are throwing money at  stuff like this, but it's a little more practical a plane if you can afford it than these little  private jets that don't really make, you can make a trip from San Francisco to Paris on a 767  nonstop. You can't really do it with too many other planes. That's a good point. And the idea,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  apparently, was that they would take, they want to take big groups places. So it's not just for  Larry and Sergey and Eric. I mean, it's, they want to take groups. Not just for Eric. Apparently,  Eric's got a nice little suite up front there. I bet he does. Well, didn't they say that one of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  them wanted a hammock hung from the ceiling? Now, that's the way to fly. And then the other one,  I'm sorry, I can't remember which one was which one, was having an argument over whether or not  he could have a California king-size bed in his room. And eventually, Sergey and Larry were like,  I want the king-size bed. No, I want the king-size bed. And Eric Schmidt had to step in and go,  look, you can both have king-size beds. Let's go back to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happened to the Hugh Hefner's round bed? They could probably get that in a little bit.  What do they need a king-size bed? I think they should all sleep in the same bed.  I think that's funny. Anyway, I'll put a link in the show notes to the design. Man, I mean,  we're talking just the most elegant thing you can imagine. A dining room, a playroom,  just very, very, I'd love to get a ride on this plane if it ever gets, if it's ever done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll get a ride. Will we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. We should do a twit from the plane. That's what I want to do. That's my goal.  Did you see that there are, the Emmys now have a broadband award for websites?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Emmys? The Emmys.  For websites or for broadband?  Does anybody think that the Emmys nominations were the worst possible nominations that could  have come up? Those Emmys nominations were done by a bunch of hippies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, apparently they changed the way they do it. The voters, the Emmy members as a whole vote,  and then the top, I think the top 10 vote getters are then narrowed down to the nominees by committee.  It's a smaller committee doing it. So that's probably why they're so, they're kind, they are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  kind of strange. Perhaps the nominations are for shows I never even heard of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cancelled shows in some cases. No, there's an Emmy award now for broadband news and documentary  programming. Well, let me tell, I will tell you. Let's see. For news and documentaries,  the New York Times garnered three nominations. Nicholas Kristof's multimedia presentation on  atrocities in Sudan. Oh, that's a, that's an exciting show. A pair of videos on the drug  policies of Bolivia's new president is a good use of multimedia and a seven part interview  series on child porn. Washington Post got two nominations, a web documentary on the effects of  corruption, poverty, and the history of authoritarian rule in Azerbaijan. And does this stuff interest  anybody in the four videos and the lives affected by Hurricane Katrina? That's good. Also nominated  MTV news segments. That's a bit of a change. You hear from child porn to MTV news segments.  MTV news segments and the National Geographic's webcasts on Katrina as shown on the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So these are all traditional print publications and newspapers that are getting these nominations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's interesting. Live eight. Yeah, these aren't very good nominations. This is terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And ESPN won a broadband sports Emmy in May for its off mics webcast. It doesn't seem like they  reflect really the most exciting or interesting stuff going on online, but this is the worst.  This show is a disaster. It's mainstream media. They just, they clearly don't get it.  They should clearly have a rocket boom on it. Do we want to even talk about this rocket boom thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  or should we just let it go on? I thought it was a fascinating story. I mean, like the amount of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like gossip and like it was like straight out of the, oh my God. Well, it's interesting. I think  it garnered more press than Star Jones getting fired from The View, which is a major network

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  television. Well, I think one of the reasons it garnered so much press is because those so  much inclined to be writing and talking about it on the web are the people that knew about it  or knew what it was far more than like the average viewer of The View. I was reading the dig

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  comments. It is. It's very inside baseball. I was reading the dig comments and a number of people  in dig, I mean, I would say half the comments said, well, I never heard of this show until this  happened. So let me just tell you people what happened. Rocket Boom, which is a video podcast.  We had Andrew Baron, the producer of Rocket Boom on the infamous Twitter 57, kind of has gone boom,  kind of like Kim Jong-il's rocket itself. Amanda, we don't know exactly what happened. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have some nice analogy. Rocket Go Boom. All right. Well, it's getting worse by the minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Amanda claims she was fired. Andrew claims she walked off. He said, this is the first I knew  about it. Any event, he's got a good, I think he's got a very good replacement. I might, you might,  know this woman, Will, because she's, she's from, I think, MTV Europe, isn't she?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's something. It's not MTV. It's like MTV Iceland or something. She's a Brit. Oh, she?  Yeah. I've never heard of her, but she looks quite all right. She's cute. People like Amanda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People like Amanda, but you know, I think this will be the test. It's a classic battle between  a producer and talent, right? Who's more important to a show like that? There's going to be, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a record audience tomorrow when Rocket Boom goes out because everybody wants to see what it's going  to be like. It's possibly the best thing that could have happened. I agree. Yeah. Some people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  said it was a staged publicity stunt. I mean, clearly it's not at this point. So the question  is, can Amanda go on? Jason Calacanis at AOL, another person who was on this broadcast, offered

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  her a job immediately. If what happened, has anything happened with that that you know of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not that I know of. Jason did a weird thing on his blog. I don't know why he did this. He said,  I've got a few minutes. Anybody want to interview me? And, uh, twit anybody out there? So I sent him  an email and didn't respond to me. So screw him. Uh, well, that's the weirdest thing in the, first

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of all, he has my number. Does anybody want to interview? Is that weird or what? That is so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you just said screw him on Twitter. He'll probably write about that in his blog against you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. Couldn't care less. Yeah, it's okay. As long as he has a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what we're learning. There's no such thing as bad publicity in the blogosphere.  That's for, that's for darn. It's all about the Google rank. Isn't it? Totally right. So I think,  I think Rocketboom will do very well if this new, and I don't know her name and I'll have to find  it, but if this new person replacing Amanda is halfway decent, I mean, people, let's face it,  people watch because Amanda was cute, right? It wasn't that compelling a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If she's an outrageous slur on the, uh, you know, journalistic and production integrity.  The thing is she was kind of charm. She had a certain kind of a nerdy charm. I think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  appealed to the larger 15 to 24 audience. She said something about her. It was a little stiff.  It wasn't as she just, I think that had, I think that was part of it. That was the charm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I'm, I'm just guessing, but I think it's, it's difficult because she, she hasn't,  I don't think being around long enough to be a sort of true personality, maybe in the sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's certainly, if it was her decision to leave, it was probably premature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She says, according to her, she has a video floating around. Yeah, I saw the video. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She says she was fired. Andrew, uh, hasn't spoken too much, but he says it came as a surprise to him.  He didn't think he fired. I know it's kind of, I hate to give it too much credence.  You know, there is a big story in this. I think was what Jason Calacanis wanted to be interviewed  about. AOL says it's going to be free. And I thought that was a shocker. AOL, uh, this is  according to the wall street. What does AOL charge for it? Quite a bit. I think a US 26 bucks for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  dial-up. This is not a pot. This is not going to happen. Well, here's the deal. I think it is. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  here's why. What they're saying, by the way, is dial-up will not be free, but if you're using  the bring your own access, in other words, you're paying for broadband and you're just paying the  $8 or $9, whatever it is, $10 a month to get access to AOL, that will become free. So the dial-up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How is that any different than what it is now? I mean, I can go to AOL.com and get my email or

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  whatever it is. That's true. You get a lot of those services for free. And I think AOL has been  moving in that direction anyway. But so do you get this? The question is, do you get the software  with its anti-spy or it's kind of cruddy anti-spy or cruddy antivirus? There's cruddy software,  frankly. You know, uh, you might get that for free. I think it makes sense for AOL to give this stuff  away. It has no premium value. It gets the value. Go ahead, Robert. I was going to say it gets their  name out there if nothing else. Are they, were they considering making dial-up access free as well?  No, dial-up is very expensive for them. I think they'd like to get rid of dial-up. They've raised  the price to the point where it costs more than broadband in some, in many cases. You know, I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  glad that they still have it. I maintain an AOL account just for the purposes of emergency  internet activity in situations where there's a problem. Somewhere where you had a power outage  once and there's no way to get online except on a dial-up thing. And it was kind of funny  because they hadn't gone up online on dial-up for probably a year or two. And I'm thinking,  oh man, can I even remember how to do this? And then I can, you can't get an AOL. You can't get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dvorak at AOL.com for free though. You have to be an AOL subscriber to have that. So I would think  that's the change. That's, I mean, apparently you'll be able to get that for free or if you  already have it, you can stop paying for it if you've got broadband. I have Dvorak at AOL,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but it's like, it's, uh, you use it for the access number to dial in if you're stuck somewhere. I  never look at the mail really. And there's no reason to, and it's just a box filled with spam.  I sometimes data mine it to see what the spam world's doing. If somebody writes me, I'll never

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  respond because I just never see it. According to this story by Grant Gross, IDG News Service,  AOL has been suffering a big decline in subscribers. In the first quarter of this year,  AOL was down 3.1 million subscribers from a year earlier to 18.6 million subscribers. Revenue down  7%. 13% fall in subscription revenue. On the other hand, advertising rates up 26%.  So it makes kind of makes sense is what's, what's, what's going to be profitable for them?  Eyeballs. Well, let's get those eyeballs up by giving it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, this is part of the consolidation where Comcast and, uh, and the Bell companies are  taking over the world. And AOL, what does AOL's role in that? I mean, AOL, what can they do? I  mean, they can't give you a DSL line or, uh, without work with one of these other guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're basically saying, hey, we're not, we're no longer an ISP. We're Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should have, do you know what they should have done some time ago? Start to work on mesh  networks and gone wireless or something. I mean, I don't know what, I mean, that's what they're  going to have to do to save the company because they're just going to lose everybody. That's  where Google's going. I'm going to have a Google's not, not going to get killed off if they don't do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  something. Right. These guys are. No, you're right. It's funny. It's been a struggle for them  since day one. AOL has just been so up and down. Do you think even as like a simplified content  portal, it, there's still no money even there. No, I think there is. I think that's what they're  doing. I think they're reinventing themselves as a, as a content company. And look, they've got time  that they certainly know content. They've got content. They've done very well with things like  live eight. Hey, they got an Emmy nomination. Are they too old media though? That's the interesting  thing. They don't see them. You know, Google's seen as kind of the hip thing. AOL seen as the,  you know, the internet for people who don't get the internet training wheels we used to call it.  And I think they're really trying to change that. I think one of the reasons that they give us  bandwidth by the way, uh, is to, is to kind of improve their image.  Well, they don't win out now, don't they? Yeah. They got that when they bought Netscape, they got  the null soft as well. They have a lot of good stuff. I'm telling you, I think, you know,  Calacanis is actually an asset to them. He's such a, you know, a stir up of trouble.  And I think, you know, he's a senior VP over there. I think he's the kind of guy who can go  into the boardroom and pound the table a little bit and maybe make them make some changes.  Maybe wake them up, wake them up anyway. No, I mean, I think, I mean, seriously,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're probably sleeping. Literally, you mean? Yeah. Yeah. A bunch of old guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, last week we talked a little, what last week we talked a little bit about, uh, Intel  trying to counter AMD by moving its Conroe, its chip up. They call it, it's the Core 2 chip.  And, uh, well, you were listening and you, you said we made a hash of it. In fact,  you weren't the only one. So one of the things I think we, one of the things I think was critical  that we missed is that Core 2 is a whole new core. It's, it's not the next, it's not Pentium 4 on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  steroids. No, no, it's like a whole different thing. I mean, I think there's been a few things  all around this topic all week. And one thing has been the sort of, um, AMD's stock price sliding

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on bad, uh, bad announcements. Um, well, AMD said that their, that their sales have been down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good time. Well, they're down from last quarter, but up on the same time last year. So think about  what you will. The difference is the question is whether they're down just because the market's a  bit slower because Intel's been going after them with massive price cuts. And the reason that Intel's  going after them with massive price cuts is because it's got a new CPU coming out next week.  Which is the Core 2 Duo in the desktop form. Now at BitTech, you've been benchmarking this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Conroe. In fact, you were the first really to tell us how good Conroe is. What is the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what is the latest on Conroe? So the latest is we just got three new chips in which represent,  um, the very top end sort of extreme edition chip, sort of mid range chip and the, and the  cheapest chips, um, version. And they're all, they're all pretty darn good. I won't repeat to you,  our labs guys were saying about them because I couldn't really repeat that on air, but, um,  it was very, very, very positive. Should we say? Did they say, what is that word now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cripes that we want to say? Cripes. Blimey. That's a corker. Blimey. That's good. It's super.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're under non-disclosure, right? For the next couple of days, I think you can break  the news on Wednesday or something like that. What's the 14th? 14th. So you can only, can you  summarize results without breaking your NDA? I can summarize for him. It's supposed to be pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  fast. It's a corker. Yeah. How about you Robert? Have you been playing with him at DLTV? I haven't  seen one yet. So, and the person who has seen it of course is on vacation right now, but he doesn't  want to talk. All of our initial testing shows there as fast as can be. Now, so here's the real  question. Faster than anything AMD currently has. That's the question. Better than AMD. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  absolutely. And I think AMD has got some initiatives that it's sort of planning over  the next couple of months. And it doesn't look like there's going to be anything really to take

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  on them, to take on the Intel stuff. The desktop is Conroe, the portable is Merum. Same kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  speed improvements? Yes, absolutely. I mean, the desktop ship previously was the Pentium 4 and  Conroe is such a massive improvement over Pentium 4. Merum is not quite such a massive improvement  over the previous Pentium M, but it's still faster and less hot. And it's definitely going to be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  killer, killer chip. Last week, Bill McCrone said that the pipelines are shorter. Is that one of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the features of the new core? Yeah, shorter and wider. So you can do a bit more in less time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like 64-bit wider or wider? Oh. What does that mean? Wider in a pipeline. Sort of things like you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  can do the sort of SSE multimedia extensions and stuff. You can now do like an entire instruction  in just one clock cycle rather than like one and a half clock cycles. Yeah, single instruction,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  multiple data. So you operate one instruction over a broad amount of data. I mean, if you check out,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll get the plug in. If you check out BIT.SEC, there's all the tech discussion of intricate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  details over there. Can I have a question? Did you guys, when you were analyzing the chip,  did you put it in? Because I know that the people at Ziff, from what I could find out,  because I wasn't there for any of these demonstrations, but they, you know, Intel  control a lot of the activities, even though I guess we got to look at the chip in some way,  shape or form ourselves. But did you put it into any real world tests? Because a lot of these,  the speed of this thing, from what I understand, is based on a couple of pretty much older  benchmarks or benchmarks that are as good as they can be because our benchmarking is just about  this much. Yeah, absolutely. So we-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're running on Photoshop or anything? Oh yeah. So we run them. We just sort of sat down  and we were like, you know, there's going to be some new CPUs, let's make some tests. And so we  basically wrote our own scripts, which involve Photoshop, iTunes compression, which is multi-threaded,  video compression, video decoding and multiplexing, all these various different kinds of things,  as well as 3D gaming. And it was faster in all of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about WordStar? Did you try WordStar? No, WordStar wasn't on my list, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure it's a real screamer with WordStar. But it really goes, yeah, it really goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, those dot commands in, you know, just incredible. Command K, control KS is like-  I don't even remember any of that stuff. You know what's weird? I do. It's like in my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  fingers still. You're the only- well actually, maybe some of those movements, I've noticed this  before and I've talked to other people about this. And I challenge anybody out there who's  listening to this show to go find a computer that's running Windows 3.1 and actually try to use it.  It's like you don't remember any of this craziness that you had to do. It had like-  It was pretty bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many people can remember how to navigate around DOS? Something dumped me to a DOS prompt  the other day and I was like, I need to get to this directory. What the heck is the command?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I keep typing LS in DOS, but I do remember a little bit of DOS. I do remember a little bit.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, the super secret in getting around DOS directory structure is you just,  you have to do the tilde, the first six letters, the tilde and the number one.  I hate that.  The number two.  That's stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because Windows could never, DOS could never recognize the Windows file names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate that. So well, that's good news. So it sounds like if somebody did not yet buy a core  duo chip, it would have been-  Oh man, hold off.  Yeah, it'd be worth waiting until next week for sure.  There's some rumor that Apple has been waiting for its high-end tower machines until the core two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely. So those are going to hit, I think fairly soon after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are those who have looked inside Apple's Tiger operating system who say that,  in fact, there's support for eight-way multiprocessing. So they think there'll be quad core two chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're going to use the server chips rather than desktop chips.  That would be a very fast machine.  A woodcrest and they are super, super fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be cool. Apple has dumped, by the way, its last Mac with a CRT.  I didn't even know they were still selling these. The E-Macs had a CRT monitor.  So now Apple's gone all LCD. Makes sense.  I'm crying.  Have you missed the CRTs? No, nobody misses them.  Not really. There are things about them I like, but  they're the things I don't like that I appreciate LCDs all the more.  Microsoft has announced it's going to support OpenDoc. I guess they've  complete reverse on this. In fact, this is from Bittek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were forced. Weren't they forced to do it by some government edicts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the deal? I got the story from Bittek. Will, you probably have a comment.  I was under the impression they were forced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it was one of those things where it was like, if you don't support it,  you're going to lose the sort of state contract.  Massachusetts.  That was one of them, I think. And so it's like, they're not forced by a court,  but if they want to remain competitive, they've got to do it basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get this. This blows my mind. Microsoft's making a plugin.  So there's PDF support, there's XPS support, and there will be OpenDoc support.  This is an open format, which means finally that you'll be able to read and write office  files in things like OpenOffice. They're going to host a plugin on SourceForge,  an open source plugin on SourceForge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so the plugin will be updated by the open source community rather than Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. I don't know. This is the new Microsoft. Is this because Bill Gates is retiring?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't see what the big deal is. I could always read these docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, no, it was always difficult to do the reverse engineering of office,  especially Word format files. I mean, they've done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The biggest problem I ever had was if you're using a document and someone does a bunch of  strikethrough where everything you edit is logged on the right and you can see what someone  has deleted and added and all that. The revision manager, yeah.  Yeah. If you open one of those that's been edited in MS Office and you open it within  an OpenOffice format, it just won't do it. It will not do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. This is good news. I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Open it, but you don't realize you're missing a bunch of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you won't actually get that data back by using this file format, will you? You'll just  not have the option to have it in the first place. It'll just be kind of a dumber format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but then if you save something, because I got a document that I had  like some lawyers looking over. And so I opened an OpenOffice and I made some changes and I  didn't realize that I didn't see the initial changes. So I saved it and sent it back and  deleted all the changes. It was a confusing mess. It took about a couple of days almost until I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  realized that OpenOffice, I shouldn't have been using it. I use RTF all the time. And in a way,  that's what RTF does. It's kind of a dumber format that everybody understands. It's a  Microsoft format. I don't know if this is... I can't picture an open document that are not having  authoring tools like that. It's got to have revisions.  Yeah. But the nice thing is, is that because it's an open format that it'll be used on  all of the word processor programs that people use. So you won't run into problems like what David had.  And that's the question. Will Microsoft support all of the features in Office  in this OpenDoc plugin or will it be a stripped down feature set?  Eww. If it's stripped down feature set, then big deal. They've done nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They need to support every feature. I'm absolutely sure that's exactly what'll happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In which case, who cares? I mean, that's what RTF does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why should they be spending their time for something that's not there? I'm not  so anti-Microsoft that I accept the fact that they should be doing stuff that there's no reason for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. Well, talking of Microsoft, how about the latest rumors of the fabled iPod killer?  Yeah. What a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You wrote a great article about this, John, in which you pointed out that the key factor  to the success of the iPod is its coolness. And that's something Microsoft will never have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no way. I mean, it's not only that, but here's the question I always would ask. I mean,  let's face it. These MP3 players have been around forever and they came out a long time ago. It  wasn't until Apple actually did some national advertising, serious TV ads, that the thing  became this dominant kind of creature. You don't see Microsoft's not going to do that. There are  trade organizations by comparison to Apple. They're not a consumer company.  No consumer electronics experience. They don't know how to do it. It's laughable that they  would even be a remote threat to Apple with this thing. It's just a waste of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did it with the Xbox, didn't they? And the Xbox 360. And the rumor is that the guy that headed  up the 360 project, J.L. Adler, is now the guy that's in charge of this iPod project. And I  think the feeling, like Microsoft, if all the rumors are true, is that if anybody can pull off  this whole consumer electronics thing, it's the guy that helmed the 360. They won't give them the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  budget. I'm really interested in this one. Now, I don't know if Microsoft said this or this is just  what leaked out and is what Gadget's saying or whatever, but according to the stories,  to attract iPod users, Microsoft is going to let you download for free any songs that you've  already bought from the iTunes music store. They can't make the iTunes songs work on their player,  so they're going to do the next best thing. According to Engadget, I find this very hard to  believe. They'll scan iTunes for purchased tracks and then automatically add them to your account.  I heard it was a limit of 20 songs. I find, how are they, how do they scan iTunes for what you've

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  bought anyway? You have to give them your account information, I would think. Couldn't it just look  in your iTunes folder? Yeah, but only for the stuff that identifies the Apple DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This opens up an interesting possibility for a website where you can trade your iTunes. Say  you already got an iPod, you don't want to buy this thing. You want to trade the songs to somebody  for five bucks, you can have my whole file and have the free downloads. See, this is what would

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  happen. The first thing would happen online. They can't do it though because the iTunes song  is registered to your account on iTunes. It even has your email address embedded in the song.  So you can't. You can't do it. The Inquirer, which is not necessarily the best source for this kind  of thing, says that Microsoft's volish spyware will scan the libraries and add songs purchased  from iTunes to your Microsoft account. The difference is the track will be in WMA format now  and you'll get them for free. I haven't heard that. So you heard that it was only 20 songs.  I haven't seen that Robert. So you see that's what they're saying now. That's what somebody told me.  I could look around. I don't even know how they would do it to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's crazy. I love how the only thing they've got is a ridiculously blurry image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's it going to look like? Is it going to look, is it going to be, I think that image is of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  UMPC. It's one of those mini PCs, isn't it? I think it's going to be, it's going to do video.  Screen and the iPod. It's going to be video. It's video is supposed to be a bigger display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And of course it's got Wi-Fi connectivity. I like that Wi-Fi idea. So it would sync up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're saying social networking as well over Wi-Fi. So I'm not quite sure how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I could get your playlist. No, that just means a direct, a direct link to MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've seen that. There's a phone with MySpace. Why don't you guys just write down all these

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  features and send them into Wikipedia under the word Cluj.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Toronto High School has expelled its Linux lab. I just, this is a really classic story that the  high school, the whole district has decided to go Windows. They're doing a Windows classroom  migration technology initiative, the CTMI. And there's one lone teacher who has a little lab  in his classroom that's all Linux. They've asked him several times to get rid of it. He goes to  lunch and the head of the school wide services for the district comes in and installs Windows  on all the machines. And the guy comes back from lunch and all his Linux machines are running  Windows. That's pretty harsh. Isn't that cold? I love that story. Typical though, isn't it?  Oh, whatever. This is a clueless school district that says, well, it's Windows. It's got to be good.  Everybody's using it. Why would you use such an inferior technology? Yes, this is Linux. How could  it be any good? It's free. That's just stupid. This is the strangest story. I think people should

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  try to read this story because it's one of the weirdest stories I've ever read. And it's almost

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hard to believe it happened. Oh, if you've ever dealt with school boards over computers, I don't  find it hard to believe. I've been trying to get my local school board to use Macs or Linux for a  long time and it's very difficult. They're very much into Windows, you know. It's probably down  to support and they have no money to have anyone to maintain. It is about support.  Perhaps the teacher who was running that one particular lab. Well, that's the thing. This  one teacher says, I'll keep it running. I'll do it. I'll do it. No, it's all Windows. But it's too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bad because that's not the good message for the students. Who's on this school board? Ted Stevens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Windows is a series of tubes. It's tubes. You think it's a truck? It's not a truck. It's tubes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gosh. I love the fact there's t-shirts of that now. Oh, they're everywhere. Oh, it's so great.  You can go and grab pictures of lots of little tubes lined up from an old valve amp or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's done more really for the cause of net neutrality than anybody. We've all been trying  to promote this thing, but all it took was Senator Stevens to say it's a series of tubes and that's  it. Boom. It's all over. Genius. Security expert Bruce Schneier in his log on July 7th pulls up a  Navy patent for what he says sounds like a firewall. The US Navy patenting firewalls.  It's not a patent yet, but it is a patent application.  In a communication system having a plurality of networks, a method of achieving network  separation between first and second networks is described. Surely somebody already owns a patent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on a firewall like Cisco or someone. It sounds like it'll just get blown out of the water.  Here's a better story. ABC looks to restrict EVRs. This is a classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you believe this? This guy is a... Yes.  Yes, but this shows you exactly how clueless these guys are. The president of advertising  sales for the ABC television network, one of the big three networks in the US,  says, I would love it if the cable companies, the MSOs, during the deployment of new DVRs are  putting out there would disable the fast forward button. He said nobody uses it. He says it's useless.  He says nobody cares. Oh yeah. He says, well, they're in the same business of selling ads as we are,  so they should be for this. When people say, but don't you think that would be hard for them to  sell these DVRs if you couldn't fast forward through commercials? He said, no, no, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's not why people get DVRs. Well, they're not selling the DVRs. The DVR comes with your Comcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  subscription type of thing. Yeah, but don't you think if you got a Comcast DVR that didn't have  a fast forward button, you'd run and buy a TiVo? Then I'd go and buy TiVo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Then TiVo should be all for it then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, TiVo should be saying, yeah, go for it Mr. Shaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think they're saying like, we're basically raising a generation of people that don't watch  ads on their TV. So instead of addressing the issue, like making the ads better, making them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  less intrusive, making them more effective, no, just take out disabled is a fast forward button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, this is a hopeless situation for these guys because the fact of the matter is the  people aren't watching, or they're watching less and less commercials and the commercials  are getting less and less effective because of it. You can't force them to watch.  You cannot force them to watch. But you know what? It's all going to lead to,  the way I see it is it's going to be, and they're going to just have to do this. And it was done in  the 50s. If you can watch some of those old TV shows on TV land, they embedded the commercials.  That's what we're going to do on podcasts, don't you think?  I think, yeah, I think embedding is what's going to happen. And that's,  you can't really fast forward because the things, you know, sneak up on you. I mean,  that's what product placement is all about. It's pretty hard to, you know, when a guy is drinking  a Coca-Cola during the middle of a movie scene, I mean, you can't fast forward past it because you-  They also-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or make it so fast that they just don't have time to respond to it.  And make it of interest. If you put commercials in that people are products that people are  interested in buying, they're going to listen. It's of information. I think that's, you know,  there's, I don't know, I can't remember what the number is. Something like $80 billion a year  spent on advertising on the networks. This money is going to be heading towards us, I think,  towards podcasts, towards other non-traditional forms of advertising where, you know, if you buy  this podcast, you buy a very specific audience. We're going to start next week. Dell is going  to be starting to advertise on-  Saying that for a month.  No, it starts next week. It's official. And it's going to be an obtrusive. There's no way I could  put a Dell commercial in the middle of the thing, but we're going to encourage-  Doing it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you like Dell, John? I think Dell's a fabulous computer company.  Well, that not you mentioned, there's a Dell story floating around on our list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I'll be honest, I wouldn't, you know, except, you know, I'd be very,  I've already turned down a lot, a number of advertisers that I didn't think fit to it.  And I think that the key for advertisers is to find, put your ads somewhere where people  want to hear your pitch. Otherwise you're wasting your time. You're talking about this concept  PC from Dell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I think, you know, we should probably talk about it next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they selling it? This thing looks like a boom box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what it is. It's a wild looking thing. I mean, they've made a couple of weird  looking machines recently. They obviously have somebody that-  It's the Alienware. Well, they acquired Alienware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, the Alienware. Yeah. That's what it is. Obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This game is amazing.  They certainly think like, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It really is a concept. It's like, you know, oh, you know, the little-  They're going to sell it.  ...bubbles on top. And you're basically like, oh, I can pull out my graphics card and just slot in  a new one or I can just pull out this, you know, little, you know, chassis extension,  which contains my processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a modular computer. I think it's a great idea. Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't need power. And it's like, I think it's going to end up with one of these things like,  you know, I can just place my phone on my desk and it will automatically recharge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you think it'd be cool though, if it were all hot swappable? Could you make it hot  swappable so you could just, you don't have to turn the computer off. You just swap modules in and out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you don't have incremental upgrades. You never have-  That is too much juice.  ...architectural paradigm shift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could do it with the hard drives. In servers, they have hot swappable hard drives.  You just plug them in while the server's running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. All that now, don't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So I think that's what they need to do. Make these- look at it. I mean,  these- I don't know. It's a cool picture. I don't know if they're going to sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, but I think that what we're overlooking here is the possibility that maybe  concept computers, which they've, you know, they made a run at over the years, you know,  Intel's done it, could be like concept cars in Detroit where you actually get to see some  pretty cool things that maybe they make one or two of. And it's like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that was always the idea from when an Intel did these, you know,  design forums where they would have crazy- it was exactly like that. It was like concept cars.  This, though, sounds more real. I don't know. This is an article from BitTech also. So Will,  you probably know more about this than we do. But they're going to call it the XCS.  It'll be an Intel ATI lineup, they think. Maybe CORD 2. I don't know if this- is this picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what they're planning to sell? I think it's a rendering. I think it's one of those things like,  this is what we'd quite like to do and maybe it'll happen in like two years time.  And would anybody buy it if we did? Are you looking at the tubular looking computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's totally tubular. And they said, yeah, it is, isn't it? They said it's designed by

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Matthew Ritter, who was the Alienware guy, right? Yeah. We used to do this on the screensavers.  Didn't we bring in people with concept PCs and stuff and show-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they'd bring in people that did their own custom mods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We did the mods, but I think we had some concept PCs as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really? I mean, the most I've ever seen is someone take a motherboard and build out  something that- some combination that- I mean, I don't think anyone was writing up  their own drivers for things and putting in something they hadn't seen before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As yet, I've never seen one of these concept PCs actually go into production.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So maybe- Well, back at CES this year, in fact,  Dell unveiled a concept of a 20-inch notebook. Oh, this giant-  Which you can now put up. That giant-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a tangible thing. They did, they're shipping that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is meant for production. You can go and buy it.  Yeah, that is the goofiest thing ever. So that's one anyway.  You're right. That one made it. And maybe it shouldn't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey Leo, you mentioned screensavers. You know that there's a bunch of old episodes up on  YouTube or Google now. Are you familiar with that?  Yeah. Somebody wrote me a note saying that you're making a dollar on each one of those.  You're the one that's posting them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, first of all, they're not for sale. If they were, they would be immediately taken down.  We are selling Call for Help, the Canadian version of Call for Help, for a buck, but I'm not-  That's where that story came from. I don't get a buck for each of them. Google gets, I think,  30 cents, 35 cents. Well, it's good for anybody that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For anybody that missed screensavers by virtue of not being geographically convenient.  I don't think it's anywhere near all-  I can watch Leo talk about 2004's news. It's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's nowhere near all the episodes. But there's some fun things. There's the one,  you remember this David, where Kevin blew up the computer with thermite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, half the reason I'm seeing all these stories is because DIG put up their whole video section.  That's where I'm seeing them too. That's right.  And so, of course, obviously a lot of the DIG users, or a lot of the original DIG users,  were fans of stuff like the screensaver. So they're the ones that are probably even  submitting half of these videos that they've captured themselves and putting that up on  YouTube and saying, oh, here's this cool video. Now, you know, G4 does own the rights to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  name and to the show and could stop it. They could do a DMCA request and stop it. We have  to pay them to call the show Call for Help. And I've been telling the Canadians, stop paying them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why are you paying them? Doesn't Comcast G4 own part of the Canadian broadcast thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They own a third of it. They own a third of the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why? Are they paying themselves then?  Well, they get a third of it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Well, that's kind of weird.  But they don't get all of it. You have to license this stuff. And apparently it's not that cheap.  I keep telling them Canadians, they do it because I think because they're one third owner.  I keep telling them, don't call it Call for Leo. It doesn't matter what it's called.  Why are you paying for that name? How about Leo for Help? That's a good name.  Help Leo. You know who was a little upset was Google. Want a little help here from Miriam Webster.  It's always an issue when your brand becomes a generic word. Kleenex and Xerox leap to mind  in both companies. I hate that. Popsicle. Google, I mean it is a lowercase G Google. I'll Google  that. Let me Google it before your daughter goes out on a date with somebody. You Google them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they're worried that Google is going to go the way of the frisbee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Miriam Webster is including the word Google, lowercase G. It's a verb in their dictionary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I liked the other ones they were putting in there. There are a couple of ones including  himbo, which I thought was great.  What's himbo? I never heard of that.  I never heard of himbo before now.  It's a vacuous man.  A bimbo, a himbo. Get it?  It's a bimbo but a bloke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the Miriam Webster people are going to the wrong bars. I never heard that.  I never heard it either.  I guess in England you say Hoover instead of vacuum?  Absolutely.  We don't do that here, but apparently that's another example of a brand name becoming a verb.  I think it should be in the dictionary.  Has that ever happened before?  Where? What happened?  I mean where a company's trademark name becomes a word in the dictionary.  I think so. I think Kleenex.  There's got to be tons of them.  I think Popsicle. I think Xerox. I think Hoover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure Xerox is in the dictionary.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  As a verb.  Xerox hates it, they're always filing lawsuits against people who say, you know, I Xeroxed.  Oh, give up.  You didn't. You photocopied it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they try and I'm sure Google will, you know.  Oh, and here's another word besides himbo, mouse potato. I've never, I don't know about that.  I don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never heard that one either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a guy that spends more time in front of their computer.  Overweight PC users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're like a couch potato, only they're a mouse potato.  But I've heard it, but it's not in widespread use.  AOL owns instant messenger.  Really?  So if you ever have to use that in print, you have to say instant messaging application.  Not instant. Oh, that's interesting.  Huh.  Is that because they bought ICQ? Because ICQ predated AIM.  Maybe.  I must have got that as part of the package with ICQ, which is the only reason  I would have even considered buying ICQ.  They never really did anything with ICQ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think the ICQ people ever use the term instant messaging.  Oh, really? Maybe it is from AIM.  They'll remember it.  They might be from AIM.  It's always called ICQ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were, their big thing was internet dial tone.  That was the phrase they used at ICQ.  They were, we're going to be the dial tone of the internet.  I never go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I guess that's what they become.  In a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you guys see this thing about the next-gen DVD formats falling foul of print screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love this. They've cracked it within a month.  Within a month, they cracked this.  It took that long.  Amazing.  The deal is you have to do it on a computer and you pause it at each frame and press the  print screen button.  You're saving basically screen capture and then stitch it together back as a movie,  but it's a full HD movie.  To what end though?  Well, to steal the movie.  The thing is it's easy to automate.  It wouldn't be so hard to write a program that did that.  True, but then you'd have to sync the audio somehow and then  are we going to do an analog rip of the audio?  That's an interesting question.  Are you going to squeeze that down to DVD resolution to make it playable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just an example of the fact that it's so ridiculous to imagine this stuff is never  going to get cracked, but I think what was perhaps more interesting about the story was  that the immediate reaction from the people making the players is,  oh, we've got to force out a firmware release.  Because of course all these new players have internet connectivity, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, now we know why they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can force a new firmware upgrade on you so they don't have to…  so that any time it changes they can just upgrade the content protection system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can't do that on Samsung's Blu-ray disc player though.  There's no firmware updates on that?  Well, there's firmware updates, but they're not forced and it's not a network connectable device.  Oh, that's interesting.  There you go.  Well, I mean, there's an increase… sorry, go on.  Could they put it on the disc and before you're able to play the disc it would say,  oh, I'm sorry, your player has to be upgraded.  That's what they would do.  That's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sony does with the PSP, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  You can't play this movie until you upgrade your firmware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Speaking of these players, have you seen that the company Ricoh has a new optical  drive that says it's capable of reading and writing both HD DVD, Blu-ray, CD and DVD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hallelujah.  Cool.  Where do I get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It says the device will be demonstrated at the International Optoelectronics Exhibition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you play movies on it or is it just for data discs?  I don't know.  I would think that you could play movies on it.  No, I bet you can't.  I bet you can read it, but you can't play the movie back.  That would go to John's assertion that they're prevented from doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What would keep it from doing that?  It doesn't have the proper decoder?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In order to play the movie, you'd have to have the DCSS or whatever that...  Licensing.  The license.  You'd have to have a license for the decryption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it looks like a device that has a lot of potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet you it reads the data and I bet you that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doing a lot of stuff.  It just sends a code.  What I see it just says it finds a way of reading it.  It doesn't mean that they can produce a commercial product.  It's obvious that that's what's going to have to happen one of these days,  but I think there's going to be a ways to go because it seems to me that somebody should have,  especially Samsung, who promised that they were going to do this and then they said they  weren't going to do it, they would have done it.  I mean, it seems to me this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to happen because not enough people are going to buy the thing and finally Sony  Panasonic and Toshiba will have to come to the table and say, okay...  They may see a couple of years though.  There's no incentive for Samsung to do it right now though because it would just kill sales of  their current player and it would probably go against some deal.  The incentive would be when only a thousand people or 10,000 or whatever that number is,  buy these things and the rest of the world says, I don't want it.  And I think that's what's going to happen.  How the prices will fall eventually.  I still wouldn't buy it.  I mean, the media itself is already pretty cheap.  It's 20 bucks for most Blu-ray movies.  Why buy a recorder?  25, 30 for most HD DVD.  I'd buy a writer for my PC, but I'm not going to buy an HD DVD player or a Blu-ray DVD player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if they were 99 bucks, Leo?  So you'd buy one of each?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't think consumers will do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They would for 99 bucks.  I bet not.  If they have a HD screen, they would.  I mean, I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they resist the idea of having to figure out, okay, I'm going to go buy this disc.  Which player do I put it in?  I don't know.  It's a good point.  Maybe they will.  But it seems like that's the kind of...  It'd have to be pretty cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I still like the idea of the one, I guess, as a Warner, maybe somebody else thinking about it.  Oh, you flip it over.  Selling DVDs because people still buy those and then you flip it over.  You already have your HD DVD on there.  That's not a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a great idea.  It's going to take something like that.  What do you think about this?  Google Checkout.  Has anybody played with Google Checkout?  It's a new payment plan from Google.  Kind of like PayPal.  Who accepts it?  I think a lot of people will accept it.  Okay.  It's a better deal for vendors.  They've already got LL Bean, I think.  They've got some big vendors.  Of course, it's a chicken and egg until consumers start using it.  But I use it.  You trust it.  It's cheaper for the retailer.  I think...  And credit cards?  Yeah.  I mean, it's just like PayPal.  It's a safe payment.  It's PayPal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because like the big vendors, you don't do PayPal.  You just pay with a credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they'll have...  There's incentive because if you have the Google Checkout button on your page,  then Google gives you...  What happens with the AdWords...  I haven't seen any yet, but I'm told that the AdWords will have a Google button,  Google Checkout button in the ad.  So there is some incentive.  You get a little bit better ad, you know, kind of visibility if you do that.  Let me search for something.  Cargo pants.  You wear cargo pants?  Oh, yeah.  Don't you?  They got lots of pockets.  Yeah, no, I don't see any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought you'd be looking for a Utila kilt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Still have one?  I don't have a Utila kilt.  Patrick got me to wear that once.  I'm never wearing it again.  I'll tell you.  Because I went to commando.  Well, we had a kilt day on the screensavers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I think I walked past you guys doing that.  I walked past your stage and it was kind of freaky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really freaky because Martin did not look good in a kilt.  Back me up on this, right, David?  He did not look good in a kilt.  He really should not be wearing it, especially the black socks and the wingtips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a photo on the web pretty easily findable of everyone from that day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I wasn't wearing underwear because Patrick told me that's how you're supposed to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure you get to an art stop on that.  Well, there's a straight line we're not going to get to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then at one point I got so giddy I spin.  And what I didn't realize is those pleats really catch the wind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't want to hear anymore. You're making us sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can we go to him? I want to ask David what you made of this.  The thing about the Friendster getting a patent on social networking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, what did I say?  Friendster got a patent on social networking.  Friendster may actually have some value if this patent holds.  They were awarded on June 27th.  It's very general.  It basically says it covers online social networks.  And if this patent works, they can go to DIG, they can go to Linkster,  they can go to all these other people and say, hey, pay up.  We want a little license fee for our social networking.  Flickr.  Just think of how valuable that patent could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know what to say about that.  I haven't read it.  Half of the Web 2.0 websites are based on being able to have the interact.  Some of this interactivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just started. I moved my blog over to a beta of Vox, which is a new service from the  six apart people, the guys who do movable type and type pad.  It's a really nice blog.  But one of the key features of it is social networking.  You have friends that you link to and stuff.  They'd have to pay a license fee too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the URL, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  vox.com.  And my blog is leoville.vox.com.  Or just click the blog link on any of my pages that goes there now.  It's nice software.  They have ads on it.  leoville.vox.com.  They have ads on it.  But it's not blogging software.  You wouldn't want to use it, John.  I think anybody who's a professional blogger probably wouldn't.  But it's kind of to compete with blogger.com for a free easy.  To get a valid T blogger.  Yeah, it's great.  And it's very simple.  But I like this social idea.  I think that a lot of sites can benefit from the kind of social networking.  I certainly hope Friendster, if they decide to enforce this patent,  doesn't get creepy about it.  Well, you know who they make a bunch of money from?  MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was interesting?  They have to have specifics.  I mean, there has to be something specific in the patent that you can show that people  are infringing.  I don't think you can't patent an idea.  And so there has to be a mechanism.  There has to be some technology.  And so they have to only go after people that they can claim.  It could be software technology.  Not saying it's not that.  But it can't be just anything.  I mean, there's been these kinds of things like MySpace have been around for a while.  Oh, here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the deal.  I've been looking for the description of the patent.  The Friendster patent's main claim applies to networks that limit relationships to a  certain number of degrees of separation.  For example, you can't connect to somebody who doesn't know somebody who doesn't know  somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, that sounds just like LinkedIn.  That's LinkedIn.  That's LinkedIn.  But that's not a whole bunch of the other ones.  It's not MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because if you know, basically on MySpace, anybody who connects to anybody on MySpace  is your friend.  I mean, I have like 36 million friends on MySpace.  And I mean, it's pretty easy to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I got your new blog up here.  I don't know.  I don't see where the social networking is.  But what the heck is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's what?  It's the, well.  Oh, it's just I'm playing with it.  You know me.  I'm not a blogger.  Oh, that's just some video.  I'm not a blogger.  I just play with these.  I play with this software to see how it works.  But it's very easy to upload videos, mo blog, pictures from your camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just giving you.  It was just some happy Canada Day video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's a happy Canada Day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Canada Day is July 1st.  And I was just celebrating because I'm on an area, Canadian.  I spend one quarter of my life in Canada.  And you spend a lot of time up there.  I like Canada.  It's very.  Oh, everybody likes Canada.  The climate's salubrious.  It's not that bad in Vancouver.  Yeah, Vancouver's beautiful.  Well, you're just you have a house just over the border, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I go to Victoria quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to Victoria in August on the cruise.  Is that anything you recommend in Victoria?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In Victoria, Victoria is probably the best city on the West Coast.  I mean, I don't think anybody who's ever been there doesn't enjoy it.  It's a small, small compact little place, but it's got like a little Chinatown.  And it's got like a little theater district and it's got the hotel.  It's amazing place.  And it's got the gorgeous Capitol Building.  I want to have a very, very pleasant place.  I want to go to Roger's.  Roger's chocolates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, all right.  You don't have to convince me of that.  Is that Roger with an apostrophe S like Roger Chang's chocolates or is it?  It's just R.O.G.E.R.S.  You won't have to convince me of that.  I'll be there.  Stephen Hawking posted a question on Yahoo Answers.  Do you think Yahoo paid him to do this?  I think they must have.  You can post these questions on Yahoo Answers and then you get answers, right?  His question, how can the human race survive the next 100 years?  But what's funny is I guess any moron can post an answer to it.  Because like the number one answer is they'll live underground.  Number two answer is get rid of nuclear weapons.  Number three answer, one day at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, I think the number two answer is the best one right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's that? Get rid of nuclear weapons?  You can't.  It's a start.  Yeah, right.  It's a no-brainer.  21,000 answers to Stephen Hawking's query.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doesn't Google Answers work where you have to put money forward to whoever answers your question?  Yeah, but this is Yahoo Answers.  Oh, it's Yahoo.  I thought you said Google Answers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They give you money to ask the question.  I'm sure they paid him a thousand bucks or something.  Why would he?  I mean, do you think Hawking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I'm saying like Google Answers.  You have to pay money to the person that provides you with the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Yahoo Answers works differently.  I'm not sure.  Welcome to Yahoo Answers, a new way to find and share information.  So I guess you ask the question and then anybody can answer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then everyone just says 42, 42, 42, 42.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  I kind of doubt Hawking would do it for money.  Why would he do it?  It's clearly a publicity ploy and it's worked, by the way.  I mean, he could probably work in his book or something.  Nothing.  Nothing.  There's no plug here or anything.  Maybe just looking for an audience.  I have a guess.  I have a guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  Girls.  Girls.  He wants to meet chicks.  He can meet some chicks.  The guy is like a girl hound.  Well.  No, in fact.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's awesome.  I've heard that too.  More power to him, right?  Concur.  Really?  How can he be a ladies man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To read that.  Rehab of his biography stuff.  I'm talking about it off the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Read interviews that he's had when people ask him about that topic.  I am a ladies man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he has.  And that's a good way to meet women.  Cartoon women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see that?  I was going to say, there was something.  There's something I was just looking at a video the other day and somebody.  I think it was even on the John Stewart show or some place or maybe it was Colbert.  And they showed him eyeballing somebody with a leer that was like, whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now he's got Lou Gehrig's disease.  He can't control his leader.  Oh, he has ALS.  I'm sorry.  He has ALS.  Well, I understand that.  He was on Star Trek too.  Amanda Cogden is going to go work for him as a nurse.  So.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's his muscular dystrophy that he has.  I thought he has ALS.  No, I'm pretty sure it is.  All right.  He did.  The fact is that he's lived longer than most people with it.  It's kind of unusual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's brilliant physicist.  You know, we've all read his book.  We're his biggest fans.  His book is probably the most owned and the least read book of all time.  The brief history of time.  Everybody owns a copy, but how many people actually read it?  You can't read it.  I have one with pictures.  I have one with pictures.  It's really it's easier to read.  Comic book version.  I still can't figure it out.  Let's see.  Any other stories before we lightning lashes, iPod packing teenager.  Ha ha.  Perfect response.  That's all we need to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The earbuds were the lightning rod or something.  Oh, guess what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get hit by lightning when wearing wires going into your head.  Bad things can happen.  That's probably a good bad idea.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we didn't mention with the Google Checkout that one of the funny things that happened  is that eBay refuses to use it.  Oh, that's right.  They have a safe payments policy and you can't until they add a pay  payer to your safe payments policy or safe payments plan, you can't use it.  They had to change it though to accepted payments because they didn't want to apply  that Google was unsafe.  So they've said because Google doesn't have a substantial historical track record of providing  safe and reliable financial and or banking related services.  And Google, meanwhile, says this isn't a beta.  We've been doing this for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think there's any reason that eBay has to knuckle under to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a competitor with PayPal.  I guess that's why they wouldn't do it.  Although I just think it's funny that they changed it from safe payments to accepted  payments so that there would be a lawsuit.  They can always argue the security side of things too.  That it's insecure?  Well, just to make sure it's like my bank for the longest time, every time there was  a browser upgrade, you just never suddenly couldn't log into your account.  You had an older browser or using an alternative browser and they finally wised up that.  And then maybe it was partially to keep a little stick at Google for their thing.  But I think it's also just a valid thing.  It's like they didn't know how secure Google's current payment system is.  So you don't want to just open that up.  And it's just a little too close to PayPal for comfort.  One last story to get John's blood pressure up before we wrap this thing up.  The Department of Defense is monitoring email messages from college students who are planning  protests against the war in Iraq and against the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy  according to surveillance reports released last month.  Are they ensuring our First Amendment rights?  They are protecting...  Just making sure?  They are protecting...  I don't know.  Making sure every word gets through, nothing gets lost.  While the department has previously acknowledged monitoring protests on campus as national  security threats, it was not until recently that evidence surfaced showing that the department  was also monitoring all emails submitted by campus sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  More reason to use PGP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  PGP.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happened to the right to protest in this country?  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You still have the right.  They've always been doing this to protest.  Oh yeah, absolutely.  They keep an eye on them.  They take movies and then they try to identify them.  I don't know what the point is.  It's not like I've seen people lose their jobs or anything over this.  Or I guess if you work for the government, it's probably not a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a picture somewhere of me on the front page of the Santa Cruz Sentinel  in a war anti-war protest.  When was this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wasn't the war over by then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh heck no.  That was the mining of the Haiphong Harbor that we were protesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, that's before my time.  Yeah right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What were you doing in 72?  All right.  That's the problem.  Who knows?  You don't remember.  If you do remember, you weren't having any fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Much of a blur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any other stories?  Any other twits want to cover?  It's too hot for us to do a long show today.  I'm burning up.  Seriously.  Oh, it's a hot day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Beautiful though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I drove through the Central Valley today on the way to drive my kid to camp.  It was 106 degrees in Sacramento.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Awful.  I think the only thing that I've got is that I just discovered the photo of all you guys in the kilt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not cool.  Yeah, I'm going to get that picture and blog it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somewhere there's a video of me spinning in my kilt.  I stopped in the nick of time.  That's all I can say.  As it were.  It moves.  Yes, as it were.  It did move up very quickly.  I just warn anybody who wears a kilt, no spinning.  Don't get giddy and start spinning.  Congratulations to Italy on their win in the World Cup.  Thank you very much for joining us.  Will Harris all the way from Great Britain.  It is where it is now, 2.18 in the morning, I believe.  I'm going to go and get some snooze.  Go to bed.  Everybody should read the reviews at bit-tech.net of Conroe and Merrim.  You'll actually have numbers out when?  The 14th?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  14th, next Sunday.  All right.  We will be right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's actually the 16th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, maybe I'm lying then.  I thought they said the 14th they'd be at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Keep your eye peeled for them.  Those numbers will be.  They'll be there.  Cripes, they'll be amazing.  And it'll be a corker.  They'll be super.  Corker.  Dvorak.org.  Dvorak.org slash blog to see pictures of Martin Sargent in a kilt.  I've got them right here.  And all sorts of other stuff.  You put those on there, you're going to get blocked again by the anti-porn filters.  Maybe.  Maybe not.  It's not exactly porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're wearing yours is like blue.  It looks really more like a skirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please.  We prefer to call them kilts.  To DLTV and Robert Heron, it's representative.  We thank you for being here, Robert.  Hey, my pleasure.  What's coming up on DL.TV?  Anything exciting in the next couple of shows?  What's all we doing this week?  You know, I'm not sure.  We're in the middle of building the new studio.  So that's been cutting into Showtime lately.  How exciting.  That's redecorating with steel and.  Wow.  And rust, simulated paint.  Will you have a spiral staircase to nowhere?  I don't think we're going to.  You know, maybe.  But I, uh, that'd be a great homage though.  You know, it is still around.  I know who I know the guy who has the staircase.  He's I have this 57 inch LCD.  I just want to stick in behind us and use that as like a backdrop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See if I can get away with it.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Final on that thing.  Wouldn't that be nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I recorded it in HD.  It was beautiful.  Every blade of grass, every penalty kick.  David Prager, revision three.com where someday soon new products will emerge.  Every time David's on, he says, yeah, any minute now.  I know how you feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Come on.  I was on last week and then I hadn't been on for previous to that for about a month or more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm actually getting hate mail now because I haven't, uh, uh, released the new site.  People are actually mad at me for not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why you don't announce stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I know I shouldn't have said anything.  Everything takes longer than you think.  When's the new site coming, Leo?  No.  Well, I could say it now because it's good that we were holding off for the Dell campaign.  The Dell campaign and the new site are launching simultaneously on Thursday.  And there will be some bumps.  The new site is, it still has a little, you know, a few problems with it, but  Is it Drupal still?  Yeah, still Drupal.  It's really, it's going to be very nice.  Very cool.  Very it's working fine.  We've got all the old data into it.  We just have to make the port over.  And unlike, unlike Kevin, a dig, I don't have a team of  crack engineers to do this.  So I'm not going to say nine o'clock in the morning on Thursday.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you see their new about page on dig?  You can see the little pictures of everyone.  Oh, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They needed to do that.  I think.  So yeah, that's in that.  And the next time we can join, we will actually have a commercial from Dell in the, in the mix.  So I'm very happy about that.  And you know what that means, guys?  Paychecks.  So I'll be asking all of you for your social security numbers.  We'll do that off the air.  Tech.  Another twit.  My friends, my twits, are you ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
