And I think it's actually been, believe it or not, a good year for journalism.  But it's also an important year for us to solve these thorny problems  of how to make journalism work in the internet age.

So I'm trying to bank up some money.  Anybody who comes to my house, you want the Wi-Fi password?  That's going to be a $10 charge also, okay?  If you share the Wi-Fi password with somebody else, you're responsible for their $10 charge.  I'm just putting it out there to the public so everybody knows the rules.  You got to make a profit.  I understand completely.  It's not about making a profit.  I just got to pay for this Netflix when they start slowing me down, start charging me extra  for Facebook.

Transcript:  So of course, Thursday or Friday, Thursday I think it was, the FCC passed the long-expected  revocation of the net neutrality regulation that had been put in place in 2015, the Title  II regulation, and basically turned back the clock on net neutrality.  It's been interesting to watch the reaction.  Just as the vote did, it does kind of break down along party lines.  There are a lot of people, I even had a conversation on the radio show today with somebody who  said, but you don't want the government to regulate the internet.  Of course you don't, but that's not what we're talking about.  We're talking about the government regulating internet service providers.  I think maybe part of it is ideological.  There are certainly people who don't want regulation, don't like government regulation.  I can understand that.  In fact, I remember the debates that the Electronic Frontier Foundation had over whether they  would come out in favor of a regulation, of a Title II regulation of the internet because  there are certainly people on the board there who thought that no government intervention  in the internet was needed or necessary.  I loved Larry Lessig's tweet.  I'm going to see if I can find it because I think he kind of crystallized it for me.  Certainly Larry has the standing to comment on this.  Let's see, he's at L-E-S-S-I-G on the Twitter.  Let me see if I can find his tweet here because I think it was a good response to people who  say, wait a minute.  We don't need government regulation.  We haven't had it for years.  The net did just fine.  He made the point that, well, we have had net neutrality.  The net was born neutral.  There it is.  There are plenty of laws protecting net neutrality from day one.  He was responding to Ted Cruz's statement, which I think reflects accurately the conservative  point of view on it.  Let me see if I can find it so I can read it.  I see it on the screen, but I don't have it here.  Should I skip by it?  He's been very active.  There it is.  Ted said, snowflake, believing online propaganda.  Here he quotes the quote snowflake, OMG, without net neutrality, the internet is gone.  Informative observer, says Ted Cruz apparently.  Ted, you know, the FCC issued that rule in 2015.  The internet grew up wonderfully free of government regulation and this restores the status quo.  Snowflake, never mind.  It's kind of nice Ted can have conversations with himself in which everything works out  well.  But Larry pointed out that the ignorance in this tweet is astonishing.  The net was born neutral from the beginning.  The FCC and others fought to keep it neutral.  The 2015 rules assured its neutrality.  Then the clueless or corrupt took that protection away.  If you think that there is reasonable argument for some government regulation, keep the water  safe, the air safe to make sure that the butcher scale delivers a pound of hamburger for a  pound of hamburger and not three quarters of a pound of the gas pump gives you a full  gallon when you think you're paying for a gallon.  Then you might agree that we need people to keep an eye on businesses like the internet  service providers to make sure that they follow the rules.  I think of the FCC as a referee representing our interests in the face of business whose  interests face it are to make money.  And that's how we want it.  We want businesses to be profit focused.  What went wrong?  Why are we sitting here with something that has been protected since day one on the internet  gone?  Let me, I'll start with you Harry.  And by the way, if you think my analysis of this is mistaken, please set me straight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well we have a chair of the FCC who was opposed to the 2015 law.  I mean that's the most fundamental.

Start time: 536.50
End time: 595.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what happened was we had net neutrality.  Verizon sued the FCC saying you don't have the standing to do this.  Congress didn't give you permission to do this.  And the courts were very conveniently said to the, the judge almost whispered it, by  the way, you have the authority but only if you declare that internet service providers,  broadband providers are common carriers.  You can regulate common carriers.  You have to declare them common carriers using Title II of the Telecommunications Act.  So the FCC went back, debated it.  Big comment session.  And I think at first, Tom Wheeler, who was the chairman of the FCC, didn't like this  idea as a Republican, didn't like this idea, but he was convinced, okay, Title II regulation,  that's the tool we have as the FCC.  We're going to do something we call light touch regulation.  We're not going to take advantage of all the features of Title II, but we are going to  use it to ensure net neutrality past that in 2015.  And that's been the law of the land.  But there have been previous things.  In fact, prior to that, I remember AT&T got a fine from the FCC because they blocked FaceTime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There were several cases.  There was an ISP that prevented Vonage telephony calls from going on its network, and they  got in trouble too.

Start time: 604.10
End time: 627.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were very concerned.  You know, the concern was that companies would use their position as an internet service  provider to block competitors or to try to extract more money by saying, we're going  to charge Google or Netflix more money to reach our subscribers, a toll road, to prioritize  traffic in some way.  And so the idea was that the FCC is the referee in this matter, and we'll try to keep that  fair.

Start time: 628.52
End time: 641.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the case for this not being a disaster is if companies that do that sort of thing  and abuse their power do get in trouble because there are any trust issues with things like  AT&T preventing a competitive service from running?

Start time: 642.54
End time: 665.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure, if you have any trust regulation.  Chairman Pai said we're going to have the FTC monitor net neutrality going forward.  The FTC said we don't have the technical chops to do this.  We have an enforcement arm.  The FTC could step in if an internet service provider says you're going to get 20 megabits  down and you only get 10.  That's unfair advertising.  But there's a lot of technical behind the scenes stuff.

Start time: 666.28
End time: 684.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  The scary thing is there might be stuff we just don't know about happening.  And Pai's video, which he made, which I assume we'll talk about, kind of glossed over the  stuff that we need to be concerned about and suggested that if Instagram works, then there's  no issue here, which is not true at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute, let me pause for a moment.  Internet freedom?  He's restoring internet freedom?  Well, that's good news.  I'm in favor of internet freedom.  It's actually the freedom for internet service providers to do whatever they want.  Freedom for Verizon and AT&T and Comcast.  Not the freedom, no, our freedom, their freedom.  Okay.

Transcript:  Oh, by the way, they love using the Obama name.  And that's one of the reasons I think a lot of people think, oh, this is from 2015.  This has been the status quo forever, as Larry Lessig pointed out.  This is not Obama era.  Painting it with the Obama brush is a way to get some people to say, oh yeah, we want  to get rid of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He just spent that amount of time trying to make a serious case for his stance.  Yeah.  You know, Ben Thompson gave the best case I saw for this potentially not being a disaster,  but he's one of the few people I've seen who actually knows what he's talking about,  who...  Ben...  ...went into it with a somewhat open mind.

Start time: 845.94
End time: 851.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ben realized that he used the wrong headline for his article.  He said, well, Ajit Pai is right, and he actually wanted to change that.

Start time: 852.00
End time: 856.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Ben's piece is long and complicated and full of subtleties.  I could sum it up.

Start time: 857.68
End time: 861.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ben's piece says, if there's competition, you don't need the FCC to referee this.

Start time: 862.08
End time: 864.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there's not enough competition in this country.

Start time: 864.92
End time: 871.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's not competition, period.  And Ben's in China, maybe he doesn't understand that.  Dan, what do you think of all this?  What's your opinion?

Start time: 873.88
End time: 967.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, God, the insult to your intelligence that this represents when people like Pai make these statements,  they're just false.  What's at stake here is really, really pretty simple.  And that's going to be who decides what bits of information get to your devices and my devices  and the public's devices in what order, at what speed, or whether they get there at all.  Do you decide, do we decide out here, or does Comcast decide, or Verizon, or Time Warner Cable,  or whatever they're called now?  That is really what's at stake.  And as of this week, barring court overturning it, and certainly Congress won't, it's the internet companies,  the carriers, that will be able to make those decisions.  And I think one of the problems with all this is that it has become partisan, and that's just mysterious.  Because I would have thought Republicans would favor a world of competition, and now they're voting for a world of no competition.  Because in a lot of places, there is absolutely none, or at most, two real competitors in a market.  It's very, very puzzling.  And we're going to, over time, I think, see some terrible impacts from this.  It's a bad day.

Start time: 971.82
End time: 1011.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Ben says we should, I mean, I really want to clear Ben's name, because he's not against net neutrality.  He's not a Pi sympathizer.  Nor is he. He says, allow me to state this point plainly, I'm absolutely in favor of net neutrality.  To believe Chairman Pi is right is not to be against net neutrality,  rather is to believe that the FCC's 2015 approach was mistaken.  Now, I think Ben's misunderstanding what Agit Pai's agenda is.  It's not to change Title II regulation.  And by the way, I think it's safe to say we all agree that there's no question that broadband providers are not information services,  that they are in fact Title II style carriers, right?

Start time: 1011.82
End time: 1017.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Comcast certainly thinks it's an information provider, because they're buying all these movie studios and TV networks and so forth.

Start time: 1017.40
End time: 1029.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that does muddy the waters.  But to the degree that they are in that position, that makes them even more of a danger, because they are now playing both sides.  They're competing with YouTube.

Start time: 1030.08
End time: 1037.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And AT&T would like to be a content owner.  They'd like to own Time Warner.  So yes, it totally is the lot of us.  Is that what this is about?

Transcript:  Is that these guys are becoming content providers and they want to kind of tilt the playing field?

Start time: 1041.54
End time: 1056.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that's part of why it's so dangerous, because they are competing with the other companies whose bits they are delivering.  And they have a much larger conflict of interest if they'd much rather you watched their streaming service than Netflix or YouTube.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am 1000% in love with that man.  First of all, snowflake, that video is not meant for me.  So it doesn't insult me.  It doesn't make me feel bad.  That's a marketing ploy to pander to doofuses that will believe him.  That's not me.  That's not the base.  I usually generalize.  You don't gram your sriracha Cheetos.  I don't even know why that made you feel any which way but loose.  I mean, if you are, then you're too worried about Instagram.  That made you feel some sort of way.  Who cares about that video?  That video, that statement.  It's marketing to people that don't know any better.  I personally understand one that this was a vote and a change.  You can appoint another chairman when you get another president and you could change  things again.  So maybe you have to suffer for a few years, but legally things could change and happen.  So it's not like this is the last thing that's ever been done to the Internet and it's the  way it's going to be for the rest of time.  I personally appreciate this administration.  I appreciate moves like this.  And I'm going to give you a perfect example why I have a friend.  I have a friend, I'm not going to say his name, went to high school with him.  He is a pothead, works hard, got three kids, great guy, but he just likes to play video  games and smoke weed and take care of his family.  Now he's researching Net Neutrality, FCC.  He's reading articles and calling me.  He knows about the budget, the tax bill.  He knows about the education bill.  This is a guy who wasn't registered to vote until this year.  35 years old, he's lived his life, never voted for anybody, never read nothing, never cared  about nothing.  Now this person, like a lot of people, are like, whoa, whoa, whoa, because now this administration  is so, the news is about political shows, so I'm trying to make it real simple.  This administration wears its heart on the sleeves.  When past administrations, they'd screw you over a little bit, but they were smart about  it and they'd pat you on the back, make you feel good, so you accept things.  This administration is a bulldozer that is for sale, and people can see that it's blatantly  for sale.  And so now more people that are regular average Americans want to know what's going on, because  when you see Net Neutrality on the internet, people that would have never cared before  now care, because they're like, whoa, wait, what?  So personally, like I said, I'm not super worried about it.  I'm just going to charge my $10 for you when you come to my house, start stacking up these  chips just in case they start messing up.  Because again, people don't understand when they say, oh, and there's competition.  I live in a small town.  I just moved across town.  This town is the smallest town in New Jersey.  On the other side of town, I had Fios and Verizon.  I always had Verizon.  I moved over here.  There's nothing but Comcast.  I can barely even get Dish Network out here because they just don't come out here because  nobody has it.  Everybody has Comcast.  So some places don't even have two options in any part of their town.  That's the difference with cell phones.  Cell phones, yeah, everybody started giving out free unlimited internet because anybody  could go get anybody's cell phone.  That's the difference.  Everybody's cell phone.  That's what competition is.  You're like, oh, man, everybody's moving to T-Mobile because they're giving away Netflix  and free internet for $40.  Next thing you know, Verizon, who's been killing people for years, is like, all right, we'll  give you a crappy unlimited $45 plan.  Is that happy?  You make you happy?  So like I said, I'm super excited about these times.  I'm not that worried about it.  I'm not that upset about it.  That video is amusing to me, but it doesn't upset me because I have faith in the future.  I like the fact that people are riled up.  I like the fact that people care, and when they care, they vote.  And when you talk about Republicans, Republicans do what they get paid to do.  What lobbyists tell them to do is what they do.  Parties and principals have changed.  They're not what they used to be.  Now we are a country of funding.  And when you get funding, that's what you buy by.  So let's cut off the funds.  Let's cut off these votes.  I agree.

Transcript:  If we can change anything, we want to change.  Long term, the only...  And by the way, it's not just Republicans.  Democrats take plenty of money from the Trump.  Oh, yeah, no, no.  I understand.  I understand.  I think the only...  And by the way, Larry Lessig, who we were quoting earlier on, feels the same way.  Remember, Larry was...  He ran for president in 2016.  Didn't really do very well.  But he had for a long time been campaigning against digital rights management, copy protection  on music and so forth.  And he realized he's never going to get anything done in Congress ever unless we got campaign  finance reform.  We need to get money out of politics.  So he ran for president in 2016 on the strangest platform ever.  He said, if I get the nomination, I will pick a really good vice president, somebody who  should run the country, not me.  My only job...  If I get elected, day one, I will do campaign finance reform.  You're never going to get the people who benefit from the current campaign finance laws to  change them.  And of course, that's Congress.  He said, I will do campaign finance reform, resign, let the very good vice president run  the country, but we will have made a huge difference by taking the influence of money  out of politics.  I don't know how doable that is.  I doubt it'll happen in my lifetime.  But I guess the one thing...  I like it that you're an optimist, Owen.  And I guess the one thing that's optimistic about all this is exactly...  You're exactly right.  Is that all money buys you is votes.  The reason politicians need to raise money is they need to campaign for votes.  The ultimate currency here is not dollars.  The ultimate currency is your vote.  And if more people vote, more people become informed, and more people participate, then  I don't have nearly the worry that we have today.  I agree with you, Owen.  I think it's very optimistic.

But you can lock a lot of bad stuff into place in a real hurry, and watch what, for example,  the administration and the Republican Party are doing with judges.  They're locking in a generation or two of extreme right-wing judiciary, which is not  likely to be on the side of things that we're talking about.  So I'm optimistic only in that one level, but I think we're in for some pretty difficult  times ahead.

You need to make up your own mind, but I think we've made a strong case for why we believe  that there needs to be somebody playing referee in this game.  Getting rid of the referees is not the answer.  Letting the ISPs, the broadband providers, decide what's good and what's not is not the  answer by any means.  We'll be back.

You don't mind, do you?  No, I can stay there.  Oh, and JJ Stone.  He is also here.  Even though he is not on, he wants everyone to know he is not on medication.  No, not today.  He's here anyway.  I'm good.  He's suffering along with us.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  I know that interest rates are starting to go up.  The Fed has raised them a quarter of a point.  I think they said they're going to do that three more times next year.  Maybe it's a good time to look at refinancing your house, lock in that low interest rate  you've got or even a lower interest rate.  Maybe you're ready to buy a home.  Now is a good time to do that.  And either way, I want you to remember this.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twittoo.  Bookmark it.  Save the day.  Put a little post-it note on your screen because when you buy a house, the biggest  purchase you're ever going to make, you're going to get a mortgage unless you're doing  really well, in which case you don't need this ad.  So you can just go have a cigar and burn some money.  But if you're going to get a loan to buy a new house, you want to make it, you're a geek,  you want to make it easy, you want to make it fast, you want to make it simple.  You want to get the right loan for you.  And that's how Rocket Mortgage works.  It's created by Quicken Loans, best lender in the country.  Number one in customer satisfaction on mortgage approval, mortgage servicing.  Mortgage approval, eight years running.  They just got the JD Power customer satisfaction number one award again this year.  I think that's awesome.  And because they're so technological, they're a very savvy company, they realized that the  mortgage process was really kind of 19th century.  They thought we need a technological revolution that's client focused, that's easier, and  they created Rocket Mortgage.  You can do everything online.  You don't have to go to the bank.  You don't have to go to the attic and get paperwork.  You don't have to find your pay stubs, your check statements.  All of it can be done on the phone.  And because it's computerized, literally on the phone, in a browser on the phone, it's  computerized, it's very easy for you.  Answer some basic questions you know the answer to.  They have trusted relationships with all the financial institutions, so they can get all  the information they need.  They'll crunch the numbers and literally, within minutes, come back based on your income, assets,  and credit with the right loans for you.  You choose the down payment, you choose the interest rate, you choose the term, you're  approved that fast.  This is how you want to do it.  And by the way, they've got great rates.  I was talking to somebody yesterday, he refied through Rocket Mortgage.  He said the best rate I could find anywhere.  He shopped around.  Shop around, although you won't enjoy the process.  Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans, that's the process you want.  Apply simply, understand fully, mortgage confidently.  And if it's time to refi, rocketmortgage.com slash twittwo.  That's rocketmortgage.com slash twittwo.  You can actually go there and start the process and then pull the trigger whenever you find  that house that you want.  Equal Housing Lender Licensed in all 50 states, and MLS consumer access dot org, number 3030.  And we thank them for their support.  Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans, rocketmortgage.com slash twittwo.  And the number two.  It's funny how net neutrality has become a hot button for the political discussion.  I get so many tweets from people saying, oh, you're wrong.  It's the wrong idea.  It's even the FCC's own CTO warned that net neutrality would cause problems.  You saw the letter written by the 30 men and women who built the internet, who continue  to run the internet saying this is a bad idea.  There's a great consensus among the didgeridoo.  There just doesn't seem to be a great consensus nationwide.

If this agency were acting in our interest, wouldn't they want to know what was going  on?  They basically ignored the comments.  They had no interest in the comments.  They didn't care what you think, which is also frustrating.  This week, moving on, Apple announced a $5,000 computer.  What's the starting price for the new iMac Pro?  Slate gray?

I don't need to review it.  Marcus will review it.  And it really is more appropriate for people who are going to use it to edit high def 8K  video and stuff like that.

Two terabytes of storage, why not?  128 gigs of RAM, why not?  What else can I do?  I'm going to beef it up because it's not the fastest Xeon.  Let's get the, what's the fastest one?  Oh, this is something people should pay attention to, by the way.  The fastest Xeon is cheaper because it's 8 core.  The 10 core is 3.0 gigahertz.  That's as fast as it goes, which points out this may not be the fastest iMac for you.  This only makes sense for somebody who's doing multi-core stuff like editing 8K video.

But that's if you load it, right?  And it's going to be even more when they have the newer processors available later.  So I decided I'm going to wait for the Mac Pro.  But is that a fool's errand?  All they said about the Mac Pro is not this year.

Transcript:  Well, in general, I'll be interested to see how many super serious video editing kind of people  want an iMac.  Because historically, they like to choose their own display and maybe upgrade it on a different  timetable than the computer.  They like expandability.  They like being able to stick gigantic hard drives inside their computer.  They like all the stuff that the classic Mac Pro, the ones before this last one, the little  trash can.

Transcript:  I mean, they're just messing up in this market.  I mean, again, they are trying to cater to that certain finite group.  But I mean, for peace sake, when you look at the product itself, like I can go put that  stuff in any other machine for like a $1.99 and they want like $8 million.  It's just it's kind of excessive right now what Apple's doing, especially when they're  not offering something a little bit better.  I mean, again, the trash can, it looked cool, but it wasn't functional for the professionals  who needed to use it.  The new MacBook Pro is a consumer book pro.  They've got emojis and little swipe things and touch screens.  I don't want that.  That's not what I need in a professional device.  And you want to charge three grand for it and you're making it for high school kids.  It's they're just I don't know what's going on over there right now.  Apple.

End time: 2034.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

And if you do, one thing that's true, there's going to be a new version of Final Cut Pro  10, and it's going to be tuned to work with this 10 core.  I met Craig Hunter, who is a developer.  He's doing an AR app called Theodolite.  Got a review unit.  This is one of the reviews that I, you know, kind of more trusted because he did a lot  of benchmarking.  He tried out computational fluid dynamics on it.  What he found is what you would expect, which is that if it's a single core process, it's  not going to do as well.  But because it's a slower chip, he compared it to other Macs, which, you know.  But for multi-core, you're going to really have a huge advantage.  If you know you need it, then you need it and probably are willing to pay for it because  he points out that compilation is so much faster for him because he's got an app with  20 to 30,000 lines of code and 120 different source files.  So that makes a big difference to him.  Vector processing, he did a bunch of benchmarks.  So this is a good, for people who want to know, HRTapps.com.  He says his wallet burst into flames.

Transcript:  Apple's PR strategy was pretty smart though.  You think so?  They loaned these to the people who know what they're talking about.  Not so much to the publications, right?  Back to the Verge and Gadget.  Rather than to the computer sites, they loaned them to actual human beings who do this stuff  and have a deep knowledge of that.  The reviews they got back were generally, I think, were fairly favorable, although they  pointed out this is not a panacea for everybody.  But for some of the grumblers, it looks like it will make a difference.

Transcript:  Let's see.  Apple spent a little of that money on a company called Shazam, a $400 million for Shazam.  Actually, that was apparently a bargain-basement price because they were valued even higher  than that.  Shazam, correct me if I'm wrong, at least the public-facing business of Shazam is figuring  out what songs they're hearing right now.

Start time: 2244.70
End time: 2286.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how they make that much money.  I mean, certain things I don't use as an average user.  Any time I've ever used Shazam, I don't even click through because once you play a song  and it recognizes or even a show, it'll bring up to iTunes, Apple Music, Spotify, wherever.  And it's like, oh, do you want to buy it?  And you can click right through the app and it'll take it to you.  And since I pay for Apple Music and Spotify, I just back right back out and then go put  it in my playlist.  And Shazam never even gets a click or anything from me.  So I guess they get the view from the app.  But I'm like, how do they make this much money?  Especially now when you can just say, you can talk to Siri and Siri will just tell you  what song is playing.  You don't have to fully go into Shazam.  I guess a partner or whatever.  I just don't know how they make so much money.

Start time: 2289.10
End time: 2307.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe Apple would make more because they have Apple Music.  But after we looked at this on the MacBrick Weekly this week, I think we came to the conclusion  that it wasn't really for Shazam the product, but that the Shazam tape was pretty sophisticated  and that it probably was for the engineering talent.  It just tells you how much engineering talent is worth $400 million.

But I have to say I've noticed something ever since I got Android 8.1 on the Google Pixel  Android 8.1, this was, I don't know if, maybe Dan, with your long history in technology,  you can remember.  I can't remember a company ever doing this.  Google never announced it, but they built in a chip.  There's a dedicated DSP for photography in the Pixel 2 that wasn't turned on when it  shipped.  They never told anybody about it, and it just got turned on with the release of Android  And the pictures got noticeably better.  It was a really interesting, I can't think of a company ever doing that before.

Transcript:  Maybe we haven't been told before.  But cameras these days are essentially the software.  That's what distinguishes them.  The chip, the processing stuff is important, and you get more power doing it, but increasingly  software.  That's why Apple's phones have had better cameras for a long time.  They were better at it.  But Google really caught up.  One thing I'd like to see Apple do with some of that money it makes every second is pay  it's fair share of taxes, but that's also a strange request in our current world.  Actually it's not.  They're not the only one dodging.

Transcript:  Everybody is.  But didn't Facebook this week announce that they were going to start paying taxes locally?  They're not going to use the double Irish tax strategy that Apple, Google, and many  others had used?  I thought that was very interesting.  Remember, this strategy, this double Irish with the Dutch sandwich, I think that's what  it's called, is not illegal, although the EU has started to go to countries that do  this, particularly Ireland, and say, no, you've got to charge taxes.  You can't not charge taxes.  The reason Ireland was getting the cash inflow from all these companies is they had close  to zero corporate taxes.  The EU has demanded that Ireland go back to Apple and ask for the money.  Maybe that's why Facebook is doing it.

Start time: 2492.26
End time: 2507.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It'd be a competitive advantage.  Facebook has enough money to pay the taxes.  Apple does too.  At some point, this is all going to end up with massive bills from Europe if they don't.

In the US, it's got a bill, it's battling with the IRS for $5 billion plus interest  in penalties due to global operations reported by the Irish unit.  It is in a little bit of trouble.  I guess it's legal until somebody says it's not.  The European Commission has ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros, that's about $15  billion in back taxes.  Apple's agreed to put that money in escrow while it appeals.  The EU says Ireland gave it an unfair deal.  Ireland's also appealing, by the way.

There's a lot of things that we could worry about, people not getting paid and skirting  funds and paying people their fair share of things.

Transcript:  I think it's interesting.  I wonder if Apple, Google, and others who are using the, actually Apple stopped using  the Irish, double Irish with a Dutch sandwich.  I just like saying that.  And has now started burying money in the island of Jersey.  Because the financial press hasn't yet dubbed that anything, I'm going to call it the Jersey  fudge.  So, they've moved from, I only call it that for one reason.  We have a friend, a viewer who lives in Jersey, he's watching right now, calls himself Jersey  fudge and brings us fudge from Jersey.  Apparently, they have very lovely cows in Jersey.  And a lot of Apple money all of a sudden, billions of dollars pouring.  And guess what?  What do you guess Jersey's corporate tax rate is, the island of Jersey?  Well we just take a wild guess.  How much do they charge companies?  Zero.  Of course.  Why else would you put your money there, right?  Apple doesn't, I don't imagine Apple makes a lot of money in Jersey.  Cows don't buy a lot of computers.  And I agree with you, Dan.  But Apple is quick to point out.  Yeah, well, but it's legal, so we're going to do it because it's our fiduciary responsibility  to our shareholders to maximize profits.

Transcript:  I know, I think there were actual, there have been companies over our history that cared  a lot about the communities that they were based in and did a lot of good things for  them.  And there are, I think, still a lot of corporations that have a corporate conscience of some sort.  We just do live in a time when people are, every incentive is to please shareholders  and top executives and law and otherwise, and hardly any incentive to do anything else.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Also, we're more of a global economy.  Before when you used to make jackets down the street and everybody worked at the jacket  factory, it's like, oh, this is 100% made here.  Apple says designed in California, but they're not making these devices.  So they've got to send stuff out there, outsource the stuff, they're shipping stuff back in.  And basically, America is now just a service center.  We don't make anything anymore.  We just sell stuff to each other over and over and over again and feed each other pizzas.  So the stock in caring about your community and your people is different because the mega  corps are global brands that literally just outsource all the work.  So it's like, well, you don't even really work for us.  All you do is pass a phone over to somebody and swipe a credit card.  You didn't slave away in a factory building the stuff.  So it's a different mindset and it's different mentality.  And that's why people here don't get as angry about it as they should, because if they did,  then that tax situation and other things and jobs would change, blah, blah, blah.

It's podcast analytics service in the beta.  We will not be using this.  I'm not sure why Apple is doing this.  I think a lot.  The problem I have with this is only about half of our listeners, half of you listen  on iTunes.  So this won't be valuable analytics material for us.  Although I don't know, maybe.

Transcript:  Here's, here's I'll tell you who believes in streaming.  I'll tell you who believes in the future of streaming.  Disney.  Disney just did a deal with Rupert Murdoch to buy the video assets.  20th Century Fox, Sky TV, the Hollywood Film Studio from Rupert Murdoch for $66 billion.  Here's a very scary picture of Rupert Murdoch with Bob Iger and the Dome of St. Paul's in  the distance.  That is if you don't spend that kind of money unless you think that you need a content,  you need a content.  Why would Disney buy this?  Is, is it, as some said, a belief in streaming.  One of the assets they get, which I think is very interesting, is all the local sports  nets, the Fox sports nets all over the country.  They don't get Fox News.  They don't get politics.

Start time: 3241.38

Transcript:  I wasn't even thinking about streaming so much is that they, through this purchase and acquisition,  they pretty much own the box office.  There are so many movies that are made that are flop franchises like Warner Brothers can't  get DC out of its own way since the Dark Knight and Batman.  They can't make the money they want.  They get Star Wars and that's a billion dollar project like that.  Marvel, the Infinity stuff, billion dollars, just like that.  Now like, oh yeah, you guys screwed up X-Men, another billion dollars.  We could fix that.  Like, they're, they have so much...

That was a bad moment.  If I'd been the theater manager, I would have been very afraid.  Right?  It was kind of funny because we're sitting in the back row so I can look in through the  window.  I'm looking at the projector and it's a computer, right?  They get the movie on a hard drive.  They plug the hard drive into the Christie projector.  It's a DLP projector.  It's basically a giant, like a two refrigerator size computer with a projector and a big stove  pipe coming off it to get the heat off.  She's wearing this nice little blazer.  She's opening the door and you could tell she's like, I don't know.  I really started to worry because then she got on the phone.  I figured she's talking to the tech support guy in Dallas.  It just went off.  I thought, we're going home.  We're not going to see the rest of this movie.  They rebooted it and they started the movie over.  We got to see the first 10 minutes twice.  What was interesting is this is a weird crowd.  This is a crowd of paid extras to see the first public showing.  While the theater is dark, some guy had an Android phone with a Pico projector and he  had episodes, the last Star Wars on it and he was projecting The Force Awakens on the  screen like this big.  People are cheering and they're watching it.  He put it up there and there's the crawl, episode seven.  That's nerds.  They weren't on the phone.  They were really...  Then it started up.  We watched the whole first 10 minutes again and then it died again about halfway through.  Oh my God.

Direct TV would send a pulse down that would break it and then you'd buy a new hacked card  and then you'd put it in.  And eventually the smartest thing direct TV did is they did some sort of, they sent out  the patch bit by bit and they all of a sudden they bricked everybody all at once.  One evil Christmas Eve.  I'm making it up.  Was it Christmas Eve?  It feels like it should have been.  They just broke everybody's direct TV, hacked direct TV.

Transcript:  This is the motive ring.  I love this.  So you've all worn, you know, fitness bands and so forth.  Well, as technology has advanced, it's possible now to put all of the functionality of a fitness  band into a ring, the motive ring.  In fact, this is kind of better than the average fitness band.  It's got heart rate.  It connects with your phone wirelessly over Bluetooth.  You're going to love the fact that the charge lasts three days and it's got two days of  on onboard memory so you don't have to have your phone to sync.  It'll sync automatically with the motive ring.  And actually, I should launch the motive software because you can find out so much about what  you're doing, about what's going on.  This is so awesome.  M-O-T-I-V.  And I love the sleep tracker functionality because frankly, I don't want to wear a watched  bed, right?  That's uncomfortable.  A ring, not such a big deal.  So you can see how you've slept.  You could see when you've been active.  You could see if you've been good or not.  No, no, that's Santa Claus.  That's something else.  This is a, oh, no active minutes, no active minutes.  Oh, there, whew.  Active minutes, 94 active minutes.  I walked seven miles that day.  Look at that.  And then I slept, but I only slept for five hours, 22 minutes.  You could see your sleep.  You could see your sleep trend.  My seven-day sleep trend.  All of this, 81% restful sleep, one hour restless.  Boy, I know about that.  Restless sleep.  This is awesome.  Unlike a bulky wristband, it's just 0.1 inches thick.  It weighs almost nothing.  It's very light.  You can get it.  See the two colors.  I have the black one, a slate gray they call it, and there's a rose gold one.  Waterproof, I wear it in the shower, no big deal.  It's made of ultralight titanium.  It's actually waterproof up to five atmospheres.  What is that?  That's pretty deep.  That's like 100 feet deep.  That's very deep.  So you can wear it all the time.  It's very comfortable.  They actually, when you order it, they'll send you a ring sizing kit.  So you can try on a range of sizes and pick the size that's right for you.  I got it just right.  According to the American Heart Association, I have bad news for you.  We adults, we need about 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity aerobic activity to  maintain good health.  The Motive Ring makes it really easy.  This would be great for you.  It charges.  See how that?  It's so cool.  We'll go back a little bit on the charge.  So it's got a little USB dongle.  You get two of them.  You put it in, I have one plugged into a USB plug, but you can also plug it into your computer.  And then you just charge it up.  It's got a little magnet on the thing.  It charges really fast.  So basically I charge it every morning when I get up after I measure my sleep.  I get up when I get in the shower, I put it on the charger.  It's fully charged.  It's a really nice little thing.  By the time my shower is done, and now I got another two days or three days to go.  But if I just kind of top it off every day, that works great.  We've got $20 off your first order.  I've been wearing this now for a month.  I love this thing.  It's the activity tracker that's always on and always on you.  Visit mymotive.com, M-Y-M-O-T-E-I-V.com, and then there are twit at checkout to get $20 off.  MyMotive.com, promo code twit.  And that's my Motive.com.  And I think it looks kind of jazzy, kind of nice.  Megan has the rose gold that's also very pretty.  Very nice holiday gift.  Yes.

I always take them off because they just get in my sleep.  I don't want to wear those to bed.  But a ring, I would think that might, that would be like great.  Because if you get the right size, it feels good.  You won't even notice.  You don't notice.  People sleep with rings on all the time.  You don't notice it.

And there are a bunch of, as one would think, Star Wars tie-ins.  That's a BB-8.  And it really does. I mean, look, it's a simple thing.  But you see in the shadow on BB-8 and it does look like it's actually on the surface of  the desk. There's a porg, which is kind of like a bird.  Good eatin' too, by the way.  Mighty good eatin'.  It's so cute. And it's I think there's audio on this, too.  I don't know if I turn it down.  There's a walker.  And you can make these bigger.  You could actually make them giant and they shoot and stuff.  I think it's kind of fun.  This is other stuff.  This I made a floaty balloon with my daughter's name on it.  That's not really a balloon in that.  It's not really in the space, but it looks like it, right?  That's pretty good.  Not bad.  Yeah. It's funny because Apple, of course, got all there's a stranger things tie in to  Apple got all the attention for AR and AR kit.  Now, interestingly, Google, I think, is responding to Apple.  Here's Lisa interacting with a stormtrooper.  She doesn't promise she can't see it, so she doesn't know she's kicking in the butt.  He's going to he's not going to he's not going to he's not going to be happy, happy  about that. But isn't it?  I mean, it's pretty amazing.  It's pretty, pretty amazing.  A lot of fun to play with.  Let me see if I have some more.  No, I don't.  That's the Google AR stickers that come with the new Google camera.  I'm waiting.  I'm waiting for my new pixel to come.

They don't really seem to be very interested in Macintosh anymore, I have to say, despite  this Mac bro.  So Google, I think, is having such success with this kind of poor man's A.R., much like  A.R. Kit on Apple.  They created, you know, kind of in response, I think, to A.R.  Kit, A.R.  Core.  They had a much more sophisticated hardware based augmented reality system called Tango.  Nobody adopted it.  There were only a couple of Tango phones and now there's Google's actually shutting it  down.

Start time: 4747.88
End time: 4769.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they had been working in it for years and just we did a story just, I  think, a couple of months ago based on some demos we got of the hardware that supported  Tango.  So it seems a little bit sudden that they've essentially shifted to doing something far  more comparable to what Apple has been doing, which does not involve a lot of dedicated  specialized hardware.

Start time: 4769.24

But it's I think the point is it's good enough.  And I think Google realized is nobody wants to buy a bigger, heavier, more expensive  phone with Tango hardware in it when just doing it in software with the existing cameras  is good enough.

And then March 8, March 1st of 2018, it'll be it'll be dead.  Dead. But come on, Google.  But just a little thing says, oh, thanks for coming.  Glad you enjoyed it.  But we're not going to do this anymore.  But instead, no, just 404.  And this is, by the way, the number one result search result I get when I search for  Google.  Tango is a non-existent Google website.  Oh, my God.  This is what Google's got to be careful.  They're really getting a reputation for just abruptly killing technologies.  And I think what happens is that people then just don't invest in any Google  technologies because they go, well, I don't know how long this is going to last.  When do they get tired of this one?  They've done it again.  You want to see the top search trends of 2017?  This is the most depressing video ever.  Thank you, Google, for making me sad.

And that's, I didn't think it was going to get this far because I didn't really  think that the tech people had quite the 10 years that they proved to have at this  point, but I think they finally know they have a problem and hopefully we'll start  working on it more seriously.

I don't, I don't know, but I think the, the, the message is clear.  What, what, what happened this year that the, I mean, the, was it the,  was it the unicorns was it Uber?

I mean, certainly Uber, uh, part of it, but the, there's a, uh, you know, a  general awareness that, uh, social networks have played incredibly culpable role in,  uh, the kind of degrading of everything in our, in our conversations and our  politics and our, uh, the way we relate to each other as well as doing lots of  great stuff.  And I think that the, uh, response until recently had been well, and it really  wasn't us and we can't do anything about it.  And, uh, I would say also, we've got to be careful that we get what we ask for.  If we really want them to be the editors of the internet, I don't.  Uh, but there's this general sense that the tech business, uh, partly cause  it's so damn rich, uh, and a lot of people throughout this country and the world are  starting to feel there's something that the power is a little too great.

People have been upset with the Valley and tech bros for a long time, but when  you're that rich, you're above it.  And you think that you are the good guys you don't, but you're not average people  can't afford to live and they're living in a shack to serve you a burrito because  they didn't learn code and you're moving them out of their apartments so that you  can have some kid come in and do whatever you want them to do and make stuff that  doesn't make any sense.  I hope you get acquired.  I mean, it's, it's really a weird thing.  You got bodegas and companies coming out, just doing dumb stuff, paying  hard PR people.  So yeah, it's great to live on an Island where you think that you're the coolest  person in the world and people are giving you money for your idea.  And maybe you make it, maybe you don't, but it's not a reflection of the country.  And as far as the internet, uh, being the facilitators for negative connotations,  conversations, guess what?  There was a guy, I forget the baseball game, but the guy blew the call.  He got 10,000 letters in the first week, a hundred thousand letters in his  lifetime about how he messed this up.  People, people always been ignorant, rude.  They just had to put a stamp on it.  Now they can just click into easy.  So the world is full.

Transcript:  Uber, which was truly kind of started in the spring with the Susan Fowler blog  post that brought down Travis Kalanick continues, uh, in the Waymo Uber case, a  letter has been revealed now, uh, by the way, a letter which, uh, came from an  Uber employee who, uh, has backed down a little bit on some of the claims in, in  actual court testimony, but the former security employee at Uber, uh, said in  his letter, things, this is the kind of thing that was going on.  This comes from Amir Afrati at the information.  This is his, uh, his post unlawfully recording an employee conference call  that was supposed to be part of Uber's anonymous and candid listening sessions  after the company was accused of sexual harassment by Susan Fowler, hiring CIA  trained operative operatives for things like recruiting someone on the senior  leadership team of a rival to be Uber's spy.  They were trying to turn executives from other companies, plus recruiting  other informants who worked at rivals, Uber spoofing rider and driver accounts  to gather data on rivals, uh, collecting detailed information about people who  drove for rivals.  If you drove for Lyft, Uber knew more about you probably than its own drivers  and 35,000 taxi driver records by hacking or outsmarting software meant to prevent  automated downloading of website information.  Uber virtually impersonated protesters and taxi operators in order to gather  data about politicians, regulators, law enforcement, taxi companies, and other  possible enemies.  Sometimes by getting invited to their private WhatsApp and Facebook groups, it  conducted physical eavesdropping to that effect too.  In one case, putting a bug at a transport regulator meeting so they could listen  in, there were, uh, hacking alleging allegations of hacking, but those details  were redacted spying on rival executives in private hotel and conference spaces  in order to record their reaction to news.  I mean, Uber was acting abominably, not just towards its own employees, its  female employees, but towards the outside world.  We know about gray ball, right?  There's software that would automatically detect if a, uh, uh, a rival or a lot,  more importantly, a law enforcement officer was trying to get an Uber.

Not, not a single one of which I'm aware of anyway, that has been shown to be true.  Maybe they're all true or maybe none of them are true or maybe a couple of them are.  I'm really wary of, of making any assumptions on that particular thing.  And just because I mean, I'm, I'm one of these people who kind of tends to want  to believe the worst about Uber, which is why I'm really careful in this case to  say, well, I got to see some evidence first.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by my doorbell.  I love my ring video door, but we've had it for almost two years now and I couldn't  live without it because well, I use it in a lot of different ways when there were  people comes out, neighbors come over and you in the doorbell rings and I quickly  pull out my phone.  I hear it on my phone, which is great.  The doorbell pairs to the wifi and I'd say, Oh, let's see who that is.  Actually.  There's somebody at my door right now.  Oh, I don't want, and I don't answer.  I, I admit it.  I, you keeps you from answering the door when you don't want to.  Even if you're not home, you get this.  I just got one just a minute ago, the ring doorbell, somebody's at our front door.  It has motion sensor in it.  So it sees people even before they ring the doorbell, when they ring the  doorbell, it dings you.  But the motion sensor can also notify you.  There's an HD camera on it, a speaker so you can talk to them and a  microphone so you can hear them.  So when the UPS guy comes, I say, yeah, I'm in the shower right now.  I'm actually work.  This is really showing you how I use it to deceive.  Isn't it?  It's showing you my poor morals here.  I'm in the shower right now.  Can you leave the package?  I'll sign for it tomorrow.  He does it.  Plus then I can keep an eye on the package, which is really awesome.  I should show you the Twitter stream, the ring Twitter stream, because they've  started what they started doing.  It's pretty funny is posting videos captured by the ring doorbell of people stealing  stuff. These are all people who were arrested, by the way.  They're not.  This is a ring video of a guy.  This is your doorbell is doing this.  Comes, he gets out of his car.  This is not a bright person and gets back in the car.  And we've got clear video.  So we got them.  People trying to break in at night.  This is this is safety for your home.  The ring video doorbell.  Now with a ring floodlight cam, you've got the same safety all around your house.  It's a motion activated camera and LED floodlight that connects to your phone with  HD video, two way audio.  If somebody steps on your property, the lights come on, you see it.  And if you want, you can talk to them.  You can say, dude, get out of here.  And if they don't respond, it even has 110 decibel alarm.  You could fire from your phone no matter where you are, anywhere in the world.  Wall Street Journal said it was the best of CES this year.  The ring floodlight cam, the ring video doorbell.  You could get a ring of security kit right now and save up to 150 bucks on it.  If you go to ring.com slash.  Twitter, all the kits included doorbell and the choice of either one, two or three  floodlight cams.  You, by the way, you can connect your ring video doorbell with your favorite  smart locks and hubs.  If you want to have added convenience monitoring and security, you don't have  to, but you can with ring.  You're always home no matter where you are.  Save up to $150 on a ring of security kit.  When you go to ring.com slash twit that's ring.com slash twit.  I love this Twitter feed because it's just a bunch of people.  Here's a guy.  He runs into the garage, steals everything, opens the garage door, runs out.  They got him on this as a floodlight cam shot.  I love it.  This guy installed it two weeks earlier.  He got the, he got the video.  Uh, Facebook did an interesting, uh, thing here.  This is, um, a post from this week.  David Ginsburg, director of research at Facebook, Moira Burke, research  scientist at Facebook, uh, hard questions.  Is spending time on social media bad for us?  Uh, uh, give you the TLDR.  Yes.  But this is stunning that Facebook admits it, but, but if you keep  reading, you'll see why the bad in general, it says when people spend a lot  of time passively consuming, by the way, that's in bold information reacting.  I'm sorry, reading, but not interacting with people.  They report feeling worse afterwards.  They quote a number of studies, university of Michigan, UC San Diego and Yale.  People who clicked on about four times as many links as the average person  are like twice as many posts on Facebook reported worse mental health than average  in a survey, but here's the good news.  And Facebook would like you to focus on this.  On the other hand, actively interacting with people, especially sharing  messages, posts and comments with close friends, reminiscing about past  interactions is linked to improvements in wellbeing.  So stop being such a passive consumer on Facebook and start sharing.  You'll feel better.  By the way, simply broadcasting status updates was not enough.  People had to interact one-on-one with others in their network.

They put up a picture of their kid.  Hey, that's good.  That's nice.  Hey, look, is it something positive in your mind to do while you're scrolling?  It costs you nothing for the like.  It makes them feel good that somebody is enjoying their family.  So whatever you see, family stuff, you're already scrolling anyway.  Just click the button and keep it moving.

Cornell researchers put other students under stress by giving them negative  feedback on a test, then gave them a choice of websites to visit, including  Facebook, YouTube, online music, and online video games.  Stress students were twice as likely to choose Facebook to make themselves feel better.  Isn't that a nice story?

Well, I mean, the year kind of started out with Mark Zuckerberg saying  that he thought it was crazy for anybody to think that Facebook had any impact  on the election and whether it did or did not have any impact on the election.  Saying that he thought it was crazy was so dismissive.  And I think Facebook is still kind of wandering around trying to get a sense  of how to talk to the world about Facebook's impact on the world.  And in this case, they're overcompensating by acknowledging that maybe Facebook is not  an entirely good thing and it's not all very good.

You don't unfollow them, you don't unfriend them,  and I presume they don't know you're snoozing them.  Hit the snooze button.  Millions of people break up on Facebook each week.  Change millions.  I think it's probably more than that.  They've got two billion users.  It's probably hundreds of millions anyway, changing their relationship  status from in a relationship to single research on people's experiences  after breakups, suggest that online and offline contact,  including seeing an ex partner's activities can make emotional recovery more difficult.  So there's a new tool called Take a Break, which gives people more control  of whether or when they see their ex on Facebook,  what their ex can see and who can see their past posts.

Don't don't don't don't don't snooze them.  You can snooze them. OK, now back away.  Bring that back up. OK, we cool.  OK, OK, good. You're good.  It's basically just a mechanism to make sure that people don't rage, quit Facebook.  And that's why they instituted this, because, again,  Facebook shows you who they want or think you want to see.  I've got thousands of people I follow.  I only see 32 people every single day.  And every once in a blue moon, somebody else cracks the surface.  I'm like, oh, you're not dead. Wow. That's cool.

Transcript:  Has it changed the world in a positive way?  It it has, because it's opened up windows and avenues for people  that never had an opportunity to see the world, reach the world, view the world.  They're building space planes to bring Internet to underdeveloped countries.  There are a lot of positive things talking about at the end of the day.  It comes down to the individual. OK.  First things first, when I was in the hospital, you know, again, my phone was dying.  So I posted on Instagram like, hey, if I because I was sick all day.  I was like, everybody's looking for me on my phone is dead.  But I'm here, you know, and people knew where I was and they knew what was going on.  So people weren't worried about me when I disappeared for a day.  That's a good use. Yeah.  So and secondly, again, it goes down to personal usage.  My daughter comes to me and she says, Dad, how do I make a new Instagram name?  And I said, why do you want to do that?  She said, well, all my friends did it.  I said, well, why did your friends do it?  Oh, they wanted to do a thing so they could get more followers.  And they think they need to change their name.  And I said, well, if you change your name, you're putting up the same content.  Do you think it's going to do any better for you just because you have a name change?  She's like, no, I said, wouldn't you want to just change your content  on the name you have and grow that filing?  She said, yes.  And so she didn't change her name.  These are conversations that I have with my child when she talks to her friends  and says, it's not about how many likes you get, it's about what you put up  and if you had fun and you liked it yourself.  Why? Because I've taught that to her and I've instilled that in her,  to which she in turn instills into her other friends.  So as people, we need to do better with the technology and the devices we have.  So that's that in my perspective.

Transcript:  All right. Nuff said.  Twitter has announced support for threading  in tweets now you can really do tweet storms better.  I don't know if that's a good thing.  I have to say we were all very worried about 280 character tweets.  And that's turned out to be great.  Yes. Yeah.  People aren't over tweeting.  They're still trying to be concise.  But when you need a little extra to say something instead of crazy abbreviations  and and kind of cryptic hashtags, you can say it.  Would you disagree?  You think you'd rather see short Twitter back?

Transcript:  I think I like short Twitter.  I think the spirit of 140 should live on.  At first, I was only going to do 140.  Then I realized that because they don't give you a count, but show that little circle.  It's very hard. You can't tell.  You can't tell.

When you do a tweet, there's a little plus sign which lets you do more.  And some people like tweet storm say that this is actually not good,  because when you do a tweet storm the old way, people start to respond to you.  And by the time you finish your tweet storm, you've taken into consideration other Twitter users.  And this thing is designed to let you compose all your tweets  without seeing how people are reacting.

Transcript:  I was against the 280 also, and then I totally changed my mind.  Sometimes it's much better to capture a little bit of nuance  that's almost impossible to do in 140.  I have not used this tweet storm feature in at least the new thing,  but I don't do them that often.  And I completely agree with you that it's a form that should never  have to have been invented.  It would be better if people just do a blog post.  OK, thank you.  And then point to it on Twitter.  I'll click.  I really will.

Start time: 6665.12
End time: 6688.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I do feel like the reason they're doing this is as Twitter's done  with everything, the at reply, the hashtag is that's what people were doing.  So they add features.  I mean, they didn't have hashtags until Christmas.  Sina did it and it started to be adopted.  They didn't have at replies.  I'm I've been tweeting and tweeting long enough from where you didn't have  an at reply.  So all of that is response to how users use Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to try, right?  I don't know if they're going to because of this ad, but I mean,  maybe somebody sees it and wants to give it a try.  That's the whole point of advertising.  I don't know if it's going to work.  And I'm a Twitter user, so I came in and speculate.  On that usage, but there is a vast difference between the average person who uses Facebook  versus the average person that's on Twitter.  So Twitter is harder to use.

Don't don't simple enough.  If it says this, this can tweet on your behalf.  Don't because it will.  All right. The Mirai botnet.  Man, this was a big story a year ago.  A botnet of six hundred thousand  bots, mostly made up of commandeered,  poorly secured routers and Internet video cameras, IOT cameras.  It turns out, I think at the time, what do you do?  You remember this Mirai net?  Remember brought down Dine, DYN,  a big Internet DNS server and  a big Internet DNS server and  a big Internet DNS server and brought down big chunks of the net.  And I thought at the time, because it was right before the election.  Oh, this is, you know, a state actor. Right.  Something like some like North Korea is doing now is some guy in his Rutgers

Start time: 7102.58
End time: 7226.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So I guess there are Minecraft servers.  First, they started by running Minecraft servers.  He and he was a Rutgers student, three friends, all in their 20s.  And the first they were running a Minecraft server,  make a little money on that.  But then when they discovered was that some of these Minecraft games  like Capture the Flag,  you can win if you can get your opponent off the net.  So they created a custom tool that you could rent  to DDoS the guy you're playing with.  And he's knocked off the net and you win, which is not very nice.  Not very, very cool.  But then they thought they had intended to bring down the Internet.  And they thought there was a market for this DDoS for hire service  called VDoS.  And I guess I guess they were starting to make some money on this.  They were renting it out.  And eventually it got bigger than they ever realized.  The security industry was really not aware of the threat until mid September.  They figured out how to stitch together multiple exploits with multiple processors.  They were kind of sophisticated, right?  And they got over 100,000 bots.  And then from there, they went to.  200,000 to 300,000 infections, and ultimately, at the end of it,  it was 600,000 bots.  The FBI says these kids are super smart, but they didn't do anything high level.  They just had a good idea.  They don't they didn't really hack these devices.  These were such poorly designed Internet of device things, devices.  They had hardwired login and password.  It was easy. It was easy.  So they searched for him, found him, took him over.  The infected devices all over the world,  but particularly Brazil, Colombia, Vietnam and China.  Some of the world's top manufacturers of consumer electronics  lack sufficient security practices to mitigate threats like Mariah.  In other words, hardwired passwords, and they didn't have any way to update the firmware.

Brian Krebs blog knocking it off for four days.  They took down Akamai, which Krebs had been using to mitigate DDoS.  One of the largest bandwidth providers on the Internet.  They actually had to drop Krebs site.  Remember that? Because they said, we can't afford to protect you against this.  Just some some guy in Rutgers dorm room.  This was unsealed during the prosecution.  So the FBI caught him.  And and I guess they're prosecuting.  But wow, that was kind of a revelation.

We talked about Patreon  and the fact that they were going to change the way fees worked on Patreon,  that it was going to they were going to charge, you know, patrons  a lot to support creators.  And creators are upset because they were losing patrons.  Patrons are upset because when they wanted to do a small, like a one dollar  pledge, would end up costing them a buck 50 because Patreon was planning on  sending them the fees instead of the creator.  Sorry, my daughter keeps calling me.  She doesn't really know my work schedule. It's OK.  Well, Jack Conti, to his credit, and I think they did this  because they had taken venture capital.  I think they needed to get their profits up a little bit higher.  Said we best up. We're sorry we're not rolling out the fees change.  I hope it's not too late.  I think some creators did abandon the Patreon platform and it gave YouTube,  for instance, now has a subscription plan.  I know that Kickstarter had rolled something out.  So I think if anything, it's going to expand the crowd funding  universe. But I I like Jack and I like Patreon.  And I know a lot of people use Patreon.  I hope they can weather this.

You don't pull an axe and stick it in somebody's back.  You take a pinpoint needle and you jab like two or three times  and see if they survive before you just come out.  We'll try to take somebody's head off.  Poke them slow. That was extreme. Yeah.

Transcript:  So your story, which is kind of a surprise,  Amazon is going to start selling once again Apple TV and Google Chromecast  on their site. They didn't for the longest time.  It competes against Fire TV.  Why and what do you think that means, Owen?

Start time: 7616.04
End time: 7664.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon, the same reason I want to talk about the target deal.  Amazon wants to sell everything.  And they have a they have something that's in direct competition with them.  But it also sells like hotcakes.  But it also relates to the other products because some of their products say,  oh, we work with Google Home.  And then people see that they can't buy it all there in a bundle.  They might go somewhere else and buy that option as a bundle package.  So they want to sell everything. They need to sell everything.  So I feel like that's why they're bringing it back in house.  They don't lose opportunities with all these smart home devices  for a person that might not want Amazon, Alexa, Echo, whatever.  Who? Who? Who?  That's it.  I always stump myself because I'm trying not to say it.  I will. I will bring who into the brain.

Transcript:  And that hurt us because people could watch our videos by saying,  whoo, watch it live on YouTube.  And you used to be able to watch the video.  Now you can't. You can get the audio, but you can't watch the video.  And that was a back and forth thing.  Is that going to change? You think YouTube will work again with Amazon?

Got Target got hacked and a lot of people jump ship from using their card  or kept them from or things.  So they need to bolster that digital marketing and digital bread back  and offer something that's competitive.  Because, again, Amazon is eating the planet.  And at some point, if you're a real deal, a retailer,  you know, Wal-Mart is fighting back with a that jet.  Two days shipping. Yeah.  And, you know, they want to come deliver stuff in my house,  which nobody's going to let them do is grocery.  Got to try and find their way to survive.

Transcript:  Should we as consumers, Meyer, OK, Meyer, M-E-I-J-E-R is pronounced Meyer.  Should we as consumers be rooting for these other guys?  Because I fear the day when Amazon literally does what you said, Owen,  have a piece of every transaction online.  And we have suddenly that monopoly means we we're out of control.  We have no control over.  We should certainly be rooting for competition.  Absolutely. Yeah.

Transcript:  They're secretly doing what Walmart did.  I have a friend who his family business is something benign.  His family business made a fitting for pipes.  They were one of only two companies in the country that made this fitting  because not that many people need it.  But it's an industry of their own.  They make a lot of money with this.  Amazon came in, bought their whole inventory.  Then the next year they bought the company and now they work for Amazon.  And now Amazon has bought the other company and they own a monopoly  on these pieces for these pipes.  So there are only people that you can get them from  and they can charge whatever they want and they get a piece of it.  And that's just one instance of company.  I knew the person personally.  I'm thinking, how many people are they doing that to?  Because that's what Walmart does.  They say, oh, mom and pop shop. You make these beads.  Cool. We need 10,000 of them.  Wow. I'm going to stop selling.  Everybody else is only so to have Walmart.  The next year, Walmart's like, cool.  We're going to buy all of them.  And now we're only going to pay you half the price  because you don't have customers anymore.  Monopoly. Let's go.  And it's just Amazon is just a secret beast on the globe.  And they just want to nickle and dime everybody.

Transcript:  Continue.  I'm not saying there's no life elsewhere in the universe.  I'm not saying that.  But I'm saying there's well, anyway, it turns out that Air Force has for years  had a secret  program called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.  It was in the DOD budget, but it was hidden dark money.  Twenty two million dollars over the last few years.  The Defense Department never acknowledged it.  It shut it down in 2012. It was Harry Reid who started it.  But Harry was influenced by his billionaire entrepreneur friend,  Robert Bigelow, who continues the program.  Bigelow is convinced, absolutely convinced aliens exist  and that UFOs have visited the Earth. Reid, of course, has retired from Congress.  He says, I'm not ashamed or embarrassed or sorry.  I got this thing going.  I think it's one of the good things I did in my congressional service.  I did someone something no one else has done before.  He did it with Ted Stevens of the Internet is a Series of Tubes fame.  The late Alaska Republican senator and Daniel Inouye from Hawaii.  Both have passed away.  They had a secret meeting in which they agreed to fund this with dark money.  Apparently, it's no longer funded, but the search still goes on.  There is a reasonable reason, a reasonable thing.  If you ask me for the DOD to do this, because they're not necessarily  asserting that it's aliens, it's flying saucers.  What if it's a foreign power that has some amazing technology?  We should at least investigate why Air Force pilots are seeing  hyper speed things flying around.  But I think in most cases, come on, it's optical illusions.  What do you think? You believe in UFOs?  I'm not talking about life in the universe. That's different.

Anyway, this kind of survey study has been going on a long time.  And it doesn't bother me if people want to study these things.

She sung church hymns for an hour and a half  and then they just brought her back  and she's singing these church songs.  So, they're like, yeah, she put the noise in her brain  and they didn't want any parts of it.  They brought her back.  I can give you a list of stuff that just generally doesn't happen.
