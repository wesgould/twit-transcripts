He's of course at Rackspace.com and spends more time with startup folks. You got a really  good interview with the guy who does that weird new camera. We're going to ask you about that.  Yeah, the light.co. Yeah.  Everybody's curious about that. It's got a bunch of lenses, simulates a DSLR with a bunch of  camera phone lenses. 50 megapixels image. Anyway, we'll talk about that. Also here, Harry McCracken.  I still call you the technologizer from FastCompany.com. Great to see you.

Transcript:  Mine's, I forgot to cancel mine. I ordered this Firo version, you know, right when it came out, I pre-ordered it and it's coming this week.  But I feel like I've played with it enough now. I don't really care if I get one.  You're done.  Yeah, I'm kind of done with it already. Forgot to cancel it. It's not cheap. It's 150 bucks.

Start time: 212.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 215.98
End time: 218.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess I'll put it in patrol mode and just let it wander the studio.

Start time: 219.60
End time: 221.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, until like someone's pet eats it.

Start time: 221.70
End time: 264.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So golly, I don't know where to start. There's stuff that is easy to talk about and easy for everybody to understand.  And then there's stuff that is hard to talk about and really hard to understand.  And I suppose it's our duty to cover both.  I mean, that's what we do here at Twit.  But I don't know if I want to start. I'll start with a more accessible one and then we'll talk about Google's Amped.  Because that one's not easy to talk about.  What do you got there? What do you, you, you, he's got the camera.  There it is.  It's like, oh, it's a picture of the camera. You fooled us.  It's a video.  Now he had a non-working model, right? Or did he have a working model?

Start time: 264.74
End time: 271.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He had a working model inside, but they were using it.  So he brought the CEO, brought one out to show me.

Start time: 271.36
End time: 275.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we can't really, we can't really judge this yet because the only pictures we've seen are ones on their website.

Start time: 276.30
End time: 317.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're, he showed me the full res and they look good, but I, I need to go and shoot with it against a 5D Mark III and then see if it really stands up to that kind of comparison.  I have a feeling that the first one probably won't, but it'll get pretty close enough for most people to say, Hey, that's good enough for me.  And let's go.  Where he was really going with this is he's at the camera industry needs disruption and the camera industry, you know, at most of the camera industry is being done away with by this thing.  You know, my iPhone.  And I have to say the new iPhone is pretty damn good camera.

Start time: 317.52
End time: 318.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been very happy.  It's an amazing camera.

Start time: 318.98
End time: 326.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The video on it, the steady cam, the pictures are good enough and good enough for most people is putting a picture on Instagram.

Start time: 326.92
End time: 338.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  So this camera is from light.co.  And if you go to the website, you could see, you know, the video of it is the size of a camera phone, but that's not a phone.  That's just, that's the whole thing.  It's quite a bit bigger than a camera phone.

Start time: 338.62
End time: 338.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it?

Start time: 338.98
End time: 341.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a, yeah, it's a thicker than a camera.

Start time: 341.66
End time: 344.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sort of the size of a VHS tape, I'd say roughly speaking.  All right.

Start time: 345.96
End time: 351.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the advantage is I don't have to bring lenses with me and the camera's lighter than a DSLR or what?

Start time: 352.31
End time: 382.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So it has, I think 13 and Harry, you might correct me on the number of lenses.  I think there's 13 little lenses there and 13 little sensors, some of which are a telephoto sensor, some of which are wide angle sensor.  And then it joins images together programmatically as you shoot them to make these sort of zoomable photographs where you  can zoom in and out at will in a way that you just can't on an iPhone with very high resolution.

Start time: 382.82
End time: 385.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Zoom is the big thing missing from camera phones, frankly.

Start time: 385.48
End time: 386.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's almost the only thing missing at this point.

Start time: 387.12
End time: 392.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At this point, the quality of the image is good.  Video is excellent.  But you just, you have one focal length.

Start time: 392.30
End time: 417.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't zoom and your ability to crop has somewhat limited.  So this is, this seems less like it's trying to be a step up from a camera phone and more like it's trying to cram the stuff that people like about SLRs.  And mirrorless cameras into a smaller package.  And it sounds like this first one is sort of, I mean, it's like version 1.0, if version 1.0, the idea is over time, they'll be able to cram it into a smaller and smaller package.

Start time: 417.46
End time: 422.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's 16 cameras in it.  That's why it's called the L16, but only 10 fire at the same time.

Start time: 422.94
End time: 425.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're all aimed in different directions and capturing different kinds of stuff.

Start time: 426.00
End time: 451.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you watch Robert's video and you look at the way that it's got little mirrors and stuff, it's kind of a kludgy, crazy idea.  But I'm not sure I agree with you.  The camera, certainly the camera industry is stodgy and companies like Nikon and Canon have really been slow to adopt modern technologies.  But it's not like things aren't happening.  The Lytro, remember the Foveon processor, both of these were kind of.

Start time: 451.24
End time: 453.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But these aren't coming from Nikon or Canon.

Start time: 453.70
End time: 464.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, and I agree.  And I think it's probably the case that Nikon, Canon and Leica are not going to be the innovators.  And what we are really seeing is the birth of computational photography.

Start time: 465.26
End time: 477.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, with this thing, what's most interesting is not the hardware, it's all the computer science and the fact that taking all these images and crunching them together and simulating stuff like optical zoom in a way that nobody else has done before.

Start time: 477.60
End time: 479.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, the images look very nice, but.

Start time: 479.98
End time: 525.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's how they're getting a decent image quality, right?  They're taking low quality cell phone cameras.  The sensors are are coming along because of the cell phone, the smartphone industry.  Right.  But they're taking 16 of those and joining them together and getting rid of some of the defects that you'll notice on a single one of those sensors.  Right.  Again, computationally.  Yeah.  It's a pretty crazy industry.  I just was in the MIT Media Lab where they have a whole group dealing with computational photography.  So I think we're seeing just the start of a new kind of camera.  This gives us a little taste of the future.  You know, it's funny.  I remember I used to work in a camera store back in the mid 80s.  Oh, I forgot.

Start time: 525.84
End time: 526.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right.  Yeah.

Start time: 527.28
End time: 546.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I was one of the first people to sell an autofocus Minolta Maxim SLR.  And I remember the pros would come in and say, that's a piece of shit.  I'm never buying one.  I'm never using autofocus.  Yeah.  I can focus faster and everything.  I was like, oh, dude, this, you know, and it's the same kind of.  Yeah, it's very expensive.  Well, $1,299 right now.

Start time: 548.18
End time: 557.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Minus the launch month discount, $1,299.  And you have to put it on $199 to get on the list.  Summer of next year.  We're way off.  Yeah.  I would.  That's right.

Start time: 559.24
End time: 565.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would, you know, unless you got $200 burning a hole in your pocket.  Yeah.  You know, which most of us don't.

Start time: 565.72
End time: 582.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, but for $1,299, you can get a very nice Canada, a Sony a seven body with a decent  lens and get a great image.  Now, admittedly, there may be some secret sauce here.  There's some zooming and all of that that might make this better.  I don't know.  Well, I'm sure we'll let Robert buy one next summer.

Start time: 583.22
End time: 654.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're going to get out several to the pros and you know, we'll see what  Karen Hutton or Thomas Hawk says about it after they've had it for a couple of weeks.  Right.  Um, they're really going to be the ones that judge whether this comes up to the standard  of an SLR.  Otherwise, you know, it's just a comparison to an iPhone and most people don't really  care about their photography that much.  I think that's the truth.  They're taking selfies or a picture of them in front of the, you know, Yosemite or  something like that.  And an iPhone does or an Android phone just does just fine for that.  This is going after the higher end of the market and is really trying to show a new  area of photography where it, um, where it'll eat away at the DSLR market.  I don't know yet that it'll really do that at first, but if you see this as the  starting point of a new kind of camera in five or 10 years, I certainly can see this  thing disrupting SLRs and the bigger camera companies in a huge way because the  software is going to get better.  The image sensors are going to get better.  And you're right.  This computational photography is something that will not stop and will keep coming at  us.

Start time: 656.16
End time: 861.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And who knows where the next big thing is going to come from.  So it's worth looking at these, even though it's appropriate to be skeptical and, and,  and take a wait and see attitude.  Lots of news.  Microsoft had an amazing event on Tuesday, shocking us all, uh, at least shocking me  with its very first laptop.  We'll talk about LastPass being sold.  The new Steve Jobs movie.  I just completed an interview.  We're going to air on the new screensavers next week with its director, Danny Boyle.  But I, and I know you saw it, Harry, we'll talk about, and I saw it, of course, we'll  talk about that because it opens October 23rd nationwide.  There's a, there's a lot to talk about.  Georgia Dow is here from imore.com.  Harry McCracken from Fast Company and the Scobelizer, Robert Scobel.  We're going to get to the more news in just a moment, but first a real quick plug for  GoToMeeting from Citrix.  I love Citrix GoToMeeting and I know a lot of you do conference calls.  Conference calls can be death.  Oh my God, they drone on and on.  You're sitting there and you know that half the people doing the conference call are  playing, you know, video, video games.  The other half, you're doing draft Kings.  Nobody's paying any attention at all.  That's why you got to use GoToMeeting because it's much more engaging.  You're going to see not only the screen, but you're going to see the, the people  in your meeting.  They're sharing their screens with you.  They're also sharing their images in HD quality.  It feels like you're actually in a meeting in a room face to face.  It's a great way to present to future customers because you can show them the  PowerPoint, but you can also see them.  They can see you, you get the body language, you get the bonding happens.  Uh, it's great to keep a team in touch because nowadays teams are everywhere.  Uh, you know, again, we, we deal a lot with third party, uh, companies doing  development and stuff for us.  And it's so nice to bring them into the same room using GoToMeeting.  It works on your iPhone, your Android device, your tablet, your desktop,  everywhere you are, you can even present from your iPad, which is kind of super  cool.  You could be sitting out in the yard enjoying the sun, having a meeting.  GoToMeeting.  I want you to try it today free for 30 days.  Just visit gotomeeting.com.  Click the try it free button.

Gotomeeting.com.  Let's talk about the Steve Jobs movie.  I don't want to leave Georgia.  I don't want to leave you and Robert out, but Harry and I saw the movie and, uh,  the list of things that are completely made up in the movie is actually longer  than the movie itself.  And yet I, and we just talked to Danny Boyle, both Danny Boyle and the author of  the movie, Aaron Sorkin really asserted that, look, this isn't, we're not  photographers, we're painters.  I asked Danny Boyle right away, is this a biopic?  He said, absolutely not.  We're not trying to get the facts of the matter.  We're trying to get the spirit of the person.  And I don't think you could pick anybody harder to figure out that Steve Jobs.  I mean, even people who know him well are divided over, was he a jerk?  Was he a saint?  Was he a brilliant marketer?  What was he?

Start time: 861.66
End time: 867.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is why some of the people who are characters in the movie like the movie.  And others said, no, this is completely wrong.  It makes complete sense.

Start time: 868.82
End time: 878.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the funny thing is, Woz was paid $200,000.  He was the only paid consultant.  Although I know Sorkin talked to a lot of other people about it.  And Woz is so misrepresented in the movie.

Start time: 879.00
End time: 881.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's terrible.  He's like Mr. One Note in the movie.

Start time: 881.50
End time: 885.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He keeps asking Steve, when are you going to acknowledge the Apple II team?

Start time: 885.20
End time: 888.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like he's still doing that in 1997 in the movie.  When are you going to acknowledge the Apple II team?

Start time: 888.90
End time: 940.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Woz himself said, you know, I only did that once.  It wasn't to Steve Jobs.  I called Scully, the 30 second call in which I said, you know, the Apple II  team is really unhappy, they're all about to leave.  You really should give them a pat on the back.  That's it.  And yet it seems like that's all Steve Wozniak cared about.  By the way, the subtext on that.  I don't know if this was intentional is I'm the Apple II team.  When are you going to acknowledge me?  And there is a big showdown between Jobs and Wozniak, which might be a little  truer to life in which Wozniak says, you keep calling me Ringo and you say you're  John, you're not John, you didn't write these songs, I wrote these songs, I  created this, I am not Ringo.  And of course, Jobs in the movie calls him Rain Man.  He's insulting.  He's patronizing.  He talks down to him and yet they're obviously old friends.  Is that, how true to life is that?

Start time: 941.32
End time: 959.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think it's pretty clear that this is, I mean, this movie should have  been called Aaron Sorkin because he's the defining personality rather than Steve  Jobs.  And so I think there are like countless instances where if it feels Aaron  Sorkin-y, you should not say to yourself that probably happened or that accurately  represents the dynamics of two people.

Start time: 960.52
End time: 964.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You make an excellent point.  I mean, everything Aaron Sorkin does is mostly about Aaron Sorkin, but this  more than ever.

Start time: 964.88
End time: 991.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he's upfront about that.  He's, you know, I mean, another example is in the movie, John Scully keeps going  to these Steve Jobs keynotes many years after they stopped talking to each other.  In reality, after Scully had Jobs pushed out in 1985, they never spoke again.  In the movie, Scully keeps coming to keynotes and they keep having these  father son talks.  It's really interesting.  So then that's not only inaccurate, it's more or less the opposite of the truth.

Start time: 991.20
End time: 1035.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although the truth in there is that Scully to this day regrets being portrayed as the  man who fired Steve Jobs, that that has been the bane of his existence ever since.  And that's really in the movie.  I mean, it's just that so some of sometimes the movie reflects a real kind of  spirit, but doesn't reflect the fact at all.  The thing that's most upsetting to me, of course, it focus a lot as we, as you  probably heard, and we're not going to spoil the movie since you, it's hard to  spoil a movie about a real person, but it focuses on his relationship with Lisa,  the daughter that he did not for a long time acknowledge.  And the thing that was hard for me is they never once mentioned his wife.  No, they never once mentioned his other children.

Start time: 1035.86
End time: 1042.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't mention the fact that Lisa actually lived with him several years before  their heartfelt reunion happens in the movie.

Start time: 1043.20
End time: 1065.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually spent a long weekend with Steve and Laureen, Reed, their son, who was  two same age as my daughter and Lisa in 1994.  They were a loving family.  Lisa was very much a part of the family.  And so while I don't have very much of a intimate connection to Steve Jobs, the  Steve Jobs I saw was not very much like Michael Fassbender.  No, not at all.

Start time: 1065.88
End time: 1088.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, certainly there are glints of the real Steve Jobs in there and, and, and  the caricature and the movie makers are not obligated to show the whole guy.  I mean, in the movie that the last scene is in 1998, uh, before a lot of Steve  Jobs triumphs came and they're not obligated to tell the whole story.  But if you go in there thinking that, um, anything in there is more likely truth  than that, you'll be deceived over and over again.

Start time: 1088.78
End time: 1116.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a character's journey that is true, which is from being a very harsh,  difficult person to work with, to being somewhat softened by his family, in this  case, just Lisa, but by his family.  And he did in fact, and, uh, and of course the, the authors of becoming Steve  Jobs point this out much mellow.  And when he returned to Apple, he was a much better manager, much better person,  uh, and much more effective as well.  You see that in the movie.  That's the, that's the character's journey in the movie.

Start time: 1116.78
End time: 1137.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Part of it is the decision to make it about these three keynotes.  Um, basically because they're only, by the way, see the keynote, it's the,  it's the moments before the keynote.  I mean, it works great in terms of entertainment and cleverness, but basically  all the things that ever happened to Steve Jobs have to line up to these three  moments, so he has to get back together with Lisa during a keynote, even if in  fact it happened years before.

Start time: 1138.78
End time: 1141.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you were saying, uh, Robert, that, you know, uh, somebody who worked

Start time: 1141.80
End time: 1159.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  very closely with Steve, Andy Grignon, who's actually in the second movie, the  man in the machine movie, uh, briefly, he worked for him for nine years.  And, um, let's back up, you know, Mark Benioff after the second movie came out,  uh, said that the Kutcher movie was awful.

Start time: 1160.38
End time: 1168.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  And then it didn't even succeed as a movie, at least this succeeds as a movie.  You know, it's actually a, probably a brilliant movie, maybe Aaron Sorkin's

Start time: 1168.62
End time: 1186.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  best, but his point, Benioff's point was these don't show the magic of jobs.  They don't show, uh, what really, why he is jobs.  They show some of his failings and they do a pretty good job of showing that,  but they don't show what made Steve Steve.

Start time: 1186.60
End time: 1200.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no, there is no heart in this man.  It's especially in the beginning.  The beginning is painful.  First scene is very difficult.  He's very harsh.  Well, which it could be, but it makes you wonder why anybody would continue to work  for him and there obviously was more to it than that, right?

Start time: 1201.08
End time: 1208.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, a movie that just showed them creating the products might've showed  more of the reality if they had showed the pain of creating the Macintosh.

Start time: 1209.24
End time: 1293.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For instance, here's an example that Andy told me, uh, and, and that  I heard from other people too.  So, uh, Andy went to AT&T to pitch, uh, AT&T on visual voicemail and AT&T  basically laughed him out of the room and said, you're nuts.  You don't, you have no idea how hard this is.  It we're, we're not going to be able to do it.  So he went back to Steve jobs and he called it crying to mommy and cried to Steve,  cried to Steve and Steve took care of the problem.  And when I met the CEO of AT&T, I asked him his side of the story and he said,  yeah, Steve came over and I got a five year exclusive deal out of Steve for that.  Yeah.  And, and so we don't see those insights.  How was he able to convince people to do something they didn't want to do?  And, and that's the key because, uh, he is an asshole.  You talk to anybody who worked in the, in the group, although his image is  being cleaned up now by people who used to work for him, he was very harsh to  work for, but he got you to do something you didn't think you could do.  And, uh, when you did that, you created something interesting and, and new.  And, um, I, I don't know that the movies have really gotten that yet.

We've been very, we've been watching, like reading the trailers,  like tea leaves watching with great interest.  This is a, a really interestingly made movie.  It's a very interesting script by Aaron Sorkin.  Danny Boyle does a great job directing it, but do not go there thinking you're  going to see anything that is, it is really truthful in terms of what happened  or even maybe in terms of how these people actually were.

Transcript:  Although this is, if you thought that was untruthful, this is far worse.  Is it?  I mean, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, the social network, which I think was also a great film.  Um, the big lie in it was that Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook to meet girls  when in fact he was with the woman who he has now married and is having a child  with and he was not single even then and was not looking to meet girls.  Not particularly ostracized from society.  Yeah.  Not, you know, and what you don't get from the social network is an  insight into who Mark Zuckerberg is.  The sad thing is I think a lot of how we think of Mark Zuckerberg is  colored by that movie.  And I think that the friends and family of Steve jobs are very concerned that  Steve's legacy will be colored by this movie.  And that's something to be concerned.

Transcript:  That is the big problem when you make a movie about someone who's a real person.  Cause already when someone's an icon, we want to either deify or vilify someone  that's in that standing.  But in the end, when we've seen something, especially when we see something on  media that's visual, we believe it to be true.  So it's really difficult to change people's opinions once they've seen a film on that.  They just believe it.  And most of us are rare in that we don't want to spend more effort or time unless  we're really a strong fan or opponent to someone.  And so you're just going to accept that on face value.  And so it does a disservice to all of the family and friends of someone that's,  that cares about someone that's dealing with, you know, a movie that's coming out,  saying things that are not true.  And I feel the same way about poor was because he's already someone that takes a  good deal of slack in the media.

Transcript:  You almost wonder why was doesn't is he's he of course was doesn't say anything  bad about anybody.  Right.  So but he was a consultant in this movie.  He can't be really happy about how he was portrayed in this movie.  He has said publicly, for instance, and the thing that maybe is the most damaging  to both parties is the shouting match that they have before the IMAC launch in  the auditorium in front of everybody.  And was says, I wasn't even working at Apple.  I tried.  He was long gone.  I wasn't there.  This didn't really happen.  And yet he's reluctant to say anything bad about the movie.  In fact, he says he likes the movie, which I think also is unfortunate because I  think it's really, I wish the whole, the public at large could understand.  This is a, this has nothing to do with reality.  Go see this movie because it's a good movie.  It's a work of art, but it has nothing to do with the reality.  And the thing is the reality that we've lived through is so amazing and so  dramatic and carries so much importance in it that we, I wish somebody would do  this justice.

And I think a little bit Hollywood doesn't like, I think they're a little  afraid of the power wielded up North in Silicon Valley and they would very much  like to cut these guys down to size.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's very, it's a fascinating story.  Read the Hollywood reporter behind the scenes and you'll see how much drama  went on with this movie.  And also it ties into the Sony pictures hack because we know a lot about this  because of the leaked emails from, from Rudin, the producer who ended up, they  ended up putting it in turnaround and universal pick it up.  Rudin took it to universal.  Um, and, uh, Amy Pascal, who was the president of Sony pictures entertainment  at the time, it says it was one of the biggest mistakes she ever made to let  this movie go.  So it's just a fascinating story.  According to, uh, early box office is not out, uh, nationwide until October 23rd,  but it is out in New York and others in places that bring to, uh, early box  office from those, that small release.  It's doing quite well.  So there is, and you know, that's why Tim Cook was a little bit nasty about it.  I think he feels like these companies like universal are capitalizing.  It was four years after the death of Steve this week.  Uh, they're kind of capitalizing on Steve jobs without actually doing him any  favors.  So there's also that to consider.  Yeah.

And if you really made an effort to make it absolutely accurate and well done, I  think it'd be the best thing ever.  Don't you?  We've watched an amazing era.  This is amazing stuff and it's changing the world.  I don't think it's weak.  You know what?

And they put it at the beginning and actually it's a really good beginning.  All right.  Enough about Steve jobs.  Actually one more thing, cause Andy and not go on Mac break weekly said as an  Apple fan, I would urge people not to see it in the first two weeks.  He says the only thing that matters to Hollywood is the box office in the first  two weeks.  He said, if you want to see it, see it on cable, see it later, see it a month later  if you want, but don't just send a signal to Hollywood.  And maybe that's not a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I think I can sum this up in a few sentences if for people who want to know.  Fantasy sports with started with fantasy baseball, there's fantasy football, and I  suppose you could do with any sport originally was just a fun thing among  friends and you play the whole season at the beginning of the season, you would  have a draft kind of simulating the actual draft in the NFL.  You would pick your team, but your team could be composed of any active players  in the league, your friends would pick their team.  You had a limited budget and then each week as you watch the game, your team  would score points, six points for a touchdown pass from Tom Brady if he's on  your team, that kind of thing each week you'd assess and at the end somebody  would win.  It was a, it was a fun thing.  People are very passionate about it.  Yahoo and others quickly got into it as a kind of backend for it.  So it would be very easy for you to play fantasy sports because you wouldn't have  to do it originally.  You had to do it all on pencil and paper, but with Yahoo and others, you could do  it, they would calculate your results each week and all of that.  That's not what these are though.  What these are is something that resets every week.  So, and there's real money involved.  So you put in real money.  It's basically like horse racing and that's why it's legal as opposed to  casino gambling because they say it's a game of skill.  You still pick a team, you put money in, but you're not betting against your  buddies, you're betting against everybody else who's put money in.  And according to the ads from draft Kings and FanDuel, you can win a lot of  money, tens of thousands of dollars.  Millions.  Millions.  It's just like horse racing.  It's something called peri-mutual betting where there is a pool of dollars  been put in by all the participants.  The company takes its big, its cut, and then the rest is distributed among  players, just like horse racing.  And it's technically legal, even though gambling is online gambling is illegal  in the U S you have to go state by state.  It's regulated in person.  Um, but it's also apparently a little bit corrupt.  Um, one of the things just like horse racing, if you could get the results  ahead of time, you could easily win.  And apparently, uh, employees of the FanDuel and draft Kings have been  playing on the competitor's site, winning money because they'd get  information before it would go public.  And, uh, and by the way, the other thing that's very important, if you've  been considering playing this, and I don't know if you have or anybody has,  but in anything like this, but especially in this, there are many, many,  what we call fish, people who are going to lose and there are small number of  players who are going to win, who know what they're doing.  They're, they're, they're, they're actually know how to play this game  and they're going to beat you.  And all the advertising, I think for draft Kings and FanDuel is to get more  fish in the game because the more fish in pari-mutual betting, the more people  put money in the bigger the rewards for the people who really know what they're  doing and you're really somewhat at the mercy.  So this is a real conflict of interest.  If they allow their employees to play, uh, now both sites are, uh, you know,  kind of banning their employees from playing fantasy games for money on any  site. FanDuel has asked former U S attorney general to perform an audit.  Um, and what's really going to, I think, happen is that, uh, I think, I think  what's going to happen is this is going to be made illegal eventually.  Um, New York attorney general has opened an inquiry into all of these sites.  Um, it's, it's, it's gambling.  There's no question about it.  It's gambling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think Twitter is, is on the face of it, a massive success, but  here's why it needs to be saved.  They're a publicly held company.  The stock market expects huge growth as it does of all tech companies,  ridiculous growth.  Twitter is not growing very fast.  It's a 300 million and almost holding.  Uh, and in the past growth has been fueled by kind of bogus things like  bots and spammers.  So the stock market is, uh, is already and soon maybe even more significantly  punishing Twitter.  Why does that matter?  Because that's the currency in Silicon Valley for employees.  So if you have an undervalued or a poor performing stock, it's hard to  get good employees.  So you can see the death spiral that ensues from not having growth that  the stock market expects.  It's a shame because I agree with you.  Twitter as it stands today could, could, should, and could continue forever.  Right.  It's a useful thing.  That's not true because Facebook is actively coming after it.

So the moments thing that they ship this week is aimed at stopping the bleeding  on news and also getting new users to be able to get to know the news and the  news and also getting new users to see that there's some value here.  Because this is a real problem with Twitter, right?  If you, how do you join Facebook as a new user?  It's usually your friends who force you to sign up.  Hey, will you sign up for Facebook so we can tag you in this photo?

Start time: 2500.76
End time: 2546.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter on the other hand, the reason you sign up for Twitter is because you  hear about it in the media or at a sporting event or something like that.  You know, follow the Kardashians, follow Leo Laporte, follow CNBC, whatever.  And when you get on to, and you just follow that thing, that's all you see on  Twitter and you don't see that there's any other value.  And so Twitter is trying to provide other ways to get you from just being a  follower of Twitter to being a follower of Twitter, bigger Twitter, more Twitter,  you know, so that you get more addicted to it and you stick around and you see  some value and then you tell your friends, Hey, you get on Twitter.  It's cool.  And there's, you know, news on it.  Um, and I don't know the Jack.

Andy and I'll go post a picture of him meeting the kid from moonrise kingdom.  Jared Gilman right below that Terry Bradshaw fed up with the NFL's domestic  violence program right below that Darwin's 1980, sorry, 1838 pro and  con list for getting married.  I mean, it's full of it's like, uh, it's like your mom's attic full of  treasures or something Amy Winehouse.  Turns out Amy's Amy Winehouse was a thumb sucker.  Who knew?  But if you watch Twitter, you know, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Harry and Leo, this is the problem for us.  I keep asking my audiences.  I've been doing a lot of speaking lately and I ask who has posted in the  past week to my audiences and invariably more people.  Well, no, that's not true.  Okay.  70% say Twitter 90, 95% say Facebook on average zero, by the way, say Google

Start time: 2639.40
End time: 2642.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 2642.52
End time: 2665.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nah, they, I, I am constantly getting, you know, this person on LinkedIn would  like you to follow them and these are people I don't know.  These are people that are like clients.  I don't know why they're like, you know, and I know none of them are actually  doing this.  I've had someone that passed away posting to me.  It's just really unpleasant in many levels.  I have strong feelings of animosity towards LinkedIn.  Wow.  Stop it.

Start time: 2665.50
End time: 2699.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's where I was going.  When you actually sit down with these groups of nerds and you ask them what  they feel about the systems, they invariably get to what you just said about  LinkedIn, which is it's just noisy and not good and I don't like being there.  And Twitter is noisy is what I keep hearing.  Yeah.  And people say, I like using Facebook more.  Right.  I don't like reading on Twitter and you unpack on it and the feeds aren't as  good a quality.  The noise level is quite high.  I can't show you because my camera's broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What does Jack do though to fix this?

Start time: 2701.76
End time: 2709.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jack has the authority to tell people this is the direction we're moving in and  this isn't the way it's going to be because he's a founder.  Yeah.

Start time: 2709.52
End time: 2713.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Give us some background.  He was one of the people who started Twitter with Ed Williams.

Start time: 2713.56
End time: 2777.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are a whole bunch of people who are, and depending on who you pay attention  to, different people are the genius who started Twitter.  They all claim they invented it.  But Jack is clearly one of them.  Yeah.  And then he basically got booted out and then he came back a few years ago as  chairman, but not deeply involved.  And then more recently he became acting CEO and now he is going to be CEO.  Although he's the only person who's been fired twice from Twitter.  And he does have two imposing jobs because running Square is not a side gig,  but these are both companies that need to figure out their future where it's not  obvious where they're going.  But he has the authority to make change.  I think, I mean, Twitter has changed shockingly little in its history.  I mean, the fact that we're still arguing over whether 140 characters works  moving forward or not is amazing to me.  I mean, and I don't want them to do more than 140 characters, but if anybody was  ever going to convince me that it makes sense or could figure out a way to make  it make sense, I think it's Dorsey.

Start time: 2777.98
End time: 2792.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So he's done two things immediately.  Like the day after he's announced, well, I don't know if he's announced,  but there will be layoffs, thousands of people.  And as you mentioned, he created this new tab called moments.  And you know, it's interesting to be fair.

Start time: 2792.72
End time: 2795.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He didn't create it.  No, no, I'm sorry.  I should say this correctly.

Start time: 2796.56
End time: 2821.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He finally said, would you please release this?  They've been working on it for a while.  This is curated news.  So none of the things here come from my Twitter feed necessarily.  They just, some editor has decided that this is what's hot on Twitter.  It's kind of like the trending list and it's news focused.  So there's today, there's news, there's sports, there's entertainment and there's fun.  There's not tech.

Start time: 2821.34
End time: 2844.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interestingly, it's not granular at all.  And right now it's not all that interesting for me, but it is an interesting  template for something that's interesting.  Cause if the, if the day comes when they have hundreds of topics or thousands of  topics, like something like Flipboard, this could be a really cool way to explore it.  Right.  Right now it is so hard if you're interested in a topic to find it on Twitter.  And this is a format that could work for that.

Start time: 2845.20
End time: 2878.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's wonderful because it makes the barrier for entry of getting knowledge  immediate for Twitter, instead of having to figure out who do I follow to find  the news that I'm interested in.  It gives you a nice curated view of news that is interesting to most people that  are on Twitter, and then you can choose to follow that news link.  Though interestingly enough, Leo, we always talk about Canadians and what happens.  I do not have my Twitter feed.  You don't have moments.  It's us only.  I, I don't have it.  Neither does Renee.  I updated specifically for it and I am sadly dejected.

Start time: 2879.14
End time: 2880.14

End time: 2906.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Georgia and Harry, you, you, you mentioned a Flipboard and this site, I think along  with Apple's news are really making me wonder what the future of Flipboard and  maybe Nuzle and other news systems are.  Nuzle is tied into Twitter and actually is Nuzle does a better job for me than

Start time: 2906.48
End time: 2919.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the, than the Twitter moments.  Right.  Nuzle is based on your friends on Facebook and Twitter.  And it kind of tries to curate the news.  This is Jonathan Abrams, a guided Friendster of all things.  This is his.

Start time: 2919.98
End time: 2953.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Harry laid out where Jack could take moments and by making it more granular and  making it more about who you're following, moments could grow into a Nuzle killer and  really take away their oxygen.  Yeah.  Or just buy Nuzle and put it into moments, you know, and make it a page of moments,  right?  Where you can see your top news from your friends.  And for me, it works extraordinarily well because I haven't been following 40,000  handpicked people on Twitter, but for, again, for that.

Start time: 2954.02
End time: 2955.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 2970.84
End time: 2983.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't get Robert started, Georgia.  He will.  Okay.  We will tell you how to make Twitter, Facebook be so much better or Twitter, how to  be so much better.  Yeah, I've, uh, it's lists, isn't it?  Isn't lists the key?

Start time: 2984.18
End time: 2989.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have lists, but I right now it's scrolling down the side of my screen and it's, um,  just fun to watch.  Do you use Tapbot?

Start time: 2989.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you use?

Start time: 2990.92
End time: 2991.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nah, just the Twitter app.

Start time: 2992.14
End time: 3016.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter app.  Yeah.  If you use, I mean, one of the things that'll be interesting, of course, is that  Dick Costolo, uh, Jack Dorsey's predecessor was the guy who killed, basically who  tried to kill third party apps and focus everything back to the Twitter app and  the Twitter website.  Uh, I don't know how Jack, you know, the early days of Twitter, it was all about  third party developers and third party apps.  I don't know how Jack feels about that now.

Start time: 3016.76
End time: 3025.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems really tough.  I mean, just realistically, if you're introducing something complicated, like  moments, doing it in a way that tweet bot can grab it seems.

Start time: 3026.44
End time: 3036.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't see them supporting developers.  There's just, uh, but you know, it's six months, nine months, two years from now.  Who knows?

Start time: 3037.44
End time: 3051.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they see drop off from their own users because people like the format of other  applications, then I'm sure that they'll make sure that it's open for developers.  But if they notice that people are going to Twitter because they would much rather  have control of their own ecosphere.

Start time: 3052.38
End time: 3085.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they need to satisfy their investors.  They need to monetize their streams.  And that means having control of where the ads are going to go.  And that's why they, uh, uh, messed with the developers and cut off all the, all  the development because they needed that control to satisfy the stock market.  I don't see that changing because they're a public company.  And, and I also, you know, let's be honest, if you're a smart machine  learning, uh, engineer, somebody who really understands the future of machine  learning, are you at Twitter right now?

It's a Sequoia back company and they're white hot and they're hiring the top.  Talent.  They're trying to, they're trying to convince the machine learning experts,  people who really understand how to, how to do all sorts of fun stuff with  algorithms, um, from fraud detection to customer acquisition to, um, showing,  uh, cool stuff on your expense reports.  Right.  Um, all of that requires a pretty smart programmer to do and they can't get  enough people and this is a Sequoia back company that is the best in Brazil.  And that's the worldwide talent, uh, uh, hunt right now.  So if you're one of those guys or girls, are you at Twitter right now?  When you know that there's a new bank out there that is, you know, white  hot, and that has a huge future in front of it, or go to Flipkart, uh, the  e-commerce system in India, the addressable market that they're attacking  is so a mess that, you know, there's going to be several billionaires that  come out of that company.

Looking forward to the new Nexus phones from Google, the new phones, the 950  XL from Microsoft.  Maybe you're still hankering after an iPhone.  Oh, that's so last week.  What are you going to do with the old stuff?  Well, I'll tell you what, you're going to sell the old stuff at Gazelle to make  money so you can buy the new stuff.  Gazelle is an online marketplace that you, for buying and selling used gadgets.  You can shop from a variety of certified pre-owned electronics or get cash on  the barrel head for your old device.

Every device, uh, worth more than a buck.  The shipping is free, but it's also a good place to recycle.  They will, by the way, even buy broken stuff, broken iPhones and iPads,  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.  Now, if you're looking to buy, they sell certified pre-owned devices at great  prices, shop for iPhone 4S through 6 Plus.  They've got iPads, Airs, Minis.  They even cater to the Android user with a variety of Samsung Galaxy phones.  The new iPhone is in store.  The new iPad will be soon to follow, but now is the best time.  That's the best time to buy a certified pre-owned device because those old  devices are getting unloaded right now at gazelle.com.  Every device fully inspected, backed with a 30 day return policy,  sold without contract.  You're going to find great prices for a replacement phone.  The kids break their phone, get them a nice replacement on Gazelle.  Devices are available in good and excellent condition.  Good means of course, some general signs of wear and tear, but in every case,  that 30 point inspection process ensures that they're fully functioning.  There are no scratches on the glass, things like that.  All the devices and you have 30 days to return it.  I want you to go to Gazelle.  Gazelle.com to buy, to sell.  Gazelle.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.

But of course, he was he did it in a friendly, gentle way.  So we knew and they confirmed there were two new phones,  the 5.2 inch Lumia 950, the 5.7 inch 950 XL, both with 20 megapixel pure view cameras,  USB C charging, which is nice.  And Microsoft's doing this continuum device, which allows you to dock your phone.  And they demonstrate this and use it as a device to do the work.  And they're doing it in a way that's not just a device,  to dock your phone.  And they demonstrate this and use it as a desktop PC.

Transcript:  And that's the problem, because this industry is not supporting Windows phone  and it's not about to start supporting Windows mobile devices.  And neither is Microsoft.  Every single person I met with up there is holding an iPhone or an Android phone.  And they know that they're losing or they've lost.  And so when they come when they start really shifting and come out  with an Android phone that I can do continuum on that, that's going to be a big day.  And I think they're already working.  You think they'll do that?

You know, I think they I think there's a new humility up at Microsoft.  There's a new  organizational structure.  And I saw across the campus, the Satya really is shifting  who Microsoft is, how they think about themselves  and where they're going to bring products out to the market.  And I think this last week was a good example, as it felt like an Apple,  you know, event.  And it was very exciting.  They're bringing interesting new products that people care about to the market.

End time: 3754.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So so so they have they show this.  They've got we've got a rig that will let you see the HoloLens.  They've got a red camera with some lot of gizmos on it.  And then some guy comes out and he makes a fist and  a gun forwards around.  Well, we can show this.  The guy, by the way, well chosen, looks exactly like one of us.  He's wearing a hoodie.

And he starts shooting them.  And they appear to be actually coming through the wall.  And this is what I really like about augmented reality is you actually  the game becomes part of the room you're in, which I think is really cool.  But this is they're showing this thing as if this guy is seeing all around him  in the whole room.  That's not the HoloLens we've seen.

Transcript:  And I know people who work are working on the HoloLens team.  And I know the guy who invented some of the patents that got sold to Microsoft.  Ralph Osterhout, who built who built ODG, this little company,  which is right across the street from the ballpark in San Francisco.  And he's building been building military glasses for a decade.  He was one of the key people who built the night vision goggle.  The problem and the press keyed in on it is the viewing angle on HoloLens.  That that video makes it seem like the monsters are all the way around you  and that you are perceiving them that way, as they would be in virtual reality.  Not true.  There's a screen in front of you, which is like a 55 inch screen,  a few feet from you, and it it has a small viewing area  and the rest of it is blank.  And this is the problem that they're going to have to fix.  And I don't believe they're going to be able to soon.  Now, Osterhout, once he sold those patents to Microsoft, started over  and he's gotten the screen up to about a 75 inch screen.  But it still is a screen.  It still has edges on the side of it.  And he he keeps hinting that he has a way to make it a little bit more wraparound.

Start time: 3882.26

Transcript:  So is it BS that Microsoft did this demo and they had no point in the demo.  Did they say, oh, by the way, it doesn't look at all like this.

Start time: 3889.22
End time: 3900.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have a history of kind of doing that, which I think is dangerous for them  because HoloLens is really cool.  And if they raise people's expectations even above  its actual coolness, people might be disappointed.

Start time: 3901.30
End time: 3964.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.  Microsoft is always giving people this promising things that they can't deliver.  And then what causes what happens in people's psychology is that we end up  with expectational debt.  I would be completely happy with a small screen  that I can interact with various things that might be helpful to me  if I'm doing anatomy, if I'm looking at the internals of the brain  to be able to interact with that would be phenomenally cool.  And I would love it.  But people end up expecting something.  And the only way that we know if we're actually happy with something or not  is what we expected and then what actually delivered.  And so unfortunately, what Microsoft often does is they show lots of cool things  so that they get great press.  But then people that have never actually tried HoloLens,  they don't know that this is completely different than what they get,  are exceptionally disappointed with that, even though it's massively cool  and it's a first gen device.  We shouldn't expect that much from it.  But Microsoft, unfortunately, doesn't understand the psychology of what they put  out there that they can't deliver on will make people actually very angry  and very frustrated.

Transcript:  Well, and let's be honest,  we're going to start hearing about this company called Magically,  which Google has invested half a billion dollars in.  And I hear they're about to get another round of funding.  Ted Shilwitz, I went down to 20th Century Fox and visited with Ted Shilwitz,  who's the futurist there at the movie company.  And he said that Magically is Google's first trillion dollar idea.  And he says, where HoloLens has a screen in front of you,  Magically has no screen.  And therefore, if Magically,  even though we know that Magically is three to eight years away,  if Magically starts showing off demos before Microsoft can really start  getting a market going for HoloLens, they're going to just Osborne  the whole market and everybody's going to wait until the Magically.

I've talked to five people so far who've seen it and spent a lot of time  in Fort Lauderdale seeing Magically.  They say it's absolutely mind blowing.

Transcript:  Well, this is why AR is more exciting to me, frankly, than VR,  because you're still in your world.  It can be a user interface.  It's more than just gaming.  VR is really about gaming or tourism or something.  But this could be a new UI.  And I understand why Microsoft would be interested in it for that reason alone.

Transcript:  The problem is, and I just interviewed Jack,  Jack, Jack, Jack, who's Jack,  the co-founder of Oculus Rift, Jack McCauley.  He was the chief engineer at Oculus and now is running a lab at Cal Berkeley  to figure out how to tell where your body is in these virtual worlds.  You're building new sensor worlds.  He says the software and he's not the only one.  The software for AR is going to be much harder  because of this expectation problem, because if I want to look at my desk  and say, put a monopoly game on my desk and have it appear,  the software to do that is way harder than to put me in a virtual world  and have me play monopoly in a completely virtual world.  Right.  And so our expectations are going to be much higher with AR  and they're going to be harder to meet technologically.  You're going to have to have faster GPUs, faster  systems than we have the capabilities to build right now.  This is why Oculus and Valve have to be tethered to a big PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the yeah, this is a thirty dollar device.  It's hard to describe.  And like all of these, very hard to demo.  But we we demoed it earlier.  In fact, I think in our promo, you'll see it.  What happens is you can buy additional software, but you get the starter pack.  This disk, you put this disk on the ground and it somehow interacts with the viewer.  You put your phone and you still it's like cardboard.  You still have to have a phone, but it works with a lot of phones.  I tried it with the Nexus 6.  And when you look through the viewer at this disk, you see  animals on it and trees and you pick up the disk, they're floating on it.  It is definitely an AR experience.  It's very hard to describe.  This is a toy for kids.  That's 30 bucks.

Transcript:  It's kind of like Osmo, isn't it?  That's the one that. Yeah.  So I think that there are we're nibbling around the edges of this big experience,  this big AR virtual reality experience.  But cardboard is cheap and it's here now.  And it actually works. I was blown away.  I'm looking at this.  I'm sure kids would be.  And there's animals on this disk and I can pick it up  and I still see the world around me.  It's it's really kind of an amazing experience.  So so there.  So there. So there we can wait for a while for Magic Leap.  And I think Oculus is a way off despite, you know, their bullish pronouncements.

Transcript:  Well, we're getting we're getting Oculus in the first quarter next year,  along with Valve.  The question is, when does everybody all the nerds that I'm talking to,  do we have 1500 bucks burning a hole in our pocket?  I've been saving for a while. I'm buying the first one.  The question is, when is my wife going to want to play it?  And and when is it going to go mainstream?  In other words, and that's five years in the future.  You know, first of all, you can't get excited by these things unless you try them.  How many people can try a 15 minute demo going to Best Buy or something?  Well, that's one of the things Oculus is going to apparently do

Start time: 4279.52

End time: 4300.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that Microsoft, by charging three thousand dollars for the dev kit for HoloLens,  I kind of assume that's less about their actual costs  and more about telling the world this is still a developer thing.  Don't don't get too excited.  Just now, this is for those of you who will build these apps rather than for consumers.

Start time: 4300.98
End time: 4324.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

It's going to be a 10 year product and we're going to invest in it.  Right. And that gets people excited, gets employees excited, and it gets customers excited.  It gets us excited. I'm excited.

Start time: 4335.64
End time: 4373.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's such a really sad thought.  But it's a little scary.  But there are also they have to think about a new way of gaming and a new way to interact.  So Oculus, there's a really cool game that Oculus came out with called Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes,  where one you're trying to.  Isn't that amazing?  You're all working as a team to diffuse.  So it makes me feel like I'm on Mission Impossible.  And we're all working together to diffuse a bomb.  And each person has a different set of the rulebook in order to help the one person to be able to diffuse it.  And so you work as a team, which makes perfect sense.  And you're not going to go through the same sickness of motion sickness, which is a huge problem for Oculus right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can play that as a family with friends.  It's something that you all have a lot of fun to be able to do.  And I think that that's going to be one way that Oculus can bring people together.  By the way, this works on Gear VR.

Very exciting, maybe deceptive, but very exciting.  They also showed an Xbox video with the games that are not new.  But I guess they were trying to juice people up.

It also is great for golf, which I don't play,  but it actually showed in the video you could see a radar map  of the golf course and get measurements and it would keep track of your swings.  That was in conjunction with the third party.  I thought that was kind of an interesting product.  It's a little expensive, but I think for the high end fitness market,  it's not 250 bucks is still less than an Apple watch.  And it might be interesting.  I think somebody here, I think Megan is going to get one  so we can review it.  They announced two new Windows phones.  We've already agreed. Who cares?  They announced this,  which is a shame, because, you know, the Windows phone is great.  It's sad, but it is.  It's dead in the water because it doesn't have Google services.  There was a rumor I saw that Google might.  They've settled their patent issues with Microsoft, that they might actually  start now doing Google services for the Windows phone.  That could save it. That would be a big deal.  It's the it's the showstopper for me.  But and they announced the Surface Pro 4,  which was about what you would expect, kind of a logical successor  to the Surface, which has been very successful for them, I think.

Paul Thurotte said I had been given this as a tip a day before,  and I didn't believe it. So I didn't run with it.  Microsoft announced their very first laptop, the Surface Book,  with the wackiest hinge you've ever seen.  It but on the other hand, this looks like a really nice laptop  priced like a really expensive laptop, but a really nice laptop,  which I immediately ordered because, well, that's just who I am.  Although if you go to the preorder, you might realize that it is  it is even more expensive than you think.  Starting price, $1499.  What do you get for that?  You get an i5, 128 gigs of storage and eight gigs of RAM,  and you don't get a dedicated GPU.  The least you can spend for a dedicated GPU is $1899.  For that, you get an i5, eight gigs of RAM and a 256 gigs drive.  And it goes up from there.  I decided to opt for not the top of the line, which is $2700.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But for $2099, you get an i7, you get a dedicated GPU.  It's kind of weird. The GPU is in the base  because even though this looks like a rock solid laptop,  they're using a interesting latching mechanism that uses a memory wire  that when you charge it, the wire shrinks, releases the latches.  So it's an electronic key.  It's right on the keyboard to eject the screen.  You press it.  There's a recorded click, apparently, not a real click.  And then you can remove the screen.  3000 by 2000, 13 and a half inches.  Very high resolution touch display with 1024  levels of pressure, 10 point touch.

So this is a better way to do a convertible out of that.  You just flip it around and close it on top of it.  That's probably how you'd use it if you wanted to use this tablet.  It comes with the pen.  They've they've heavily magnetized the pen on the new surface  and the new surface book.  Finally, so it goes whack.  Paul Therese almost leaps out of your hand.

Start time: 4897.28
End time: 4917.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love I love it. It's so cool.  It's like an icicle way that it bends in and out.  It's called the fulcrum hinge, which is so cool.  Which is so cool because it's going to stop at whatever point  you would like it to.  But it really bothers me that it does not close seamlessly.  It looks like a clothespin.  Yeah. And that bothers me.

Start time: 4918.90
End time: 4930.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the the reason that they give for this fulcrum hinge is stability of the laptop.  It is one of the problems on especially thin and light laptops.  And now you've got a big battery in the screen.

Start time: 4934.16
End time: 4965.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You push it and it tips over.  So the idea of this fulcrum is actually it changes the center of balance  so that it's much more they say much more stable.  It also and I think this is probably not an insignificant reason for it  makes it visually distinctive.  You know what you're seeing, right?  It's also the first laptop ever to have the Windows logo on it,  which you may not know if you watch TV because you see laptops on TV all the time  with the Windows logo on it.  Product placement.  But now there finally is a laptop with a Windows logo in the lid.

Transcript:  Well, you know what?  It's it's kind of interesting because I really liked it.  If I did not have a laptop and I was not already really invested in the Apple  Apple ecosphere, I would think about switching because I use a lot of Microsoft  products, so there wouldn't be a huge change.  I usually type out.  I use Excel. I usually use PowerPoint and though I sometimes use Keynote  and then I use Word.  But the fact that I know that all Apple products are going to work,  it's going to work really easily.  It's not going to break down.  If it breaks down, I can bring it to the Apple Store and the barrier to entry  when you're learning something new and I'm not sure about how to navigate on my  screen makes the big change of once you're comfortable with working on a certain  computer, the odds of changing are really slim.  And I think that that is across the board for people unless you're in technology.  And so you're you have to learn many different, you know,  OS's, which is just a difficulty.  So that's why they train it with kids in the schools, right, because they get  comfortable. And then once they get comfortable, they're not going to want to  learn something new.

Transcript:  I have to say, as a longtime Mac computer user, I am intrigued by this and I did  order it. And I tell you, for one reason, I don't think Apple's ever going to put  touch into OS 10.  Probably not.  And I think I'm not alone.  I mean, you're sitting there with an iPad, Harry, but after you use an iPad for  a while, don't you reach out and touch the screen?  You're right. I am not against I know Apple is religiously against the idea.  They think, well, your arm will get tired or I don't know what.  I really think touch is not a bad thing.  I think that screen it's three by two, which is interesting, not 16 by nine.  It's an aspect ratio that you see on the iPad and you see on the Chromebook Pixel,  but never on a Macintosh.  It's got a stylus and really now we'll have to see how much latency there is.  It's not going to be an iPad Pro, I'm sure.  But I feel like this might be a compelling product.  And, you know, the Georgia after all, the difference between OS 10 and Windows is  small, frankly.  They're all computers.  I mean, it's not it's not it's not.

Start time: 5123.12
End time: 5157.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I. I agree with you.  I would love to be able to reach out and touch the screen.  I think that it would make it much easier for when I'm interfacing with things.  And sometimes I do if I'm using my iPad for a while, then I'm going to reach out  and I'm upset that I can't move something where I exactly want it.  I find using a trackpad annoying and tedious to be able to change things, to be  able to draw, to be able to use a stylus directly to the screen.  It's one less point.  It's it's one less point that I would have to interface through.  And so that would be nice for me.  And I think that that's a huge bonus on Microsoft's.

Transcript:  My my kids don't understand how to use a computer without touch.  Right. Right. Right.  So it makes sense.  It's interesting that Microsoft is opening a new New York store.  I think, yeah. Right.  Right. By Apple, like two blocks down from the Apple, the key Apple store.  And it looks like it's going to be a showpiece store.  And I think that's why they they're doing this.  They need products in their store that represent their brand to them, to the public.  And, you know, they don't really care what Dell thinks anymore.  I think you guys know that it's it's copy Apple when you have to  and then innovate when you can.  And here's a good example of where some innovations come in.

The difference is Windows has plenty of apps for it.  Yeah, because because Microsoft bit the bullet and did Windows 8  and really said, we're going to go touch.  There's a lot of support for touch in the US and in the apps.

Start time: 5351.28
End time: 5365.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that because Microsoft is not as secretive in the first place, though,  people are not gunning for that.  And Apple's story is a huge story.  It's true.  Microsoft is like, man, the Lumina, man.  Like, you know, no one's really eating up those stories.

Start time: 5365.62
End time: 5401.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, I mean, I used to work at Microsoft  and the interest in Microsoft products just is not even close to that of Apple's.  Right.  And, you know, Microsoft's business model caused the anti-secrecy, right?  Because they had OEMs building all of the devices for the new versions of Windows.  And there was no way to keep a secret.  Now that they're building their own branded stuff,  it's a lot easier to keep the secret because you can control the entire line  of of who's touching that product and and and keep them quiet.  It's a supply chain issue.

Transcript:  Yes, I can.  Uh-oh, here comes my watch.  He just wants to make me jealous.  Let's be honest.  Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.  It's so funny, because for a long time,  I really thought that a part of my job  was to have a WordPress site so I could experience  what it's like to modify the templates,  to update every 48 hours with the new fix  to avoid the security flaws.  And I finally just threw in the towel the other day.  I said, I've been doing Squarespace ads for like 10 years.  Maybe I don't need to have my own self-hosted WordPress blog.  And it's kind of embarrassing.  It's so easy.  It was so nice.  I've set it up, and we're going to make,  I'm just going to flip the switch as soon as I can get  my server ops to tell me how to do that.  But gosh, Squarespace is great.  If you go to leoville.tv, you can see the beginning.  I started with a cover page, which  is what I really like about Squarespace,  is it's really easy to set up a basic beginning cover page.  It's kind of your, I don't know, your business  card on the internet.  And actually, if you take away the lower third Squarespace,  you can see at the bottom, it's got all of my social,  the links to all my social media, and it's got a link in.  It's just a really, you can even put,  like this is the front cover.  So you click the blog, and I was able to get my entire blog  imported from the WordPress blog going back to,  I think I started in 2001, 2002.  It's really easy to embed content.  The tweets, they came in there automatically.  The Instagram comes in there automatically.  I've even decided to do an events thing.  That's one of the things, the templates are so great.  They have things for all kinds, like I have my photographs.  That's the only event, but there'll be more events soon.  I can have a little photo blog, and then  you can use the portfolio app to show up your portfolio.  I just, I mean, I'm thinking, you know,  Squarespace really is great.  It makes it easy to create a, I've known this,  but I knew it academically, you know?  And now I've finally done it.  It's like, wow, this was easy, this was fun,  and this took me an evening of just having fun, frankly.  You can create a professional website, a blog, as I've done,  or an online store if you're a band.  They have templates for bands, for restaurants.  Incredible 24-7 support.  I didn't have to call the support at all,  because it was just like, so easy.  And you know, if I decide I want to try a different template,  you just click the template, boom, it's done.  All of these templates are state of the art.  You know, what inspired me was we were talking  to Jason Calacanis, he was on the new screensavers  a couple of weeks ago, and somebody asked on the show,  you know, how much should it cost to get a new website?  Where do I go to get one?  And he said, you'd be crazy to design your own website  these days, to hire a designer and all that stuff,  because companies like Squarespace have done it.  They have the best state-of-the-art templates,  mobile responsive, all the technology that you'd want.  It's crazy to reinvent the wheel, and you get e-commerce,  and you get hosting that never goes down,  and it's affordable, it's $8 a month  when you sign up for a year.  I sign up for a year, I thought, what the heck?  There's nothing.  And you get $100 in AdWords credit  when you sign up for the business or commerce plans.  It is just gorgeous.  So if you've been waiting,  if you've been trying to do it yourself,  if you've been waiting, if you're a new business,  if you're a restaurant, you have a site  that you're not the happiest with,  you know, there are companies that really, frankly,  prey on businesses, that prey on brides and stuff,  that say, oh no, we do all the wedding, don't do that.  You can do it, it's better.  Squarespace.com, try it free for two weeks,  just click the get started button, no credit card needed.  All I ask if you decide to buy,  and I forgot to do this, that was so stupid,  use the promo code, tweet, and you'll get 10% off.  You didn't use your own promo code?  I didn't even use my own promo code, I'm such an idiot.  Squarespace, what a moron, Squarespace.com,  you use the promo code, get you 10% off, Squarespace.com.  Do it for Leo, you need the next one there.  I gotta pay for the Tesla.  No, I was just blown away.  Yeah, there's pictures on here that I've never,  like, I really had fun doing this.  And what was amazing is, you know, my real concern was,  how do I get 15 years of blog content  from my old platform to my new platform?  It was really, really easy, it just kinda happened overnight.  And it was easy to hook it up to hover.com.  I just love this.  Yeah, that's our wedding picture.  I don't think anybody's ever seen that.  It's beautiful.  Yeah, it was just the three of us.

You go out in a tram and you go feed the giraffes,  and they're out there and they just reach their necks over  because you've got bamboo shoots or whatever they like.  And I was looking at my phone, I wasn't paying attention,  and the giraffe just kind of nuzzled me.  And Georgia, it was a great moment.

Transcript:  Yeah, this giraffe was actually very curious.  He really was.  Is he tweeting?  He was tweeting.  I think I tweeted that picture,  I Instagrammed it or something.  All right, moving on.  I'm so embarrassed that for all these years,  I've done Squarespace sites for friends and stuff before,  but I just felt like, oh, it's probably true.  I really need to understand how hard it is.  I have to do it the hard way.  And I don't know what I was thinking.  It's so much easier.  Let's see, we covered the Microsoft stuff, right?  Nothing more to say there.  We covered the Steve Jobs.  Oh, I don't know how to talk about this.  Harry, you're sophisticated.  I claim to be.  AMP.  Accelerated Mobile Pages.  We actually did a very deep dive  on this week in Google on Wednesday.  We had Kevin Marks, who's a developer  and really worked at Google, understands web standards  and all of that.  This is their response to Apple's news.  Facebook's news initiative to Medium.  Publishers apparently are interested,  I don't know why a publisher would want to do AMP,  but I guess they're interested in making their stuff  look better and be more usable.  And Jeff Jarvis, who's also on Twig,  pointed out that a lot of companies now, like Buzzfeed,  they don't care about a homepage.  They put their content everywhere.  Vice does this as well.  The idea is it doesn't matter where you read a Vice article  on Facebook, on Twitter, on Flipboard,  as long as you're reading the article.  And nobody goes to a homepage anymore.  Nobody goes to NewYorkTimes.com to read the paper.  You're much more likely to deep link into it  from some other source.  So AMP is an initiative at making pages load  more quickly on mobile and desktop.  You can actually try it for yourself  if you go to google.co, slash, I think it's AMPed,  and then you'll get a Google search page,  but the pages you find will be AMPed up pages.  And it's g.co, slash, AMP, yeah.  And you should probably do this on mobile.  But there's all sorts of new things.  There's a carousel.  Can somebody explain why, A,  I guess I understand why Google's doing this.  They're doing it in conjunction with Twitter.  It's open source, it's all on GitHub.  But it's weird, you can't use JavaScript.  Google has to approve any JavaScript you use.  There's no image tag, there's no iframes,  there's no embedding.  Everything kind of has to go through  this Google approved subset of HTML  with the goal to support caching, to support speed.  And WordPress.com has already said,  oh, we're gonna support it.  Pinterest has said we're gonna support it.  I presume Squarespace, actually I bet you anything,  they're gonna support it.  So if you're using a publishing platform,  you might get the benefit automatically.  But why would somebody want to use a constraint,  a limited version of HTML?

Transcript:  Well, here's why.  All right, go ahead, Harry.  First Harry, then Robert.  I mean, it's a reaction to, I think, a couple of things.  One of which is that Facebook did something very similar,  but within the world of Facebook,  Google also wants to speed up your pages.  Everywhere. But in a more open way.  On the open web.  I think Facebook did it in part because  media companies have a pretty shaky history  of figuring out how to make their sites good.  A lot of media sites are horribly slow  and are not usable on mobile devices.  And these new ad networks don't help either.  And the ads are really hurting you,  because you're bogged down by enormous amounts of JavaScript.  They're taking JavaScript out partially  because there are so many sites that are unusable  because there's all this JavaScript tracking you  and bogging down the experience.  And Google has always worked under the correct philosophy  that when you start to get slow, people just abandon you.  So speed is usability.  And I think they're trying to lead media sites  in the right direction by doing this.  And I basically like the idea,  because media sites clearly do need help on this front.  They've done a terrible job.  And the fact it's a little more open makes it appealing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the deal.  You're on a mobile phone.  You see a headline.  You click on it.  And you count.  And on the average website,  it's usually five to eight seconds.  On Facebook's approach, it's instant,  because it's pre-cached that stuff underneath the web page.  Sort of how Flipboard got so fast, right?  Why did Flipboard feel so nice and fast?  Because they pre-cached everything underneath the web page  so that when you click that link, it was already there and would pop up.  And I know I go away from pages that don't pop up.  And Facebook knows this.  Google knows it.

End time: 6334.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there you go.  Because Facebook is not in the business of frustrating its users.  And neither is Google and neither is Twitter.  They need to figure out a way so that when you're on a mobile phone,  you click a link, it pops up and it makes you feel good.  And you use that five seconds to read the damn article.  By the way, that five seconds could be reading the article a little bit deeper.  And you get another ad.  It improves your monetization, which is what Jack is being asked to do  by his investors, right?  And so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And how do we get the industry to start doing this?  I don't know.  The real problem is a lot of these media companies  can't afford to hire a really high end programmer  that knows how to do this stuff right.  And even if you can, they're usually focused on making ads work properly  because that's where the money is.

But but just by saying that and when, you know,  your Google rank is going to change the amount of page views, people are in  incessantly lazy and we're not going to be clicking through pages.  And we really don't have very much brand loyalty when it comes to news  or information, we want to get what is fastest best.  So Google, just by saying that, even if it's only marginally true,  is going to kind of push people to try to increase their ad revenue  by getting a better Google search rank.  So it's going to change it.  And is it wrong? Yes.  But if you were Google, wouldn't you do the same thing?

And so I don't think that I'm the person that's going to really use it.  The same thing, though, for for Google.  I really don't want them to curate news for me.  I don't like one large network being, you know, in control of what is  is the information that's going to be given to me,  because I think that that's too much control for for too many main companies.  And, you know, information is power.  And so if it's if there's a lot of stories that are anti Google,  they might really push that down on the importance list  and it might rank a little lower.  And so they can control, you know, which I understand.  I fully understand if I was Google, I would probably do the same thing.  I wouldn't want to have a lot of bad press about a product that people don't like.  But I think that that's why, you know, you have to control the amount of powers  that large conglomerate companies have.

Now they're saying that there's no safe harbor  and that every company does business in the EU, including Google and Facebook,  has to adhere to the privacy regulations of each and every country in the EU,  which is very scary because that's a difficult thing to do.  On the other hand, I understand a lot of privacy advocates applauded this.  So I don't know what to say.  Feels like it breaks the Internet also feels like there's a lot of things  going on to break the Internet. Stop it.  Knock it off.  Hey, did you miss anything this week?  We had some good shows.

Our show today brought to you by brain tree mobile app developers.  I got something for you.  If you have to get a payments API into your app or your  website and your rack and your brains,  look no farther than brain tree, brain tree payments.com.  They, with a few lines of code, I mean, literally 10 lines of code,  you will be ready to accept Apple pay, Android pay, PayPal, Venmo,  credit cards, even Bitcoin. And when new technologies come along,  you just go to your control panel and you check the box and there it is.  They do it all for you. It's secure. They have great fraud protection,  fast payouts to you and your customers are going to love it. I mean,  you don't have to, you know,  go much farther than the references they provide.  Brain tree payments are used by Uber and Lyft. I mean,  that's what makes Uber awesome is the payment system, Uber and Lyft competitors.  They use it. Both of them hotels tonight and Airbnb. They use brain tree.  GitHub uses brain tree. It's really the best solution.  Maybe you've seen the, the one touch SDK that gets you,  this is what Uber uses. You don't have to do even do a checkout.

John Chen told the verge his goal is 5 million smartphones a year,  but this is the second part of that sentence,  which will be necessary to make the business profitable.

And it even almost reminds me a little bit of Blackphone or some of these other  phones that are kind of aimed at being secure.  At least Blackberry has some history and tradition of that.  So they could be credible that they might. And, and as you say, Robert,  there are a lot of business and government people who still believe in Blackberry.

You're talking about,  yeah, you're talking about Amazon web services, which you're right.  Everybody runs on. In fact, again,  this is an example of how Amazon and the stealth way is a disruptor.  By making Amazon web services,  they really made it possible for anybody to create an app startup or a web  startup. Because in the past, I remember when Kevin Rose started dig,  he had to buy a Colo space and he had to buy servers and he had to set up  server. It was a lot of money and it was a complicated.  Now you just spin up an Amazon web service instance and you've got a proof of  concept to all the way up to a full scaled service.  So revenue has been very good for a AWS by the way.

Transcript:  Well, you know, holding your servers down in your basement is a bad idea too.  You know, they can go down there too. They can go down everywhere.  I guess. Absolutely. And the chances that you have a nerd, you know,  keeping them up to date and keeping them, you know,  watching them make sure they're not too hot or the hard drives aren't burning  out as a whole, a whole nother thing.

Transcript:  Amazon for a long time has been talking about making a pay TV service.  They're apparently at it again, according to sources with Bloomberg Business  Week, they've reached out to CBS and NBC about carrying their channels  on an online pay TV service.  Cord Cutters dream doesn't mean they're going to make those deals.  Cause a lot of people,  like a couple of a couple of called Apple,  been trying to make those deals for a long, long time.  And the networks are understandably a little slow to embrace this.  Dan Rayburn, we've talked to him on the show before he does a streaming media  blog, said that content owners were approached by the company.  I didn't know this. Did you know this, John? Amazon bought Elemental.  So the streaming hardware that we use,  because calling Kelly told us to buy it.  When you watch our live streams here,  it's encoded by something called an elemental didn't know this,  but Amazon bottom. Did you know that? Oh, they knew that.  Why didn't you tell me?  So there, that's an interesting business for them to get into.  And they have AO AWS for IOT,  which is what I know you were talking about, Robert, tell me what that means.  It means

Transcript:  So if you're a company like a union Pacific,  you're putting sensors underneath the rails to watch,  to listen to the trains going overhead. If you're a company like,  um, cantaloupe in San Francisco, you're putting a package inside,  um, uh, vending machines that's going to talk to the internet.  And you're going to use this new AWS IOT SDK SDK to glue it all together and do  new things with all those sensors that are around.

Start time: 7467.98
End time: 7476.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's kind of like Amazon web services for the web,  but only instead for these little devices. Yeah. So think about it.  It's easier to create an IOT device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now nest is on Google's or an alphabet, but, uh,  let's say you're building a new thing to, you know,  build a new kind of desk with a sensor. For instance,  you're going to use this SDK to hook the sensors in the desk to the cloud.  And so you can do stuff on the cloud.

Transcript:  Kind of spit up my coffee a little bit when I read a yesterday or maybe it was  on Friday that last pass was acquired by log me in.  Uh, I love last pass. I know many geeks use it. We use it for,  we use the enterprise version for our business. I use it.  It's a password fault. I use it too. And, um, uh, they,  tech crunched at 110 million dollars to Joe Segrist and a company.  Joe was really pretty much, I mean,  he created last pass himself and ran a very reliable,  uh, and secure service that a lot of geeks trusted.  I especially trusted it after Steve Gibson, uh,  took a look at it, talked with Joe, looked at the source code.  Joe was very kind to let him look at the source code and gave it thumbs up.  Log me in. I'm not so sure I trust them as much as I do last pass.  Um, so I don't know, uh, what do you guys,

Start time: 7549.70
End time: 7561.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  keep in mind,  what log me in is a pretty cool system that you can share your Mac or your PC  and get into it from your other devices. So that,  that requires a lot of trust as well.

Start time: 7561.50
End time: 7586.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're a remote access company.  I know a lot of people who have been unhappy with how log me in has run the  service. They had a free version, which people recommended for a long time,  killed that.  They, uh,  apparently still have considerable number of bugs that people have been  complaining about. But most importantly,  the history of log me in and how much he is not, uh,  another acquisition that they basically killed, um,  worries me a little bit.

Start time: 7588.22
End time: 7608.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just in general, I mean,  it does a useful reminder that if you entrust somebody with something as  important as keeping your accounts safe, um,  you don't know what's going to happen to them and better they be acquired than  they go away. Right.  But maybe best of all, they keep on doing what they're doing,  especially if you entrusted them because you like the people running it.

Start time: 7608.36
End time: 7613.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. It's a challenge. And I don't, you know, uh,  there are other choices. What do you use for a password fault?

End time: 7620.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I knew I jumped around a lot cause I like to know what's going on there.  Smart. I've had, I've tried all of them. I've tried like Dashlane, uh,

Start time: 7621.04
End time: 7628.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 7638.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  your brain is the thing you should not use.

Start time: 7642.04
End time: 7655.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really shouldn't use it because I will forget my password to absolutely  everything. One password is happy and it keeps everything there for me because  it's just, there's too many passwords to use or I'll end up using the same  password for everything, which is a horrible, horrible idea.

Start time: 7656.12
End time: 7662.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I have a basic issue.  I do a lot of stuff on mobile devices where it's a lot harder for any of these  services to be as good as they can be.

Start time: 7662.82
End time: 7735.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but LastPass solves that, you know,  and now they solve it with a little bit of, and you know,  it raises a little bit of an issue because in order for them to solve that,  they have to store your passwords. Now you,  you encrypt it with your pass phrase and only, you know, that they,  they say they can't decrypt it. And I believe that's true. Uh,  Steve seems to verify that, but that is a, that is a, uh,  that is certainly a point of failure because if somebody can get,  and there was some concern that maybe they did get the password vaults stored on  LastPass servers, they could use brute force to bang at them until they got into  them. And of course somebody gets your password vault, you're dead in the water.  That is the worst possible scenario. Um,  now log me in has my password vault. I think for the time being,  I'll continue to trust them,  but it's time to maybe start looking at some alternatives.  I'm sure Steve will be doing that on the security now on Tuesday. Um,  I don't know what else to say about it, but yeah, these things happen.  Uh, but it's the same thing with RadioShack went bankrupt.  They sold the RadioShack customer database.  Now you may have agreed to the privacy statement at RadioShack.com or when you  joined the battery club, but now somebody else has got it.  What's their privacy rule? You know,

Transcript:  This is good news.  Computer science is now the top major for women at  Stanford.  Maybe we're going to finally break this glass ceiling.  I hope so. Uh, yeah, it's awfully lonely here.  214 met women are majoring in computer science.  That's 30% of the majors in that department. So still not a majority.  Uh, human biology, which had been most popular for women,  slipped to second place with 208,  but women are about 30% of the comp sci majors at Stanford.

Transcript:  Better. It's improving. We're still a far ways off.  Change is slow.  Change is slow and it used to be a field where women kind of felt excluded.  Like if you don't see other people in the job,  we actually don't think that that's something you can do. We're,  we're mimics by nature. So by bringing your girls,  giving them bits box so they can learn how to code, uh,  bringing them to work that type of thing. And in media and on shows,  having more women visible in technology will help them know that there are  placed there for them as well.

They don't have good sleep hygiene.  And we don't, we haven't taught people how to sleep better. And so we, yeah,  it's a horrible, it's a horrible thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do. We actually miss learn how to sleep by a lot of bad habits  from parenting and noise and just sleep is considered as bad.  And we're not being productive when we're sleeping.  But the biggest issue is that we'll actually become more productive, eat less,  feel healthier if we sleep more because our brains are being cleansed of all of  the neurotoxins that they build up through the day, all of the refuse.  So it's also a preventative from dementia.

And if you would like to join us each and every week,  best time to come by 3 PM Pacific, 6 PM Eastern time, 2200 UTC.  That's when we do Twitter on Sunday afternoon.  If you can't watch live though, on demand video always available  for all of our shows at twit.tv. Little program note.  When I was setting up that Squarespace site,  I kind of changed the DNS for leoville.tv and it turns out  somehow that I don't understand. We used to, in the old days,  we used leoville.tv slash podcasts as the podcast URL.  We've long ago abandoned that.  The podcast URL is now feeds.twit.tv,  but apparently maybe it's not just maybe it's somehow iTunes has the old feeds.  In some cases, maybe not in the U S maybe in Mexico. I don't know.  But if, if all of a sudden you see there is no,  there's no podcast feed anymore.  Resubscribe and make sure you're resubscribing to feeds.twit.tv,  not leoville.tv.  And I guess what I'm going to do is I'm going to go change the domain server  and fix it and put it back to the way it used to be.  Until we figure out why that happened. That's like from,  that's like from the old days of twit. That's when I was,  that's when the feeds were on my server.  I don't know what happened.  So don't subscribe to leoville.tv slash podcasts anymore.  Do subscribe so you get every podcast whenever they're available right away.  That's the whole point of those feeds. If you'd like to be in studio with us,  Oh, we'd love to have you. It's great studio audience today.  Thank you all for being here.  You just have to email twit tickets at twit.tv.
