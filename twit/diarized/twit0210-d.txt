Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Passing gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, we got the other voices in now.  It's Tom Merritt from CNET's Buzz Out Loud.  Hey, Tom.  Hey, Leo.  Also here, Roger Chang from Techzilla.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Techzilla.com and HD Nation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, HD Nation with our friend Robert Tarrin.  Robert Tarrin.  And Patrick is on that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick, Robert on HD Nation and Patrick and Veronica on Techzilla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All at Revision3.com.  Yes.  And of course, Roger and Tom do a show called...  East Meets West.  East Meets West.  Yes.  And Roger plays East and you play West.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or I play East because I'm from out East and Roger plays West because he's from California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's from Modesto.  We can switch it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I'm from San Francisco, but I lived in Modesto for seven years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we want to welcome that show to the Twitter network.  You're going to start producing that live on Twitter right after...  On the network right after this week in tech.  That's right.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Every Sunday at five o'clock.  Start watching.  And the audio podcast will still be available at subbrilliant.com slash emw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're not taking that over.  You still own the audio.  You still own the show.  We just want to help you produce it and have some extra content on the stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We got such good feedback when I did it that we came across on.  You did it already once.  Yeah.  That we thought, hey, let's make a regular thing of this.  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm so glad.  Thank you for letting us broadcast it.  We're just, I'd eventually like to get to there's something on the network live all  the time.  I don't think that's going to happen, but we'll...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you thought of setting up a bird feeder?  It's depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's really depressing if you go to Ustream.  We're on Ustream.  Many, many streams, many millions of people have watched us in Ustream, but the Shaboomy  puppies beat us.  I don't even know what they are, but they're cute puppies.  You just need to have some puppies.  I need puppies.  You need puppies surrounding you.  Puppy video.  John, how have you been these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything going well?  I'm keeping busy.  The weather's been fantastic.  It's been nice and hot.  Except till today.  I don't know.  What else?  That's it.  I'm just asking.  I didn't really want to know.  I know you don't.  Go to channeldivorek.com.  As you continue the show, I'll go slam the phone off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  Get the phone off while we talk about, I guess we should start with Snow Leopard.  Big release of a new operating system.  I'm liking calling it Snow Job because I have to say, it doesn't feel like the release of  a brand new operating system at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't even really feel like an update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't.  They say it's all under the hood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is the emperor's new clothes.  I noticed initially when I started it up, it did peg my activity meter 75% for 30 seconds  for some reason.  It settled down so it runs just like it did before I installed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here's my favorite Easter egg and I guess it is documented.  But if you hold, when you boot into Snow Leopard, if you hold the six and the four key, it will  boot into 64-bit mode.  Not on my machine.  Because you have an old machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  There's actually a set list of five machines that will boot into 64-bit mode.  And it's the most ridiculous thing ever.  First it was because people might be running a core duo instead of a core two duo so you  had no 64-bit registers and then it was down to the 32-bit EF5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Shouldn't it be a setting instead of an Easter egg?  Like I would like to run in 64-bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This 64-bit OS by default boots into 32-bit.  Which really underscores the point that 64-bit is silly anyway.  Nobody really needs it.  If you want more than four gigs of RAM, that's about it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty much.  I mean, you know, my MacBook is saddled with the old Intel chipset, I think the 945, that  does not allow the machine to see anything past three gigs because of the memory controller.  Anyway.  So yeah, I have four gigs installed.  OS X says I have four gigs.  If I go to the activity meter, the RAM usage only stops at three gigs.  I don't know, 30 bucks went to Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's 30 bucks.  If they had charged 129, I could see people would be really upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the price of six pints of Guinness, roughly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wouldn't you rather?  When you put it that way, it seems a little expensive.  Seems a lot.  A little pricey.  One evening's...  If Microsoft had done this, howls of protest and pain.  Actually, they did.  It was called Windows ME.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much.  I mean, Windows ME is a good example, right?  Because it doesn't have that much of a graphical improvement.  Supposedly, there's a lot going on under the hood.  I think there's more performance improvement going on under the hood with Snow Leopard  than there was with ME, but there's a raging debate in the Buzz Out Loud crowd about whether  this should just be called a service pack.  I think it's more than a service pack.  I don't think it's appropriately priced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's what bugs me.  It feels like Apple had a lot of improvements.  They held back over the last two years.  Minor little things in the system preference pane, 512 by 512 icons.  Got to have that.  They did some really nice stuff with the assistive technologies.  Some of my blind friends are saying much improved.  But these are all things, if you ask me, that they could have been releasing over the last  two years.  Somebody somewhere wrote a memo saying, let's just hold these back and we'll release it  all on a disk and we'll call it a new version.  To me, this is marketing.  This is about Apple having something to counter Windows 7 a month earlier.  I just don't think this is a new operating system.  It's barely anything at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't it supposed to integrate ZFS?  This is what really pisses me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not only did they pull it out, they pulled it out of server also.  They're not going to do ZFS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's basically what Microsoft did with Vista when they pulled out WinFS.  You're touting all these new engineering benefits and progress and then you take it out at the  last minute because either A, it's not stable, B, has conflicts, or C, has way too much overhead  for what they want.  It seems one of those things where Apple, it does really seem like they're trying to  get Mindshare right before the release of Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That may be.  I think part of the reason they're doing this though is to get off of the PowerPC legacy  support.  I think that's the biggest advantage you get from Snow Leopard is getting some of your  disk space back.  I've heard people getting up to 20 gigabytes of disk space.  A lot of that's print drivers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the thing is when I install OS X, I selectively install.  I don't do the multi-language.  That saves gigabytes right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In a way, it's a company saying, we were installing too much stuff, so we're going to install  less stuff.  Ooh, it's an upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's some legacy code going too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw a bigger jump from Tiger to Leopard.  It's much bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is interesting.  The Buzz That Loud crowd is also saying this, a little pushback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a good debate over it.  My opinion is this is appropriately priced.  I think it is more than a service pack here, but it's not a full operating system jump.  They charged $30 for it.  You could make it argue it should have been $15 or $10 or something like that, but I think  they've got something there to charge for.  Molly, opposite.  She thinks it's a service pack.  She hates Mac.  Yeah, there's that.  A lot of the listeners agree that, hey, like you were saying earlier, they should have  just been releasing this over time anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what bugs me is that they maybe were abusing us a little bit by not releasing these  fixes over time.  There's a kernel patch in here that has been a bug, a major overflow bug, security flaw  for something like four years that they finally put into this.  It's stuff like that.  Come on, Apple.  Just release this stuff as you come up with it.  You don't have to hold on to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you were a cynic, you could say that Apple is basically testing the waters to see if  the public will accept a low cost or relatively low cost incremental OS X update.  They see that as they continually seed out new versions of OS X on an annual basis.  It's like, oh, it's only $30.  Upgrade today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they've been doing every other year, they've been doing $129.  They've been doing fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they eventually want to get off the hardware train and just want to start pushing.  Oh, I don't think that's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  David Pogue said that anybody who doesn't like Snow Leopard is a, what do you call him?  A jerk.  A jerk.  No, he didn't say that.  No, he said a hater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A hater?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He said, anybody who says Snow Leopard is just a, he said, there are haters who will  say Snow Leopard is just a service pack.  I say, I don't know what he said, fiant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm not a hater.  I'm kind of like, hey.  I think that these guys-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why is he saying this in the first place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that Mossberg and Pogue really overhyped this.  And I think really that what I'd like to say is-  Oh, that's right.  I'd like to say is that this is fine, but please don't rush.  Don't get in line.  Don't worry.  In fact, I wouldn't even get it now because there are compatibility issues and you're  not going to see any real benefit to this until somebody writes software that takes  advantage of Grand Central Station or whatever the hell it's called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I put the developer's version on one of my older Mac laptops just to try it out, but  I didn't want to put it on my main one.  And I pre-ordered from Amazon, which kind of is a mistake because I don't get it until  Tuesday now where I could have just gone to the store, but I don't really care because  it's like, yeah, I'll get it when I get it.  There's no hurry.  And then I'll upgrade it.  And that's the message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd like to say there's no hurry.  So John, you have any opinion on this or is this just completely-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I would like to know.  No one has explained with any alacrity why are there compatibility problems with versions,  for example, of Photoshop?  I mean, what has changed in the kernel that has resulted in compatibility issues?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple's explanation, as I understand it, is that, well, there are tools that used unapproved  API calls, things we warned them not to use.  We took those out so you're going to see.  But almost all of these programs like Super Duper and so forth are being updated right  away.  I think you could just wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get Snow Leopard when you get a new machine.  They're not going to upgrade CS2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well this is a good question.  Yeah, Adobe's using this as an excuse to move people off of CS2 and 3 saying, well, we're  only going to guarantee support in CS4.  But apparently from, I've heard a few people say, no, CS3 works fine.  It's just that Adobe's not going to make any effort to support.  I think this is Adobe using it and just saying, well, cool, great, we can finally get these  CS2 people to buy a copy of CS4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, CS3 apparently.  There's a great wiki.snowleopard.wiki.com where they have people reporting all of the  compatibility issues on everything.  CS2 has apparently got problems under Rosetta, as you would expect.  CS3 has got minor bugs in Photoshop and Dreamweaver.  I think that's what we're hearing about, right?  Is all the Photoshop stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you need Exchange, if you want to use Apple Mail with Exchange, hey, it's a big upgrade  and it's probably worth $30.  Get your company to upgrade their Exchange servers.  Yeah, really.  Or get off of Exchange.  I just think there are few specialty markets that are going to want Snow Leopard.  But for most people, they should just be aware, don't run out.  This is not what you would call a typical OS upgrade.  Don't run out and get it.  There's no hurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wouldn't put it past Apple to start putting out some things that kind of encourage you.  Oh, yeah.  To upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's only $30.  I mean, look, I bought 10 licenses.  Yeah, did you buy two of the family packs?  I bought two family packs.  It's cheap.  It was $43 on Amazon.  So under $86, I get 10 licenses.  It's cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the thing.  If you run into any reason to get it, get it.  It's cheap.  But like you say, don't be in a big hurry.  The QuickTime stuff is kind of interesting.  How much was QuickTime Pro in the past?  Like $20?  But you lose QuickTime Pro.  You don't get Pro.  You get the new QuickTime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is not Pro.  It's much less than Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It actually replaces Pro if you have Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This QuickTime X has a lot of missing features.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When did we ever get to the point where we say that an upgrade that probably should be  free and is $30 is actually quote unquote cheap?  I think there's more in here than would need to be.  I'm just wondering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're talking about QuickTime 7?  X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, 7 is an optional install.  It's still on the disk and you can install it.  They want you to use X, which doesn't do as much as Pro does.  I think they're going to still sell Pro.  You could still upgrade 7 to Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still have Final Cut on here so I can't really get rid of Pro.  You need it.  I need it to export videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's a strange thing they did with that.  I don't really quite understand that.  Very bizarre.  I'm going to do Mac break on Tuesday and all the fanboys on Mac are going to yell at me.  To me it's like, okay.  Apple didn't in their defense didn't say it's the greatest new thing ever happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It just seems like this is less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lessons.  Well, maybe because Windows 7 is considered such the hype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think this is more marketing than anything else.  I think they said, we've got to have something to respond to Windows 7.  Guys hold back any improvements you want to make.  We're not going to push them out as an update.  We're going to do it as a quote polish of leopard.  This is our response to Windows 7.  I think this is driven by marketing, not by technology.  And that's what I don't like about it.  That's really I think at the bottom.  You're a hater.  I'm a hater.  You're a hater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come and get me David Pogue.  Are you going to start just taking all your Macs surrounding you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, I love my Macs.  But I have to say I did upgrade.  I did.  No, I upgraded this Mac in front of me to Snow Leopard and one of my absolute critical  drivers wouldn't work.  So I'm it's back down to Leopard and I've kind of mad at myself for falling for the,  you know, the hype.  Anyway, it's not that big a story.  I just I thought I'd start with that so that we can get that out of the way.  And now a story for John.  The Kennedy family is using Twitter to update people on the funeral.  They started a Twitter account, Kennedy News, at Kennedy News, in which you can follow the  vigil and the whole thing.  Isn't that exciting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it is terribly creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's you've taken a very solemn ceremony and you've kind of.  We're tweeting.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Don't move the casket too quick.  I'm going to tweet it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's got a nice picture of Teddy.  It's really, you know, they call it Kennedy News, but really they could have called it  like the Kennedy wake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  What's right?  I mean, I've seen worse things on Twitter that way.  You know, it's probably some aid who's hired to just kind of update.  It's like live blogging.  Paul Byers have picked up casket.  Why not live blog a funeral?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a verified account.  I am not a verified account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not a verified account either, and I've begged them to give me a verification account

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Dead Kennedy is a verified account.  Is this Jello Biafra really running this?  Yeah, I was wondering about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.  Enough of that.  Nazi punks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, will Jello come back with the band?  No, I guess not.  I guess that's not going to happen.  Not going to happen.  That's not in the cards.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm so bad today.  FTC is banning robocalls unless it's a robocall that really bugs you.  That they're going to keep.  Tom, which ones?  So there's a...  I'll give you the good news first.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Give me the good news.  FTC chairman John Leibowitz said American consumers have, quote, made it crystal clear  that few things annoy them more than the billions of commercial telemarketing robocalls they

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  receive every year.  From now on, starting September 1st, violators of the new robocall prohibition will pay penalties  of $16,000 per call unless you're in one of the exempt categories.  What are those exempt categories?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exceptions start out pretty good, right?  If somebody's not trying to sell goods but maybe providing information like flight cancellations  or delivery notices, those are allowed.  I want those.  Notices from debt collectors, however, are also given an exception.  I guess there's an argument for that.  Other calls not covered include politicians, charities that contact consumers directly,  banks, insurers, phone companies, survey calls, and certain healthcare messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty much all of the people that call me already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know who can't call me?  My elementary school can no longer call me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's it.  I can't think of any robocall I've ever gotten that doesn't fall under one of the exceptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the thing is robocalls are great if you need to spread.  For example, school.  Like, school's closed today.  Keep your kids at home.  You don't want to pay someone $12 an hour to call people.  Has anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John, you must have registered on the Do Not Call registry.  Did you?  Have you registered on that?  Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does that work?  No, I have.  No.  The robocall that I get over and over and over and over and over again is from some  carpet cleaning company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does anyone get a one where you're says your car warranty is about to expire?  That's what this is targeting.  Oh, that's a scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just an out and out fraud.  That car warranty one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They take your credit card and charge it up the wazoo and you get nothing.  But that one they're already went after.  They prosecuted that guy.  Yeah.  But you're right.  That would be banned.  That would be banned even though it was already illegal because they were a fraud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That one's out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, too late.  Consumers already on the national Do Not Call registry should not be getting live and pre-recorded  telemarketing calls.  But I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unless you do business with the company.  So your bank can call you, your cable company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's not the people that are annoying me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you ever get your carpet cleaned by this company at any time, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Why would I want to do that?  I always tell people that this is a robocall, but anybody ever calls me trying to sell me  something, I just say, don't accept phone solicitations for anything.  I don't know them from Adam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My wife is a sucker for these.  There's a charity, any charity that has the word police in it, she'll give them money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they all-  Oh, yeah.  I have a, yeah.  The police, I used to work in a boiler room for a summer.  Really?  Wow.  And yeah.  He was young.  He needed the money.  I had the number one best sales for one day and I realized then it was just random numbers.  And I got to see a bunch of scams from both sides.  There's people that scan with the boiler room.  Oh, really?  Oh, I'd like to know how to do that.  Yeah.  You do that by ordering something and then when they bring it over, somehow you get the  receipt but then you send the product back and you end up keeping the receipt and you  stick the government for it.  And a guy that was running the place, yeah, he's got every year this, and there's one  company in Oakland.  They do that every year.  But he makes enough money, it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a cost of doing business.  It's very painful.  So there's this one, it's something like California Youth Police Youth Charity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was the one I was working for.  One of the things they did was one of these phony baloney basketball game for the police  department, some crap.  And the thing is, it's hard to, you don't really know what the deal is, but when somebody  calls me, I'm always flabbergasted.  I go, oh, my wife just got that call on the other line.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the guy goes, oh, I'm sorry.  They either go, oh, I'm sorry, sir.  And then they hang up and say, oh, what was the disposition?  I said, I don't know, you have to talk to her.  Call her.  But it gets them off the script that they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the key, get them off the script.  I usually just call the police.  Skip Jumps.  Do you hate children?  Skip Jumpers.  Yeah, they're using COBOL.  What was that line?  Skip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Skip Jumps, jump skip or something like that.  Some crazy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I looked it up.  So my wife pledged money to them, right?  And I looked it up.  And they're being sued by the state of California for fraud.  Not a kind of fraud for pocketing a significant percentage of the funds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in other words, they're a nonprofit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they won't say exactly what percentage goes to helping kids play  basketball against the police or whatever it is they're playing basketball against.  Don't you like the police?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to get one solicitations from the sheriff's department for like rodeos and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  What?  If it's the actual sheriff, I'll give them money.  I don't mind because maybe they won't arrest me.  But what is the deal?  And John, you would know this.  In California, you see these license plates.  They say the CHP 411 founder, whatever it is, foundation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the scam, supposedly the scam is you pay these guys a lot of money and you never get  a ticket again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I doubt it.  I mean, I know in Texas they have a little sticker that you get and you put on your car  window right near the window.  So the cops see when you come in.  You know, the only one way these are generally you're not going to get out of a ticket no  matter what they tell you unless you're unless it's part of the unless you're an ex-policeman  and you're actually contributing to some retirement fund.  Now there is there are different ways of getting out of tickets with certain kinds of, you  know, things that you can get from the cops.  Courtesy badges are one way of doing it.  And but generally courtesy badge.  Yeah, there's just a little miniature badges are about so they're about like an inch size  and they're usually exact copies of a real badge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it fits right in the wallet conveniently.  It goes in the wallet and they're from all over the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I knew you'd know about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds like a Mason kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know who had you know who I got one of those courtesy badges from from Luke Rider.  I had the one from the from he had he had the badge from the DA's.  In fact, he still has his badge from the New York Queen's District Attorney's Office and  look at it.  Get out of jail free card.  It's pretty much the same thing.  I used it once.  I don't get pulled over much because I drive like an old lady.  And so mainly because I got a speeding ticket doing 100 or something.  So now I drive like an old lady.  But but I pushed the button on the cruise control now because I know I can't get another  ticket because it's painful.  You have to go through traffic school.  It's ridiculous.  I did that recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I didn't have my little courtesy badge with me.  I did have it with when I was pulled over in Los Angeles once.  And I've shown me I pull out the wallet.  You kind of make it clear.  You get this little the little courtesy thing.  And he's then they grill you.  You have to be able to answer some questions.  I throw the somebody you're doing with the badge and you know, what is that doing there?  Who would you do?  And you know, the stuff I throw the book at him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd say what is your question?  You try to know actually, I was looking for the air pollution district.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I was working for the air pollution district, we had a lot of during the era when they  had they had cops working there pulling people for their cars, smoking too much.  And all of them were ex cops and they all had these little badges in their wallets.  And the story I got, which was kind of interesting, is one of the guys was a Sonoma County Sheriff's  Department guy and he had the little courtesy badge in his wallet and he got pulled over  by the highway patrol.  And the guy laughed at him when he showed him the badge.  And it turns out with the California Highway Patrol specifically, unless you have a California  Highway Patrol courtesy badge and you'd worked there before, they won't pay any attention  to this.  You have to have the right badge and you need the right handshake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When I was doing search and rescue, there was a sticker you could get from the sheriff's  department and they said this will not get you out of tickets.  Don't speed.  You might get somebody let you off of the warning because they're feeling nice that  day but it's no different than any other traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't buy like your way out of the way.  I hope not.  You can in Chicago.  Well you can.  I just, well yeah, you're not supposed to.  You can in Chicago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My name is Daley.  What do you say in Chicago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now in Chicago the trick is, if anybody wants to know, not that I study this stuff, but  the old trick in Chicago and I think it changes to make sure that they keep only the locals  aware of how you're supposed to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't use this technique because they'll change it tomorrow because you telegraphed them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The old trick in Chicago according to everybody I know is you keep your drive.  It's ridiculous that it just even works.  I've never tried it and I wouldn't do it and I don't recommend it.  But you have your driver's licenses in a...  It's wrapped in a hundred dollar bill.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's in a holder and behind your driver's license is a folded up hundred or a fifty  I think you can probably get away with.  And the cop asks for your driver's license.  You pull out this little holder that's completely...  And you give it to the cop.  The cop supposedly, the cop will turn around and look at the license and then he'll give  it back to you and then the hundred will be gone.  That's how it is in Mexico.  Go on your way.  That works in Mexico.  Now I don't know that this works.  I've never tried it but I've had more than a few locals tell me that this is what you  do.  I wouldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If I were a cop and I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a pretty low risk way though because at the worst they're going to turn around  and go, why did you put this in here and say, oh, I'm sorry sir, I didn't realize it was  in the wrong...  That's where I hide my money.  I didn't put it in front of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, that's a very low risk trick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd be pissed.  I'd double the ticket.  I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did get pulled over once.  I didn't know the trick but I got pulled over once.  I was rushing to the airport and it was really funny because the cop pulled me over and I  think he expected something but then he realized I was in a rental car from California and  he brushed me off as fast as he could to get rid of me.  Why?  Because he needed to go find somebody that had the hundred dollars in the back of the  thing.  I was just a loser.  I didn't know what I was doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You all know how to bribe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You all get out of here.  You do not know how to pay bribe.  It's kind of an expensive bribe too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think in Mexico you can get away with a little cheaper like 20 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My wife was arrested when she was younger.  She was backing her car.  She lived in Guadalajara.  She was backing her car out of the driveway and a guy on a motorcycle ran into her and  she said the rule is whoever bleeds was the victim.  So he caught himself or something.  So they came.  The cops come and they get in the car with her and say drive to the jail because they  don't have a car.  So they drive to the jail.  So she drives herself in her car to the jail.  They put her in jail and her friends came with a fifth of whiskey and that was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all good between friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The fifth of whiskey got her out?  That's pretty cheap.  Yeah.  Well she shouldn't have been in jail in the first place.  I wonder if I could get by with Otter Pops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It depends on how hot it is.  Otter Pops.  It's a really hot day maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What flavor do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got whiskey flavored Otter Pops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But she says now she's got a record and she's like very proud of that.  They gave her, they actually, I think she, oh no that was another time.  She's done time.  That was the other time she got arrested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How often does your wife get arrested?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well she's got two strikes now.  Uh oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two strikes.  In the state of California or just in general?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  One was in California, one was in Mexico.  I probably shouldn't be talking about this.  The one in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll be hearing about it later tonight.  It's a matter of public record.  Or a misdemeanor.  You might as well work overtime tonight Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was in, yeah I'm not going home tonight.  I'll sleep here on the Twitt Cottage.  It was in Plumas County I think.  She wants to go up there and get her mug shot.  She thinks it would be nice to have your mug shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You should be able to have your own mug shot.  You should have your mug shot.  You can do it at home.  You can get your file from the FBI.  Why can't you get your mug shot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She said she was waiting in line once with the cops and some lady comes up and says,  I want my mug shot.  So now she's got it in her head that you can do that.  You can go up and demand your mug shot.  Alright we're going to take a break.  I'm going to call my wife and see if I've still got a place to live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell her the show is no good not to listen to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what's funny?  I don't have to ever worry about that.  She has never once listened not only to Twitt but to any show.  Till today.  This would be the one she'd listen to.  She's probably watching live today for the first time ever.  She said I went over to the neighbor's house and I wanted to watch the show so I went to  twitt.live.tv and there's a naked woman's butt on there.  I said what?  Where did you go?  twitt.live.tv.  I said I don't own the live domain.  I don't know where you went but that's not...  Live.tv.  What was that again Leo?  Let me just check it out.  Go to live.tv.  The same thing would happen if you put jennifer.live.tv.  It has nothing to do with me but she still blames me for that.  She thinks I'm putting porn on the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, she'd be driving a better car.  She'd be driving a much nicer car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  And a much more interesting set of friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honey if only.

You were saying there were a number of studies this week that said only kids, I mean only  adults use Twitter.  Kids don't like the Twitter.  It's, it's, but you're saying that was a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a bunch of them.  And now this guy, Jeff Cook on TechCrunch says, actually, you're not looking at the  data very closely.  In fact, the problem is nobody's looking at the data of the people over 17.  He says we recently ran a survey of 10,000 plus U.S. teenagers, 13 to 17 to see if we  could add anything new to the question.  It turns out the question is flawed.  The reasons given for the alleged aversion have ranged from condescending because they  have nothing to say to because it doesn't feel safe because they can't afford it.  All these reasons are predicated on the widely accepted notions that teens don't tweet.  But the fact of the matter is we haven't figured that people above 17 also post on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nobody tweets, tweets.  Scoble said Twitter's worth 15 billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, nobody tweets.  Facebook is only 9% teen while Twitter is 11% team.  So actually, Twitter has more teens on it than Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, that's the zombie from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John's dancing at it.  Oh, is that?  Oh, I know what game you're talking about.  Yeah, I love that game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The voodoo voodoo something.  You play basically you play a voodoo doll that has to get your.  What is that from, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I was hoping you guys would tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Voodoo something.  X-Box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The point of this whole story is all these Twitter stories are for bunk.  It's all bunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all hype.  What did I miss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Voodoo Vince.  Oh, you know, the story that people that teens don't tweet.  It turns out they do tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a higher concentration of teens on Twitter than on Facebook.  The problem is that's a lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The problem is nobody tweets that there are these millions of people who have accounts,  but nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tweet about two or three times a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I tweet two or three times a week.  I tweet maybe once in a while.  There's a pill you can take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys are all tweet tweet Twitter haters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, the worm has turned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So much hatred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Federal.  So this little guy here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This came out this game, whatever it was, was 2003.  They sent this out as a promo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Voodoo Vince.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Voodoo Vince.  He's got a button eye.  I figured this got to be worth something.  I have a house full of crap like this, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it pristine?  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it in the case?  Is it pristine?  It was never in a case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It came like this.  You should set up an eBay section.  I think crap from my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Roger could come over and for what would you take?  Sure.  Take pictures of everything.  List it all on eBay.  It'd be a good business, Roger.  You could probably make $12,000, $15,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could stay at home all day.  Send, take, and receive and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Work from home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Work from home.  I had to do that.  I did that for my friend once.  He signed up for one of those work from home deals at the back.  And you did it?  No.  He ordered it from the back of the popular site.  What do you get?  So he got this one where you had to mow, comb mow hair, which is basically camo hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They send you clumps of mow hair.  It's really difficult to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, honey, I got my new shipment of hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're telling me that didn't work?  I thought it was envelope stuffing or data entry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They send you one.  And as you progress, you send it back and they send you another batch.  It's basically distributed labor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How much do you get per clump?  It's got to be a lot to make it pay, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but we were all in college and it was like, hey, we need money.  So you send it in front of the TV.  No, no, no, no.  You don't understand.  It's impossible to comb.  You follow the direction supposed to soak it and warm water.  It's just impossible.  So he said, screw it.  I'm just going to get a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe it's a scam.  Did you pay for the kit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, you send away for it.  It's free?  You send a clump of mow hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You send it to Ashton Kutcher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, even if it was a scam, why would you pay money for someone to take hair off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What would you do with your stolen mow hair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're trying to get rid of the mow hair.  They have a mow hair surplus and they found a way.  This is an interesting story.  The federal government and the Obama administration has requested this.  It's a Senate bill they're looking at right now that would give the administration, any  administration, not just the Obama administration, any administration the right to declare a  cybersecurity emergency and upon declaration of a cybersecurity emergency, take over private  networks for security purposes.  And there's been a little bit of, you know, furor around this.  I mean, it's mostly it's partisan.  I mean, I think if it were Bush, it'd be Democrats complaining and if it were Obama, it'd be  Republicans complaining.  But do we want the president to have the right to take over private networks in a national  security emergency?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, is it couched in the terms of declaring martial law for a section?  And you say, OK, right now, your company's networks are now run by the government for  government purposes kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's the fear.  It's natural disaster or severe attack.  Those are the things. It's sort of a wartime use of communications networks.  And this bill clarifies to say under the previous laws that allow the executive branch  to take over communications networks, the Internet's one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At 9-11, President Bush shut down the airways.  He said, it's not safe to fly.  We're not going to let anybody fly.  That was, you know, he had the right to do that, the legal right to do that.  So this extended to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unless you're a Saudi prince.  The Prince Walid.  He got to get out of the country.  Get to fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right before the right before it went down.  It's like, oh, you better get on the plane now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What? He left before it happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, he left right before the...  Right before the closure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, right before they closed the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because you might have stumbled on something if he left before 9-11.  I would think.  He ran out of the country.  Right. You better leave right now.  We don't know what's going to happen.  See, this is how this stuff got started.  This is Adam Curry's listening, taking notes right now.  He already knows this.  Is Adam one of the 9-11 doubters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A truther?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A truther?  A truther. Now, that's a birther.  Is there a truther as well as a birther?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the truthers came before the birthers.  The fact the birthers were named after the truthers.  That's how it got that name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an entirely new mythology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the truthers believe that 9-11 was a government, a US government plot.  An inside job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can look it up on the Google.  You can look up truther and you'll find all these links.  No, there's about six branches of the truthers.  One of them thinks it's a US government plot.  One of them thinks it's that guy who owned the buildings,  who set them up to get blown up.  There's a million different possibilities for the truthers.  The only thing in common that they have is the fact they think the whole thing  was something's fake about it.  And they keep pointing to World Trade Center 7 as evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Adam is one of these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Adam will tend to, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is it in the human constitution that makes us want to believe?  Believe in conspiracies.  Believe conspiracies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably because of conspiracies.  Like the Guy Fawkes thing where they tried to blow up British parliament that was, you  know, actually tried to happen.  Or that...  That was a while ago.  I don't think that's in my DNA.  That's where it started, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's the same thing that starts...  I'm going to get a real controversy here when I say this.  It's the same thing that starts religions.  Which is, you know...  When you go back into the anthropological history, people create religions because they  want an explanation for things.  And so...  But what if there's an obvious...  The explanation doesn't suffice...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What if there's like an obvious explanation, a terrorist commandeered a plane and steered  it into the building?  I mean, it seems like we've been watching that happen.  What if that obvious explanation is there?  Why is it that we want another one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think part of it is also because people who feel that so many believe, people believe  in something, it obviously must...  There must be something.  I know the secret stuff.  Most people are just too dumb to understand.  So there's some secrets.  Is it because of everybody?  And therefore they feel somehow empowered.  Superior.  Yeah, they feel like they're superior because they've stumbled onto something that people  don't understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's evidence that crazy things happening over time that are kind of  suspicious.  Like for example, in California, they ripped out all the little trams all over the states  just before World War II.  And then it turned out there was a lawsuit 50 years later against Firestone, Ford and  Shen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was in Los Angeles, the whole GM Firestone and Mobil supposedly got into this.  No, it wasn't Mobil, it was Chevron.  Was it Chevron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it was Standard Oil.  Standard, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Standard.  Basically, all three of them conspired to remove all the streetcars in LA.  It wasn't even that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What they did was they put all their money into electing local officials and putting  them in place to have all these streetcar tracks removed so buses could take over.  And this was in Los Angeles, Fresno, a bunch of there's a bunch of little towns all over  this.  That's just good business.  St. Louis is another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good idea.  And it was a marketing thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a lot of a lot of conspiracy stuff stems from marketing.  So if I...  Snow Leopard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, Snow Leopard.  No, what I'm thinking is maybe I could buy some congressmen.  Are they cheap?  Depends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've never tried buying one.  There needs to be a Web 2.0 site for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm thinking, yeah, buy a congressman like they can auction.  Like an eBay.  No, no, like Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can wait till the specials happen on the weekend and then you can get a cheaper  rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's easier actually just to buy local officials.  I know.  They could call it Senate woot.  And they have a special woot of the day and you get a Senator.  Pelosi woot.  Pelosi woot.  Because I'm thinking what I could do is like, if I got a law passed against radio and TV,  that would be good for my business, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely, Leo.  Let's do it.  Anyway.  I'm in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's go back to Senate Bill S773.  CNET News has obtained a copy of the 55 page draft of S7.  This is Jay Rockefeller said Bill.  Would quote, allow the president to quote, declare a cybersecurity emergency relating  to non-governmental computer networks and do what's necessary to respond to the threat.  Now I think what it's really aimed at, remember when we found out that the bunch of these  companies that run the nation's electrical grid had Trojan horses and security breaches  and they really hadn't secured their networks at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's one of the biggest examples of why you would need this is if you just, you know,  suddenly the entire power grid got hacked into and you needed to take drastic measures

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to cut it off.  I think Katrina was kind of highlighted because once, when that hit suddenly, you know, every  available means of communication other than, you know, wireless, like, you know, TV radio  was out and having to coordinate and respond to all these issues at that time, I mean,  it's huge.  So why not have a system or take over system that's already in place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because the government showed such prowess during the Katrina thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no, I'm not saying whether it's that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You imagine them taking over these networks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is there a good reason for the government to take over the internet at any point?  I think so.  I don't know that I can think of anything beyond the power grid.  The power grid is really a big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't think they need to take over Twitter, but I think the power grid-  They gotta take over because of the porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They gotta stop porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, when they take over, does that mean they take over the DNS servers?  They take over all the routing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what I mean?  Well, that's my problem with this is it's written so broadly that they can take over  anything they want.  They can do all of those things.  And do they even know how to take it over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well this is the other question with Vivek Kundra and Mr. Chopra and the lack of a system  that the cyber securities are.  I wonder if we really are better off with these private industry handling this stuff  at this point.  They haven't demonstrated any technology savvy at all.  And beyond that point-  Ever.  Ever?  Ever.  So it's not just this administration.  I mean is it gonna-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it gonna end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's probably some people at the NSA that could do a really good job of taking over  these networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I say this instead of wasting energy on this bill, what they should be doing is going after  these companies, these power grids that are being broken into and say, look guys, you've  got to fix it.  Here's the guidelines that we're gonna have an independent third party security audit  and we're gonna make you fix it now.  Why wait till there's a cybersecurity emergency?  Fix it now.  Why are we worried about when there's a cybersecurity emergency?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think this should be about fixing.  The idea with the communications network is we need to keep the lines clear.  So we're taking over the communications network and we're stopping all non-essential communication  until the emergency is over.  Is there an analog to that on the internet?  Where you stop people from-  No, because it's killing torrents to keep the lines clear?  There isn't.  Is there?  I don't think so.  Maybe it's just to help the MPAA.  I guess you could actually.  You could go in and say, I'm gonna kill all the P2P protocols on this network.  Because we need the bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My thing is like, so, okay, if they do take over, can they suddenly say, well, okay, we  have hackers from China, we're gonna start blocking all IPs from that region automatically  and they can do that with a free hand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The new version does actually address what I was talking about.  It gives the executive branch 180 days to implement a comprehensive national cybersecurity  strategy.  Thumbs up on that.  90 days to develop a plan to implement what they call a dashboard pilot project.  I guess a dashboard would be what's our situation.  But the mandated legal review won't be done for another year.  So I'm not sure why they're gonna wait on that.  That's one of the questions Declan McCullough asks.  He actually posed four questions to Charles Stewart at the Commerce Committee and has  not received a response.  But I think that's a valid thing to say.  You got 90 days to figure out a plan, 180 days to implement it, get it out there.  That's what I'd like to see them work on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm with the EFF here where they say, look, there's no real additional limits.  There's no designation of what makes something a critical infrastructure.  It's too vague.  It just needs some more clarity.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they don't understand what they're doing.  Let's face it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, it's one of those things where, you know, under a benign administration, it  might not be much of an issue, but you know, you get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Put Cheney in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In our chat room, somebody's saying the problem is that this is treating the internet as U.S.  property.  It's not U.S. property.  It's not any, it's actually not a national issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but isn't this less about the internet and more about private networks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it does say private networks.  But that could include the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well that's what I'm asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It could include Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Well, what about all the backbones?  That's what I'm saying.  I think there's cat control.  There's good precedent.  No, I understand that.  But if you can't control major arteries of it, you might not control it, you can severely  cripple it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's good precedent for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are we going to do when everything is dependent on the internet and they just shut  it down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're screwed.  No, smoke signals and carrier pigeons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't stop the internet, John.  It's unstoppable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll take over the world and turn into a great mush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've got like two backbones.  You cut those things off and you're done.  All they have to do is shut down the...  They stopped the internet down in South Bay when they had somebody just clip two wires  someplace.  It was down for a whole 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you kill those 13 DNS servers, the whole thing's down.  Unless you...  Hey, we should start a project for people to save IP addresses so they don't need DNS.  So everybody should like...  We should have a national IP registry so that everybody...  If you needed an IP address, you could call me and say, what is Yahoo?  The DNS isn't working.  And I could say it's 162.34.74.9, Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that what it is?  No, I made that up.  Or maybe we could just wean ourselves off computers and go back to living like our great,  great grandfather.  I'm so ready for that.  I am ready for that.  Back to farming and traveling by mule.  Coming mohair.  Dinking.  Send me some mohair.  Go starving.  I'm going to raise...  There's a lot of stinking and starving right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I got a story on this list here that I want to talk about.  Yes, sir.  Gamer study reinforces stereotypes, players say.  That they're fat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Over 35.  The average video game player is 35, has a somewhat larger BMI than normal.  And if you're a woman player...  That's not the music code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the body mass index, not the royalty collection index.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Body mass index or something like that.  Female players reported greater depression than women who don't play video games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's because they are depressed that they play video games.  It's a chicken egg thing, right?  Chicken egg or chicken...  Well, either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Works in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's ask Veronica.  She doesn't seem particularly depressed.  She seems happy.  Do you think she's underneath tears of a clown?  She's like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  What the hell are you talking about?  I can't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a preface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that why she drinks so much brain tonic?  She's really depressed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have actually never known her to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She's pretty chipper.  I would not call her depressed.  She's pretty chipper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think this is true.  Curtis, sexygeek134, says, I've been playing video games since 1978 with the Atari 2600.  When I was six years old, I play about four to eight hours a week with a lot of variation.  I'd always plan to become a video game designer slash computer scientist, but pursued a career  as an orthodontist instead.  He says he's near 35, he's not fat, and he's not bummed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I hate these stories because every time you come...  Every time you come out with something and say, well, this is sort of the survey shows  that the higher percentage of people do it this way.  I'm not that way.  I'm not exactly like that.  No, it's an average.  Kids don't Twitter.  I'm a kid, I Twitter.  Kids Twitter.  I'm a kid, I don't Twitter.  See, you are upset by the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the way all news is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know.  It's all made up.  You're upset by the tension, the natural tension between anecdotal evidence and fact.  Yes.  What's statistical?  Statistical fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's factish.  Factish.  Factoidish.  It's more factish than a...  How about this one?  Here's a fact.  I want a higher representative sample.  Use a...  Like the entire population?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe 10,000 people.  Use a cell phone, go to jail.  In Utah, after a crash here that killed two scientists and prompted a dogged investigation  by a police officer and a local victim's advocate, Utah has passed the nation's toughest law  to crack down on texting behind the wheel.  If you should text behind the wheel and cause a crash that injures or kills somebody, 15  years in jail and a fine of, I don't know, a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  15,000, I think it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  15 years in jail.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  All for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go for it.  I don't think people should be talking on the phone while they're driving around.  No.  They shouldn't be doing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  People should be doing a lot less of things.  People eat...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what people should be doing while they're driving around?  Driving.  I know.  Watching the mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this the crotchety...  Oh, it is Cranky Geeks.  Wait a minute.  I accidentally have put together a Cranky Geeks panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We haven't shown up on the show, by the way.  I'll show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got stuff to do.  I'm busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What day do you tape?  We do every Cranky Geeks on Wednesdays at 12.  I got things to do on Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do other shows on Wednesday.  I can't leave this ball.  I have to sit on this ball all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What gets me is basically all these in-car entertainment systems with DVD players, screens.  I saw one guy watching a movie on his dash.  He had a TV on his dash.  Which is illegal, right?  Which is illegal.  But unless a cop manages to pull up right alongside him and actually see him doing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sir, you were watching that TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had the Slingbox app playing on the iPhone up sitting on the dash watching it and realized...  I was passenger seat, but then I realized, oh, this is probably a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In California, texting is banned while driving, but you know what the penalty is for texting  while driving in California?  $20 fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got rand...  See, this is...  I put $100 folded up in my...  The parking ticket in San Francisco is $100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Officer, here's $100 for that $20 fine.  That's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't make sense.  It's one of those things because I almost got in a collision because a person next to  me was texting and they were making a left turn without looking.  And they were literally coming into me.  And it's times like that that you get that road warrior rage where you just want to chase  him down and crush your car.  Because you're just so...  Hey, don't be a hater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't be a hater on people who don't properly operate a vehicle and endanger everyone's  lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  I think I will be.  For this one instance.  You're a hater, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know?  I've done it before.  I've done it.  You've done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've all done it.  Texted?  Yeah.  No.  I've never texted while driving.  Ever.  I've never texted while driving.  I've actually pulled over and put the car in parking and then text.  So I have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've done that.  What you could do, you put your hands through the steering wheel.  This is good.  And then you could type like this.  This is the technique.  It's a how-to video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  While you're driving.  You know what?  You should develop a thumb board for the steering wheel so you have...  There you go.  And then you have a heads up display that has a text so it always looks like you're  looking straight ahead.  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think I could sell that?  That would solve the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would.  You'll be like a fighter pilot.  Click, click, click, click, click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because that's not distracting.  Ah, it's a business.  You know the Swedish regulators are going to ban the word bank from domain names?  What?  Why?  If you get a .se.  You can't be really big bank .se?  So you're extending the law that prevents anyone from having the word bank in their  name without proving their illegitimate bank to domain names.  So no...  Oh, you have to be a bank first.  You have to be a bank to call yourself a bank in Sweden and they're saying that applies  to domain names now.  I think that makes sense.  What about blood bank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about a sperm bank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  Maybe in Swedish they don't call it a blood bank or a sperm bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if you have embankment in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, I guess it doesn't apply to just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if it's a river bank?  I'm the river bank in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What if your name is Tom Bank and you just happen to be Swedish?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, isn't that one Dutch ISP going to start doing metered internet where they'll  basically charge you according to what you're using it for?  More video, you get charged more data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a great idea.  Actually, that's what you always said should happen, John, isn't it?  What, metering the internet?  Of course.  Yeah.  Aren't you a fan of that?  Absolutely.  Didn't we have a big fight over that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was reading some tech journals out of, I guess, Australia and somebody came up with  another one of my, I think one of my wonderful ideas from 2003 saying that we should license  computer users.  You mean like can radio operators?  There's too many phone heads out there.  It's a hazard of navigation.  They're idiots.  They're going for Nigerian scams.  They're getting viruses all over the place.  The only reason we have a problem with all these bots is because people are stupid.  They need to be licensed.  License internet usage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just like drivers.  See how well that's worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  License people on the internet.  Plenty of unlicensed drivers on the road.  Are those the ones texting?  They have to take a test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What kind of test?  Would you design that test, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be called the Dvorak test, like the touring test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, John used to ask people what search engine they'd use to see if they knew anything.  And if they said Yahoo or MSN, they'd go, pfft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should throw in a couple of questions about wine, too.  That way you can kind of stratify the various...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, like your upscale or a downscale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like having a chauffeur's license or a truck driver's license.  You have to have a little more skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  More skills?  So your bandwidth would be...  Let's combine these ideas.  Your bandwidth gets determined by your score on the test.  Everybody can have internet access, but you're limited to dial up if you don't pass the test.  That's a good idea.  I like it.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can do less harm, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you're a Mensa member, are you automatically...  Broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you automatically booted from the whole system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you're a Mensa member and say you're a Mensa member, never again.  And you're on internet, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not allowed to use the internet ever.  Unless you can come up with some really good puns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that your favorite form of humor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, Mensa's notorious for...  Their typical Mensa philosophy is that the highest form of humor is a pun.  What?  You ever heard that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's coming from Tom, pun master.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tell Oscar Wilde that.  He was the master of the pun.  So the Pirate Bay has been sold to GGF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it finished?  Golden Gate Fields here in Albany?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, Global Gaming Factory X.  The shareholders voted to acquire Pirate Bay on Thursday.  The majority of stockholders at GGF gave the acquisition its blessing.  However, they need 60 million Kroner.  They got to go to thebank.com.  That's $8.2 million.  I guess that's the fine.  Is that the fine that they have to pay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you stay with that Swedish accent, Leo?  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Trading in Golden Gate Fields shares has been suspended because Aki Target, the stock exchange  for GGF is listed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So how are they going to get the money to make the acquisition when they're stocked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Their stock is suspended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there's no acquisition yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there's no acquisition.  I'm like a sucker for these voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so funny because I work with a Swede and it's just...  They don't talk like that.  Of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nothing close to it.  That's the Finnish.  I know.  That's how the Finns talk that way.  We have many Swedish and Finnish listeners to whom I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're now sending you rocks.  Lots and lots of rocks.  Akiya coupons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The rocks.  D.A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  CEO Johan Ljungberg said he had not heard from GGF in three or four weeks and was very hopeful.  You're working into it.  I'm working my way into it.  It's just not right, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you're Irish.  Now you've just lost it.  That was great.  You became an African or something.  They did.  So that's really Irish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Irish accent is a Swedish accent.  It was a little historical.  Top of the morning to you and the rest of the day for you.  May the road ride up in the way and you're going out of the way on the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Will the road rise to meet you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Raise to meet you on the way out of the dirt.  Don't let the ditch in the butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good.  That's like a combination thing.  Those are harder to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know if this whole tech thing fails you can just do impersonations all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bad impersonations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can do like those.  It's my future.  Remember they used to sell novelty phone messages for you?  Yeah, I could do that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hello, John's not here right now.  Would you like to leave a message or a lute-a-fisk?  Court, let's see, rejects cap on cable market share again.  This was actually very aggressive.  An appeals court overturned a rule.  The FCC has been trying, for a long time, had a rule that said that a cable company  could not have more than 30% of the nation's subscribers.  Comcast can't have more than 30%.  Comcast has at 25% and they want to be bigger.  So they sued and a court of appeals said that the rule, the 30% rule was arbitrary  and capricious.  Actually it's better if you say arbitrary and capricious.  And they threw it out.  Big victory for Comcast.  Real defeat for the FCC.  It seems sensible to me that no one media company should dominate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean like what's the Radio Clear Channel?  Clear Channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Totally dominates.  And by the way I want to thank everybody at Clear Channel for giving me a job.  So let's not slam Clear Channel, okay Roger?  Or CBS Radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you working at Clear Channel?  What's your connection to Clear Channel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Premier, which syndicates my show, is owned by Clear Channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you mean the KFI show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well it's all over the country but it's many of them.  Yeah, but what kind of money do you make from that compared to this?  Fearing a cable monopoly, Congress in 1992 directed the FCC to set limits on how many...  Wait a minute, I'm sounding like Linus Torvalds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me get this right.  The cable companies came in and said, we want monopolies in every region.  So make it legal for us to have a monopoly in every region.  There's only one cable company.  But then the government said, okay but we don't want a monopoly for the entire country.  And they said, no, no, no, we want one for everywhere too.  We want the monopoly nationwide.  So why don't we just cut out all of this crap and say, you know what, the United States  just grant a monopoly to one company and get it over with.  Forget free competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, Web 1194 says, the Finns don't talk like that.  Screw you Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly how he said it.  The Finns don't talk at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No that's right.  That's why they invented texting.  We can thank the Finns for this whole texting thing because they didn't want to talk to  people.  They wanted, they were very shy.  They're very shy people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are.  And they like to drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's good for you.  So I think this is, to be honest with you, I think you're exactly right, Tom.  I think this is what protects us from an utter monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean I love that these cable companies are constantly saying we don't want government  regulation when they absolutely want government regulation.  In their favor.  Just as long as it's benefiting them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that how it always goes?  Rules that benefit someone are always good laws, but if laws that somehow kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We always protect free speech unless we're offended by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The FCC led by Obama appointee Julius Genachowski said the commission is reviewing the decision  and will take it into account on future actions to implement the law.  One FCC commissioner, Robert McDowell, was more vocal saying, I disagreed with the decision

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to reimpose the cap in 2007.  He said this, I knew this would happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So he's all for this.  He's all for it.  He's all for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I'm fine.  Do you want Comcast to own 50% of the cable market?  As long as there's unfettered competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly.  That's my problem.  I'm fine with getting rid of a cap as long as you can have local competition as well  and I can choose.  Sure.  But if I'm locked into Comcast locally, all I can do is go to DirectTV or Dish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  While we're at it, the FCC also protects cable operators from other ISPs using their physical  plan.  The phone companies are required to let DSL providers use the central office.  For years, the FCC has said, oh no, cable is an infant industry.  We have to protect them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's something to be said for that, Leo.  What you really want to do is you want to think in a medicine.  Say you let them do their own thing.  Let them have their protection.  Let them build out the infrastructure.  Then screw them later in the game.  Right.  When it really hurts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now it's later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not later yet.  It's like a patent.  The idea of a patent is to protect you for the investment for a limited amount of time.  I think the cable companies have been protected.  They dug those ditches.  Yes, it was very expensive, but that was 30 years ago.  They've been protected for 30 years.  All right.  You want to eliminate this rule that you can't have 30% market share?  Fine.  We'll also eliminate, I'm with you, Tom, we'll also eliminate the rule that says you have  a local monopoly.  Let's, while we're at it, allow ISPs to use the cable for their, so there's a little competition  in the internet service market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the quid pro quo of giving you the protection.  Verizon's laying their own Fios cable.  John, do you know?  Does anybody know if they're getting any kind of protection?  I don't think they are.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think your theory is absolutely correct.  It's about time we opened up this backbone.  It's been long enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's been long enough.  They got their money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They got their time.  They got their money.  If they didn't make their money, well, maybe they...  They made their money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's one of the ruses they're trying to perpetrate on the people of the United States  is that the cable companies are somehow not making money.  They're making more money all the time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm with you on that.  Not going to have any anger against Comcast for any reason at all.  I like Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're Comcast-ic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got a very generous severance package from them.  You did?  No.  I got a severance package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They fought me tooth and nails on the severance package.  You like Comcast, John, is that right?  They're Comcast-ic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You just wanted to say that, didn't you?  I love saying it.  My Comcast internet was out last night.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not so Comcast-ic.  No, actually I'll have to say that my Comcast is a lot better than my AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, mine is too.  Well, I didn't have AT&T, but I had AT&T lines.  I had a different ISP.  Do you use Comcast for phone?  No.  No.  Anybody use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  John, you don't use Comcast for phone.  I use AT&T.  No.  Anybody I know who's used Comcast for phone says, that's okay.  We're willing to stand corrected if Comcast wants to call in.  Donate.  1-800-555-1212.  Give us a ring anytime.  We'll be glad to put you on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just Twitter it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  Real briefly, I want to mention folks the great deal that Audible is offering you all for  audiobooks.  Now, this is a deal you can get behind.  If you go to audible.com slash twit two, you can sign up for that platinum account.  That gives you two, count them two audiobooks from Audible.  I'm a big Audible fan.  I have to say, listen to Audible like crazy.  What am I listening to?  I'm still listening to Game of Thrones.  That thing is long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a long ass book.  That's only the first.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got them all and it's long, but I'm still on the first.  But I'm getting there.  I'm getting there.  It's wonderful.  The guy is such a good reader.  Also listening to a book that Annie Anakko recommended called Writing Down the Bones  for Writers.  It's really good.  I think John went off to.  Oh God.  John's put up a picture of Microsoft Bob.  I think John's actually, I think John's studio is in the bathroom and he just wanted a little  privacy.  What is he doing?  Microsoft Bob.  Where did he get that?  That's awesome.  He has a lot of that crap.  He said he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's probably like a mouse pad.  He should probably turn his house into a museum.  I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll tell some stories about John when he's gone, but first let me remind you, audible.com.  It's a great bookstore of audiobooks.  60,000 wonderful titles.  I love signing into Audible and just to see every day.  They've done a really nice job of the front page giving you ideas for stuff to read.  I'm just going to log in here real quickly.  We can see what's on the front page at audible.com.  I don't have a book pick for us this week, but it's all right.  We've got the site.  We can maybe find something wonderful to listen to in business and classics and fiction history,  science fiction.  Do James Patterson out and on sale, $9.95.  The Alex Crosses Trial, $9.95 on sale.  The Ted Kennedy Biography by Edward Klein.  We recommended that a little while ago.  Great stuff.  Audible.com slash twit two.  Sign up for the gold account.  You get two books, two books a month.  The first two are free and even if you decide not to stick around, you get to keep those  books.  Yours is good.  This is a good one.  This is good for those people who game too much.  Raise Your Social IQ, How to Do the Right Thing in Any Situation by Michael Levine.  How to Mix Business and Social Relationships.  Thank you notes and why they're indispensable.  Email versus snail mail.  Guess which one's better.  How to behave on a first date.  That'd be good for you, Roger.  You could use that.  Yeah, totally.  Racism, politics, and sex.  RSVP or else the 10 Commandments of Social IQ, the basics of friendship.  Just an example of the kind of things that you can learn.  You're in the car, you're driving home.  Maybe you had a bad experience on that first date.  You could get the book out and you can learn.  Also in sci-fi, they've got the, oh boy, this is in science and technology, the Feynman  Lectures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh nice.  Wow, that's long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's quite a few of them.  Wow, this is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are they the tapes of Feynman reading?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  The Feynman Lectures on Fixer.  Yeah, let's play a little bit.  If you've never heard, let me see if you can hear his voice on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You see a system which is similar to those artificial wave machines that they have in  first year physics.  If you have a harmonic oscillator...  You hear that great New York accent.  ...you have a harmonic oscillator and so on.  And starting a irregularity in one place, which is analogous to putting an electron  in one atom, will ultimately produce irregularities moving all around.  In other words, the electron makes its way in the quantum mechanical analog of the wave

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  phase.  This guy was so brilliant.  They have the complete Feynman Lectures.  All... was it 32 volumes?  I can't remember.  20 volumes?  All of them on here.  I didn't know they've got them all now.  That's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is fantastic.  I have those on a CD collection at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You probably have the six easy pieces, no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's the lectures.  The lectures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the one I have.  This is the Essentials of Physics.  This would be a great one to start with because it's five hours, six lectures in his inimitable  style.  You'd really learn the basics of physics here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've read the tapes from the original Feynman course all these years, and they have graciously  allowed Addison Wesley to work in partnership with them.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's, of course, the foreword.  I don't know why they do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The current Sword and Laser book is also on there.  What's that?  The Forever War by Joe Haldeman.  Is it good?  It's great.  What's it about?  It's about Vietnam, essentially, but really the premise is a guy goes off to fight this  alien race away from Earth.  Relativity kicks in.  When he comes back, everybody he knows is old, close to death.  I love it.  It changes.  So he goes back and re-enlists because he can't adjust and Earth isn't welcoming.  I've read this.  I love that book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a great allegory.  Unfortunately, it's something I actually have to finish reading.  It started off...  There's two Forever Wars on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't get the Dexter Filkins.  Don't get the Dexter Filkins one.  That's a different story.  This is Joe Haldeman narrated by George Wilson.  That's a good one.  See, this is why you need two.  It's not even enough.  So get one.  Get the Feynman six easy pieces and the Forever War.  There you go.  And get your science quotient and your sci-fi quotient.  They also have many of the books about Feynman on here too.  It's just a wonderful book.  Look, you see how much fun it is to browse this bookshelf?  You get them, you download them, you got them on your iPod, your iPhone, your Zoom, you  got them on your Kindle or your GPS device.  I mean, it's just...  It's there and it's ready and you listen to it on the way home tonight.  Audible.com slash twit2.  Give it a try.  We know you're going to love it.  Are you back, John?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, I'm coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I swear.  Still.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's got the Microsoft Bob thing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm one of the few people that have...  I have an unopened...  That's the box?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the box Bob came in?  Oh, that's a box.  Wow.  Look at that.  And it's unopened.  See, now that's worth a lot of money on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's got one ding in it.  Oh, it's got two dings in it now.  It's got two dings in it now.  I have actually two unopened boxes of Microsoft Bob.  They sent me three copies for some unknown reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, I'm surprised.  I thought you stored all this stuff over a Chevron station.  No, I should.  You used to have...  Wait a minute.  You used to have a storage room.  I remember going in there when we did the radio show in the 90s.  I needed a modem and Mimi let me in and it was like Fibber McGee's closet.  You opened the door and all this stuff cascades out.  Didn't you have that?  It was over a gas station.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not imagining that.  That's where he ran a little operation called WorldWare 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want to elaborate?  What was that about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, obviously it wasn't successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can buy it now.  Microsoft Bob unopened, 100 bucks on eBay.  It's a buy it now?  No bids.  $49.99 is the minimum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to have to pay someone to take all that stuff away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I knew if I saved the box it would be worth something someday.  Does it run on Snow Leopard?  It's actually kind of interesting.  The back of it.  I blogged this about a year ago and took screenshots of all the back and the front and all the  rest.  It's actually kind of interesting to look at the sales pitch they have and all these  little cartoons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There are people in chat room who don't know what Microsoft Bob is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft took it off their timeline.  Microsoft doesn't even know what it is.  It never existed.  We know nothing about this.  Very Orwellian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You'll be glad about this, John.  We've been talking on Twitter for at least a year about the fact that when you cross the  US border, border control has the right to search your laptop.  I don't mean just open it up and look at it.  Go through the hard drive looking for stuff.  Yeah, they're looking for porn.  But the Obama administration on Thursday put new restrictions on searches of laptops  at US borders.  A supervisor now has to approve holding a device for more than five days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What?  Or 30 days depending on the agency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Any copies of information taken from travelers' machines would be destroyed within days if  there were no legal reason to hold the information.  Once we all got a copy, you can destroy it.  Given all personal details that people store on their digital devices, border searches  of laptops and other gadgets can give law enforcement officials far more revealing pictures  of travelers than suitcase inspections might yield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Revealing pictures of travelers, exactly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Literally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there are more restrictions.  A supervisor has to be present during the searches.  Well, that makes me feel better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why do I as a US citizen have to submit to a random search of all, surrender my data  to Canada for up to five days, maybe 30, for no cause?  There's no probable cause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a random search.  There is probable cause.  You had left the country for five minutes and now you're trying to get back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all they need.  But that's the thing.  If you left the country for five years, that's...  Five minutes.  Oh, five minutes?  So if I jumped over the line and waved at the border crossing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You went shopping in Windsor, came back to Detroit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went up to Canada a few years ago to Victoria.  This is the year that they ran out of flu vaccine in the United States, but I wanted  to get a flu shot.  So I went to Canada to their horrible health system and I got a shot up there.  And I came back.  It can't have been that horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got the shot.  You're still alive.  Hey, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I drove back across the border and the guy starts grilling me.  What are you doing in Canada?  I got a shot, man.  Said, I got a flu shot.  He says, they have flu shots in the United States.  Actually, it is kind of a...  As a matter of fact, they don't.  It is a very suspicious reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you need to have a Canadian health card?  I got a flu shot in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, actually you don't.  You just go up there and...  I was up there working in Toronto.  You have to pay.  With a Canadian health card, everything is free.  With no health card you have to pay a fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Officers must consult agency lawyers if they want to view a traveler's sensitive legal  material, medical records, or, this is good for you, John, a journalist's work-related  information.  So you can say, hey, this is my notebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything in...  Actually, in my notebook, everything is in my notebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait, they just have to consult a lawyer.  So they have a lawyer there.  An agency lawyer.  And the lawyer says, yeah, go ahead.  Can they still take the laptop for five days while they consult the lawyer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents cannot keep property for more than 30 days,  depending on circumstance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's a step.  It's depending on circumstance.  It's a step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not much of a step.  Well, the question is, do we know anybody out there that's in a great listening audience  that has actually had anything happen to them in this regard?  Mitnick.  Mitnick did.  Remember that?  Mitnick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but he has enough red flags.  He does have a history.  He has a pretty unique history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mitnick doesn't count.  Here's the stats.  Between October 2008 and August 11th of this year, Customs and Border Protection officers  processed more than 221 million travelers at U.S. borders, only searched 1,000 laptops,  of which 46 were in-depth searches.  Is that the one where they keep them?  That's probably where they keep them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still say...  So your chances of winning the lottery are better than your laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's pretty good.  46 out of 221 million is pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is pretty low.  Yeah.  But TrueCrypt gives you that false bottom OS.  I like it.  If you really want to be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that what they call it, a false bottom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what I call it.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean the file container.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the operating system within an operating system, so you can give them a TrueCrypt login  that unencrypts the hard drive and they don't see anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's nested, encrypted.  I don't know.  No, the thing is, if you notice it and you see how much that file actually takes...  I understand how it works when I've used it, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Use steganography.  That'll solve that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't see that file in the windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So when they're going through the thing and they're looking at data...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the file size remains the same.  So if you created a small nested file, it wouldn't be an issue.  If you created a larger one, like say 50% of the actual file...  You just say that's decimal, hexadecimal differential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, there's a question here because I know about this technique.  Is the nested file a separate entity?  In other words, if you have your encrypted file as gopher.com, and that's really where  is the container for the encryption, and you have a false bottom, as you like to put it,  in other words, a fake password that makes it look like you're unencrypting something  and there's a few files in there...  It's a whole operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It can be a whole operating system.  It depends on how you use TrueCrypt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know why you'd want that, but that's another story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, because then when they see your laptop and they say, hey, this is encrypted,  give us the password, you have to, you give them a password, they open it up,  it launches an operating system, they look at the hard drive, looks like it's a full hard drive  with very few files, and you just say, yeah, I don't keep much stuff on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Roger, you and I are thinking alike on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you were suspicious of someone, you would scratch, I would scratch,  but I said, huh, that seems kind of peculiar.  If it's, you know...  They've got just normal stuff on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whoa, that's strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, but you...  I thought you were suspicious.  You're suspicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have a 250 gig hard drive and yet the OS only sees 200.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do they know you have a 250 gig hard drive unless they take apart the laptop?  Maybe the OS lies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it depends on what you're running.  If you're running a PC, you can...  Can the false bottom lie?  Because they say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm not saying that people should be using TrueCrypt anyway.  People should be using TrueCrypt anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty hard to notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because it launches up an operating system, you right-click on the hard drive,  it tells you the hard drive is this big.  Yeah, yeah, no, no, not from the operating system, though.  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do it from either the BIOS or...  And the thing is they do take...  It's not going to work.  Look, let's put it this way.  I think Roger's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's a missing piece of this puzzle.  If it's not going to work, if they really have reason to suspect you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's my point is that it's like people who fill their tank with enough space to put pot in it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and then the border guards always start tapping on the...  It's never worked for me.  I got to say.  It's because it's soaked with gasoline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really bad.  We really don't want to light that joint.  This pot stinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it burns weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dell beats forecasts, then surges.  On Thursday, Dell reported unexpectedly strong second quarter earnings.  They say that they think business is going to really pick up when Windows 7 comes out.  They hope.  Well, this is an interesting thing because then I saw another analyst say,  don't get too bummed if Windows 7 doesn't drive a lot of sales because it could just be the bad economy.  But I'm glad to see that Dell is picking up.  Net income, 472 million, 24 cents a share.  That's a decline.  Well, it's a 23%...  What?  23% decline in net income.  But that's good news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That doesn't sound good.  No, it doesn't.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, their profit probably went up because when you know these guys are slashing left and right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess when they say unexpectedly strong, they mean, well, it could have been worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, which is always like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ah, they exceeded the forecast.  That's what they did.  I love Wall Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Excluding costs associated with its continuing revamping,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the company reported earnings of 28 cents a share, substantially exceeding the forecast of 23 cents a share.  So even though revenue was down 22%, profits were down 23%.  They beat their forecast.  They beat the forecast.  So they had a great quarter.  Stock was up 7%.  This is like a Ponzi scheme.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's just the way Wall Street works, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Either making money or you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're losing money, but it's not as much as we thought they were losing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just like when companies have a positive quarter and make money and then their stock gets trashed  because they didn't make as much as everybody thought.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which happens just as often as this bullshit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I should have read this story more carefully.  Foolish me, I read the headline instead of...  Good news!  We beat the forecast.  Good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're not sucking as much as you thought we were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't suck as much.  Dell's really been going through.  And then here's the press release.  Dell improves business performance through continued execution of strategic agenda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, a couple of people in the chat room pointed out when a true crypt volume is encrypted,  you can't tell from the outside what's random data and what isn't.  There's no way to tell from the outside that there's anything hidden.  You can tell from the outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you've got three gigabytes on the outside that you can see...  It's just empty crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not saying that they'll be able to see it, but they know something's there.  No, it's just slack space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's all random data.  If you go in there and you've got three gigabytes showing on your list...  Yeah, but you can't use it. That's a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can write...  It doesn't look like empty space.  That's my point.  None of it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The filled space and the empty space both look the same.  Because it's encrypted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, when you go into it, you see one file.  When you go into it, though, it's a hidden container.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go into the initial true crypt file and say you do have the false bottom, right?  You look at it and it says it has whatever amount of space that it has in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It says it has exactly the same amount of space it says from the outside.  There's a hidden container in there that you just don't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this East meets West? Is this what East meets West is like?  No, because I don't talk about tech on YouTube.  Oh, yeah, you don't want to. Now we know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you guys talk about on East meets West?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because it's coming up in about half an hour on the YouTube network.  We have no agenda, John.  I know.  And we've been doing it since 2005.  That's a great idea.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  One last story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you see the Microsoft ad that in Poland was the black guy was cut out?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was pasted over. He wasn't cut out. He was pasted over to a white guy.  Well, his hand was still black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Toronto had that thing when they had one of those brochures for the city  and it was a Hispanic family and then they put the head of a black guy on top of the man's head.  And it was a really bad Photoshop, first of all.  So it was pretty obvious someone shopped it.  But then a lot of people say, well, it seems kind of forced.  Why don't you just take a photo of people in Toronto instead of using stock images?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is kind of like when I got highlights for children and they'd say,  find the 15 things wrong with this picture.  OK, the guy's got a white head and a black hand.  The monitor actually is not connected to anything.  And look, that generic computer he's on, that's a Mac with the Apple painted out.  This is good. This you could have a little contest in this.  So I wonder if there's some, by the way, the Asian guy was not Photoshopped out.  Just the black guy.  Is there some sensitivity thing in Poland or is it just, I mean, what's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't have any black people in Poland and they didn't want people asking,  what kind of a person is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many Asian people do they have in Poland?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You sure he's Asian? He kind of looks Polish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's an Asian Pole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just love it.  My favorite part is that there's no wires on that monitor.  It's just standing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the fact that they're all grinning.  They're all so happy.  They're like, it's a grinning grin. It's like, oh, what are they grinning about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. I have to look at the American one to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Microsoft product news that ads are dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, that's not it.  Stop the presses. Ads are dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I see why they're smiling.  They're empowered with the IT tools they need.  That's why they're so happy.  That would make anybody smile.  Sure.  Learn more.  Learn more.  She's it. Look, is that an electric razor she's holding or what is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's shaving her. She's going to shave her under arms right after this is over.  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Might be a remote.  I wonder why we haven't found out.  It actually looks like Vancouver.  I think they're in Vancouver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it does look like Vancouver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a Vancouver backed ride.  It's that blue glass.  Yeah, it's definitely Vancouver.  Yeah.  OK. Optimize your business productivity infrastructure.  Yes, indeed.  I can't even think. OK, just from this, can you tell what they're selling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Microsoft.  It's IT. It's supposed to be very up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're selling Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're selling solutions and empowerment.  I can't even tell what they're selling.  That's true with all this corporate stuff. You could never tell what it is.  I used to do corporate stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how you know it's corporate, Tom.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen.  Do you guys get into a slap fight later when you do your show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't slap, John. When it comes to fisticuffs, we form the fist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was thinking maybe you could wear later hosun and slap each other.  Is that a fantasy of yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My wife won't do it, but you guys will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's with the fish, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dane didn't tell you? Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to apologize and I hope you'll come back next week.  This is as good as it gets.  By the way, just a little shout out because in fact, I invite...  Why doesn't CNET do a team?  We're going to do laser tag.  Really?  On Labor Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll be at DragonCon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All you guys are sci-fi guys, so that's why.  We're doing it at Huniparo Sarah Park.  You can join the Twit team.  In fact, if you don't want, we have a Twit team, but apparently we're the only team.
