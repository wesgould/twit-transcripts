Transcript:  This week in tech, I'm Jason Snell sitting in for Leo Laporte.  We got a lot of Apple news this week from the Worldwide Developers Conference in San  Jose, plus a little bit about Amazon versus Walmart.  We got some bad news from Uber, what else is new, and maybe a feud between Taylor Swift  and Katy Perry.  We'll find a tech angle next on Twitter.

Transcript:  This is TWIT.  Welcome back.  I am not Leo Laporte that much as obvious.  I am your guest host, Jason Snell.  Leo is gallivanting around south of the equator.  Of course, he's always like eight moves ahead of the rest of us knowing that Apple's developer  conference would be this week.  He decided to get the guy who was the editor at Macworld for more than a decade to guest  host for him because we'll talk a little bit of Apple but we'll also talk Uber, maybe  some Amazon, a little bit of Taylor Swift if you're very good at the very end.  And who knows what else might happen.  Let me introduce my wonderful guests who are with me as I take the helm from Leo for this  week's TWIT.  Lisa Schmeiser is here.  She is the editor at the Windows Super site and a good friend from way back, one of my  former coworkers.  Hi, Lisa.  Welcome.  Hi, it's a pleasure to be here.  And another former colleague of mine in the great days at IDG, Harry McCracken, who now  at Fast Company.  Hi, Harry.  Hi, Jason.  Good to be here.  It's great to have you both in studio and remotely across the Skype interwebs.  It's Micah Sargent from iMore.  Hi, Micah.

Transcript:  OK, good.  That's a relief.  Boy, secrets coming out here on Twitter.  All right.  Again, the big news this week and I'm I would feel more guilty about like pumping up the  Apple News this week, given my background, if it were not one of the best, if not the  best week for Apple News of the entire year.  Maybe the iPhone week's a little bit better, but it's close.  Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference was in San Jose, California this week.  Started off with a keynote on Monday, continued throughout the week.  Lots of other side events going on.  It was a two, almost two and a half hour, two hour, 20 minute long keynote that was  packed full.  I have it on good authority that the first draft of the keynote was well over three hours  and they actually cut a lot of stuff out, announced some stuff in advance.  There's still a huge amount of stuff that they dealt with this week and we're going  to talk about a little bit.  Most interesting, perhaps, a brand new product.  There are a couple of products that aren't even going to ship until December, but Apple  pre-announced them, which they very rarely do with products unless they have a product  in a brand new category like the HomePod, which is Apple's answer packed with Siri  power apparently, although we didn't hear it.  It's Apple's answer to the Amazon Echo and also the Google Home and that Cortana speaker  that Microsoft is doing with Harman Kardon and you know, smart speakers, right?  This is the Apple smart speaker.  I heard it.  I got to say that, yeah, it sounded pretty good, but you couldn't touch it and you couldn't  talk to it.  Those were not allowed.  I can only say that I heard it and it sounded pretty good.  Do not touch the HomePod.  Harry, did you?

Transcript:  I would say that Apple has now entered this fray, but they haven't.  They've said their intention to enter the fray in six months.  Micah, what's your take on the HomePod compared to, I know you follow this home automation  stuff closely.  I know you have opinions about this.  Let's start with you.  What's your take on Apple's take on the connected speaker category?

Start time: 333.46
End time: 408.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I certainly do have some thoughts.  I think that the problem is my whole opinion and feels are based on the rumors that took  place and so because of that, I ended up being pretty disappointed by the HomePod that came  out because I was expecting this really cool in-home home assistant that was kind of going  to take on Amazon's Echo and Google's home device.  And instead, what we got was a Sonos like product that seems to be competing in the  premium audio space.  And yeah, it seems like it's going to do just that.  It's going to work with AirPlay and that's great.  And it's got acoustic fibers all over the outside that look like, you know, Spider-Man  had a moment, but I'm just I'm not impressed is what it ultimately boils down to.  And maybe that's the fault of, you know, the different sites out there that were telling  me that this was going to be Apple's Amazon Echo.  But it just is a speaker that happens to have Siri and really what they cared about and  what they were talking about was the seven Twitter array system and the custom designed  subwoofer, which was not the stuff that I was interested in.

Start time: 409.26
End time: 419.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Were you disappointed because you were kind of hoping that there would be a more sort  of low cost, lower quality thing like the Echo rather than having to make basically  a Sonos with with Siri in it?

Start time: 420.24
End time: 517.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. And I don't even know if lower quality is the right.  I mean, it would have had to be because it would have been lower cost, of course.  But I wanted to see them focus more on a device that could be this this smart assistant that  offers up some kind of the stuff that Google and Amazon are looking into now, which is  a smart assistant that is aware of what's going on and also aware of what you want to  do in a home. And so it'll light up and say, are the lights are basically giving a hint  that there's something that it wants to tell you.  You ask it what's up and it's like, hey, did you know that the traffic is really bad right  now? So you should probably leave in the next five minutes or notifications that pop up  and can let you know about calendar appointments or flight cancellations or things like that.  And that's not at all what it is.  And the same thing applies to being proactive in the home where it always knows that at  like eight p.m. I end up shutting off the lights in a certain room and I walk into the  kitchen and want to have a cup of coffee or something like that.  If it starts to learn that kind of thing and get better at being an active automator for  my home, those were the things that I was hoping Apple is going to focus on.  But instead, they were focused on check out this really expensive speaker that's going  to sound so good and you only have to buy two of them and then it's going to fill your  entire house with sound. I don't really need or want that.  And, you know, I'm sure there's somebody out there that does, but it seems like, you know,  the Echo and the Google Home are pretty popular and Google's Chromecast system are pretty  popular and they seem to be focused more on the proactive type of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Harry, what does it say about the fact that Apple put Siri kind of in the background in  this product? It's there and they talked about it on a couple of slides, but they didn't  demo it with Siri. We never saw that. They didn't talk about assistant features.  It really is sort of, at least in the marketing, a secondary feature of this product.

Start time: 536.48
End time: 590.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they were very careful about their messaging. I think that most likely reflects  the fact that Amazon has a huge head start making Echo well-tuned for this use case scenario  and Google with the Google Assistant on Google Home also has a head start.  And Apple needs more time to do that. And my guess is that they didn't not talk about that  because they're not going to do it. They just didn't talk about that because you would be  immediately comparing what Siri can do right now to what Echo can do with HotSky and what  Google Assistant can do. And they just need a little bit more time to put that together.  And by not telling you to compare them right now, you think about it in competition to Sonos,  which is a much less intimidating competitor for a company like Apple. Even if it was only a Sonos  like device, the fact that it's from Apple and supports Siri would be intriguing to a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  people. And we should say, because I don't think I mentioned it up top, it's $349, which just to  pat myself on the back, before the event, I thought what would it cost? And my thought was $299.  Then I added $50 and predicted it would be $349. And I got it right. So this is the thing. Add to  the price if you're predicting an Apple price. Lisa, do you have a take on the HomePod?

Start time: 611.06
End time: 710.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's Apple tipping its hand that it's beginning to reposition itself away from  computers as a market and more as a luxury consumer device maker or a luxury consumer  goods maker in general. To me, it spoke volumes during the keynote that we had a lot of attention  paid to the watch. We had a lot of attention paid to the phone. We didn't have a whole lot paid to  the experience of computing using Apple as a platform. And with the HomePod, it seems like  what they're saying is we will build very nice, almost single-use appliances for you. And we've  decided to go after audiophiles because audiophiles are willing to spend money on hardware.  I think what they probably suspect is that people who have this will also have an Amazon Echo  because Echo's already got a head start in the market. More critically,  Echo streams a lot more musical services than this will. And you really can't discount the  loyalty that people are going to have to Spotify or to Pandora or iHeartRadio or what have you.  I was talking to some friends this week about streaming music services, and they have  really talked themselves into, oh, it's totally worth paying $10 a month even if I already own  the CDs because I like that I can load this onto my phone and play it at the gym. I like that I can  play this in the car, so on and so forth. So I think putting this in the same product category  as the Google Home and the Amazon Echo may not be the right thing. I think Apple is trying to stake  out a slightly different consumer take. And so this way, if things do not work out with Siri  or they do not nail down their home automation strategy, they can go, no, it's always audio

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  all the time. I think it is interesting that this is an Apple Music product through and through,  which is not too surprising, but at a first cut for the first generation of a product,  when who knows how many they're going to be able to make, there is an argument to be made,  just like the first iPod had Firewire on it and it only worked on the Mac, that if it goes really  well, perhaps they have the option to open it up. But for now, it is for people who want a  nice sounding connected speaker that works with Apple Music. That said, I did just buy the  Amazon Music Unlimited 4-My-1 Echo. I just bought that because I was playing so much music on it  that even though I do not subscribe to their service, I threw them some money because I  wanted the convenience of it. That would be the alternative, is you really want this and maybe  you switched to Apple Music to do it. I do not know how likely that is.

Start time: 756.90
End time: 792.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing that concerns me slightly is that Apple, one of their historic strengths  has been that they managed to define user expectations and user experiences for product  categories because they helped adopt digital music by making it virtually frictionless to download  and buy. They jump-started smartphones, you could argue they have become the leading vendor for  smartwatches. They basically set the standard for how experiences go. I wonder if they are trying  to do that again here or if they have badly misread how people already have integrated  experiences like streaming music and smart home assistance into daily life.

Start time: 793.06
End time: 810.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that the fact that they chose the name HomePod might be meaningful because  it can mean music if you want it to mean music. It can also mean almost anything else. If this  product is around for the long haul, they are not going to be defined by a name like Apple Hi-Fi  or something like that.

Transcript:  Jason, you said that you got the Amazon Music Unlimited service. Did you get the one specific  to Echo that costs less because it is just for Echo or did you go all in?

Start time: 820.66
End time: 838.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I got the one just for my little lady in a canister who sits on my kitchen counter  because that is the only place I really… That was where my wife and my kids were  shouting, play this song and being told here is a 30 second sample which is the worst thing in the  world. So a fine, okay, $4 a month or whatever it is. That is what I am doing.

Start time: 839.62
End time: 956.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that is… Lisa, you touched on the fact that people are kind of… They pick  it up music service and they kind of stick to it. And Sonos offers Apple Music as one of its  streaming services. Of course, the Amazon Echo does not inherently have that, but it is interesting  that Apple is only going to be offering this as well as AirPlay 2 which you can use to stream  whatever happens to be streaming on your iOS device. But I got to thinking about the fact that  I do not only have people who have iOS devices coming to my home and maybe they have a podcast  that they want me to listen to or something that is not available on Apple Music and they want to  be able to stream that in the home. They cannot use AirPlay 2 and so suddenly, we have got this…  I have this $350 speaker that will work for them and I am trying to figure out some way. Here,  send it over to me or load it up on my computer and then I will play it over AirPlay 2. That is  frustrating. I have an article that I put together that kind of compares the AirPod and Sonos and  then one that also compares the AirPod to the Google Home and the Amazon Echo device. And it  is really interesting whenever you look at the different streaming services that they offer  because Sonos has a bajillion D and both the Amazon Echo and Google Home have a bajillion D  as well. And then Amazon Echo right now lets you stream over Bluetooth which is incredibly open.  Google Home is offering that very soon so there is going to be Bluetooth there as well. So,  it is a little frustrating that the HomePod, even if we are just going to look at this strictly as  this wonderful music streaming device, it is only going to let you do it over Apple Music itself or  over AirPlay 2. And if you do not have the proper devices for that, then I do not know, we shrug or  say go talk to the Echo that I also do have in my living room as Lisa said.

Transcript:  To be fair, I think what Amazon and Google are trying to do is target everybody with the product  and Apple very clearly is not. And I think that is within their rights as a company that makes  products to say this is our product for people in our ecosystem who use Apple Music. We have  complete control over every aspect of it and if you want to play Apple Music in your house,  we have got it. Or if you want to do streaming music in your house, we have a complete solution,  our service, our hardware. The challenge is like is this all Apple is interested in doing? I can  hear my inner Andy and Natko speaking now which is is that all Apple really wants is to capture  the people who are completely inside their ecosystem or do they want to compete with the  other products in this category and have it be a level playing field where other services can be  on there? It seems like for now that answer is no, that this is about people who really are deep  down in the ecosystem and I am sure this will be a great product for those people.

End time: 1040.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would love to see the research that breaks out spending potential by people who are as you put  it deep in the ecosystem compared to a broader wider audience because if somebody at Apple has  run the numbers and said it is going to be way too much work for us to make the licensing agreements  and put together seamless technology that does what say Michael wants to do where your friend  comes over and says I want you to listen to this podcast. If you are like no, it is not worth it.  We can make more money with less effort just with this narrow audience segment. I would love to see

Start time: 1040.16
End time: 1070.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if there are numbers that back that up. I will remind you too this product is Siri driven.  I wonder how much of this is strategy of no it is only Apple music or how much of the strategy is  we cannot do anything else because Siri on your iPhone cannot control Spotify either. Nor did in  iOS 11 Apple make any announcements that they might add that to the Siri kit functionality that  they introduced last year. They would have to do a whole lot of new functionality that does not  currently exist on any of their platforms to let other services in the door. You have touched on a

Start time: 1070.96
End time: 1116.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  really fundamental irritation with digital assistance is that right now they are also  fairly strongly siloed. For example, on my phone I prefer to use the Gmail app over the mail app.  I like how I can sort and prioritize my mail. Just as an experiment today as I was driving,  I said hey Siri look up an email from Tanya Hall so I can find the address to this place.  I cannot go into Gmail. Would you like to download your mail app so I can go into that?  I thought what is the point of having an assistant if I cannot have it go through all of my digital  assets because as a user I do not really care about brand loyalty. What I care about is the  aggregation of data that I consider to be attached to me and what I want to do. I want to be able to  access and manipulate that data independent of platform app or device. I do not care about the

Start time: 1116.46
End time: 1168.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  siloing. It is always dangerous to predict what Apple is going to do with something.  That said, I do not see why they would not want to do essentially what a lot of their other devices  do which is to cater both to people who are completely in the ecosystem but also to people  who like to live outside a little bit. Looking back at the iPhone, that was a closed platform  for the first year and a year later they realized they could keep everything they had from being a  closed platform or almost everything plus make it far more powerful by reaching out to people.  I also feel like it is pretty clear that these smart speakers are at least potentially  you know a vastly larger market than they are even right now and Apple cannot compete if it  has something that only aspires to be a really nice device for listening to its own music service.

Start time: 1168.70
End time: 1187.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Is the HomePod a device that is intended to induce people to subscribe to Apple Music  or is it a product that they want to sell and ultimately they want to sell it to  people who use Spotify or Amazon Music or even the Google streaming music service as long as  they can sell HomePods maybe in the end. I would imagine that that is ultimately what

Start time: 1187.78
End time: 1306.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  their vision is going to be. I would really hope because it would be disappointing if this is  genuinely just supposed to be a way to listen to music. One of the things too like a lot of  enabled devices and I am sorry I have just triggered everyone's echoes but those enabled  devices can now hook up with your iCloud account to add calendar events and to I think what is it  calendar and reminders or something like that. I know calendar for sure and so Amazon really is  paying attention to this and trying to be the every person's smart speaker and every person's  smart assistant and I appreciate that and they've opened up on device so that you can use that  whether you're running iOS or Android and I think that they are really what I want to see Apple do  because I do enjoy the hardware that Apple puts out and I would be happy to have a Spider-Man  web-covered device that sounds really good but also can do all the things that I know Amazon's  voice assistant can do and that's where I guess I end up being a little bit disappointed in this  version one but as people across the interwebs have reminded me this is just a version one and  it's not even supposed to be out until December and we could see some more stuff come to it  but yeah when you look at the smart assistant marketplace or the ecosystem at least the  Siri still is pretty closed off and yes Siri is in a bunch of different languages and that is  awesome and I'm glad that you know Siri can be spoke to in those different languages but  also selfishly I wanted to have a little bit more built in that allows me to connect to different  types of of apps and things like that that I use. Yeah I guess it is true this is a product that

Transcript:  emotional roller coaster because during the keynote they did their ios 11 segment and barely  mentioned the ipad and I was really worried and then they announced the new ipads and then all of  a sudden they came back and did a sizable chunk on the ipad specific features which included a  a reasonably high percentage of the things I want not all of them I still want to be able to select  like a different web browser as my default browser for instance but it does look like they've pulled  off making it a lot more powerful without just cloning how stuff is done on a pc and it still  feels like the ipad but it should be a lot easier easier to juggle apps it looks like there it should  be easier to work with files I feel like a fairly high percentage of the stuff this new files app  will do I'm already doing with third-party apps but it's probably going to be better if it's

Transcript:  because I knew our friend Federico Vettici who is absolutely an ipad mastermind was in the audience  waiting and I was like oh no Federico's going to be so sad but we didn't end up getting sad because  they announced so many cool things and I've been dragging and dropping and dragging again across  the whole thing and it's been really fun one of the things that I've seen early on is the  people who have access to the software the beta have kind of been complaining that the discoverability  is a little not there and there are some things that you know they're not able to understand right  off the top so I think it's going to take some learning but I am absolutely down for a learning  curve if it means that I get all of these cool new features on the ipad and then also a few little  drag and drop features on iphone as well though we'll see how many of those stick around in future

Transcript:  betas right occasionally apple has this reputation of sticking some sweet ipad feature in for the  iphone in the beta and then taking it out and all the iphone users going oh man that was a good one  yeah I had the same same reaction I was a little nervous but then I got really excited I do wonder  about the discoverability and I should say the public beta will be out later this month there's  a developer beta out now it did kill my ipad my 9.7 inch ipad when I installed it on there  and I had to reinstall it so this is not if you're not a developer don't install it yet there will  be a public beta later this month and then a final version in the fall but the discoverability thing  I think this is one of the arguments is how advanced can you make ios without risking ruining  it for people who don't want the advanced features and it at first glance just using it for about  half an hour I felt pretty good that apple was doing a pretty good job of like if you don't know  the secrets you just won't ever see them but if you know the secrets and you flip flick up a little  bit further and start dragging things out of the dock then kind of the universe unfolds before you  but that's the trick is you don't want I was imagining somebody who's a novice user getting  like into split screen drag mode and being like what is happening help right and that's that's

Transcript:  I don't want to do that that is that is always the risk what what do you all think about the  argument that by making a doc like the mac doc and adding in drag and drop and adding in something  that looks an awful lot like mission control that this is uh macifying the ipad and it's sort of  counter to the ios aesthetic or philosophy or something because I have heard those arguments  can you hear me that's an eye roll I'm doing verbally right there but I'm curious I don't  understand why that's a bad thing well I mean the danger is that it's it's it's complex or that apple  is sort of punting and going back to the way they did it on the mac although it doesn't feel to me  particularly mac-like except in the fact that it's capable this is not really a problem I've seen on

Transcript:  and pure because it's on a tablet I mean I think of myself as being a fairly hardcore the ipad  should not be a traditional computer kind of person that said I think it looks like they've  done a really smart job of bringing in features that make sense and tweaking them where appropriate  it's you know before the event people were talking about whether there might be a keyboard with a  trackpad I personally hate that idea it needs to be one of the few people who is perfectly happy  lifting up my arm and touching stuff and that's an example of of a place where I think it makes  sense to be fairly absolutist about not trying to turn the ipad into a mac but there need to be  better ways to move information between ipad apps so drag and drop makes perfect sense there are  cases where it's really cumbersome not to be able to sort of get at files in a way that's a little  bit closer to what you do on it on a windows pc or mac so that makes sense yeah the heaviest ipad

Transcript:  consumers in the short term yeah i mean what part of the plague one of the reasons this is smart for  amazon is if they've already got saturation at the high end um you can actually make a lot of money  off of lower income retail tiers if you provide a service at a reasonable price point that they keep  coming back to over and over again i mean this has been true in banking for years where check  cashing corporations make tremendous amounts of money from the unbanked um the profit margins are  insane there and so with walmart they've got that walmart with amazon they've got the same potential  where they can grow that audience walmart is in a slightly more vulnerable position because  their core audience has traditionally had less discretionary spending power  and so their sales are more closely tied to recessions economic ups and downs and their  inability to penetrate tiers with higher percentages of discretionary income might  actually hurt them in a way that it won't hurt amazon since amazon's got that that that

Transcript:  i think with uh with amazon to you know lisa you kind of touched on this the fact that uh  customers kind of keep coming back and and uh getting the same thing and amazon is really good  at that i mean i have a bunch of amazon dash buttons in my home for uh purchasing in bulk  different products like paper towels napkins and uh certain non-perishable food items and i love  the fact that i hit that button and i can count on in two days most of the time unless it's like  the weekend in which case it's three days that will be at my doorstep waiting for me and i can  you know replace the the product that's been used and if amazon can do this uh with you know people  who they're they're kids like the same cereal every month and you know you just need your bread and  you need your uh uh macaroni and cheese or what have you and amazon will always have it it'll  always be there it'll always be at a cost that you can kind of count on that's a huge deal  growing up when i moved when my family and i moved from california to the midwest  there was a period of time where my mom was on government assistance and used ebt cards and i  can remember we would basically have the same items every time every time it was time for mom  to go out and get groceries for all of us kids it was the same stuff and that's because you could  mostly count on a price and you could count on all of us not being picky about it because of the  stuff that we liked and amazon like i said is already very good about kind of keeping those  items in stock and making sure that hey if i hit this button it's going to be there so this uh you  know looking specifically at the kind of human side of things as opposed to the company side of  things i'm really excited about this uh it was certainly helpful for my mom and all of us kids  having that government assistance and so for amazon to accept that and open up amazon prime so  that you know a mom can say i can trust that in two days there's going to be the stuff that i need  to make my kids lunches that they take to school that's awesome so this is this is really cool  even if you know was alligator amazon and the the scary snake that is walmart are fighting  we'll let them do that i think this is great for consumers well you mentioned that it's diapers

Transcript:  in the car michael i think it's smart yeah i think it's i think it's a really smart thing and you know  there were some companies who were kind of working on bringing these features to phones but it was  always like i don't know cellular carriers and insurance companies and there's just something to  say about how entirely uncool it is to be like yeah i downloaded the at&t app so it could lock  all my devices and no one can text me while i'm driving but the fact that apple has this built  in and that you know you can enable this feature and it just says hey whenever we can sense that  you're driving in a vehicle then we're going to uh make things you know so you won't see things  because i think part of the problem i think people would be more apt to you know stay away  from texting and driving or snapchatting and driving or what have you if they don't right if  they don't see those things in the first place because ultimately a lot of us uh we we we just  end up in the end having uh what is it prehistoric brains and it's like we see something light up and  you know our our eyes instantly turn to it and look at it and it's just kind of the way we're wired  um or at least have wired ourselves over time and if those notifications just aren't there in the  first place then it's less likely that you're going to pay attention to them which i realize  sounds really obvious but at the same time i do think there's something to kind of keeping that  out of your line of vision and then your brain does a better job of resisting needing to get  that little dopamine hit from seeing you know the latest instagram like on your selfie so this just  seems like a good idea overall and i hope that people do take advantage of it and the fact that  you can kind of set it up to say hey you know this person's driving right now but you can contact

Transcript:  them later is really nice one thing i wasn't clear about from the demo is whether this also  shuts them off on an apple watch because oh man i am i'm pretty good at not looking at my phone  but i do sort of sometimes glance at my wrist without totally taking my eye off the road which  i thought of as sort of being maybe semi-safe halfway point yeah i have that same little

Transcript:  bargaining behavior which is well you know it's not looking at a phone it's just glancing at my  watch people wear watches that don't have texts on them and they check their watches when they're  driving and nobody dies probably except one of the things that struck me about this is  is this is a feature that will i mean almost certainly save lives right just by interceding  and saying most of these notifications are junk which i'd like some of these features all the time  honestly on my iphone and just in just getting them out of the way and and being contextual  and maybe letting through if somebody on your contacts list calls or texts because it's super  important but otherwise just like quieting down while you're driving seems like such a good

Transcript:  word is context because i really want i want to live in a computing world where i have context  dependent notifications because if i'm driving and some and if while i'm driving my husband  texts me and says while you're out and about please pick up groceries that is a notification  i don't mind getting while i'm driving especially if i can get it read to me instead of reading it  myself yeah but if it's somebody else going hey can you pass on the name of so and so that you  recommend it for such and such no i don't need that one um but i would love to see more context  dependent notifications i think this is a good start um i hope that context dependent gets  split out from the safety aspect so that we start working on that more i think the safety aspect is  super important um i think context dependent will ultimately be better for computing in the long run

Transcript:  yeah the um in the chat room they're talking about uh nanny features and this is the thing this can  be a nanny feature if you're weak-willed and you and you know you're going to check your phone if  you don't see it i think the upside of this is not when it's a nanny feature but when it is that  smart assistant saying i'm only going to buzz you when you're driving if there's really something  important otherwise i'm going to lay off and that's that's how it should be that's that's not um  that's not preventing me a weak person from checking my phone while i'm driving that's  preventing me a regular driver from being distracted by pointless things and and there's

Transcript:  that is where we're headed honestly because some of the stuff that i've already seen and um  you know some of the stuff that we'll see what the public beta hits but uh let's just say i happen  to have come across some of this stuff while i'm totally not using the ndade uh beta software anyway  siri is paying more attention than siri used to and even in conversations because we did see this  on stage so i could talk about that of course the the keyboard and the the predictive text it was  almost scary because i was talking to someone on twitter about a particular subject and then when i  went to an iMessage conversation with that same person and i used the word twitter then the  predictive text popped up the subject that i had just discussed on twitter in this iMessage  conversation so if siri's already getting smart enough to kind of understand to whom i'm speaking  and about what i'm speaking i can see how this would easily be applied to notifications and to  adding calendar events and making sure that i have the contacts that i need and maybe even you know  sending out a message and it's like wait you're sending out a message about this but don't you  also want to include this person of course i do siri so i i think it's already starting to do that  and ios 11 right now is the entry into that and figuring out you know with the data that it gets  on device how it can use that and then hopefully we'll see that kind of break out even more and  see it applied to other features across ios i'd like to see more information clustered according

Transcript:  any of those balance card companies that offer uh you know you can go in and buy one next to the  gift cards yeah so it works the same way it's a balance card which is a particular type of payment  card and yeah apple has that money and it's i think what is it called apple pay cash card or  something like that and you can transfer it out and it's not clear how many days it'll take to  transfer out or in um i assume they're going to push more for the cash style which cash is uh what  is it paypal um anyway the cash app which does quick transfers back and forth between your bank  and not the one like some of the others that take you know a whole week to get it to transfer in and  out so i i'm looking forward to it because where i have seen very slow adoption for other apps and  it seems like anytime i ever have to tell someone um you know you use your mom as an example again  i'll use my partner as an example where i'm like hey can you download this app so i can send you  money they don't want to do that but if it's already built in and it's already on device then  that makes it so much easier and more likely that they're going to do it there are also less things  that get in the way um where like my sister when i tried to send her money with vinmo uh her credit  union denied the use of vinmo completely and it's just some silly things that you know do end up  being the super amounts of friction that i am looking forward to apple pay kind of kicking to  the curb and saying no it's okay we've we've got this taken care of and i do think that it's uh  yeah it's interesting that apple's kind of pushing more toward becoming a bank but it also means  more regulations and things like that for them so i i'm i'm happy that they've chosen to wade into  those waters because it means that i can receive and send money a lot easier with most of the people  that i would already be kind of exchanging money with the uh other big feature that is not an end

Transcript:  user feature but will lead to lots of apps that people will go nuts for is ar kit which is apple's  weighing into augmented reality uh the general perception was because apple doesn't talk about  what it's doing that it wasn't really doing anything in terms of vr or ar and they had stories  for both on stage i think ar kit was the more interesting because what they did was create  tools for developers to build augmented reality products the in other words the app store will be  full of augmented reality games and things and utilities perhaps come the release of ios 11 and  i talked to some people who are in the know about augmented reality and virtual sets and all sorts  of other things who said that they were really blown away by the fact that apple was essentially  doing all of this heavy lifting for them so that all they have to do is build the apps because the  ar kit stuff works in and i you know i it's again it's not very exciting because it's a developer  announcement at a developer conference mind you but i just get this feeling that this is because  apple's got so many third-party developers in the app store now and that they've just handed this  toolkit to them that it's going to end up being way more impressive than if apple just built a  few ar things into the operating system right that into their into the camera app or something

Transcript:  like that my colleague mark Sullivan wrote about the fact that this may presage the next iphones  it's not unreasonable to think that if apple starts building ar functionality into the  operating system it might want to give cameras to an iphone to let it do even better stuff than  you can do today with the one camera on the iphone 7 and the two cameras on the iphone 7 plus

Transcript:  pretty big step i think that's a big thing go ahead lisa no no no i was just gonna say i think  that's the big thing right there is how much of the stuff apple's doing i am in no way a developer  but i have been playing with ar kit um and making little apps and models of stuff just to see what i  could do and like i said i'm not a developer i i was basically just drag and drop to make this  stuff happen and i had my dogs like running under chairs that were only visible in my ar kit scene  and uh you know sitting down lamps and stuff like that and taking photos of them like running around  them and interacting with them and that is it's incredible i mean it's genuinely incredible and  to think of what uh some different companies might create with this and i was talking with a friend  of the internet joe steel about some of this stuff as well and and joe does does visual stuff  in in movies and television shows and uh talking about the possibilities there for doing uh  interesting graphics with even like pre-made video so you know you might already have a video made  but could ar kit potentially like ingest a video that's already been made and then use that and  figure out control points i mean there's just a lot of possibility here and yeah apple's taking  a lot of the the load off of developers to create that stuff so that someone who knows nothing about  it can put a chair in their living room in no time at all and you know laugh about the fact that my  dogs are like running through it it's just really interesting and i'm looking forward to more pop-up  books and i don't know lego scenes and all the other stuff that they were showing what i'm really  hoping for is that pocket minecraft gets an ar kit uh extension and then i can like play minecraft

Transcript:  absolutely gorgeous and i was drooling looking at it whenever it first kind of showed up i think  this is really exciting i've always liked the iMac design and so knowing the story that you just told  now about how this was going to be the replacement i would have been happy unfortunately a lot of the  people that i i would imagine both you and i follow on twitter would be very displeased with  the fact that an apple would be doomed because they weren't releasing a mac pro so now they are  and so maybe they're not doomed but probably still are doomed and this iMac pro is just it's  really really neat it's out of my price range probably but it is certainly a device that  i would enjoy owning just because i mean i do do a lot of video production work and photo  manipulation and stuff like that and it would be really nice to have and a desktop computer that  can do all of that stuff and more the i think what ended up being more of a highlight for everybody  who i was paying attention to was the fact that you've also got the space gray magic keyboard and  magic trackpad and that that was interesting apple certainly sees this as kind of like its own little  package of awesomeness and i loved the point when they were like we didn't just stop at this many  cores we also offer this many cores and not just that but even this many cores so you know there's  a market out there a very small market but yeah i think apple's going to be fine with that this  is a device made for the particular person that wants it and they will buy it and they will probably  be happy with it and that's great i would love to see the space gray come to more iMacs but  until that happens i will just have to stare longingly at this new iMac pro this is that you

Transcript:  if you're going to spend five thousand dollars on an iMac you get the special color i think that's  definitely the case just to be clear there will be a new mac pro as well apple said that a few weeks  ago this is not that there will also be one of those and that'll be interesting to see how do  you differentiate this iMac pro from the mac pro presumably because it won't have a screen and  hopefully will be more configurable and space gray squared that's right and other things that that in  a standalone computer you can get that you can't get in an all-in-one that's attached to a big  screen and that'll be i actually think that could be really great to see apple being freed from a  lot of these needs that they have in so many other computers to just make something that is utterly  devoted to people who want to have a box they can open up and plug something new in and hopefully  that's what we'll get and not just a an iMac pro with the screen taken off of it but it's it's uh  harry you you alluded to the other macs that were announced this is all part of the same story that's  been happening since late last year where especially the professional core of apple's mac user base was  complaining that the systems weren't being updated often enough the mac pro had gone a couple of  years without an update and they were questioning apple's commitment and basically the other mac  releases that happened were notable only in the sense that they happened and that apple was sending  a message that they were going to do these updates they updated those macbook pros that they announced  nine months ago they shipped nine months ago and that in itself is not that exciting but there had  been a long time when apple had let these systems go for more than a year without doing a processor  update even though we knew those intel processors were out there and so i in some ways yes those  things got speed bumps but also it was apple sending a message that we are going to update

Transcript:  have been subsidizing all of our inexpensive rides on uber for a long time so we thank them  uh so they have some problems that might might be basic to what they do but they also have all these  problems they created some of which date back a long time they're coming back to haunt them poor  travis callenak's parents were in this horrible voting accident and his mother died and his father  was badly injured if he does take a leave of absence maybe that's a factor there yeah um  it's always dangerous to say that a company is in such deep trouble that it's not solvable  but you do have to wonder how they get out of this um they do have the same voting structure  um but a lot of other companies like google and facebook have used very successfully where  it's very hard to get them to do anything that a handful of people including the ceo don't want to  do uh so i think some of this comes down to travis callenak agreeing to radical change if it happens  and i don't think it's in the cards that he would just be forced out most likely um they also hired

Transcript:  this strikes me as a sign of a company that does realize that they need to really change their  culture and brand and impression the question is like the glass cliff will they be able to do it

Start time: 5139.44
End time: 5203.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's have you heard of the glass cliff because it's a thing that gets reported on in business  media where typically if a company is in a boatload of trouble that's when you hire the  women executives because no seriously and they call it the glass cliff and it's the unwinnable  and gm and xerox and the idea is this way in hb even an hb and this way if they turn it around  hooray it's great and if not then it can you know oh you can blame it on their management style or  you can blame it on their inexperience or what have you but the glass cliff is a fairly well  known um way of of trying to change corporate culture and make changes that so so it's a this  company is no longer a horror show to women because we have five of them now and then if the  company fails anyway oh gosh those women sure didn't know what they were doing so oh my lord  yeah no that's really frustrating and no anytime they start announcing high profile women executives  that's when you start looking at the balance sheet and the fundamentals and you ask when are  the layoffs coming what business units are going to get set down how when do you set the death

Transcript:  bad weeks bad months bad years um yeah and even even before all of the the the latest stuff even  before all this stuff kind of hit um i was at ces and was taking uber at the time um so this was not  last ces but the one before that and i remember talking to one of the drivers because it seems  like it's something that you always do how long have you been driving when you have no idea what  to talk about and ended up getting into a conversation because they're both lift and uber  and talking about the differences between both of them and so i ended up asking the question  which one do you like more they said lift and i asked you know why what's what is it about lift  and uber that makes the lift different they talked about you know they felt more like they were  treated as a person at lift among some other things so for the rest of that weekend i made  sure to ask every single uber slash lift driver that i rode with that same question and it was  the same answer every single time that they preferred lift and it was that lift made them  feel more like they were a real person so it i mean uber it seems like has had an issue in in all of  these ways for for quite a while even before all this kind of stuff hit the fan and before we were  you know we knew about it and it's interesting that you know of course these companies rely  on their drivers who they don't consider actual workers for them but just contractors  and also the people who decide to ride for them and both of those things can change just like that  if other options provide better options if other options provide better opportunities for the  drivers and for the riders then uber is nothing and so i i mean i i keep asking what what  bosama st john is obviously incredible and i think she's fantastic but what at this point  can anybody in that position or any position in the company do to make all of this stuff  suddenly acceptable because i don't think that'll ever be acceptable so it's just it's interesting  i don't know what their next steps are but certainly not the emails getting out there
