Transcript:  This is Twit, This Week in Tech, for Sunday, June 5th, 2005.  Episode number eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The BBC would like to announce that the next scene is not considered suitable for family viewing.  And it looks as though we're in for a splendid afternoon sport on this, the 127th upper class Twit of the Year show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And now for something completely different. We are all Twits now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What a great Twit!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alright, here we are once again. It seems like we just did this. God!  By the way, I want to apologize to everybody who's trying to get the Twit cast.  You're all trying to get it at once. That's really the fundamental problem.  And you know, you'll get it eventually.  It's just trying to get it all on the same day.  You know it's going to be a real traffic jam because people are still getting number seven.  And now number eight is going to come out and it's just going to be, forget it, forget it.  What do we do?  Kevin, we need more bandwidth!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got it really fast actually. I was using BitTorrent and it came down to just a couple minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the best way to get it is BitTorrent. But apparently people don't, I don't know,  maybe they don't understand how to use BitTorrent or something.  Just real simply, get Azurias. A-Z-U-R-E-U-S. It's free, it's job-advanced.  People are afraid of the lawsuits.  Nah, don't be afraid. You can't be sued for BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know that and you know that. But I think a lot of people, I've run into three people in the last two weeks  who'll be like, I'm not going to use BitTorrent because I'm going to get Serial Dams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The critical thing is to leave it, once you're done downloading it, is to simply leave it running  so that people can continue to upload or use your upload.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our listeners, the ones who use BitTorrent, really know that there's about 1300 seeds right now for episode 7.  So the good news is with all those seeds, it does, it comes down really quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's remind everyone, as long as you're not downloading copyrighted material, you won't get in trouble using BitTorrent.  And even if you are downloading copyrighted material, you'll probably never get caught.  It's when you're hosting or directing the copyrighted material that you might get sued by a larger organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an amazing tool. Like those day of patches that come out for games.  It's amazing.  Yeah, it's amazing.  And some games that you download out of Azure are mods for games running to the hundreds of megabytes.  It's simply the easiest way to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got somebody emailing me the other day saying that they couldn't download an episode of System  because their parents wouldn't allow BitTorrent to be installed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, actually, I can understand that because I've cleaned up some systems where kids haven't stopped downloading stuff  and they've been trashed.  I mean, just nasty, nasty stuff.  Well, I've seen adults do that.  Everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Certainly not unlimited to children.  I've seen fewer children do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kids are smarter than that.  The key on this is use it.  It's safe.  You're only downloading legal stuff when you're downloading the Twitch cast.  There are some businesses, soldiers in Iraq.  And we have, by the way, guys, I don't know if you know it, we have a number of listeners who are on active duty in Iraq.  They can't get MP3 files.  That's blocked by the military.  And they, BitTorrent's ports are blocked because it does use non-standard ports.  So for them, I offer a straight download zipped file.  And that way it's just a plain old download of a zip.  And they can get that.  That's at leoville-downloads.com slash twit.  But I prefer you use, that comes off my server.  I prefer you use BitTorrent if you can.  Are we all in agreement?  Asurius is the best.  I mean, I just think it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you could, there's an RSS plugin for it.  So you could make it work just like a podcast client.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or, you know, automatically.  That is really handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's azureus.sourceforge.net.  It's a free download.  Install it.  I don't know.  Somebody said out there having trouble with the RSS feed.  I don't know.  But all you have to do is you have to go to the Twitch site.  twit.tv slash, this is the BitTorrent site, hi-b.  That's for high quality BitTorrent version.  So that's again, twit.tv slash hi-b.  Of course you all have it now.  So I don't know who I'm telling this to.  And then if you have Asurius, download the .torrent file.  Just right click on it and save it.  And then double click it.  It'll be a blue frog.  That's the default icon.  Download it and double click it.  Asurius will launch.  And you'll get it in like three minutes.  You'll get it really quickly and then leave it open so that other people can get it.  They're right now as I'm looking at this, 1,557 seeds of the seventh episode, the last episode.  And 322 people are downloading it.  And I guarantee you because there's so many seeds, they're all getting it as fast as their bandwidth can handle it.  It's just the easiest way to get it.  So that's enough of that.  And as I've said a few times, it's just taking some time, but we do have a couple.  We now have two big players, two really big media companies that want to distribute twit.  And we're going to let them do it because it's not exclusive.  They're not going to use advertising or anything.  So this will all be moot soon.  There'll be plenty of ways to get twit.  We know you want to get it.  Back now to the news, boys and girls.  Oh, let me introduce you all.  First of all, Kevin Rose.  Yes, hello.  Beautiful Los Angeles.  Things going well for you, sir?  Yeah, yes, indeed.  Calm down after the system.  Yeah.  Are you, are you, have you typed, are you taping a new system?  You're working on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the new system comes out this week, actually.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, another episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you wasted no time.  That's great.  Robert Heron is here, the lab man, the lab Meister.  Hello, hello.  He works at PC Magazine, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, for their website.  I run their HDTV lab.  Checking out the latest and greatest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's his favorite topic.  He talks about everything.  We, of course, welcome David Prager, who hasn't been with us  too many times.  This is his second Twitcast, third,  if you include the pilot.  And David is still at TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I work for a cable television network.  Small cable television network devoted to games, gear,  gadgets, and G-Jaws.  What is the fourth G?  Gigabytes.  I think.  I don't anymore.  That was girls.  Girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Games, gear.  What is the big show now on G4?  It's Attack of the Show or is it X-Play?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The X-Play and Attack of the Show are the two main shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about the donut show, the driving donuts?  What's it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  That's another show that is turning a lot of heads.  Because I guess it's just cars and girls.  Can't go wrong.  I guess not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he's a producer there.  He's the guy who put the web server up the guy's butt.  Oh, jeez.  You actually didn't do that by hand.  No, no, no.  You had a surgeon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, we got a doctor.  He had some tools.  And a shaky light.  That was your idea though, right, David?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wasn't it?  No, it was absolutely not my idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He implemented it.  It wasn't his idea.  He said, hey, how about we do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was the guy who figured out how you could do it.  And of course, ladies and gentlemen,  let's not forget the star of our show,  the chairman of the board of Slamdance Industries,  Mr. Patrick Norton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm still trying to get my head away from that whole web  server butt thing.  Hi, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry.  Hey, at least they didn't use a sledgehammer to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there a wipe tracker in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So to-  We're not in log files.  So this is the-  We're taping this in the evening of Sunday, June 5th.  Tomorrow, June 6th, Steve Jobs gets up on the stage at the  Worldwide Developer Conference.  And if the Wall Street Journal is to be believed,  if CNET is to be believed, he will announce that future  Macs will not have PowerPC chips in them,  but will have instead Intel chips.  That, to me, is a huge story.  Huge story.  You know, frankly, I've been saying this is the end of the  world for Apple, that Apple is, you know,  this is Apple shooting itself in the foot,  committing harry-carry.  It's Steve Jobs' ultimate act of arrogance.  And the first person I thought of to call was John C. Davorek,  another member of the Twit team who hasn't been here because  his Skype is still not working.  But so I actually used this technology they called a  telephone and called John.  And I asked him what he thought about all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you sure make this sound dour.  I have just the opposite take that you have on this.  I mean, you're making it sound like-  First of all, let's go over this.  And I did have this written up in 2003.  And I expected it to happen last year in 2004 based on what  I heard that was going on.  It's possible that it took longer to do the middleware part,  which is going to be the things that allow some of the software  to run on the new platform much the same way the Power PC made  its transition.  Now take a look at the timing on this.  So we had a 10-year period of the 68,000,  then a 10-year period of the Power PC.  And now we're going to have a 10-year Intel period.  I don't see that this is such a big deal in terms of the  progress that the company has been making.  I think this is going to be one of the greatest benefits for  Apple that the company could ever imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do they stand to gain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what they stand to gain, first of all, is to-  and I've been arguing that they should be doing this-  or they should have started doing this maybe 10 years ago,  which is that they can bring out a standardized Intel platform  running this BSD Unix that they have-  oh, I'm sorry, it's OSX-  running on a kind of a standardized PC platform.  They can also manufacture standard PCs for people who want  to maybe still use Windows, even though I think that  there may be a swing toward OSX for Intel,  or which I call a Mac Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you think they're going to make a dual boot system  that runs both Windows and Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's doable.  And I think also, if I had a choice,  and I think I could speak for most PC users,  even though you've abandoned the platform,  I could say for most PC users-  and I've just written this up for PC Magazine,  it'll be running tomorrow-  I think most of these computers that we have on our desk,  or have all the appeal of a 1977 Plymouth.  I agree with you.  People will spend a few extra dollars  to have a good-looking computer.  That means Apple can sell against Dell and HP,  the same machine with a premium price,  getting the margins that those other guys will never get,  and pretty much decimate the market.  I think this is probably the biggest thing Apple has ever done  in terms of potentially becoming a dominant computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what about the Adobe's and the Microsoft's?  How are they going to rewrite their software?  What are they going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they've done it before,  and in fact Adobe seems to rewrite its software every two years,  or every year for that matter.  I mean, anyway, they're all constant.  This is a recompilation thing anyway.  Adobe already has the software running on the x86 system.  How difficult can it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it could be very difficult  because their Windows version relies on Windows API,  which is non-existent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a middleware company that Apple's involved with right now,  and I have their name somewhere,  but this is going to take care of that issue.  This is not going to be as big a deal as you make it out to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the middleware company I think you're thinking of is...  Oh, I had the name here, wait a minute.  Yeah, it's a forgettable name.  It's not a memorable name.  Is it transitive?  Yeah, something like that.  The change from 68,000 to PowerPC,  these were very similar chips.  They were able to make it possible for the operating system  to run both with something called fat binaries.  The program could run in both modes,  and there was a transitional period.  It wasn't a very happy period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, of course, and this won't be either.  In fact, one of the other things that Apple did  was bring out that Power Macintosh upgrade card,  which they can do again,  so people can use the old machines and then put this card in  and make a transition slowly.  My argument is this,  is that Apple, this is the time for Apple to do it.  They can suffer through a transition like this,  which I agree with that part.  It's not going to be easy,  but with the iPod, iTunes thing making tons of money for them,  this is the time to make this move,  because this long term is a fantastic idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think it's gutsy.  I think we're going to look at tomorrow  as the day Apple committed suicide,  and here's why I think the exact opposite, John.  First of all, they're on a platform  that is far from moribund.  I think that the cell chip, which is a PowerPC-based chip,  is a very exciting future chip.  I think the Intel platform, on the other hand,  has run out of steam.  I think they're moving to a processor platform  that is seeing the end of its line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's a couple things there.  One is that apparently the story has it  that Steve was like stiffed by IBM concerning the cell chip  and kind of put it in second place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That, I believe.  I can see this being an arrogant move on Steve's part,  an ego move, but I think it's going to be suicide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I again disagree.  The other thing is about the cell chip.  Jobs has been poo-pooing it as lousy.  And the other guy who's, of course, doing both of this,  these are questionable sources for criticism.  I mean, Steve says this chip is no good,  and then also Bill Gates.  Again, I agree that this is coming from a guy  who's got a competitive product,  but at the same time, Gates is complaining about this chip.  And some of the people within Intel  have some issues with this chip.  So you think IBM...  With the new multi-threaded, multi-core Intel chips  are nothing to be sneezed at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree.  The new, the Pentium D and the hyper-threading  and then dual cores,  they're trying to keep this chip's family alive,  but it's not a long-term solution.  You think the G5 is the end of the line  for PowerPC from IBM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they probably will continue  to upgrade the chip for their own internal uses, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about the notion of Intel  maybe doing something new for Apple?  Do you think that's credible?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to be an Intel x86 chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It has to be.  I mean, if they did something like what you just described,  which nobody said,  I mean, that's purely just off the wall.  Highly speculative, yeah.  Yeah, it's totally.  I mean, there's no evidence of this.  I mean, it's, I mean, you know, long,  you know, of course you never know,  but we would have known about something.  I mean, when my original thesis,  when I first stumbled onto the meetings,  I had, you know, thought what might happen  that would be interesting,  and I thought it would be kind of interesting  if Apple went to the Itanium  because they could use it for the servers  and it would be different,  and Intel's begging for people to buy the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that at least has a future.  The x86 on their Intel is,  it's end of line product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I'm not in agreement with that  because, I mean, I know where you're coming from saying that,  but in fact, you know, with the legacy out there  and the fact that this chip is just getting faster  and faster with the multi-cores, and I expect it to go up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Intel says no 4 gigahertz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, nobody wants to do 4 gigahertz.  They'd rather do more cores.  I mean, you can double the performance  by doubling the number of cores on the same die  because things are shrinking so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have two cores in my G5 right now.  I have two processors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you're ahead of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But most people do.  We're talking to John C. DeVore at Columbus for PC Magazine  and certainly a guy who, if anybody knows what's going on.  So you does, you believe the CNET report.  You think this will happen tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.  And the Wall Street Journal is also kind of saying it's a done deal.  I mean, there's a blogger out there, which I link to in my blog,  if you go to devorek.org slash blog,  who made this observation that he found a language observation.  He looked at the articles and noticed that they weren't,  neither CNET nor the Wall Street Journal  had any weasel words in their stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They seem adamant, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I mean, it was like, you know, this is,  we got this on Good Authority.  And the newspapers nowadays are so gun shy about not weaseling out of,  you know, some of these assertions that when they don't have them in there,  that's actually a signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So well, especially with Steve Jobs,  you don't want to be a rumor monger with Steve Jobs.  So yeah, well, you have to wonder if somebody from Apple is actually  feeding this story to the Journal into the CNET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, he's done that before because he's, you know,  CNET looks like it's picking the story up from the Journal.  But, you know, Jobs plays favorites with the high-end media.  And most of the people are irked with him about it because he'll,  you know, put everybody on an embargo to a certain date  and then give the story to Newsweek so they can run it the day before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or Mossberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Mossberg's a big guy.  He's like kind of a stooge for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he's at the Journal and I could easily see them feeding this to Mossberg  and him feeding it upstairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, actually, that's a good point to be excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I just, it scares the heck out of me.  It doesn't seem like it's necessary.  I think Apple's in a good position right now.  It is a very gutsy move.  I mean, your scenario is attractive.  If they could start shipping computers that would run both Windows and OS X,  I think there's a big market for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a huge market for it.  And I think the other upside for Apple would be that they get,  one of the problems they're always going to have with only selling  1 million computers a quarter compared to the 100 to 175 million machines  that are sold every year.  This is a ridiculously low number is that you can't get the developer interest  that you can to a market that has 100 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you think that that's the that's the carrot they're going to offer these guys  for rewriting all of their software.  You think Microsoft's going to play along?  Office is critical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Microsoft, Microsoft, no, I don't think it's as critical as you think it is anymore.  I think and besides that if you bring out a dual boot machine who cares?  But the point is is that you know, I think Apple's been trying to get out from underneath.  I mean, that's what they've been bringing out products that kind of compete with Microsoft products.  Ever since Microsoft or Macintosh Basic, the product that was killed by Microsoft,  the people in the Mac community would love to just ditch Microsoft and go off and do their own thing.  And you know, there's a lot of good stuff out there that runs on Unix machines.  I mean, some of it has crappy menuing systems,  unfortunately, because the Unix guys, they think weird.  But you know, except for that Piccadillo, I think most of this stuff,  I think you can outfit an OS X machine with no Microsoft material on it at all and do very well for yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you get in line to buy one of these machines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was asking me about buying stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know you don't have to.  But if you if for some reason you didn't get one, would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the kind of machine that if I was like a computer buyer, which I'm not, I'm a writer about computers.  I don't go out, you know, I don't just basically testing stuff all the time.  So don't worry about buying stuff.  But if I was a computer buyer and I had the lineup of different machines out there and Apple,  which has already developed this name as a kind of like I mentioned in the column tomorrow,  kind of the Lexus compared to the Fords and Chevys, Dell and HP.  I think I would buy the Lexus.  I have a Lexus.  I would buy a Lexus computer.  I mean something that's a little nicer.  It's maybe you might think it's better made in probably the same company in China making them all.  But definitely a better looking machine with a lot of cache.  I would get the Macintosh in a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Well, there you have it, John.  Thank you for on such short notice for coming on the show.  Anytime Leo, you know me.  So there you have it.  John C.  He says it's a done deal and it's a great idea.  You know, you heard me.  I just don't buy it.  Why do you think it's a bad deal?  Here, I'll give you the three reasons.  All right.  Reason number one, all your software has to be rewritten and it is non-trivial.  I know everybody's going crazy.  Oh, no, the drivers are already there.  Believe me, Adobe, just because Adobe makes a Windows version of Photoshop and a Power PC  version of Photoshop doesn't mean it's easy at all to make a Intel X version of Photoshop.  That's just a whole new kettle of fish.  And no matter what, you know, you don't just recompile, you rewrite and it's a lot of work.  And, you know, they went through this 10 years ago.  I don't know if they're going to go through it again.  The only thing that might convince them is maybe there's a giant market.  So maybe we will.  Secondly, why x86?  Why not Athlon?  Why not Optorun?  Why, why saddle yourself with a company that's at the end of the line?  It's just, I mean, this doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, Roger.  I just wondered, did you mean end of the line for Intel or just for the x86 family?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, end of the line for x86.  I mean, you've got to make a decision.  Are you going Itanium?  Are you going, I mean, you think it'll be an Itanium?  By the way, let me introduce Roger Chang, who's somehow taken the place of David Prager.  I don't know how it happened, but it's magic.  Roger is writing it about games for GameSpot over at CNET.  And by the way, Roger, maybe you have some insight.  How did CNET get this story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, actually, I work for GameSpot and the way CNET actually separates its division,  they keep it pretty much behind closed doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's go, so let's go back.  So anyway, those are two points and I'm sure there's a third, but address those if you  will, gentlemen.  Do you think it's a good idea, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just think in terms of the sheer volume of the chips and the fact that they've got  to be able to get the chips cheaper.  They've got to have access to better chip sets.  You know, it just seems like from Dvorak had a really good point.  I mean, if they're tapping into an architecture that's going out to 125, 175 million PCs a  year, it's a lot easier to get deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're saying they had to for economic reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they've probably had to for economic reasons and it's probably getting really difficult  to compete with.  The reason Intel always held on to the megahertz numbers on the processors is because the marketing  people always said people went in and they go for the biggest number of megahertz, even  if the performance is unrelated.  That's why Cyrix did branding that sort of upsold from their clock speed up to what their  actual performance was.  AMD's done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think Microsoft's going to rewrite Microsoft Office for it?  This is exactly the moment Microsoft's been waiting for to dump Apple.  Well, you know, like how important is Microsoft Office?  It's the number one selling application on Macintosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What percentage of the users actually use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you have to have it if you want to live in a Windows world and you want to use a Mac.  By the way, here's my third...  And I use OpenOffice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use OpenOffice.  I don't live on Microsoft Office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can use OpenOffice on Mac, but you have to run X-Window.  Here's the third reason.  I think it's a very compelling reason.  It's the Osborne effect.  They're announcing now that in six months, the Mini will be based on Intel and in 18  months, all of their products will be based on Intel.  They're not going to sell one more Mac for 18 months.  That's it.  Who would buy a Mac now knowing you're going Intel and every bit of software you buy is  obsolete.  This is a stupid move.  I'm telling you, we're going to look back at this and say this is when Steve Jobs fell  on his sword.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know about that.  All right, Kevin, you explain it to me.  This is so exciting.  I'm stoked.  I have two Macs, I have three PCs, and the only reason I don't just have one computer  is because I want OS X and I also want to be able to play my games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do like a dual boot.  I do like, and DeVorek brought that up, a dual boot PC Mac is attractive.  Yeah, but that's a total fantasy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't think that'll happen?  It can happen if it's based on Intel chips.  And the other thing is you don't have to do a boot at all.  They can run a nice little emulator that runs inside OS X that will be native on the  x86 based processor so you really won't see the slowdown that you would if you're running  it in like a processor emulation type mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're exactly right.  You don't have to do a dual boot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll buy emulatable or hackable, but I don't see Steve ever signing off on doing a dual  boot Macintosh system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why are you so stoked about this then, Kevin?  Let's say you can only buy Mac Intel.  Is it the dual boot that gets you excited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the main thing that gets me excited is that I've always been a huge fan of Apple  hardware.  I mean the way they design things, the computer, if you take apart a G5, open it up, play with  it, upgrade it.  It's beautiful inside.  Everything is laid out so clean and so well and the power supply, every piece of that  computer is just so well engineered it blew me away.  And I would love to have, I would pay a few extra hundred dollars for a nice Apple that  could run my, you know, not only my Mac applications but my Windows as well.  Robert Heron, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see this maybe as a first stage for Apple in terms of creating competition for Microsoft  in the operating systems suite down the road.  If their software suddenly is x86 compatible, then what's to keep them from, you know, maybe  making a better operating system for and possibly throw more competition to Windows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a great question, Robert, because are they going to release OS X as a standalone  product that you can install on any x86?  You don't think so.  Apple is a hardware company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's true.  You're right.  They are not a software company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's also a, there's a nightmare in terms of legacy coverage for hardware on  the Windows side.  They've never had to address on the Mac side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then all of a sudden they would have to address that.  You're right.  I mean, they own the hardware.  They don't have to worry about it.  They know exactly what they're running on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think what you do at that point is you do like what BOS did and that is when you start  to release it, you only select, you know, here's 15 motherboards that we're compatible  with.  Here's 10 different chipsets.  Here's 10 different video cards.  Very limited hardware support.  So like the greatest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like an OS X certified motherboard, OS X certified video card.  I mean, you know, it's interesting because Apple has a lot of the content creation software.  I mean, they have Shake.  They have a few other 3D rendering.  MotionLive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, they rule the video space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I mean, it would be feasible that, you know, Steve could be thinking that, you know,  there's so many people kind of already invested in that software, in that technology, in that  kind of learning that they had to do for it that they'll want to switch over, you know,  down the road when they require more powerful hardware and they acquire, you know, updated  software and run it.  It's like we, granted it's running on the architecture, but from their point of view,  it should still feel and look like an OS X Macintosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could see this if, you know, PowerPC was dead, if IBM wasn't innovating, if it were  kind of a moribund processor family.  I can see it making the move, but IBM is an innovator.  They're the first to use copper.  They're doing this cell chip.  I know Steve Jobs pooh-poos the cell chip, but I think it's going to be the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what's the software transition?  You know what I mean?  It's like, what's worse, the software transition from the G5 to the cell processor or the software  transition from the G5 to the Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Easily.  The cell processor has a PowerPC controller chip.  It's a...  Well, I mean, now I'm speculating, but because it's a PowerPC controller chip, it's PowerPC  family, I think it's going to be an easier transition, a much easier transition.  Look what happened.  Microsoft has gone to PowerPC for Xbox.  PlayStation has gone to cell for the PlayStation 3.  Apple is going upstream.  They're going the wrong direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but those are also relatively closed platforms, and they're primarily looking at  gaming performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're going to sell millions, and gaming performance is very similar to 3D rendering,  to MP3 conversion, to digital video.  It's the stuff we do.  I think they're going against the trend in processors right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They may be bucking the trend in processors, but I think what they're really going after  is they've realized that people won't switch unless they have that, you know, certain application  of that certain game that can run on their Mac.  And the true way to do this, the best way to do it, would be to run native, x86-based  where you wouldn't have to have a crazy emulator.  It could just run right inside of OS X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But remember that most of these games are written to a Windows API, to a DirectX API.  They're more tied to Windows than they are tied to Intel.  So you have to run Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, you would have to have the kernel running with inside there.  But there's just like the way a virtual PC operates right now, how you can launch a Windows-based  application directly from the taskbar.  It would be the same thing but without the emulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what does Microsoft's take on this?  Is this good for Microsoft or bad for Microsoft?  Does Bill Gates support this?  Because if Bill Gates says there's no way they're going to be able to run Windows on  this thing, they're not going to run Windows on it.  And do you think Bill Gates is going to say that?  Or is he going to say, oh good, another chance to make some money?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, why would he say there's no way though?  I mean, if it's x86-based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's a huge threat.  First of all, it's a threat.  If this works, it's a threat to Windows.  And I think inherently he doesn't like this whole idea.  It's Apple saying, hey, we're going to move over to your side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I think he hates the idea.  But the thing is that he can't stop it if it's x86-based, that anyone can put Windows  on there.  As long as Apple allows it.  I know Apple could stop it if they wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I just think that if normal users are going to do it, it has to be with the cooperation  of Microsoft.  Because they, well, they own, for one thing, they own the EmuLa emulator, soft PC.  Would you buy one, Leo?  Oh, of course.  I'd buy a dual boot Windows Mac machine.  I guess I would.  I mean, you know, most of us, all of us live in a dual processor world.  We have Windows and Macs.  And that's a satisfactory solution for me right now.  I do most of my work on Macs, but this tablet PC is great.  I mean, I'm using it for, you know, as a date book, $2,000 date timer.  A very expensive date book.  It is, but it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's big, breakable, and it won't fit your pocket.  By the way, it'll last a half a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's almost as small as my date timer.  It only costs 10 times more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting.  I noticed that somebody was commenting on one of the issues Apple had with the cell  processor was that there was no VFX Altevec or there wasn't a sophisticated, sophisticated  Altevec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't need it.  Yeah.  I mean, the whole machine is an Altevec machine.  It's SIMD.  It's SIMD and hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, but they'd have to redo all of the code that was made for Altevec.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  I mean, I, you know, there's no question you've got OS X in the lab running on Intel.  I mean, they've had that all along.  Yeah.  Mark our project is what they call it.  Yeah.  I mean, that's, there's no, that's easy.  I'm not worried about the operating system.  I'm not worried about drivers.  I'm just application developers.  You know, you're going to leave behind, maybe you won't leave Macromedia behind or Adobe  behind.  Although not neither of these, none of these companies have much love for Apple anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause that would be interesting to know just what percentage of, of either, you know, but  you know, especially Macromedia or, or, or Adobe, what percentage of their sales are  still to the Macintosh platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's telling that Steve's making this announcement at the developers conference.  Clearly the announcement is to, he's going to have to really kiss some butt over there  and tell, and tell the, the, the ISVs, the software vendors, we love you.  We, you know, we're going to support you.  You've got to develop for this.  He went through this in 94 when they went from power piece to power PC.  This is even worse.  Now, maybe it's easier in some respects because they know Intel, but, you know, I mean, you  don't, nowadays you don't write to the processor.  You write to the operating system.  You write to the API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so do you think the key here is going to be a suite that he announces saying, Hey,  this is the one suite where you'll be able to develop your application and then easily  port it to windows if you want to kind of selling them on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He has to do something.  You're, you know what, Kevin, you hit the nail on the head.  I hadn't thought of that, but that's exactly what he has to do.  He has to say we have tools that will develop.  You want right once it runs on both.  You're exactly right, Kevin.  That's what he has to do.  They may be able to do that.  Then that now that's compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So will I, will I be able to get a G5 in like a shuttle case in like three years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think anybody will be getting a G5 in three years.  If this keeps up, you'll have to get an Xbox.  All right.  That's it.  I think we've, we've done this to death.  Let's just go around the horn and, and, and cast a thumbs up or thumbs down.  Good for Apple, bad for Apple.  Kevin Rose, thumbs up.  Robert Heron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd say thumbs down for the hardware side.  Roger Chang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would say thumbs up for software and thumbs down for the hardware.  Oh, you will weasel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick Norton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, if it makes for a cheaper Mac, great, but I still don't believe it's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe it's going to happen and I think it's going to be the end of the line for Apple.  I'm very disappointed.  Item two, WiMAX.  Patrick, you talked with Intel about WiMAX this week.  Yeah.  It's the latest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember the idea that WiMAX was mostly hype?  Yeah.  Well, it's still mostly hype, but it's hype that's going to be in, it's hype.  They're actually claiming it was, there's some, some, some interesting stuff online.  Basically, WiMAX is a, is a microwave replacement for a cable or DSL distribution of broadband.  It's going to be capped at about one megabit per second.  And people are excited mostly because they have this vision of being able to go anywhere  in a metropolitan area and connect to the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me just correct something.  You said one megabit per second?  Yeah.  One megabyte per second?  One megabit, no, no, more, it must be one megabits.  Like the, that's like the old home connect.  You, I mean, what are you talking about here?  It's 11 megabits right now for 802.11b.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If they can guarantee a one megabit, that's still not that bad.  If that's like a solid guarantee up and down, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's  up for me.  Up would be pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not for down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, think about, I have a three megabit right now and it's, I don't even hit  one megabyte when I'm downloading, downloading certain things.  This is like more along the lines of a, you know,  So you think of it as an ISP kind of a, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is WiMAX line of sight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it is definitely not line of sight.  That's what's exciting about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you're right.  Typical end user WiMAX bandwidth is expected to be in the range of 512 kilobits to two  megabits.  So you're right.  It's, so really it's competing not with Wi-Fi.  It's competing with, it's, it's an ISP solution.  It's competing with DSL.  All right.  Okay.  So this is guaranteed to every single person is going to get one megabit.  Well anyway, I mean, let's, I mean, I'm curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is, it comes across like a utility, something that would be provided, you know, rather than  dealing with relatively slow modem speeds, just plain old, plain old telephone service.  You can at least have a megabit anywhere that's as free as water per se.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know about free as water because there's definitely, there's, what's interesting  is in the, basically this summer, they're going to start doing WiMAX as a fixed, fixed  WiMAX test are going to start this summer and they expect it to start rolling out in  the late, very late winter or early spring of 2006.  And the idea is it's basically fixed to your house or fixed to your businesses as a competitor  to cable or DSL.  The next stage is going to take about another year or about a year behind is going to be  mobile WiMAX, which is going to be urban metropolis is primarily being covered.  The Wi-Fi distribution is kind of, I mean, it's interesting.  It's an interesting idea.  And I think for smaller towns, it works pretty well, but it's definitely been up in arms  for wireless distribution anywhere other than Philly, I think.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this, do you see this as something like maybe in a second generation of what Ricochet  was trying to do or is it what cities?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think it was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think the, I think the true second generation of Ricochet is going to be 3G,  you know, 3G and 4G coming over cell phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's RF.  This is, this is at microwave frequencies.  So it's, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's going to be, I mean, between, you know, the, between 3G, WiMAX, existing Wi-Fi  and Wi-Fi hotspots.  I mean, Sprint's talking about taking advantage of Wi-Fi, WiMAX, because basically you can  cover more territory with fewer cells.  You know what I mean?  You don't have to, you don't have to roll as many trucks to get the network up and running  or you can create, you can, you can take what is essentially a whole lot of Wi-Fi cells  and reduce the number of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So essentially it's kind of an intermediate technology between Wi-Fi and 3G where it has

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's a, it's a competitor.  It's a competitor to 3G.  Because remember the idea of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's cheap though to roll out, much cheaper than 3G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's much cheaper than 3G, but 3G is also regulated, 3G is restricted in how it can  be distributed based on having to be associated, you know, with a cell phone network and basically  having to deal, the idea is this is, it's a pure data technology, whether or not it's  not designed, it's not a, it's not a  Not a voice technology.  Voice technology is being repurposed for data.  Which is one of the issues that's coming up with 3G because certainly Sprint, I mean,  all of the networks have played games here and there with whether or not you can actually  access their network over particular cell phones or how you can, either by shutting  off Bluetooth or turning it on or allowing or not allowing USB connections.  And WiMAX is, you know, and the other thing that Intel says is they're investing more  money in 3G than they are in WiMAX and they're pretty heavily invested in WiMAX.  But I think both of those, I think there's going to be a lot of competing technologies  in, you know, probably about two years to bring broadband, at least in the major markets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's great.  I mean, just the whole point is who cares?  Co-op, competition is good, co-op, I don't want to say co-op-it-tion for, competition  is good.  I mean, it drops prices, it's good for consumers.  So that's good no matter what, whether you want to use WiMAX or not.  Is it symmetric for the most part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a really good question that I haven't seen addressed yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you know, that would be, if I could get a megabit up and down, I'd be very interested.  That's a T1 line, I want a T1 line.  That's of interest, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  VoIP is also interesting in that respect to cell phones now incorporating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that's the limit on Skype is it's not the downstream, it's the upstream that's keeping  us from sounding great.  So final issue, because we're running out of time here, and I'm going to give this one  to Kevin Rose.  I should really give it to Robert Heron.  ICANN has approved the XXX domain name.  Are you happy Robert?  I'm happy.  Now instead of strippers.com, it's strippers.XXX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like it's good for the industry, so why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a good thing just to have, I mean I know you say you're setting up a red  light district on the internet, but at least we know where it is now.  The red light district's there, it's just everywhere now.  Let's move them all off.  Can you make the porn guys go to XXX?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they would want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well some would.  That means someone would have to start regulating.  Right.  Decide what kind of content is, is there an adult?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In theory you do it now with .edu and .mil and .gov.  You could, I mean there's no reason why you couldn't say if you're going to have an adult.  I'll give you a good example, playboy.com, they're never giving up playboy.com.  And they don't want to be playboy.XXX because they don't consider themselves XXX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean none of the existing sites are going to give up their existing URL.  Maybe new sites, but think about all the squatting that's done every time somebody comes up with  .biz or .tv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It won't make filtering a lot easier for parents though.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any XXX?  That's why I like it.  Or conversely, if that's what you're looking for, you know where to go.  You know what you're getting.  I think frankly we should register twit.XXX just in case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well mostly you want to register it just so somebody doesn't link to donkey stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Of .XXX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting that you bring up donkey.  They also approved, and this didn't get as much attention, .mobi.  What's that for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  .mobi is really funky.  Is that for bald mix artists?  No, it's a cell phone content specific address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like if you went to a kind of a WAP site.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Basically there's not a whole lot of information out on it, but the idea is that this is a,  and it's also not a lot of information of how proprietary this format would be or closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh it's not just a TLD, it's a format.  Yeah.  Whatever happened, was it WAP?  Was that what it was called?  Remember there was that protocol?  Accident protocol?  No, for the, yeah maybe it was.  It was for small handheld websites.  Yeah, for cell phones.  Yeah, WAP.  Whatever happened to that?  It's still out there.  Are there WAP sites?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there's versions of all different types of sites that you can access over WAP.  Oh.  Yeah.  I don't think it's, it didn't really catch on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe .mobi will.  Well yeah, it's Microsoft, Nokia, and Vodafone.  Oh well there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.  Anything else anybody is anxious to talk about?  Roger, you see any exciting new games on the horizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know summer, believe it or not, for gaming is generally kind of the dry season.  Kids are outside, they're enjoying the fresh air.  It's when the temperature starts rolling around, it just, you'll see a lot of new games.  Everyone's basically waiting for all the 360 stuff to start pouring out, or at least the  announcements for 360 stuff to start pouring out, because that's supposedly going to be  the first action console on the market.  Everyone wants to see what the games are for that particular system.  But from what I understand, every time a new generation of consoles come out, there's actually  a dip in game sales because most people are usually saving up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah that's what's going to happen to Apple for the next 18 months.  Get ready Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeez.  We're going to wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So should I hold off on buying my new G5 until later when they're like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well you tell me, what do you think?  Yeah I just bought a power book, I need to sell it.  Exactly!  I'm going to do a buy it now for like four hours right now on eBay.  You see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see what I'm saying here?  This is bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hoard the classic Apple hardware quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know what, it's kind of weird because there's a lot of people like me who are looking  at Apple, currently looking at upgrading Mac hardware just to take advantage of the new  Final Cut Pro software, the new Shake, all the new kind of compositing and video editing  software because a lot of post-production houses are now moving more independently and  they're trying to get away from larger studios that rely on Avid and want to be able to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  stuff on their own without breaking the ban.  Well the good news is because Apple makes those programs, they'll appear on Intel immediately.  But it's just the non-Apple programs you're going to be waiting for.  Look how long it took Quark to do a PowerPC version of Quark Express.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you don't think it would be quicker with the next 86 architecture?  You think it'd be longer?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've got big endian versus big endian.  Yeah but Quark takes forever to do anything.  Yeah.  Well that's true.  But I mean it took three or four years.  People had to use OS 9 until very recently if they wanted to use Quark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still have OS 9.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it'll run on Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually you know what?  With Batsalisk I can kind of sort of run OS 8.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I still have my OS 7.5.  I'll install this somewhere.  Wow.  Just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the oldest version of Apple you run?  We have a contest.  All right gang.  I think we've done enough.  Two tweets in three days is more than anyone should really have to do.  All right.  Thank you Roger Chang for dialing in.  It's great to have you.  We're going to have to send you a recorder so you'll sound as good as the rest of us.  Next week let's use TeamSpeak Robert and maybe that'll make it a little bit better.  Certainly.  Don't know what happened to David Prager.  I think maybe it was because I insulted G4.  Do you think it had to do with the server up the guy's butt that...  He disappeared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it was the server up the guy's butt I'd be more worried about the audience than David.  But I think David got confused.  I think he cut off and then came back in and didn't understand what was going on with the  Dvorak guy.  Oh maybe that's what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he went and did that G4 and Hirschhorn came over and pressed the button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think maybe it could have happened.  Oh well.  We can talk freely since none of us here have anything to do with it.  Kevin Rose, Robert Heron, Patrick Norton, Roger Chang, I'm Leo Laporte.  I hope you've enjoyed this episode.  We'll find out what happens tomorrow.  Maybe we'll do a special episode to recant...  What do you call it?  Recant?  Recap?  Recap?  No, take it all back.  Recant.  Recant.  I got it right the first time.  I can't stand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah I'm actually going to try to see if I can get into the WWDC.  We should go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's all just go down.  We'll say, hey we're here.  We're the Twits.  We're the Twits.  Are you moving up here?  There's still some debate over that.  Are you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah it's still going back and forth.  But it looks like it.  We'll find out.  I'll let you know more next week.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you gentlemen.

I have some banner left over from last time.  I'll just use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it the Woody and Trumming banner?  All right, guys.  We went over like the cheese demo.  Oh, the cheese demo.

Transcript:  I'll never forget that.  Patrick's snoring in the back while I'm trying desperately to explain digitization using cheese.  I have to point out, I was very tired.  I had been up very late running this march.  That was so depressing.  I mean, this was like in the first six months of Call for Help.  And I'm using cheese, slicing cheese to show sampling, right?  I have this long brick of cheese and I'm slicing it.  And it's not going very well.  And I've got sweat on my lip.  It's a good brilliant, by the way.  No, well, in conception it is.  Maybe not an execution.  I mean, it just was flopping.  And I'm struggling around with this and it's just not working.  I'm breaking into a sweat.  And then I look up and there in the back of the studio, Patrick Norton fast asleep.  I'm not kidding.  You were out.  And that just was it.  It was all over for me.  That's my career ending right there.  All right.  We have enough banner to last us for several shows now.  Good to hear.
