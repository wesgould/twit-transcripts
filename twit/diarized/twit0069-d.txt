Transcript:  This is Tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is Tweet.  This Week in Tech, Episode 69 for September 17, 2006.  You're on my list.  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Visa.  Safer, better money.  Life takes Visa.  And by Dell.  For this week's specials, visit twit.tv slash Dell.  Alright, let's do it.  Start the show.  Alright, start the show.  Ladies and gentlemen, time to Tweet.  Just a couple of Twits right now.  Maybe we'll add some more as time goes by, depending on the Tweet connectivity.  From Slamdance Industries, Mr. Patrick Norton of DL.tv.  Hi, everybody.  Hey, Patrick.  Why Slamdance Industries?  What does that mean?  Slamdance Industries?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was, because Slamdance.com was picked up by a film festival down in LA.  So that was as close as you could get.  Well, no, I own Slamdance.net and Slamdance.org.  Oh, wow.  They were just looking for a nice two-word name.  So that was the best I could do in what was available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So basically what you're telling us is you've given away your Skype name to the public now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, he's talking about the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo has, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I didn't mention, because that's the name of your blog.  But now I'll take that part out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, also here.  Now leave it in.  The guy needs attention.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he's pretty busy.  He needs to be busier.  Do you need attention, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm good, actually.  My email and my IM are publicly enough as it is.  I get into some highly amusing conversations that way.  You don't leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I doubt either of you.  Certainly I don't leave Skype on all the time.  No.  No.  Because then it really, people would call all the time if they, they could figure out  who you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, John's is not.  Well, until recently, actually, nobody really knew what my Skype name was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Until just moments ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Until moments ago.  On this shocking edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I never get that person, because I just put my name out there.  You know, you want to, John C. Dvorak is my Skype name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People are scared of you, though, John.  They don't call you.  They're not unapproachable of us.  They call us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should be scared of Patrick more than they are of me.  Absolutely right.  I mean, if you're talking about linebackers, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.  Like a wide receiver.  He wields a mighty sledgehammer.  I remember getting a call, I think we were in Louisville, Kentucky, and I remember getting  a call in the hotel room at six o'clock.  I foolishly checked in under my own name from a tech TV fan and said, hey, how are you?  Welcome to Louisville.  I'm saying thank you very much.  Good morning.  You're trying to sleep.  You want a mint julep?  So, yeah, I mean, people think we're, I think because we were on TV so much, Patrick, they  just think we're, you know, approachable.  We're friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They know us.  We're part of the gang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've been in their house.  They're living in their kitchens.  You know, I have to tell you, the funny thing is people, you know, I've done as much media,  but people don't, A, they don't think I'm approachable, and B, when they approach me,  I'm like so normalized.  They don't think it's you.  Well, no, it's not even that, but they're very disappointed.  Yeah, they want you to be cranky.  Well, they want something more than just some jerk that's just standing around like anybody else.  How are you?  Hi.  Yeah.  What do you do for a living?  I started interviewing him and that kind of drives him crazy.  It takes care of it.  So what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak's here.  Dvorak.org slash blog.  I'm sure you recognize the voice.  We missed you last week.  Glad to have you both back on Twitter, especially since now Twitter is sponsored and that means  cash in your pockets for every show you're on.  Did you know that?  In silver.  In silver, in doubloons, gold doubloons, because that's how Visa pays us.  This podcast is brought to you by Visa Smarter, something better, something money.  If you're using a Visa, oh, I have to do this.  I have to, we got a number of complaints.  People said, it's not clear when you're doing the commercial.  I think when I start talking about Visa, that's pretty clear it's a commercial, but I'm going  to say now this podcast brought to you by Visa.  And then now you'll know it's a commercial, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe you should have an uga horn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do I have a what?  A website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A website to go to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, Visa, I mean, why does Visa have to advertise?  Aren't they like-  That's a really good question, but I'm not going to-  No, I'm just saying because everyone knows who they are.  Everyone knows who they are.  It's like there's two cards, there's Visa, MasterCard, and then there's I guess-  John, John, John.  They need to advertise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so important for their image.  You know what they're trying-  Actually, they have the best image of all these guys right now.  I think they do have the best image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Compared to what?  They're indistinguishable from MasterCard, and they're in a long running battle with  American Express.  Maybe that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a different style.  American Express is a different game.  I think so too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you may think so, but a lot of the public may not notice the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you get a credit card, do you really have a choice?  Can you go to your bank and say, can I not have a MasterCard?  I'd prefer a Visa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In some cases, you want to apply for one or the other.  In other words, what Visa's doing by advertising is really advertising to banks to get them  to use them instead of the other guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you why they wanted to be on Twitter.  That's the whole network, by the way.  They wanted to tell people who understand security and who use their credit cards online  that they're working to make sure that the fraud doesn't happen on Visa cards, and they  keep an eye on things.  They actually do this.  I've had this happen where if somebody uses your card out of context, you get a call and  they say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or if you use your card out of context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I actually got that too.  When I started using it in Canada, they called and said, do you go to Canada a lot?  I said yes.  They said, oh great, we're just checking.  I think that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With DiscoverCard, it's really easy to get it shut off, like driving three hours to the  right...  My bank shut off my card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My bank shut off my ATM card.  I've been going to Canada for two years.  Three months ago, they shut off my ATM because of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the computer program fault.  They have programs that can tell that you bought an airline ticket, you did this, you  did that.  They would know.  They should put it all together.  Yeah, because basically they're following us around.  I agree.  I was at a lecture once with one of these bank card guys, and he had this very interesting  thing to say, and it's actually happened to me.  He says, and anyone out there can try this.  This is a very good algorithm that they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They often use SAS Institute stuff because I've talked to the SAS people about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's some of that, but here's the trick.  Here's what you want to do if you want to see if your card get killed.  Don't use your card for a couple of days, and then go buy two tanks of gas separately.  Buy a tank of gas with the card, and then buy another tank.  In other words, have your wife or somebody come...  Within 15 minutes.  No, right.  Well, yeah, probably 15 minutes.  But say just one, fill it up, and then charge it, and then fill up another tank.  If you really want to have some fun, do three.  But fill up a bunch of tanks of gas, like in a row.  Try to rent a 747.  And then go buy a pair of Nike sneakers.  That is actually an algorithm.  They found that a lot of kids...  I'm sure it's called urban profiling.  A lot of kids steal a car, and the first thing they do, according to the guy, they fill up  their older buddy's tanks full of gas.  That's the first thing they do.  Go buy some shoes.  They go buy some shoes.  So I had a similar situation, although I was buying a pair of pants.  But it was at some one of these kinds of places.  Interesting.  And they...  No, they didn't kill it, but I had to talk to somebody on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what they do.  I mean, they don't kill it right...  Or maybe someone did.  They killed my bank card.  Well, you do the Nike.  Yeah.  They killed my bank card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was like, okay, we'll try that.  Yeah, do it.  Just do it as a gag.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that concludes this Visa commercial.  Stay for better money.  Life takes Visa.  How do you like that, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we gave him too much time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it was more than just a commercial because we learned something here.  We learned how to kill your credit card.  So the couple of big announcements this week, Tuesday, Apple Showtime announcement, and  Thursday, Microsoft's Zune announcement.  And you've already heard all the details.  The only thing about the Zune that I thought...  There are two things I thought were very interesting.  I'd like to get both your comments on this one.  First of all, the Zune will come in three colors, black and white, much like the iPod,  and brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, brown.  That kind of defines it, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brown.  Yeah.  What?  Who?  Now, of course, we need a woman on here.  Trendy brown.  Is brown trendy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, amongst, I guess, people at Microsoft who spend too much time in the bathroom.  Oh, I'm sorry I said that.  Okay, I was off-color joke.  Hey, brown, off-color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the number two color right after white, they said.  Can you imagine?  My question is...  I noticed this too with Ubuntu.  Ubuntu is predominantly brown.  Is brown the new black?  Is that the new color?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but the brown Zune actually looks pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you buy a brown MP3 player?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't.  I don't know.  I've got like four as it is.  I think I'm permanently out of the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the other thing that I think is interesting.  We'll play copy protected songs from the Zune marketplace and then unprotected AAC, which  is, that's good, MP3, Windows Media, JPEG for photos, H.264, MPEG4, and Windows Media.  What's missing from that list?  Microsoft's own place for sure protection.  Well, that's because...  We block this.  What's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Well, it's...  But it seems like they're trying to...  Either they're establishing their own market and they don't want to share with the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it?  Rhapsody and Napster and all that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even the urge eyes are like, we're there to participate if Microsoft wants us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is not an accidental admission.  This is fact.  They are not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this has got to be a huge blunder.  This is a conflict of interest.  This makes the company look like a bunch of buffoons.  I agree.  I think it...  I was watching something the other day which is...  Charlie Rose occasionally has actually a good guess that he can interview properly.  I don't like Charlie Rose.  I think he's a jock sniffer.  He's always talking about money.  He's always talking about...  How do you...  Questions like, how does it feel to be rich?  I remember seeing him once, one time, he walked into somebody's house and he pointed a painting  on the wall and said, what does something like this cost?  These guys preoccupy with money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does that though because he thinks the audience wants to know.  No, he doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like money hungry.  No, everybody wants to know that.  Nobody cares what Michael Dell thinks when he...  Anyway, so here's...  He does this interview with Les Moonves who's the head of CBS at the beginning of this entire  show.  He says, don't worry, I'm not going to say anything about Viacom.  You're not going to go there.  But by the time this interview is over, he had this anecdote about synergism which was  directly related to the relationship of Viacom and CBS, which is...  And Paramount.  And he made this point.  And I listened to this and I said, this is exactly the problem.  And this is what's going on with this Microsoft device.  And Moonves tells a story about when the movie studio brought out the movie Stepford Wives,  they wanted to advertise to the 25 to 52 year old women of which CBS had the dominant market  share.  They had most of them.  And the advertising dollars, 85% of them went to NBC.  How does that work?  He says it's all because people are like...  They have these buddy relations.  You can't do anything about all these relationships that are preordained, these buddies that are  in the business that...  Who knows what goes on behind the scenes that result in these kinds of what is basically  a conflict of interest.  And the fact that Microsoft doesn't use its own DRM in this system...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's not its own DRM because it's the DRM other people use to play Microsoft devices.  But they have this new DRM, the Zune DRM, which is stuff only they sell apparently,  right?  So in a way, this is screwing your partners saying, yeah, well, we created a DRM that  you can use, but we're not going to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  It's stupid.  But yeah, no, it's like they have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys, they're manipulating their partners to get them to play along.  Oh, you think that this is a negotiation ploy?  This is their plan.  The thing's like at least three months out.  I'd be mad if I were Rhapsody and Napster, Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Patrick, I think that's a great theory if you're going to really actually think Microsoft  can think like that.  I mean, the fact that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Microsoft's 3.0 on DRM, John.  That's what it is with music.  This is their 3.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Has not been able to market anything for crap except for their office suite and windows.  And they keep dropping the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They killed Netscape.  And who else have they killed in the market or threatened to kill in the market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, I'm not saying they can't kill people.  They kill people with their weight.  It doesn't do them any good.  I mean, what benefit was it to kill Netscape?  I mean, what was the benefit?  What was the actual long-term benefit?  And the way they killed it, they thought it was threatening.  They thought.  I'm not saying it's rational.  Well, that's what I'm trying to point out here.  So who are they trying to kill here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the value?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their target is obviously they're embarrassed by the market share that Apple holds.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're trying to kill Apple.  Oh, please.  But the way they're killing them is by dumping on their existing partners, seems to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, see, that's why I don't believe that that's what's happening.  I think it's just boneheaded incompetence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in any event...  So you believe this is true.  It's not an omission.  It's not just on an accident that they actually do not plan to support Place for Sure on the  Zune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's just a complete incompetence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you, Patrick, think it's a negotiating ploy to get Rhapsody, Yahoo, all these partners  to do something, kick in more money?  I mean, what do they want them to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it could be a negotiating ploy.  Probably what I was saying is like, you know, the whole reason for them to kill off Netscape  is if somebody was smart enough to know that people are going to spend a lot of time in  browsers and they wanted to control that avenue out of the Windows desktop, right?  You know, seriously, like the 1.0 product for them is a DRM, which was adopted by a  ton of partners and is pretty much the only, you know, their DRM is pretty much the...  This is the Place for Sure stuff you're talking about.  No, no, actually, I haven't even gotten to Place for Sure yet.  Place for Sure is like the 2.0 product.  The 1.0 product is their DRM.  The 2.0 product, you know, which is adopted by half the planet, right?  The 2.0 product is when they realize the end users are having a nightmare experience  getting stuff to play on the different Windows compatible MP3 players as they inaugurate  Place for Sure to try to make all of these things behave properly.  And then they realize that even if they got, you know, made the situation more manageable  and ran it through a Windows media player and made behavior consistent and made sure  the DRM worked, that didn't help much.  And now they're basically, they're going to market these portable players, the Zune,  and just try to start digging away at Apple's market share.  And I think they've got the resources to do it if they do it right, especially with some  of the Xbox Live gaming on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just always had the resources to do anything they want.  I mean, the fact that they're doing it with the Xbox is kind of a miracle because half  the time they get into something, they make a little money, maybe some profits even, and  they don't like those margins compared to what they're used to.  And they bail out and they bail out and they bail out and they bail out.  They don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is the Zune an ego move where they're just, it's not a market they really care or want  to be in, but they just hate it that Apple owns this market that has 80% market share  in this market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they care a lot about the movie market, right?  The movie download market.  And they pretty much own that in the sense of theirs is kind of the standard, you know,  until this recent announcement by Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they got to be scared, though, by this new iTunes.  I mean, Cinema Now is not anywhere near as good as the iTunes Music Store, do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know the iTunes, I don't know if the iTunes Music Store movie situation is that  good, Leo.  Really?  I mean, to be perfectly honest with you, it's 640 by 480 movies.  At least they're getting like DVD quality on the stuff that's coming through Cinema  Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're saying Cinema Now is better quality than the 640 by 480?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so.  I mean, at least they can do DVDs, you know, standard-ish wide format.  I haven't downloaded too many movies off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The 640 by 480 will do wide format, but what happens is you get black bars top and bottom,  so it's not 480.  You always get black bars.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So these are essentially, I don't think, what I'm saying is I don't think it's, I haven't  enough of the long format stuff, but unless they're downloading considerably faster, I'm  not sure they have a huge advantage.  Except for the fact that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're about two gigs.  They're about two gigs in the file size, which is, I think, comparable to Cinema Now, isn't  it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very comparable.  But how is it, is it two gigs like, you know, Cinema Now and Amazon's Unbox.  The difference between Amazon Unbox and Cinema Now outside of one-click shopping?  Impossible to tell.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only thing I have with Unbox and Cinema Now is the Windows DRM.  I mean, there's Apple DRM on it, but it seems a little bit easier to manipulate.  You can move it around.  You can have it on an iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can do that with, well, you can do that with the Windows DRM too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't, and neither of them will let you burn a DVD, which is, of course, what people...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually the Cinema Now, some of the titles are allowed to burn on the Cinema Now.  It depends on the copyright holder.  That's totally a decision by the copyright holder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what kind of towels are we talking about here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With the Cinema Now stuff and the Amazon Unbox.  Old crap?  No, actually a lot of new crap.  A tremendous amount.  Have you ever been to Cinema Now?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've really increased, for a while it was junk and they've really increased it.  The same thing will happen on iTunes though.  Right now it's only Disney because that's where Jobs has a relationship.  Yeah, relationship, he owns most of the stock.  But I think the same thing happened with the TV shows.  As soon as people see it working, they're going to move there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean it's also, because if you look at it, it's very similar to the Pay-Per-View.  It's amazing, I don't know if you guys, the Safeway by you guys have it yet, but the Safeway  down the street now has the dollar a night video rental kiosk.  Yeah, but I don't want to go out the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to get my movies now and I want them without...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well the problem is nobody's got movies now because you have to wait for a 2GB download  or at least for the first 25 or 30% to queue up before you can start watching the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can stream it within 10 minutes or 5 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, well, Unbox, I haven't checked Cinema Now in a while.  Cinema Now usually takes about 25 minutes.  Unbox was like, the first couple days Unbox was open was, I have to check it again now  that they've kind of settled in, but I was getting like 160k downloads.  It was taking hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple's ockomized, so you're going to get pretty good throughput unless they're gating  it and I don't think they are.  It seems like it's coming in pretty fast.  And Jobs claimed that you would be able to stream it within a couple of minutes at the  beginning of the download.  So that may be an advantage.  I mean I do think that from the point of view...  Claims?  Well, yeah, claims.  I have to try it.  I do think from the point of view of the viewer, that's the whole point is I don't want to  leave the house.  I want as close to the video on demand as possible and I want to keep it.  That's the problem with video on demand.  You can't keep it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's a lot of video titles that you can actually purchase.  But again, and this is like, remember last week Cory was on and you were kind of like,  why would anybody want to buy a video if it was DRM?  I mean it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's just...  Look, you're going to have DRM.  I'm not arguing with that.  The question is how onerous is going to be.  I think people will probably...  It's not going to put DVDs out of business.  It's just another way of buying.  I think...  I don't know.  I haven't bought anything yet from them.  I did buy some stuff from Cinema Now and I was unhappy with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that our connections are still too slow to make this that practical.  I mean I guess it's okay to download something overnight and then watch it the next day.  But gee, I mean we don't even have the kinds of speed that you need to really do this efficiently.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Spam House, a UK blacklist site was sued in Illinois court.  They're from the UK.  They didn't bother to respond.  The alleged spammer who sued them, 360 Insight, E360 Insight, won an $11.7 million judgment  just because it was a default judgment.  Spam House didn't show up.  But apparently Spam House has said, we don't have to pay.  We're in the UK.  Default judgments are not recognized in the UK.  So not only are we not going to show up for the trial, we're not going to pay him any

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can do this.  I mean, yeah, we could do some stuff here too.  But that reminds me of an old story.  Remember some years ago, at least five or six or maybe longer, where this guy was doing  the Nazi site in the United States and it was like, you know, going into Germany because  it was like on the internet and the guy decided to at least once in his life go out of the  country and float around.  He wasn't going to go to Germany, but he stopped off in Netherlands.  Big mistake.  They picked him up and threw him in a German jail.  Right.  You can never travel now.  Yeah, these guys basically can never travel.  So great.  OK, you have a lot of fun with your money in England.  I mean, you're going to have a lot of money you think you'd want to get out of the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Spam House.  This is one of the most popular black hole lists, if I think it's the correct way of  putting it, for people who maintain spam tools.  It's like saying, you know, we've declared a judgment against Apache and it's like,  what does that mean?  You know, it's basically a company that's commonly acknowledged online.  And again, this is from a bunch of the reporting I've read.  There's a lot of people are like, yeah, these guys are totally spammers, you know, and that's  why they're black hole.  But you know, they took advantage of the legal system to try to get out from under that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't work out for him.  Well, David Lindhart, who's the guy behind E360, claims victory.  He says Spam House is a fanatical vigilante organization and they've won.  Of course, it doesn't get him off the black hole list, which is probably what he really wanted.  You know, I have to say that black hole lists can be misused.  Absolutely.  You know, often you can't get a hold of these guys to appeal.  I've been black holed.  My old servers are black holed.  It's pretty tough to get off those lists because somebody had once used that IP address range  for spamming and then, you know, those IP address are kind of poisoned forever.  Yeah, that's a problem, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think the thing is, this is a funny kind of a situation.  I agree with you.  I think the black hole lists are bad and these guys should be sued for like, but not, I mean,  the fact that they got sued by a spammer instead of by some legitimate guy, because I've been  on black hole lists and we've seen them happen to all kinds of normal companies that just  for some reason or another, because of some, you know, because these things are automated  or who knows what, a lot of them are like mechanical, really screw up things.  And so it's kind of, you know, I think black hole sites, I'm not a big fan of them, to  be honest about it.  There's other ways of going about this.  But at the same time, the irony of having a spammer, you know, sue the guy makes it's  like, well, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Spam House says, we don't block.  This is kind of like the gun industry.  We know we don't block them.  ISPs block them.  We just make a list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ISPs don't have to adhere to the list.  In fact, you know, my ISP for a while turned as everybody wants to fight spam.  They turned on some of these black hole lists.  That's when I noticed that I was being black holed.  I never noticed it until then.  I couldn't get an email at Leoville and they turned it off because it frankly caused more  false positives than it was worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't know.  I mean, what do you guys think?  I mean, I mean, it's like there are better ways to fight for one thing.  They're never the guys.  I'm coming like Spam House or these guys, you know, are judgment proof.  Let's face that reality, first of all.  So that 11.7 million dollar fine is bogus.  Second thing is if they really get themselves into trouble, they'd get picked up if they  tried to travel out of the country, which is, you know, could happen.  And they probably can't afford to fight the suit like this, which is what really should  happen because a spammer shouldn't be able to sue anybody for anything.  Right.  I have mixed feelings about the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  The governor, the gubernator says you may not hold a cell phone to your ear while you  are driving.  The state of California has passed a law, $50 fine, making it an infraction to hold  a cell phone.  It doesn't say hold a cell phone to your ear.  It just says to hold a cell phone while driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you basically have to use it similar to the laws that are in place in New York  and other states where you-  Jersey has that law, actually, your home state.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Washington, D.C.  The simple fact is it's dangerous to talk on your cell phone while driving.  I will kill you.  So getting people's hands off the phones and onto steering wheels is going to make a big  difference in road service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's one you better work on.  I have to work on it.  It's not guttural enough.  Yeah, they talk like they're- yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, he says the law goes into effect in July in California.  Vehicle vehicles will continue to be able to use push-til-talk phones.  Push-to-talk phones, the next else thing, until 2011.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is like-  You know what you should be looking- what's kind of interesting about this story is that  if you start watching the metro news, the TV news, the local news, you're starting to  see a lot of stories emerge, which I believe is from a public relations company.  I can't prove this, but it just seems weird that they're all cropping up about how, oh,  to eat food while you're driving.  It's more dangerous to fiddle with the radio while you're driving.  It's just as dangerous.  People are putting makeup on and they're reading books while they're driving.  They're doing all these things.  So why is the cell phone being singled out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yet, I got a press release from Verizon Wireless congratulating the governor on his  foresight and praising the law and saying this is exactly the kind of law we wanted.  I think they're scared of their liability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the California Highway Patrol has maintained that cell phone use is a top cause of accidents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only time I've ever been rear-ended, the guy was on a phone and admitted it.  And I know when I'm on the phone, I drive like I'm drunk.  In fact, that's what the studies say.  Being on the phone is equivalent to being drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, so the other thing is what these bogus stories that the local news TV stations are  putting on, nobody like I was yesterday or the day before I'm driving around and there's  some woman and this is a really complicated traffic situation and she has to go out.  It's like a hard left turn to do.  You got to go out.  You got to go through some double yellows and there's a middle one of those middle turning  lanes.  It's five lanes total and you got and you got to first move out and stand out there  and then you got to make a left and ended moving traffic.  It's a really complicated maneuver.  And I'm watching this woman and she's on the phone the whole time.  Oh God, I hate that.  I'm thinking this woman is going to be killed.  I mean, can't she get off the damn phone just to turn?  I don't see anybody eating a hamburger or dipping French fries in the ketchup or doing  their makeup in a maneuver like that, but they'll be on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you don't want to interrupt the conversation.  It could be important.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Did you see the exploding think pad?  We talked last week about the fact you can't bring a Dell or a Mac on Virgin, Qantas or  Korean airlines.  Well, you can't bring toothpaste on any airline.  But you can't bring a Dell or Mac laptop.  But apparently you could bring a ThinkPad.  Well now, according to Engadget, a ThinkPad exploded at LAX causing a bomb scare.  Passerby stared aghast or fled crying, terrorist.  The ThinkPad apparently burst in flame.  Fortunately, a United employee busted out a fire extinguisher and put the thing out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, I'd like to have somebody go to this website that shows a picture of  the thing that blew up.  Yeah, have you seen it?  Yeah, there's a photo on Engadget and it doesn't look like a ThinkPad to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's not black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's dusty.  It's not black now because it's covered with all sorts of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess they sprayed it, I guess, to put it out.  But maybe.  Yeah, yeah, it has an extinguisher.  It has a lot of funny looking, the back of it just doesn't look right to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at it, Patrick.  It's in the...  Is that a ThinkPad?  Patrick uses a ThinkPad.  He should recognize it.  That sure looks like a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has a lot of tags and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what they put on the back.  Departments and jeez.  I know, that's funny.  There's a lot of junk on the back of a lot of PC laptops.  They're not smooth.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hold on a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to get this going wrong.  Yeah, check it, Patrick.  You're our ThinkPad expert.  Let's even get Kevin Rose on the line here because...  You and Kevin use...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, Kevin's gone to Max.  I use Toshiba's and a Toshiba hasn't blown up yet, so I'm a happy camper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yet.  What's interesting is that they checked and these batteries were not in a recall of any  kind.  IBM, Lenovo, not yet flagged for bad batteries.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, how about this for a concept?  I mean, I don't want to get too carried away with this kind of thinking, but is it possible  that somebody set this up?  You know, either...  Oh, yeah, sure.  Absolutely.  It's like a phony deal.  More than possible.  Blow it up so they can take a little pressure off of the Dell Sony people, Sony Dell Apple?  Could be.  And by the way, how come a Sony laptop hasn't blown up?  Yeah, maybe they don't use Sony batteries in Sony laptops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they save the good stuff for themselves.  It's probably an IBM.  That looks like it, doesn't it?  That blows to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, it's probably a T-42.  It's just covered with the foam from the fire extinguisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was thinking, yeah, they probably sprayed it with something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wednesday, September 13th, 1956.  The first hard drive was introduced by IBM.  It's 50 years ago this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I went to the anniversary.  It was over at the Computer History Museum.  You did?  Yeah.  And that museum, by the way, anyone who's in the area, it's in Mountain View, is a tremendous  place to visit.  Mainly because they have these old, they have a whole bunch of these old mainframes.  Did you see the core memory?  They have a big old core memory.  They have a bunch of core memory.  But the thing about these mainframes is these aren't like, you know, mainframes from the  60s.  These are mainframes from the 40s.  Yeah, that's cool.  They have a Johnniac, which I thought was kind of interesting.  Is that ENIAC's little brother?  Johnniac was like, built by the same guys.  I think it was a one-of-a-kind thing.  It was built for, and it was named after John Neumann.  And they have it there.  I think it's a one-of-a-kind that they had this rescue from a junk dealer.  But it's a really great place.  But anyway, so I was there and they had what was cool about it, besides the fact that,  you know, they had some fairly depressing speeches, was...  I remember 50 years ago.  Yeah, the speeches were depressing because of the nature of what these guys are perceiving  is that they had a futurist, a guy from Hitachi, used to be with IBM.  And his idea of the future was that you're never going to be doing anything but working  24-7.  Oh, that's great.  You get to see everything.  You take notes while you're at dinner and you get to see your children's first walk,  but you get to see it remotely.  It's like, come on.  It sounds like a miserable life.  I thought it was the most depressing speech I've ever heard from anyone.  The future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll be able to work 80 hours a week.  It's going to be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what was cool is they had an original Ramac running.  That's the hard drive.  That's the original one.  The original one.  It was running.  It was running.  So the thing that's weird about it, I didn't know this until I was at this, but I never  thought about it much, but it has all these platters, right?  The thing's about five or six feet high.  It's the size of a refrigerator.  Yeah, and it's got five megabytes.  It's a huge thing with all these platters.  Five megabytes.  Yeah.  And it's like five megabytes.  It's spinning around at some high speed.  And the head to read the disks is one head that comes out, goes down, goes in, comes  out, goes down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Group put of 500k per minute.  If you're lucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Compared to, you know, I guess it actually would have been slow compared to card entry,  like throwing a bunch of cards into a stack and running it through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's why for a long time, I mean, seek time, we talked about seek time as a  hard drive statistic.  It was important.  If you had a four minute seek time, that was relevant.  Good Lord.  Finding the data.  Well, happy birthday, hard drive.  And you know, Gordon Bell and Gwen Bell, I think Gwen was very instrumental in starting  up the computer history museum.  They did a great job.  We had a number of people on the screensavers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, she managed to get a lot of this stuff collected.  But if you go there, I'm telling you, anybody in the country that listens to the or in the  world that listens to this podcast, if you get, if you're in Mountain View, you have  to just go there to look at these, this old gear.  It's really interesting.  If you're, if you like computers at all, isn't it in one of the old hangers for the old blimp  hangers?  No, no, those days are over.  It moved to a fine facility.  I would like a really fancy place right off of shoreline.  Oh, I haven't been there.  In Mountain View.  It moved about four years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.  Shows how on top of it I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, I was shocked.  I haven't been there either.  Last time I was there was at Moffett Field when it was in the hangar.  And I went and I was stunned.  Good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They raised a lot of money, I guess, and that put it together.  So we talked last week about the HP scandal and predicted at that time that heads would  roll that most likely the scapegoat would end up being chairman of the board, chairwoman  of the board, Patricia Dunn.  In fact, she has announced her resignation effective following the next board meeting,  which is not till January, right about when Vista comes out, January 18th, 2007.  She's in trouble, of course, because of the leak investigation she inaugurated into not  only her own board, but into nine journalists using pretexting to get phone numbers and  phone records of these people.  Hey, you know John Markoff pretty well.  Have you talked to him, John, about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he's.  Is he upset?  Hey, I'm not going to say anything, but I believe that he and some of these other journalists  that were pretext out like this are going to sue the HP scandal.  Going to cost them a lot of money.  And that fact that Patricia Dunn is, she's quitting the chairman's job or chairwoman's  job, but she's staying on the board.  I mean, I think it's unconscionable that this company has gone in this direction.  It's just inexcusable.  And you know, they're leaving themselves open for all kinds of issues and they all have  deep pockets.  Every one of those people on the board.  I think that there's a lot of problems that are going to result.  This is an unresolved situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's going to be replaced by HP president and CEO Mark Hurd as chairman of the board,  but still on the board.  Wow.  And you know, it's still up in the air whether the state of California is going to go after  them in a criminal case indictments.  Billy Lockyer says something.  A crime has been committed.  We're just trying to figure out whether it's actionable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's going to be interesting to see how the lawyers handle this because I think  a lot of this has to do with the, you know, let's take a look at the lawyer that keeps  coming up in the news here and he comes up with this HP case, which is Larry Sonsini.  A lot of people are, you know, he's also one of the guys whose name keeps cropping up when  it comes to these stock options problems that have occurred.  Well they're the big, that's a big Silicon Valley.  It's the big firm.  It's the big boys.  But I mean, they're the ones who run Silicon Valley, but they're, I don't think this is  good publicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not for them.  Do you guys think this is really that uncommon?  I mean, getting caught obviously is, but do you guys think this kind of stuff is that  uncommon in large corporations?  I think it is uncommon.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a dumb thing to do.  It is uncommon.  There's other things to do besides spying on your own board.  There's other things to do besides spying on journalists.  The last time that some company got their ischneringer was General Motors when they put  this private investigator on Nader and it became a huge problem for the company that  lasted for decades.  Every company knows that this can happen.  The fallback or the pushback on this is extremely, it's an extreme situation, especially in the  day and age that we have with the privacy concerns.  This is one of the biggest blunders anyone could possibly make in a million years.  Yeah, if you got away with it, fine, but gee gosh, you didn't get away with it, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It clearly shows incompetence on the part of the board, right?  I mean, if she was doing this, she should know better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's naiveté more than incompetence.  I mean, it's crazy.  Why would you put yourself at this sort of risk?  I mean, the public relations fallout from this must be unbelievable.  I can't imagine what meetings are going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ironically, it didn't hurt the stock market.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it won't hurt the stock for a while.  It doesn't hurt the market.  It's a long-term problem.  I mean, you get, you know, already there's jokes floating around.  I mean, it's like, you know, it's not going to help them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  E-Donkey out of business, they are one of the big, along with, you know, Broxter and Morpheus,  they're one of the big peer-to-peer file sharing networks.  The RIAA went after them hard, you know, saying, we're going to sue you.  They, E-Donkey actually paid, it says, according to Ars Technica, $30 million to not be sued.  And it shut the door and put up a sign saying, don't steal.  If you steal music, you're breaking the law, which is what the record industry makes them do.  We've seen that before.  That sign before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like, just another one bites the dust.  So Kazaa coughed up $100 million.  I think the record industry's found a new way to actually to make money that might be a little better than selling records.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and another way that the artists get screwed.  You know, Leo, before this story ran, I never heard of E-Donkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it was very popular.  In fact, it was one of the more popular sites when we were talking about these things on the tech TV.  And I think it's, you know, it's one of those things where there are fashions with the kids.  But this was very fashionable, wasn't it, Patrick?  I think it was very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  E-Donkey was extremely popular.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this shows you.  Yeah, it shows you.  But you know, you can plug these things up and it doesn't matter.  There are still plenty of ways to get music illegally.  I don't think they can ever plug them all up.  Maybe that's their plan, though.  This is one that scared me.  Are you familiar with Tor servers?  The idea is they're anonymizing servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Zero Knowledge.  Is it EFF project or is EFF just pushing really hard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  EFF has a Tor site, and that's why I'm not...  It's tor.eff.org.  It stands for the Onion Router.  And it is very much like Zero Knowledge.  It's an onion of servers.  And you anonymize by hopping through random numbers of servers  to get where you're going.  Little scary.  Why?  Germany.  Why is it scary?  Germany, during a child porn crackdown, seized Tor servers.  And they're looking at logs.  German prosecutors have been trying to locate an anonymous child porn  server by seizing the Tor servers and looking at the logs.  Now, I don't know if the Tor servers...  I'm sure they do have automated processes that delete the logs.  But it makes you wonder.  You use these Tor servers with the presumption  that you're absolutely anonymous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to always wonder about anything like this,  whether it's a honeypot or not.  I mean, you always have to make that consideration.  Tor's not.  I really...  Yeah, I know.  But you have to wonder about anything.  It seems to me that if you're doing something...  I mean, you're best bet if you want to do this kind of stuff.  And I'm not recommending it to anyone.  But get a big giant antenna and then some wireless spoof your Mac  and link into some guy in the office.  You know, pretend to be him.  I mean, there's nothing else you can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, none of us are saying child porn is a good thing.  And child porn is terrible.  And these people should be tracked down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you can track them down using old fashioned techniques called,  you know, you have somebody, you know, kind of get into the ring  and then find out who everybody is.  And it takes a while.  It takes some actual work.  And then you bust them all.  I mean, they've done this over and over again.  It's not that hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I guess the moral is for those using Tor servers for legitimate,  you know, privacy reasons might start to consider whether...  How private is it after all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, how does it work?  I mean, what do you do?  How do you find one?  If I wanted to use a Tor, it's called a Tor server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The onion router.  It's tor.eff.org.  And the idea is you'll run a little program that will automatically,  a little proxy program that will automatically hand off your traffic  through servers and a number of servers,  randomized servers all over the planet.  So the theory is that if you do enough switchbacks...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So how does somebody track this?  It doesn't sound like a nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only way to do it is if you had the logs of enough Tor servers,  you could piece it together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but at some point...  You'd have to have a lot.  You'd have to have a lot of those and it couldn't be a break in the chain,  it seems to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this is basically then,  and the zero-knowledge folks when they were still doing it,  before they shut the servers down because they couldn't make any money off it,  what they had was hundreds of servers connected out on the web in various countries.  And you would use basically an anonymous token to purchase an ID.  They would use that ID, which couldn't be connected to you by any financial purchase  of any sort and you would log into a local server.  And then the way they had it set up was so that your request,  your IP request, your HTTP request would bounce through as many countries.  Like basically, if you were in the US,  it would bounce you to like Sweden and then Holland and then to like Mexico.  And then what they would do is they would bounce it through a bunch of European countries  with really extreme privacy laws to make it as difficult as possible to chain it down.  And even if somebody did manage to go through the years and years of court battles  it would take to track down the ID,  they still wouldn't actually be able to rig the ID up with somebody.  Yeah.  Unless they happen to nab you and your computer and your ID at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's either prosecutors that don't really understand Tor  or it's somebody trying to send a chilling effect, a message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it's an interesting side.  This gets back to the whole argument like,  well, nobody really needs privacy if they're not doing something wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's well, I mean, a lot of what the tour is about is just protecting your privacy on websites.  You know, people, you know, with network analysis and so forth,  I mean, people can really kind of draw a pretty big, pretty good picture of what you're up to.  And I'm more about marketers than I am about government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's the market. Yeah, but there's all kinds of worries out there about privacy.  I mean, these stalkers, people who want to kill you.  You bet.  I mean, the if somebody wants to make sure you vote Republican or Democrat,  I mean, there's I mean, there's a million things that they can do with this kind of information.  It's gotten really when you look at it, it's got little to do with whether you're doing something wrong  or not in these porn maniacs, sickos or whatever you want to call them.  I mean, a pretty small group that, you know, they target. Sure.  But I mean, it's everybody is susceptible to being, you know,  kind of spied upon and in ways that aren't necessarily positive for a person.  You know, I've always said this, that, you know, if you if people want to say, well,  if you're not doing something wrong, what about this situation?  You're working for company A and you want to go work for company B.  So you have a couple of meetings, but these things, you know, are in somewhere.  You can be tracked and found out that you're going to have these meetings.  You may or may not get that job.  But if you don't get the job and company A finds out about it, you're toast.  I mean, this is not doing anything wrong.  I'm just looking for a job.  How's that doing anything wrong?  It's like, you know, and but meanwhile, of course, you're never going to get promoted again.  And your life is ruined, perhaps.  But that's the kind of thing that goes on.  And again, if all the companies that do these sorts of things,  high tech companies are really into spying on their employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you shouldn't be using our Internet connection at the office to do your job.  I mean, John, that's disrespectful of the organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In a sense, you could also track people's home stuff and who knows what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, whistleblowers.  There's lots of reasons why anonymity is part is an important part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Using the connection at the office to look for a job.  But the fact of the matter is, if everything's going to be wide open  and they can track anything you're doing and nobody cares, then where are you going to do it?  You can't do it at home. You can't do it anywhere.  You have to you can't have their private meetings and those can be backdoor.  I mean, right now, one of the restaurant reservation systems, supposedly,  has a back door in it and people can like put two and two together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then your insurance rates are going up.  One too many cream sauces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's you got that. There's another problem.  There's a problem right there. I got to be careful.  You know, you actually there is an insurance angle on all this stuff.  I've always felt that way about the Safeway Club card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I never know that sucker.  Why do I want so much more for your food?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you don't. You just tell them to use the house card.  Oh, you can do that.  You do that in any store in the country.  I've done it everywhere.  You don't have your car. You say, I don't.  I forgot my car. Can you use the house card?  And they always have a card right there by the cash register.  And they'll be glad to swipe it in or the person in their own.  Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, I'm surprised you didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we have learned something on this podcast.  Use the house. It makes it worth listening.  You know, that is fantastic.  Yeah. So that whole thing is a scam.  Oh, my God. Well, it's obvious what they're up to.  And I don't do it.  But it's kind of depressing when you look at the Safeway price.  You know, the club card price is four dollars.  And if you're not a member, it's nine dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like, well, what are they?  I mean, they're basically they're trying to track people's buying habits.  Right. And then they what's so nefarious about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, nothing, unless you're eating hummus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nothing. Patrick, what if they take what if they take that information  and give it to the insurance companies?  Well, that's right.  As far as we know, they're not doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As soon as they start doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you know they're not doing it?  They find start fine tuning.  Well, how come your rates went up? Well, I don't know.  Well, we we've done some research and whatever.  I mean, this information, they're not just doing it for their own benefit.  I used to be in the mailing list business.  And I'm telling you, what you want to do is you collect this data  because you can sell it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We used to be in the mailing list business.  Yeah. Were you ever in the spam business?  Is this the real reason? No, I wish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wouldn't be here now.  I'd be on Monaco.  I got those because I got friends in the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When were you in the mailing list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't know. I was in the mailing list business in the late 70s  when I was doing when I was selling software.  I want to decide when you make most of your money off the mailing list.  This is when you see that computer professor, that guy that's on TV all the time.  He's in the mail. He's not in the computer.  Oh, the video professor.  He's in the mailing list business.  That's why he will give you money.  It's a by the way, this thing these numbers, but the way  the way it is for high tech numbers in the mailing list business.  I don't know what they are currently because I haven't kept up.  But I'll tell you this, when he's offering to give you your money back  plus five or ten dollars cash, if you're unsatisfied,  that means he's making a lot of money from your name.  That's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The one of the most valuable mailing lists in the world used to be here  in the United States used to be the one for this nose hair clipper  that they would sell in the back of like men's magazines or Rolling Stone and stuff.  And you laugh. But anybody that is so timid, they won't buy a nose hair clipper  at the local at the local drugstore.  That used to be one of the grails of mailing lists because you buy everything by mail order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's probably true.  If you'd buy a nose hair clipper, mail it or you'd buy anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's not even about no, because there's don't just a nose hair clipper.  The the it's more about it.  It's actually about somebody who's like that self conscious,  but won't actually buy the stuff in public is what it's about.  Well, as I'm saying, yeah, they'll buy a lot of mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'll say, yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going to do a lot of reticent buying.  So but I got a question. Is it still valuable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, doesn't everybody just throw out this junk?  I mean, we're talking about mail, US mail, junk mail that you get in your post  your post office box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not what it used to be, I can say.  But I'll tell you this, if that guy if that guy is offering to give you five or ten dollars  plus your money back, somebody's giving them money and shipping.  That name has to be worth it.  And the total cost of that whole deal has got to be around 20 bucks.  That means the name itself is worth about 20 bucks or 40 or 50 or 100.  Because I mean, it's minimum 20 is what I'm saying.  And, you know, in other words, you can sell that list over or rent it.  It's a list or rental. You don't sell these lists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I have a post office box and right next to the post office box  is is a big, I mean, big giant recycling bin.  And I watch people at the post office box.  The first thing they do, they open the thing, they take it out.  There's tons of junk mail in there.  They immediately go, they sort through it, throw everything in the bin.  The Postal Service might as well just recycle it back into the boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's nobody even looks at that stuff.  I throw a lot of stuff out the same way.  It's not assuming the mailing list is, or I'm sorry,  the direct marketing business mail order.  It doesn't assume that every single person keeps it.  You only need to sell two percent of the total.  So you have 100. Is that the is that the figure?  That's the break even number.  Two percent. And so too.  So you need to sell two people out of 100 on the on the proposition.  And then you're in business.  And so, yeah, Patrick, do you ever get the feeling that there's this whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hidden secret agenda that's going on in life and that that you just  I feel like I know nothing about life, that all of this stuff is  people like John are like going here.  I know what's really going on.  I'm missing the whole point of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It isn't the whole point, first of all.  And second of all, I hope not.  John's saying here is news to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a subtext.  And you know, I'm missing the whole subtext.  You're missing the subtext.  You're not missing the point of life.  You're missing the subtext, which is where all the money is, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I mean, I'm missing the money.  Here I am trying to tell people to go to the Dell commercials on the on the website.  And then meanwhile, I should be selling their mailing list or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but it depends on, you know, I've been trying to get you into this  for years, Leo, I'm such a fool.  I got to know you.  Leo had this huge list at Tech TV that was just this  is just enormous thing he collected.  He's managed to do this over the years.  And I'm always thinking about as a gold mine list.  I mean, I know what these things are worth.  I mean, they're worth the life.  You know, I didn't know there was.  I was always thinking ten bucks used to be an old number for like,  what's a name worth in terms of what you could get out of it?  You can get compensated about ten bucks per name over time.  And that's why they talked about eyeballs and all these things  during the dot com era. It was all about that.  But I think if this guy's given away this video, professors giving away  ten bucks plus all those expense, you know, all the disks and everything else.  I mean, it's got to have gone beyond ten bucks.  It must be close to twenty bucks.  And I've heard that twenty dollars is what a cable subscriber's worth,  or maybe twenty five.  Then I've heard numbers like 30, 40, 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm surprised, though. I thought people were smarter now.  And, you know, I just didn't think people really paid any attention to junk mail.  We certainly saw a small percentage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is, is, is, is, you know, John said it twice.  It's not about it's not about the volume.  It's about the small number.  That's why spam is so popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do thank the folks at Dell for providing us  with the wherewithal to get my nose waxed and whatever else.  Patrick wants to do for his Kiltage.  Dell actually has a great deal for a back to school computer.  The dimension B110.  We've got a link at the Leo's Picks page on Twit.TV and also the Inspiron.  Is it Inspiron or Inspiron?  Inspiron. Inspiron.  Is it? You sure?  Well, does anybody know? That's the question.  I've never heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I covered notebooks for a bunch of years, and if every Dell employee  and for, you know, OK, in so I called it Inspiron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Inspiron, the E1405 big wide screen, very light, very nice  in all the specs you want, including the Core 2 Duo.  But for prices, you must go to Twit.TV slash Dell.  That's the Leo Picks page.  And thank you, Dell, for your support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you're not on anymore on my list.  I'm not on your list anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. You saw off the list.  Is this the good list or the bad list?  Remember, remember that John used to be on Microsoft's enemy list.  No, you know, I don't think I ever was.  You weren't because didn't you were saying Ballmer had a blackboard  in his office with journalists that were, you know, bad people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The guy that worked there, it was a PR guy that worked there named Marty Tauker.  Oh, Marty Tauker.  And he was and he was enamored with the Nixon administration.  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't make any less funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he had a big board in his office.  Now, I have to say that this second, it was one of the guys  from the New York Times that told me this and people have confirmed it.  He had a big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute.  I I know who could confirm this.  And he's I see him right now.  He's on Skype. Bill McCrone, former  editor in chief of PC magazine.  Let's well, let's just let's conference him in.  Hey, Bill.  Say, guys, you can you can confirm or deny this.  You ever hear this Marty Tauker story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As a matter of fact, I pushed my way into his office  against his attempts to keep me out to get a free T-shirt.  And I saw the three boards that were marked.  OK, needs work and deep.  Oh, really? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a John. This is perfect.  We have confirmation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, most of my stories are accurate.  I don't believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like this is the moment in Manhattan, you know, where Woody Allen pulls  Marshall McLuhan out of the line.  Well, no, actually, let me.  So we well, I got Millicron.  It's not Marshall. So, Bill, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Since we got Millon, let me ask you since I have never seen the board,  I only heard about did you get to check out any of the names?  Oh, yeah. Who is on the list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, let's see.  PC magazine itself was on the OK list.  And I told Marty that if that was the case, we had a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're a real journalist, you don't want to be on the OK list.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's see, Dvorak was on the needs work list  and the infamous Will Zuckman was on the deep.  Oh, yeah. Well, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Zachman used to just hound Microsoft to, you know, 24.  Every column was just the same basic column about how screwed up Microsoft was.  And so I guess that's why we'd end up.  Did you see anybody else on the needs work work list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, the the list had probably half a dozen names on it.  And I could not tell you any more.  John, you're gratified, though, to know that you needed work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure that's a very great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need to work. But you know, I always need work.  You know, anyone has work for me.  I'm looking for jobs.  So Marty had that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always need work. Maybe that's what it meant.  All right, Bill. Hey, thank you.  And we'll see you next week.  You're glad to have your confirmation on on that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's my pleasure.
