And so I was listening to it and there's Liz Gaines doing interviews and stuff. I said, Liz.  So I was really pleased. We've plugged this a couple of times because I think it's a great app.  It's a great website. But more importantly for me, it's an echo skill.

So that's where you're going to end up. That's where we're going to start.  And we're going to probably bum around Europe for. Why ever leave Venice?  How come Mike's got two pairs of glasses?

What's the point of these? I don't understand. They're bad.  So anyway, good to have you. Thank you. And good luck in Venice. Thank you.  I always when I'm when I go to Venice, that beautiful Italian town that's floating,  I think it must be hard to live here like harder even than Manhattan.  Right. Because you have you have to walk everywhere or take a boat.  Shopping must be murder. Yeah. On one of those little boats with the bags.  Yeah. That'd be horrible. People who live in Venice really want to live there.

Start time: 326.88
End time: 331.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, we tell they have self-driving gondolas.  It's going to be a totally different thing. It's going to change everything.

Start time: 332.38
End time: 343.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So tell us about 60 DB Liz, as long as we got that conversation started.  Because to me, this is kind of the next step in what podcasting started.

Start time: 343.42
End time: 400.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  60 DB takes over from I think podcasting is great.  But there's all sorts of other ways that you want to listen to audio.  And it doesn't have to be like an hour long conversation between a couple of people.  Like, that's just one way. Those are great. But  I think I heard the stat in our pitch deck the other day that like terrestrial radio  has 90 million more weekly active users than Facebook.  So there is something bigger than Facebook and it's people listening to stuff.  And so, yeah, 60 DB is like a personalized playlist of news.  So instead of like getting in your car and listening to like.  Radio technology that has not changed in forever, that's, you know, you turn into one channel,  you're 10 minutes late for their show. So what? You're not interested.  So what? This is just like a personalized playlist of usually like five to seven minute clips.  So it's like a show that's edited for you. And then it never stops.  Yeah. And you ask Alexa to start 60 DB again and you keep on going with your channel.

Start time: 400.88
End time: 407.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And does it? I'm sorry to interrupt, Leo, but does it sort of automatically customize itself?

Start time: 407.28
End time: 425.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You customize it. It's like Tinder. You swipe and then you hear.  No, really? Yeah, that's great. I can swipe.  Yeah, you can say next and we. Oh, yeah.  On the echo, you could say next. Yeah. Like if you another.  So that was a long way to explain it.  But another way to say it is like our founders came from Netflix and NPR.  So what is Netflix plus NPR? Right. And it's personalized.

Start time: 425.68
End time: 430.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you do when you first sign up, there's an onboarding experience where you pick categories  that you're interested in. Yeah.

Start time: 430.86
End time: 441.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And like you get exposed to stuff you would never hear on the radio.  I had a barbecue podcast the other day and I was like, this is awesome.  I've never heard this on the news.  I'm much more educated on sports and markets and all sorts of things than I would normally be.

Start time: 441.74
End time: 444.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just signed up while we were doing it. Well, it's free.

Start time: 444.36
End time: 450.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the monetization strategy? You can put ads in there.  What is the you're doing content for this to you're doing unique content for?

Start time: 450.50
End time: 456.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think we don't have this yet.  But like, how does Netflix make money? Right.

Start time: 456.94
End time: 463.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're probably going to do that. I would subscribe.  I'd pay for this. Absolutely.  And by the way, twit bits are on here, show up on here.

Start time: 464.10
End time: 466.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they come up in my feed a couple of times a week.

Start time: 466.24
End time: 470.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're short form. So are you optimizing?  There's both size. Look.

Start time: 470.14
End time: 475.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's quick hits. These are five to 10 minutes.  Right. Or even shorter sometimes.  And then in depth is longer. Yeah.

Start time: 476.02
End time: 502.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we do both. We're getting better at doing in depth because like,  I think at first we were like, people don't realize that short form is great.  But then it turned out that most people who download like early adopters  tend to already know about digital audio.  So we have to be a good podcast app, too.  So now we're going to be like both short form and podcast.  We actually think of yourself as a podcast app because like you don't want to switch  apps just to listen to something longer.  So we're going we're trying to give you both of those.  And actually, we had a redesign go live on Saturday that has both of them now.  Oh, interesting.

Start time: 503.22
End time: 513.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The UI was really good.  Like, I just signed up just while we were talking about this.  And it like had me, you know, I was in used, you know, my Twitter account,  gave my email and picked like three things.  And then so, yeah.

Start time: 513.92
End time: 522.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you can put the app on your phone so you get in the car.  You can listen on the app, but you can also do it on your Echo,  which to me is mostly how I consume it.  I get up in the morning. I say, yeah, and hopefully like cars will have voice

Start time: 522.64
End time: 526.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  interfaces soon. I mean, someday our technology is never as fast as you want it.

Start time: 526.92
End time: 534.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're really onto something because not interacting with the app  while I'm listening is really important to me because I'm usually cooking or doing  dishes or I'm taking a hike.

Start time: 534.68
End time: 544.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some of the inspiration for this month, NPR won.  NPR had this insight originally with their app, right, where you would just say,  listen, and it would play your NPR shows one after the other.

Start time: 545.00
End time: 553.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, which is great and pretty similar.  But limited.  We have a bit more variety, right?  Because NPR is by its own content.  Yeah, I use the NPR one app.

Start time: 554.90
End time: 560.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So actually just and I'd heard of 6Db, but hadn't downloaded it yet.  Yeah, check it out. We're brand new.

Start time: 560.80
End time: 565.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But like I mean, I think it's actually really good for being a three month old  product.

Start time: 565.18
End time: 567.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you're working as a journalist for them. You're doing journalism.

Start time: 567.52
End time: 603.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Thank you for letting me talk so much about what I'm doing.  I would be happy to tell you.  Yeah, I'm doing I'm helping places like the Atlantic or Wired or Politico  create more audio content and then that fits into our feed because they write  great stories, but like not everyone wants to read stories.  And hopefully they'll start doing that themselves.  I also do some more original stuff like I really wanted to cover the AI versus  humans poker tournament.  So I like found a reporter who went to that called them.  I wanted to cover the Hyperloop competition.  So I found a reporter who went to that.  So sometimes I'm driving it to because that journalistic instinct is really

Start time: 603.48
End time: 606.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  important, I think, to giving it a full stack of stuff.

Start time: 606.38
End time: 627.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, like the idea of engaging other journalists and stuff they're doing and  turn these into audio stories, too, because we've done I can't even I've lost  count of how many times we've started a podcast and it always peters out after a  year or so. Right.  And but we we know that it's a good way to engage the audience.  And so I think there's a market there for to engage with publishers and turn more  of what they do into audio.

Start time: 628.20
End time: 631.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have to be insane to get into the podcast.  You would kind of not.

Start time: 632.50
End time: 664.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, I kick myself that I didn't think of this because we have the skill to put  together audio feeds.  And but there are a lot of people and we get approached frequently by people like  Tech Republic, not you didn't, but others who say, hey, we want to do a show.  You know how to do this. How do we do it?  Can we partner with you?  This is actually a better way to do it.  And and frankly, there's a monetization plan.  I don't know if that's one that you're considering, but the the ability to put the  Atlantic on the radio has got to be valuable to them.  They don't have a you know, actually, they do have podcasts, but but they don't

Start time: 664.52
End time: 688.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  put it on for stuff. Yeah.  Do you know a lot of places don't have and and reporters don't realize how easy it  is to talk about their stuff if you have somebody like you on the other side.  And so I call them like five minutes after they finish the story.  It's fresh in their head and they can, you know, tell me a few stats.  I can edit in a few clips.  I am a month into being an audio producer.  So I'm getting faster at it.  Yeah, I've been I've been working some nights, but hopefully I'll get quick at it.

Start time: 689.18
End time: 722.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, me. Well, that's a big plug for 60 to be.  But I think it's worth plugging because I think this and and, you know,  it doesn't really help us particularly.  We far prefer you use our apps or listen on our website and hear the whole show.  But at least it's an introduction to people who have never heard it.  They can hear a short bit and say, oh, that's why we make it.  It's right. We make them and we put them on YouTube  so that people can down or in our websites so people can download something quick  and kind of get a sense of what they might be hearing  with the three hour episode, which we're about to do. Yeah.  Oh, is that it?  Well, we just spent half an hour on 60 DB.  I think it's getting longer all the time.

Start time: 722.60
End time: 724.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to try it on my way back to the city.

Start time: 724.44
End time: 801.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really fun.  I actually wanted to ask you, Mike, because you wrote a good article.  Where was that was computer world?  Where did you write that about Twitter? Yes. Yes. Computer world.  I just read that this morning.  Twitter announced this week that they are going to.  A couple of things happened.  First of all, Twitter had its financial results.  Yes. Not good. They weren't great.  They only had two million new users in a three month period.  And I can test that.  Well, I don't know how many of those are.  I would bet half of those, as is often the case with Twitter,  our spam or fake accounts.  So a million, maybe compare that to what was it?  83 million that Facebook got in the same quarter. Right.  And they they have done nothing.  Back going back to their previous CEO, Dick Costello, who said,  it's it's on me.  We haven't done a good job dealing with abuse.  We've done a terrible job. We're going to do better.  And they haven't.  And now, you know, you've got Jack.  They tried to find a buyer, Jack Dorsey, the CEO,  apparently interested at Williams, one of the founders, not interested.  Nevertheless, the board encouraged them to find a buyer.  Was it the other way around?  I've wanted to sell injected and I can't remember.  But they've had nobody to buy it. It's a toxic brand.  Because I think that's the problem.  You point that out in your article that no advertiser wants to be  in an environment where you don't know what's going on.

Start time: 802.04
End time: 808.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't want to be sandwiched between two bits of hate speech. Right.  You don't want your brand there.  But Twitter's well, go ahead and say it.

Start time: 808.00
End time: 810.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just going to say Twitter's never been more relevant. Exactly.

Start time: 811.12
End time: 823.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it should. We need it desperately.  I'm so afraid that they're going to fail and fail and fail.  And then they're going to sell it to some company that's going to strip it  for parts and like just, you know, milk it for whatever all it's worth.  And it's going to be this lost opportunity.

Start time: 823.86
End time: 834.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, then that was even the rumor is that some hedge funder  or investment group would buy it and do exactly that.  What you really want is almost a journalistic entity to buy it. Right.

Start time: 835.18
End time: 847.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I my my fantasy is that some well-meaning billionaire buys it as a  as a Jeff Bezos type and says, well, maybe well-meaning, I said.  I think Jeff's done pretty well with the Washington Post.

Start time: 847.24
End time: 849.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He really has. He's done a great job.  I think he deserves credit.

Start time: 849.78
End time: 887.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And he does have his own space program.  So respect for Jeff Bezos.  But but but see the I wanted to continue to be what it is minus the harassment.  Yeah. And and there's one thing that they do that they refuse to change  that I think is the whole problem. And it's this.  So if you go to if you go to Facebook, Google Plus, Pinterest, Instagram,  every social network except Twitter,  if somebody replies to something you post, you can delete it.  Twitter has refused to do that.  So if somebody puts hate speech as a reply to my thing, I can't do anything.

Start time: 887.72
End time: 896.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can actually delete it.  I can't delete theirs.  But you can delete it from other sites, from every other site, every other site.

Start time: 896.26
End time: 919.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's why Twitter has a special reputation for harassment,  because there's nothing you have to go ahead and hand to Twitter and say,  please, please remove this person.  They're clearly a troll.  The whole account is nothing about except harassment.  But then every time you build an anti harassment feature,  they build a better harasser.  So they figure out how to get around these things.  They have some death threats.  They say, oh, somebody should kill you.

Start time: 919.54
End time: 958.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's like there's a technical issue with this.  That's the same reason they don't add edit.  Everybody says, oh, you should be able to edit your talk.  But the problem is that with.  Yeah, with Twitter, once a tweet goes out, deleting it doesn't really delete it.  You know, it's because there's third party programs, there's databases,  there's the Library of Freaking Congress.  There's people archiving Twitter all the time.  So once, you know, and somebody should tell the US government that once you put a tweet out,  it's there permanently.  Right.  So you could delete.  I guess it'd be better than nothing.  They've announced some initiatives this week, one of which.

Start time: 958.82
End time: 982.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Three of them.  Tell us about the three initiatives.  OK, so one of them is that they remove problematic results from search.  So if people are tweeting something that's harassment or hate speech or low quality content  and you search for it, you can't find it.  It won't show up in search.  And they base that on the wrong criteria.  The criteria that they use is if somebody's been blocked by a lot of people or muted by a lot of people,  their posts don't come in.

Start time: 982.54
End time: 984.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Humans are better at this than machines.

Start time: 984.86
End time: 989.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is your point in the article.  Yeah.  Was it humans are better than machines at this?

Start time: 989.38
End time: 1002.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And understanding the nuances of language.  But to the search point, now this becomes a source of harassment.  So, for example, lots of people have blocked you, Leo, and now you're not going to show up in search results.  Right.  And so now they're...

Start time: 1002.50
End time: 1006.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because Twitter will misinterpret that signal as a harassment.  It's a dumb signal.

Start time: 1006.78
End time: 1023.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because the haters...  What would be better?  What would be better would be for everything to show up in search results and then every tweet or in every reply to your tweets has two buttons.  One is delete this reply.

Start time: 1024.34
End time: 1025.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For me.  For you.

Start time: 1026.12
End time: 1040.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it deletes a reply for everybody.  Nobody else can see it.  And third party issues and so on.  So it's like a comment thread instead of...  It's like every other social network.  On Facebook, if somebody replies to something you post, you can go in, there's a menu item, you say delete this and it goes away.  And it really does go away because you don't have third party clients.

Start time: 1040.34
End time: 1043.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have a history, you don't have search.  Exactly.  So it can.

Start time: 1044.28
End time: 1048.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But even if it continues to persist on third party clients, it would still, on the main site...

Start time: 1048.74
End time: 1051.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter would have to kill the API or modify it.

Start time: 1052.48
End time: 1065.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't really know what percentage of people are getting on the app or on the site or whatever.  But that would be one thing.  And the other one would be delete this reply and block the user.  And then block should have more juice than it currently does.  But that's really the secret sauce.

Transcript:  So what they propose is to make it harder for people to recreate serial accounts, an abuser.  By the way, I don't know how they're going to do that because we have abusers who use spoofing and so forth.  It's almost impossible.  They create a new email address, spoof the IP address.  How do you know it's the same person coming back?

Start time: 1086.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So think about this.  Let's say a janitor comes in here and uses your guest network to harass somebody.  They shut down your IP address and nobody, no guest, no employee, you, nobody can tweet or set up accounts.  I don't know how they're going to do that.

Start time: 1101.30
End time: 1119.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So somehow they're going to identify people who have been suspended and stop them from creating new accounts.  If they could do that, that would be helpful.  That only, in my opinion, that works most with people like Milo Yiannopoulos, who wasn't anonymous.  You can say Milo, you can't create a new account.  He may have created an anonymous account, but he can't create a new account under his own name.

Transcript:  Right. There's like a reputation aspect to it.  But that's a small number of people.  Yeah. I mean, the vast majority of trolling happens because you can do it anywhere.  And, you know, your reply shows up no matter whether you built a reputation or not.

Start time: 1132.76
End time: 1150.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  The simple solution to that is pseudonymity, where Twitter knows who you are.  You have Twitter who you are.  And then you can have any public name you want.  And then they should have an option says, you know what, I only want to know from I want to I don't want to hear from anybody who's anonymous unless I follow them or there was we were told they were going to do that.

Start time: 1150.90
End time: 1164.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  They were starting to do that.  Expand verification.  Yeah. They apparently abandoned that.  Yeah.  They we mentioned removing from search results and the problem with that.  They also say maybe they'll collapse or hide objectionable replies.

Start time: 1165.02
End time: 1194.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is a which is a useless feature because it's again head in the sand type of attitude that Twitter's already had.  If if if somebody if there's low quality content and by the way, there are search algorithms, their their software is going to misfire on this as it does on every other social network on Google plus like 10 percent of the things that they hide are perfectly good content and 10 percent of the garbage they allow.  So it's hard to do this.  Well, it's hard to do it.  Well, if Google can't do it, I doubt they hide it from me.  And if I unhide it or hide it, it's only affects what I see.

Start time: 1195.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my biggest problem.  They've proposed this.  You know, they always say if you complain about someone, just mute them.  Just block them.  Then you won't see it.  But that's not the problem.  So I don't care about seeing it.  So other people seeing it.  It's a problem.

Transcript:  I think the way to use social media is that my profile on any social site should be a place where I start conversations and I cultivate conversations and I can make sure that people don't derail those conversations.  That's the problem.  The s posting of I don't know if I want to say the full word where you throw a bunch of garbage, people having constructive political conversation and a bunch of haters come in and start screaming at everybody.  The point of that is to make sure nobody can have a conversation.  You can just delete those people and just keep the rational people.  Then you can have a conversation and that should be controlled by each individual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leave Twitter alone.  I think there's a couple of things, though, to keep in mind with this.  And I think Mike's point is Mike's poking the holes in what Twitter is doing and is perfectly valid.  I think there's a couple of things to keep in mind.  One is that this pretty much happens to every social network, every community over time.  I don't it's almost like a law of nature that they get worse.  And, you know, communities reach this point where they get really bad.  But Facebook hasn't.  For the one simple for the exact reason we talk about, you have to be you.  It's very hard to fake real names.  Policy makes a difference and it makes a difference.  But also the thing that makes Twitter great, it's like when you fall in love with someone and you realize like their best quality is also their worst quality.  Right. It's the same thing in in with with an interesting philosophy.  Like its best quality is its openness.  Right. It's also its worst.  Evan Williams made this thing and he went to bat very early on.

Start time: 1311.16
End time: 1347.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, yes. He very much went to bat for the openness of this platform early on.  And the openness is still its strength and it's also its weakness.  And I don't know.  I think the one thing that has the best chance of solving this is what you're talking about is the the fact that they want to if they follow through with opening it up to the.  The people who want to get verified and then they get they give precedence to those use a real names policy policy in the side door.  Yeah, I don't know.

Start time: 1347.88
End time: 1368.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The notion of verification from public figures to people who are willing to be themselves.  Yes. Yeah, I feel like though the better comparison and not to say they figured it out would be read it right.  Like Reddit is Twitter in as in a discussion board form and they're struggling.  Well, absolutely. But they reputation matters then because it's a continuous discussion rather than its own.

Start time: 1368.44
End time: 1380.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they have karma. They have voting.  Yeah.  In fact, the voting works quite well to hide a lot of the junk unless you go to a sub Reddit around junk and then nobody downvotes it because this is what we're here for.

Start time: 1381.02
End time: 1437.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And on Reddit, you can pick you can go to the trollies trollish hateful speech.  But you don't have to.  It's voluntary and everything's segregated.  The problem with Twitter is like it's open.  Everything is wide open.  The thing that I think Jack, the mistake I make that he makes, I think, is that the problematic tweets are problematic precisely because they stifle free speech, harassing people,  silencing women, doing all those things that the haters do.  That's actually ending free speech, not promoting it, allowing somebody to derail conversations when people are trying to have a constructive conversation does not promote free speech.  And that's why there's no substitute for letting people choose themselves.  Now, if some if I delete somebody's comment, he wants to go diss me on their profile or on somebody else's comment thread.  Great. Right.  That's fine. But like I'm trying to have a good conversation here and I should not let it hijacked.

Start time: 1437.30
End time: 1442.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Well, if I think we're having this conversation and it's great in this little world that we live in, where Donald Trump hasn't been mentioned, but Donald Trump needs to be mentioned.  Right. And like this is where the discourse we should save it for.  Wrong. We should save it for the president.  Did you notice that like now Jimmy Fallon does an impression of Alec Baldwin doing an impression of Donald Trump?

Start time: 1475.38

Start time: 1490.78
End time: 1522.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of important, actually. You're right.  What's interesting is every president going back to FDR has wanted a way to directly address the electorate.  Yeah. FDR did fireside chats, the brand new medium of radio.  He used it masterfully, right?  In fact, presidents still do radio addresses.  I don't know if Trump has done that, but up until Trump, everybody was doing radio addresses.  Everyone wants to find a way to talk to the people directly.  And this is I mean, he's a master of this medium.  I mean, it's arguably one of the reasons he got elected is his mastery of Twitter.

Start time: 1522.34
End time: 1570.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, it's a two edged sword, though.  The one of the biggest things I've ever written is actually for recode.  I wrote it for medium recode, asked if they could re-post it.  But it was how to how to get into the filter bubble of people who follow who are fans of Trump.  And that is simply that if you can post a reply to his tweets within five seconds, you'll hear his fans will see it.  And so this is a powerful thing.  I mean, when when when the president post something, he has direct access to 20, whatever, million people.  And then those people see the the resistance come flooding in.  And so it's a double edged sword for him.  Yes, he gets to talk to everybody, but he also has to be exposed to every single post he has.  It's followed by thousands of people slamming and criticizing.

Start time: 1570.58
End time: 1585.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And so you when you look at and I presume this is not at POTUS.  This is at real Donald Trump that you're talking about when I wrote it, that he wasn't right.  So if you look at the tweets, you see his tweets.  But if you go to tweets and replies, which I'm not going to do.

Start time: 1597.40
End time: 1622.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's a valuable discussion, but I think that the whole Trump phenomenon is separate from the issue of harassment in general.  The thing that concerns me about harassment is when people make the decision where they're trying to have a voice  and they get to the point where like, you know what?  Twitter is so toxic, I'm just going to stop talking in public.  That's kind of what I do.  And their voice is silenced. Your voice is silenced.

Start time: 1622.32

This conversation is in some ways like dated because there's this weird thing going on  where like we're all talking about the same stuff at the same time.  And maybe I'm like deluding myself into believing that.  But I do actually believe that for the first time, we're having a national conversation  because like whatever Trump did today, it's the most interesting and impactful thing  that we're all dealing with in our lives.

It's not like a potato or it looks like an octopus on a top hat.  And it's from some guy I must follow, right?  I don't know. He's a social media nitwit.  And he's written a book called Pam Mastery  and a crime novel called Butterfly Stomp Waltz and a science fiction novel.  Wow, this guy's prolific called Hydrogen Sleets.  And he likes punching Nazis.  That's probably why I'm following him.  I don't know why I'm following him.  I don't know how that happened.

Yes, News and Report report is a kind of right leaning.  There's a bunch of and then left leaning and you get some centrist publications  and you get those content and then you go and post  and then you engage with the people who reply to your post.  And that's your social media.  I don't think it's a good place to just open yourself up to this fire  hose of dreck that just comes.

If you go to his Twitter feed, he's literally has zero activities, never tweeted anything.  But he talks about how the what the digital I need this movement has done  is this done to simultaneously crazy things.  It's made the value of what he calls deep work,  which is where you really sit down and think without distraction.  Far more valuable.  There's also put all this pressure on people to do shallow work.  So people who used to do deep work like journalists,  they're now being pressured by the by their organizations  to go out and be tweeting all the time, which is shallow work.  And so there's this huge opportunity for people to think deeply  and do deep work because nobody's doing it.  And the value of it is through the roof.  And the value of shallow work is just very, very low and getting lower all the time.  You guys do long form stuff for exactly that super value, valuable stuff.  And you can't do long form journalism well if you're like checking Twitter every five seconds  and you're being distracted and you have the news going and all this kind of stuff.  You can't do it. You have to like a quiet room.  You have to do some serious thinking.  You have to do some serious digging.  Otherwise, it doesn't work.

Transcript:  We can have Baryshnikov make a new movie.  I don't know. Our show today brought to you by ITProTV.  The guys are in studio. They're around somewhere. Tim and Don,  the founders of ITProTV.  Well, they're maybe they're out drinking beer.  Maybe they're doing that.  They're also in town for the RSA conference.  They covered on ITProTV.  So here's another way you can get your coverage of RSA.  They do a lot of interviews all week long at RSA.  What is ITProTV? It's actually a really cool idea.  I think Tim and Don saw what we do here at Twitter.  They were fans of tech TV.  They said somebody ought to do something like that for online  IT training, for keeping your IT skills up, for learning.  And that's why they created ITProTV.  They have five studios in Gainesville, Florida.  They are doing Monday through Friday, nine to five video.  They do it much like we do.  They have chat rooms going on.  But the subject matter is all the stuff you need to know about  either if you want to get the IT certifications  or you want to keep up to date.  They offer 2000 hours of content, 30 new hours every week.  You can watch it on your Chromecast, your Roku,  your Amazon Fire TV.  They have a great Apple TV app.  Of course, you could stream it on your PC or tablet.  Courses include things like certified information system  security professional, CompTIA's project,  plus all the CompTIA certs.  One of my favorites is certified ethical hacker.  I want to be this when I grow up.  Ethical hacking, they got version nine just went up.  Sean Oriano has been teaching that and they have others,  some of the best people in security teaching this.  You'd be guaranteed a job, right?  If you knew this stuff, you would be guaranteed.  Upcoming courses, AWS solutions, pen testing, networking plus.  We had one of our detectives from the Petaluma Police  Department came to me and said, I'm now in charge of forensics.  I need to learn how to use Wireshark.  I said, I'll tell you exactly where you got to learn Wireshark,  ITProTV.  In fact, I can't tell you the commercial customers  because they're customer, they don't want to tell everybody.  But I could tell you that for some reason,  the universities don't mind.  The entire Harvard IT department subscribes to ITProTV.  So does MIT, so does UCSD, so does Stanford, Liz.  Everybody knows this is the best way to keep those skills up today.  They have a low monthly subscription price.  And because they started teaching people to get the certs,  they have an easy no hassle cancellation policy.  But you know what?  I think even if you get the cert and you get the job,  you're going to continue to become a member  and continue to watch because it's fun.  Premium annual memberships, $57 a month.  Or you get two months free if you subscribe for a year.  But we got a special deal.  Of course we do.  For a free seven day trial so you can see exactly what it's like  for a whole week, 30% off for the lifetime of your account.  Go to ITPro.tv slash twit and the offer code is twit30.  30% off for the life forever, for the life of your account.  Could be years.  And a free seven day trial so you can see what it's like before you buy.  By the way, ITProTV is in process of introducing a new membership level.  They're going to do that soon.

You'll automatically be upgraded at the same price.  So sign up today.  ITPro.tv slash twit, the offer code twit30.  We're talking high tech.  We're talking the world of technology.  I'm just going to a little parenthetically.  I got the new Android Wear 2.0 watch.  Isn't that attractive? Isn't that lovely?  Don't I look like a prisoner on work furlough?  It's huge.  Just.  Okay.  And by the way, not only is it ugly, it's uncomfortable as heck.  Because this is the sport, the LG Sport.  It's like an inch off your wrist.  It's enormous.  It's huge and it doesn't stop at the watch.  In the band, they put the antenna.  So the band is rigid halfway down your wrist,  which means it really does feel like one of those work furlough bracelets.  I won't tell you how I know that, but it's not comfortable.  You can't change the band.  It's like rubber and I'm not impressed by Android Wear 2.0.  They've added some nice features, but I can make phone calls from this, by the way.  It has a SIM card and a phone number.  My watch has its own phone number.  But would you want to?  You look kind of dorky going Dick Tracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny, when the whole smartwatch thing started, I felt like I quit wearing watches like ten years ago.  Or maybe not quite that long ago.  Apple trained us not to wear a watch.  Exactly. The smartphone made it unnecessary.  And I started wearing the Apple Watch.  I'm still wearing it.  One of the probably, of the ten people I knew that got it was the only one still wearing it.  But the only reason was, and I hated wearing a watch.  And so the only reason I kept wearing it was because it was comfortable.  The band is actually, the cheap band is actually really comfortable.  And then there's only, but they pitched this all wrong with smartwatches.  I feel like it's a, they pitch it as like you're going to have this computer on your wrist.  And that was their whole.  And what would you say?  Their whole thing.  I think it's a slightly smarter Fitbit.  It's just.  Yeah.  It's.

Start time: 2629.34
End time: 2641.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2659.84
End time: 2680.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Other than that, the only thing I use it for is the alerts.  It is nice not having to pull your phone out of your pocket for me because it makes me easier to ignore things.  And then having the weather on it.  I have the one thing that that's really that's all I use it for.  It's it's my but I had a Fitbit before.  And so it's a slightly smarter Fitbit.

Start time: 2680.52
End time: 2693.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The promise of these was you would take your phone out less often because you could look at your watch.  But what I find is the watch is just like so brief that I go, oh, that notification.  I better read that.  And I take my phone out.  So I'm now doubly annoying.

Start time: 2693.72
End time: 2699.82

Transcript:  Yeah. I think the interesting thing with the Apple watch is it is meaningful.  Some of the third party people that track it have said that it is now next to they are the number one vendor watch  selling number two watch selling in the world.  Well, if you don't count Fitbit as a watch, you count watches number one swatch timex.  Yes. It's one of the it's one of the it's one of the Swiss Swiss watchmakers.

Start time: 2768.88
End time: 2786.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just think that of the of all the smartwatches absolutely the Apple watch is better than Android where this did not save Android  where Motorola already knew that they dropped the 360 line entirely.  Yeah. And I'm not even convinced the Apple watch is worth even I have a really stupid theory about why they're selling so well all of a sudden.

Start time: 2786.38
End time: 2800.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the theory is this I think Apple fans see new stuff as a kind of crack cocaine every year or two.  They need a new hit and they're not buying the Mac.  They're not buying the Mac because the Macbook sucks the laptop.  They've been waiting four years for a laptop.  They actually sold a lot of those though.

Start time: 2800.68
End time: 2804.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but a lot relative to Macs.  An interesting theory probably completely wrong.

Start time: 2804.44
End time: 2810.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that was probably through pent up demand.  It's their crack hit.  It's a crack cocaine theory.

Start time: 2810.20
End time: 2811.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a pretty good theory.

Start time: 2811.24
End time: 2857.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a pretty good theory because there's not a whole lot to get excited about.  The Mac is sold.  The new Mac is sold really well.  I'm using it.  But it's mostly because of pent up demand.  I think because I do know a lot of people that were waiting and they weren't thrilled with it.  I think the touch bar.  I don't use much of it and it's more annoying than it is helpful.  Exactly.  Ultimately, by accident.  But I think if it integrates with more software, maybe there's some things on it that could never going to be useful.  But right now it's more annoying than useful to me.  But this is a lot of power.  You got the 13.  I have the 13.  So it's very similar to an Air, very similar weight.  And it's a lot of power in a small laptop.

Start time: 2857.70
End time: 2862.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Trey Radcliffe, our good friend and stellar photographer, wrote a blog post this week.  Apple is dead to me.  Now you got to remember Trey is a Mac fanatic for his whole photo career.

It's an MSI, basically a desktop replacement laptop for $4,599.  But the Apple's top out at what 16 gigs of RAM.  This has 32.  If you're a photographer, that's a big deal.  It is a big deal.  RAID hard drives with a terabyte spinning drive and a 256 gig SSD.  It's got the NVIDIA Quadro, which is a video card artists and graphic designers use.  It's probably not great for gaming, but it's got a lot of horsepower for graphics.

And this is interesting that he thinks augmented reality is going to be as big a product category as the iPhone.  And I thought that that was telling because it's obvious if you've been watching Apple's results that they're looking for their next iPhone.  The iPhone turned Apple from being a little computer company into being the most valuable company in the world.

Start time: 3110.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think what Apple does is they use these interviews to kind of get people in the mindset.  I think they...  They're creating demand, right?  We talked about this last week with Robert Scoble who was a little cracked on this subject.  But he's convinced that augmented reality is in Apple's future.  And I think that it's interesting because I do feel like he feels that...  When he says something like that, that's not offhand.  Tim and Apple in general are very calculated about what they say.

Start time: 3179.92
End time: 3206.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he moved to India too, right?  Yeah, he's spent a lot of time in India because Xiaomi was moving into India.  Yeah, that's where all their sales were.  But you notice that when Mark Zuckerberg introduced him, he said he's going to be running all of our virtual reality stuff including Oculus.  Including?  Exactly.  And so we've been hearing for a while that they're working really hard on augmented reality.

Start time: 3207.12
End time: 3217.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

You know that article I just posted about whenever you say,  Hey, I love your new art thing he wrote about.  Yeah, because I'm reading it while I'm talking to you.  Now the interesting thing I realized is that for augmented reality,  we always think of the HoloLens and glasses and VR kind of stuff.  But Apple's AirPods are definitely, as we've talked about before, wearables.  More than just headphones.  And augmented reality merely means you're taking the world and you're augmenting it.  Could it be audio?  Could it be telling me in my ear, oh that's Jason Heiner?  You've known him for years.

But that audio is a killer feature  because we're entering into the realm of genuine AI virtual assistants  and we're going to want to be chattering with them.  One way is the Amazon Echo way where you have a device  in every bathroom and everything.  The other one is it's always on you  and you just talk and you hear back  but it doesn't cover your ears  and it doesn't have a battery life that dies in four hours.  There's another company from a high school.  This looks like a great product.  There's a high school student in the Midwest  who came out with another product that he's kickstarting  and I think he's going to have a successful kickstarter.  And I'm trying to remember what the name of the product is.  The chat room, if you can remember.  But basically it's a thing that clips onto any glasses  and gives you bone conduction access to sound hound  which is a great virtual assistant that's underrepresented.  Right, it's like the alternative to the big companies  and anyone can incorporate it into their products, right?  Exactly.

Yeah, I agree with you.  So that's the baseline.  That already is a killer app right there.  I would buy that right now.  Then if you can throw something onto the screen  like Apple or something like that.  Scoble said that Apple's working with Carl Zeiss.

It's a VR game that's just a blast.  And Jason Hiner from CBS Interactive  our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.  It's a product from Quicken Loans  the best mortgage lender in the country  and you don't have to take my word for it  look at the website  but there was something missing.  They were happy  they were doing a great job  but they realized that they could make it  even better by making it entirely online.  They knew there was a crowd out there  people who listen to this show  are a good example  who don't want to go to a mortgage lender  who don't want to go through boxes  of papers to find check stubs  and bank statements  who want to do it all on their phone  and so they created Rocket Mortgage  from Quicken Loans.  It is an entirely online approval process  and because it's computers  because it's online it's fast.  They have a video on the website  of a couple at an open house  looking at it and saying  honey we should buy this  and they go and they do the mortgage pro  and then they show it to their realtor  well we're approved  you can actually submit pay stubs  submit back statements all online  you don't have to bring them papers  it happens in minutes  they have settings  that you can change the rate  you can play with the rate and the time frame  so it really is personalized for you  get a personalized loan  from a great mortgage lender  that fits your exact financial situation  and it's completely transparent  and completely online  it's Rocket Mortgage  skip the bank, skip the waiting  go completely online  QuickenLoans.com  QuickenLoans.com slash twit  to equal housing lender  licensed in all 50 states  nmlsconsumeraccess.org  number 30 30  from Quicken Loans Rocket Mortgage  at QuickenLoans.com slash twit  to we thank them for their support

Transcript:  it's pretty limited  but Google believes they can take this technology  because it uses this point to point wireless  it believes they can take this technology  and apply it to  fiber deployments  for the last mile  so instead of putting that one  fiber hut as Google calls it  where that connects  to 12,000 homes  they can put some kind of wireless sensor there  and they can beam it  so they feel like they can go faster  so that was an opinion piece  but in the process of doing this  one thing that we discovered was Louisville  is one of the cities where fiber  has been coming where I live  but it's coming from AT&T  so well there's two so AT&T and Google  fiber have been in an epic battle

Start time: 5845.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so what happened though was  Louisville was one of the cities they pause  so Louisville passed legislation one touch make  ready which let  Google and any other  fiber provider use AT&T's  lines so AT&T did a big  lawsuit against them over this  so that's why Louisville  became ground zero in  the court room  but it's also so last week  or the beginning of February  Google quietly  moved Louisville  from  the potential cities which have all been paused  to upcoming and it's the first one  since they paused

Start time: 5883.62

Start time: 5885.70
End time: 5935.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah exactly somebody's excited  and so we started asking around  about it and found that Google  a lot of signs from a lot of different  sources that  Google had been preparing to launch  in Louisville  and what we found out at the same time  was AT&T at the same time we got  wind of this AT&T also got wind  of this and they had slowed down  their fiber deployment once Google wasn't  coming in anymore you know they had  kind of quit and we had searched for months  to try to find one customer  who AT&T had said  they had 10,000 people who were  available to get it we could not find  one customer in Louisville  who had it and this had happened in other cities  too Austin and a few others  to the point that some had written  that AT&T makes  these big announcements but like  try to find a customer it's really hard and so like

Start time: 5940.00
End time: 6029.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  exactly and so Tech Dirt wrote that  it's less fiber to the present premises  than fiber to the press release  yeah I like that I like it  and so we found three customers  but we also found a bunch of  contractors and they said now all of the sudden  because what we had noticed was they had  stopped building out fiber  once in Louisville  and so we  but AT&T apparently got wind  of this that Google is now coming  to Louisville and last week they started  hiring tons of contractors  and telling them if you can't move fast  enough we'll find somebody else that we're putting  fiber into essentially every place because  what Google is about to roll out in  Louisville according to these reports  is it's mixed  gigabit  and wireless it's next generation  infrastructure where it's trying to combine  the two of them which is quite  a you know it's a new infrastructure  obviously it's a lot different than what they've  webpasses done in  San Francisco and Boston and other cities  but it will be  interesting to see and then  at the same time you have 5G  you have satellite you know the  satellites that Elon Musk  and others also are  talking about doing and so  you know obviously it's  needed  and Google being involved  has spurred on competition  and so but it will be interesting  to see AT&T says they're building  all of a sudden Verizon says they're  building again you have ones like Sonic  what's the one that you guys have? Sonic yeah

Start time: 6030.12

Transcript:  well there's another one that I haven't heard anybody talk about  that I discovered on my own my son got an  apartment in Roseville California which is north of  Sacramento  and one of the options was  gigabit ethernet and we're like what who's providing  that? It's called consolidated  communications they rolled out in  Roseville first they next going to take over  Sacramento and they're going to move into the Bay Area according  to their plans $75 a  month for gigabit ethernet  and it is blistering  Sonic charges $40

Start time: 6058.83
End time: 6067.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6070.22
End time: 6077.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like this is the answer to your question like should we just  wait for Elon Musk to do the satellites? No  we should have lots of competition  that's the key exactly

Start time: 6078.32
End time: 6094.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  without Google fiber though  if Google fiber doesn't press will the competition  be there and I think the answer is no  we've seen that with AT&T as soon as  Google fiber announced they weren't doing it like they stopped  building and we couldn't find a single  customer and so I think Google fiber  is that because it's hard to make money

Start time: 6094.32
End time: 6112.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  at that business is that really the problem or  what? What did they not  want to do it? It is hard  to make money I mean to build  these little companies  like Consolidated and Sonic that are doing it  I would love to get to the  bottom of that. The economics are hard

Start time: 6112.42

You can't dominate it  you can't dominate it and that's  what happened with cable that's why the FCC  gave cable franchises  duopolies yeah because  if you can't it's so the infrastructure is so expensive  you've got to dominate you've got to own the

Speaking of satellite based  wireless it's kind of a funny story  that I  noticed my brother in law is a  developer in Santa Barbara, California  he's got a friend who lives in the foothills way beyond  any sort of internet  connectivity you can get so he aimed a satellite  dish to share his home  wifi with this person who's like three  miles away and they just  matched up these satellite dishes and  the person has had sharing his  wifi for a long time  and it's like it works great I'm like  wow that is weird  more people should do that.

End time: 6192.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I guess the other question  is because the fiber  really only works in metro areas  right? You have to have population  density. That's where 5G and  satellite are going to play a really important role.

Start time: 6192.74
End time: 6212.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ironically and sadly but this has always been  the case where you really could use it  especially wireless technologies in rural  areas where they don't have the population density  but inevitably it happened with  Ymax too. It rolls out  in the cities because everybody wants to make the most  amount of money. What is  the state of 5G? Is that just completely  marketing? No. Or is it

Data rates of 100 megabits  per second for metro areas.  A gigabit per second  on the same office floor. In other words  5G is very distant dependent.  Several hundred thousand simultaneous  connections for massive wireless sensor networks.  That's one of the purposes of 5G  is internet of things, small devices,  sensors, spectral  efficiency significantly  enhanced compared to 4G. That's good  news because spectrum  is limited. Coverage  improved, signaling efficiency enhanced  and 1 to 10 millisecond  latency. Wow.  Which is a lot less than a  5G. 5G is simply 2 to 3 second

Start time: 6303.18

You can't do it to a  satellite. That's good for a satellite.  That's really good. That's what most of our  good connections are now.

Up until a year or two ago, the main device was a  Spot, which is just a 9-1-1 device.  This is now basically  a satellite texture and GPS thing.  I don't know.

Our show today brought to you by SeatGeek  the best deal on sports, concert  and theater tickets  with SeatGeek, buying tickets online  for sports and concerts.  It's always challenging to get them from a lot of  different venues. It's always been hard to find the best deal  for the show  or the game you want to go to.  And none of the older ticket sites  have any incentive to change that.  But SeatGeek is different. They've come along  and created an amazing app.  I use it now all the time. They make it easier  than ever for you to buy and sell  tickets.  SeatGeek.  You'll love this. Everything about SeatGeek  is designed to make life easier for fans.  They do the price comparison for you  by searching multiple ticket sites.  So you're going to get the best deal available.  And SeatGeek wants to get  you the most bang for your buck.  So every ticket on SeatGeek is given a grade  based on value.  So you know if you're overpaying for a bad seat.  More importantly, you'll see under-price  seats to be able to find deals that fit your budget.  And I've got a $20  rebate off your first SeatGeek purchase.  So what you need is the  SeatGeek app on iOS or Android.  Go to the settings tab and add the promo code  TWIT.  And you will get $20 after you make  your first ticket purchase.  So this one's on me. How about that?  SeatGeek.  Go to the iOS store,  the Android Play store, get the SeatGeek app  and in the settings add the promo code  TWIT for $20 off. You'll like it too.

We had live music in  the studio a couple of weeks ago.  We want to see more live music.  So we just go to SeatGeek every Wednesday.  What can we go see?  Sometimes we'll go out of town.  Maybe there'll be a great concert in Louisville soon.

This comes from Elcomsoft,  which is a Russian hacking tool creator.  But I think this is related to the story about  Apple keeping your contacts in the cloud  and your history of your messages and so forth.  This is probably a setting.  Yeah, by default,  the browser,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vladimir Katalov,  who is the CEO at Elcomsoft,  said that iPhone keeps a separate  iCloud record called Tombstone.  Okay, that's suspicious right there.  It knows their deleted web services  or visits were stored.  He said he came across the issue by accident  when he was looking through  Safari history on his own iPhone  and he used their phone breaker software  to extract data from the linked iCloud account  and found deleted records going back a year.  Now, in Apple's favor,  they call them cleared, not deleted.  Does that help?  No.  Katalov said,  a year may be forever.  Yeah.

Transcript:  So definitely turn off the iCloud.  And by the way,  we should point out, and I point this out every time,  but I think Apple really doesn't want people  to remember or realize this,  that Apple has the key to your iCloud stuff.  Your stuff may be encrypted  and it's encrypted by a key,  but Apple has the key,  otherwise it wouldn't be able to do all this  selective syncing stuff.  Not their iMessage though, right?  Yeah.  Bad news.  If they got a subpoena or a warrant,  they could give that information to law enforcement.  And a malicious...  I don't think Apple would just spy on you for fun,  but a malicious employee, a rogue employee,  could.  So this is no different than a lot of cloud services

Transcript:  Right.  Well, we've seen that before, remember?  Remember those pictures from famous movie stars?  Do you trust Google?  Maybe you shouldn't.  Google has added a...  privacy...  what would they call them?  WANCs at the register.  Chrome 56, the latest version of Chrome,  which came out at the end of the month,  added something that they're calling  a Bluetooth snitch API.  With Chrome 56,  according to Google,  your web app can communicate with nearby Bluetooth devices  in a private and secure manner using the Web Bluetooth API.  In other words,  you have to pair with light bulbs, toys,  heart rate monitors, LED displays,  just a few lines of JavaScript.  And you can query all of these devices.  Google says...  it's TLS,  and users have to allow the connection  with a touch or a mouse click.  So that's good news.  But it is kind of built in.  And how long before somebody figures out a way  to get around the click?  Just leave the front door open, it's fine.

Transcript:  I saw that too. That's not the happy story.  Unless you're Amazon.  Now Amazon says  we're not in the business to put people out of work  and we aren't going to probably put these stores everywhere.  But these are the stores that they were prototyping in Seattle.  I think there's only one.  Where you walk in, you use a barcode on your phone  to say it's me, and then the cameras  and sensors in the store will follow you around  and you want anything, you just take it off the...  It's kind of like going to Vegas  and using the mini bar.  It goes, oh, you took a sandwich,  and then you walk out the door, but you're automatically charged.

I think who wouldn't like that?  The lines at the grocery store  is kind of the worst part about going.  They've said that the jobs are going to be  in food prep,  that now they're going to have all these pre-prepped meals.  The tech industry has to, at some point,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did a story on this recently,  I tried to find the good news on the automation-killing job story.  I talked to a professor at NYU named Arun Sundararajan.  He had some ideas that were relevant.  He used the farmer example, too.  He said, also, we didn't have tourism 100 years ago.  Now that's a huge industry that employs millions of people  and supports many world's economies.  Another one he suggested  where automation could create jobs,  or AI could create jobs, was healthcare.  Right now, doctors do how many years of preparation  before they can actually do it.  Right now, doctors do how many years of preparation  before they can actually do it.  They do how many years of preparation before they can get their job  and then we pay them lots of money to do their very specialized thing.  But if we had a world where AI could enable always on healthcare,  then we would need healthcare technicians to just go like,  oh, your chart looks weird today,  let's work on how to diagnose that  and keep you all healthier.  And that actually would be a version of the world  where more people work in that industry  than the many, many people today.  Does he think it's going to be a net zero?  No, I don't think you can go that far.

Yeah, and that was the other point that he had,  which is like we've been worried about this forever,  but the fact that technology improves on the jobs  is interesting.

End time: 7486.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think basic...  Is he advocating basic income?  No, he's not at all.  But I do think that preparing for this,  training for what jobs will exist in 10 years  is a much better plan than trying to bring back  industrial era jobs, which are never going to come back.

I'm not sure how far from you,  I forget my Kentucky geography.  He's been here and says a couple hours.  They've retrained themselves as a coding squad  and they brought them all in.  Similar to one of those things where you'd pay  to go for eight weeks and get some kind of  vocational credit that you can get  and you can get a job.  They actually hired the people,  brought them in, trained them,  and now they're working as a team taking gigs.  This company is called BitSource.

Transcript:  because one of the dirty little secrets  about big data is that the algorithms  really aren't smart enough  to sort out all the stuff we need  for big data.  Humans have to.  There are armies of people doing  coding, data cleaning,  and all kinds of things  behind it.  IBM, Microsoft, Amazon,  they hire armies and armies  of people doing click work.  We did a big investigative story on this  because there's some problems with it too  because they're all independent contractors.  Yeah, it's got its issues.  So we wrote about that  especially Amazon Mechanical Turk.  But this is creating a whole new scale  of jobs.  Some people are arguing that these are  some of the blue collar jobs of the digital age.

Transcript:  It reminds me of the music industry  where you had these superstars  these multi-platinum artists  but there was plenty of  lower level work  for just a journeyman musician.  Playing at a bar.  Those weren't bad jobs.  But if you looked at Metallica,  they weren't Metallica level jobs  but I think there are a lot of people who are what is.

They want to be a star.  They're like, look at me. I'm at the Apple event.  Why don't you do your job?
